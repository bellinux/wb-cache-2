5|$|A christening ewer and basin {{made by the}} Garrard&Co. founder George Wickes in 1735 {{were used}} at the christening of the future GeorgeIII in 1738. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, had been banished from the royal court by GeorgeII and was {{forbidden}} to use the CharlesII Font. An inscription {{at the front of}} the ewer records its use at the christening of GeorgeIII's son, Prince Alfred, in 1780. The <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> the ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising the triumph of virtue over vice.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Rundell and Bridge {{sold the}} diamond to the Emanuel Brothers for about 7,200 pounds (today about £). Six {{years later in}} 1837, the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor, the 1st Marquess of Westminster. At one point, the Marquess mounted the diamond in the <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> his dress sword. In 1886, the diamond was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between £ and £), {{due in part to}} its vast gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge.|$|E

Boycott nearly died, and in the efforts to save his life, his spleen was removed. In March 1950, Boycott's father had a serious {{accident}} {{while working as a}} coalminer, suffering severe damage to his spine after he was hit by empty coal carts; He never fully recovered, and died in 1967.|$|E

5|$|A new bow type, {{in which}} bone {{reinforcements}} cover the <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> the bow {{as well as}} the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed this type the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E
5|$|Boone informs Locke he {{is tired}} of lying, and wants to tell Shannon about the hatch. Locke knocks him {{unconscious}} with the <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> his knife, and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. Locke applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in {{the ground in front}} of Boone so he'll be able to free himself. Locke explains that he will be able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams and the sounds of the 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf Air Force Base crashed, {{killing the}} pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were {{restricted}} to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation. The crash {{was attributed to}} a bleed air system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency oxygen system. Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects. She later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the engagement <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> the emergency oxygen system was redesigned; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure. On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.|$|E

5|$|The two copper statues, each {{standing}} 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, flank the obelisk which {{rises to}} a masonry soldier statue, {{instead of the}} typical apex of an obelisk. The figure atop the granite obelisk is a mustached American Civil War soldier dressed in a long coat, a cape, and a cap. In the figure's right hand he holds the <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> his sword and the sword's tip rests {{in front of his}} right foot. In the soldier's left hand is a flag. Below the apex of the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a Union infantry soldier and a Union cavalry soldier. The Union infantryman is dressed in a cap, long coat, and a cape, much like the figure atop the obelisk. The Union cavalryman, standing {{on the east side of}} the base, is dressed in a brimmed hat and short jacket.|$|E
5|$|The Grenade, Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb, was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War. The grenade was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> the grenade, the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E
5|$|The fort was {{surveyed}} {{and described}} by R.G. Collingwood in his Archaeology of Roman Britain, 1930, where {{he noted the}} fort's uniquely skewed shape and extraordinary set of defensive ramparts on the western, uphill side. Pottery excavated in the 1950s suggested that the fort was constructed in 122 AD, {{at the same time}} as Hadrian's Wall. A survey in 2007–8 by English Heritage showed a large Roman civilian settlement or vicus to the north and west of the fort. Artefacts found include coins, pottery, glass, objects made of jet, and inscribed stones. In 2012, the University of Durham carried out a geophysics survey as part of an English Heritage project. In the absence of a full excavation, archaeologists have exploited the diggings of moles to uncover Roman artefacts by sifting earth thrown up by the animals in their molehills. Finds include fragments of terra sigillata (Samian ware, Roman table pottery); rim fragments of serving bowls and earthenware pots; a bead made of jet; some iron nails; and a bronze dolphin from the bath house, most likely the <b>handle</b> <b>of</b> an instrument like a strigil or razor.|$|E
