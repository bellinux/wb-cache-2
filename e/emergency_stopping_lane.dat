50|$|A {{shoulder}}, or {{hard shoulder}} is an <b>emergency</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>lane</b> by {{the verge of}} a road or motorway, on the right in countries which drive on the right, or on the left side in Japan, the UK, Australia, and other left-side driving countries. Many wider US as well as Swedish freeways have shoulders on both sides of each directional carriageway, in the median {{as well as at the}} outer edges of the road, for additional safety. Shoulders are not intended for use by through traffic, although there are exceptions (see below).|$|E

50|$|On large {{industrial}} machines, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button is typically {{located on the}} panel, and possibly in several {{other areas of the}} machine. Often, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is made wireless using a remote control. This provides a rapid means to disconnect the energy source of the device to protect workers. For fail-safe operation, the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button is a normally closed switch which ensures that a broken wire will neither accidentally activate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> nor prevent it from being activated.|$|R
40|$|In working environments {{with large}} manipulators, {{accidental}} collisions can cause severe personal injuries and can seriously damage manipulators, necessitating {{the development of}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm to prevent such occurrences. In this paper, we propose an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> system for the efficient and safe operation of a manipulator by applying an intelligent <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm. Our proposed intelligent algorithm considers the direction of motion of the manipulator. In addition, using a new regression method, the algorithm includes a decision step that determines whether a detected object is a collision-causing obstacle or a part of the manipulator. We apply our <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> system to a two-link manipulator and assess the performance of our intelligent <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm as compared with other models...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 <b>Emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{controls}} are essential parts of industrial machinery {{because they are}} designed to stop the operation in case of emergencies without risks to operators, equipment, products, or facilities. Current guidelines for <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> controls have been formulated based on experience but not on empirical studies. The main objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} the type and orientation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons on the reaction time, mode of activation, and preferences of subjects in order to formulate guidelines for their selection. An experiment consisting of a simple, cooperative assembly operation with a Microbot was designed for this study. The main conclusions of this research are that reaction time to activate <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbutton is not affected by the orientation of the control but it is influenced by the type of control. The mode of activation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons is influenced by both the type and the orientation of the control. Subjects preferred <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards or with half guards over controls with full guards, and subjects also preferred an inclined orientation of the control over horizontal or vertical orientations. The following guidelines are recommended for the selection of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons. Select <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards. If a guard is absolutely required, select a guard with slots or a half guard to ensure adequate visibility of and access to the button. If possible, give <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons an inclined orientation (about 45 °) on the control panel. Avoid using vertical orientations for these controls...|$|R
50|$|Safety {{features}} include an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button which immediately moves the grinding wheel {{away from the}} ground rings on its revolutionary axis. Because of the wheel's momentum, it cannot be stopped but the power is cut and the wheel slows naturally, it cannot be reactivated until the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is reset. After the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is activated, {{the size of the}} workpiece must be re-established before the line can be reactivated into production mode.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A motion planner of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{must make}} an {{operating}} humanoid robot to a stationary state under the emergency signal. It {{plays an important}} role in prevention of falling over because humanoid robots fall over easily. Immedi-ately after the emergency signal, it must generate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion in real-time. We modeled a humanoid robot as a simple dynamic system consists of ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) and COG (Center of Gravity) as its states. The <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion is generated by a state feedback. We determined optimal feedback gains in terms of the initial conditions and the pole assignment. The proposed method realized a reliable <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> with low computational cost. Furthermore, it can easily predict the possibility of the successful <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> at any time. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by an experiment using humanoid robot HRP- 2. I...|$|R

50|$|On railways, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{is a full}} {{application}} of the brakes {{in order to bring}} a train to a stop as quickly as possible. This occurs either by a manual <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> activation, such as a button being pushed on the train to start the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop,</b> or on some trains automatically, when the train has passed a red signal or the driver has failed to respond to warnings to check that he/she is still alert, which is known as a dead man's switch. A similar mechanism is the watchdog timer.|$|R
