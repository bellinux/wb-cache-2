Swami Satyavrathan remarked {{that it was a}} good fortune to have the Guru along with them. Suddenly, the Guru got up and said, I am here not just to participate, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> pray. He stood in meditation for a few minutes while the whole crowd waited. This was the single occasion when Guru had ever prayed in public.|$|E
500|$|Marburger {{responded to}} {{criticism}} of his support for Bush administration policies in 2004, stating [...] "No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that the}} science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory.... I don't regard intelligent design as a scientific topic". Also In 2005, he told The New York Times that [...] "global warming exists, and {{we have to do something}} about it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Cruise first meets Nicole Kidman (Dolly Wells), he {{asks her}} to sit down so that he will appear taller. Cruise {{performs}} his [...] "dangling-from-the ceiling routine" [...] from [...] – while in bed with Kidman. Cruise asks Kidman how he can prove he is not gay, and she recommends that they make the film Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley Kubrick is portrayed as a sleazy film director, and the program shows a newspaper headline giving a critical review of Eyes Wide Shut. The show portrays Cruise's relationship with Penélope Cruz, who is seen wearing a mantilla. Travolta introduces Cruise to his third wife Katie Holmes (Laura Patch) who is depicted as a robotic Stepford Wife. [...] "Greetings, Earth Man, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> serve you," [...] says Holmes to Cruise upon their first meeting. After Cruise asks Holmes to marry him, she states, [...] "Affirmative". The show makes fun of Cruise's couch jumping incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show. (This spoof is in reference to a 2005 appearance by Cruise on the Oprah program, where he [...] "jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend.") At the wedding of Cruise and Holmes, an alien bride and groom are displayed {{on the top of}} the couple's wedding cake, and the show spoofs the couple's wedding vows. A voiceover at the end of the program tells the viewer to visit scientologyisgreat.com and purchase £4,000 worth of books.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theme of}} the book, at least as {{perceived}} from its title, aroused immediate opposition within the United States. [...] A well known instance of this occurred during the 1996 presidential election when, during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Republican Party nominee Bob Dole said: [...] "... with all due respect, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> tell you, {{it does not take}} a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child." [...] Criticism of Clinton's notion would continue to be made by American conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Andrea Tantaros, and Jonah Goldberg through the next two decades.|$|E
2500|$|In the meantime, Peace had {{developed}} an obsessive interest in Dyson's wife, {{though it was}} never established how far she may have returned his feelings. In June 1876, Dyson threw a card into the garden of Peace's house, reading: [...] "Charles Peace is requested not to interfere with my family." [...] On 1 July, Peace approached Mrs Dyson and threatened to blow out her brains and those of her husband. Dyson took out a summons against Peace, {{and moved to a}} different suburb, Banner Cross. On their first day in the new house, 29 October, Mrs Dyson was accosted by Peace, who said [...] "You see, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> annoy you, and I'll annoy you wherever you go." ...|$|E

2500|$|I publish these poems, few {{though they}} are, {{because it is}} not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more. [...] I can no longer expect to be {{revisited}} by the continuous excitement under which in the early months of 1895 I wrote the greater part of my first book, nor indeed could I well sustain it if [...] it came; and it is best that what I have written should be printed while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see it through the press and control its spelling and punctuation. [...] About a quarter of this matter belongs to the April of the present year, but most of it to dates between 1895 and 1910.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Morton Stanley {{had been}} sent to find him by the New York Herald {{newspaper}} in 1869. He found Livingstone in the town of Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on 10 November 1871, greeting him with the now famous words [...] "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" [...] Livingstone responded, [...] "Yes", and then [...] "I feel thankful that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> welcome you." [...] These famous words may have been a fabrication, as Stanley later tore out the pages of this encounter in his diary. Even Livingstone's account of this encounter does not mention these words. However, the phrase appears in a New York Herald editorial dated 10 August 1872, and the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography both quote it without questioning its veracity. The words are famous because of their perceived humor, Livingstone being the only other white person for hundreds of miles. Stanley's book suggests that it was really because of embarrassment, because he did not dare to embrace him.|$|E
2500|$|Jean {{embraced her}} role as acting commander-in-chief, {{one of her first}} {{international}} duties being a trip, from October 29–30, 2005, to France for the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, just after which she returned to Canada for the arrival at Trenton, Ontario, of the bodies of six Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Jean made on March 8, 2007, her first visit to Canadian troops taking part in the offensive in Afghanistan; she had earlier expressed her desire to go, but Harper advised against such a trip on the grounds of security concerns, the relevance of which were demonstrated when two attacks were made against Canadian soldiers on the same day the Governor General landed in Kabul. Jean had the arrival timed specifically for International Women's Day, stating: [...] "the women of Afghanistan may face the most unbearable conditions, but they never stop fighting for survival. Of course, we, the rest of the women around the world, took too long to hear the cries of our Afghan sisters, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> tell them that they are no longer alone. And neither are the people of Afghanistan." [...] Part of the Governor General's itinerary included meeting with Afghan women, Canadian soldiers, Royal Canadian Mounted Police teams, humanitarian workers, and diplomats.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{her success}} on the show, Brown was {{eliminated}} after {{making it to the}} top six contestants.

'Long may she live to do it, sir, and <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> {{see this}} pretty contradiction {{of the song}} that [...] "youth and age cannot live together"!' {{answered}} Laurie, smiling at the pair.

2500|$|Button faced early hostility {{from new}} {{teammate}} Villeneuve, {{who suggested that}} Button had been hired for his marketing appeal more than his ability, and compared him to a [...] "member of a boy band". Button responded by denying he had anything to prove to Villeneuve; [...] "I am not here to earn Jacques' respect, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> win and move the team forward". Their relationship did not improve after the first Grand Prix in Australia: Villeneuve was due to pit, but stayed out an extra lap and pitted when Button was due in, leaving Button waiting in the pit lane while Villeneuve's car was serviced. Villeneuve blamed it on [...] "radio problems", but both Button and team principal David Richards hinted {{that they did not}} believe him. Button performed well in the first six races, scoring eight points (the points system had changed that year to award points to the top eight finishers), including fourth place at the Austrian Grand Prix; Villeneuve had scored only three. Button crashed heavily at 185mph (298km/h) during Saturday practice in Monaco, briefly knocking him unconscious, and he was detained in hospital overnight. Despite the accident Button still wanted to race, but was withdrawn by his team on medical advice. He also missed a one-day test in Monza, but was cleared to race in the following Grand Prix in Montreal. Button continued to outperform his teammate (although Villeneuve suffered a large number of mechanical problems), and this helped rebuild his previously faltering reputation. Just before the final race in Japan, Villeneuve lost his seat at BAR, so Button was partnered with Takuma Sato; he took his second fourth place for the season, and finished ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 17 points.|$|E
