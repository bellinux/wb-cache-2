50|$|An Ethernet {{frame is}} {{preceded by a}} {{preamble}} and start frame delimiter (SFD), which are both part of the Ethernet packet at the physical layer. Each Ethernet frame starts with an Ethernet header, which contains destination and source MAC addresses as its first two fields. The middle section of the frame is payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> with a frame check sequence (FCS), which is a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check used to detect any in-transit corruption of data.|$|E
50|$|Cole opened new, wider {{production}} facilities in 1922. However, sales went down rapidly, {{mainly because of}} a short but severe recession. Although there were more models to choose from and prices were reduced drastically (most to a level under that of 1918 / 1919), only 1,722 cars were built of the Model Aero Eight 890, as the car was called that year. The wheelbase was increased by a quarter inch, and the <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> were split. The Sportcoupe had a weight of 4155 lb. The car was priced at $3,385 with a 75 mi/h km/h speedometer.|$|E
5000|$|Two-player [...] (or larger) teams compete by {{alternating}} {{teams and}} alternating players within each team. For example, if teams consist of players 1 and 2 versus players 3 and 4, and player 1 breaks, turns alternate {{in the pattern}} 1 (breaking), 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, etc. I.e., the ending of a player's turn at the table ends that team's turn at the table. As in individual competition, a player's turn at the table does not end until a foul is committed or the player fails to legally pocket an object ball (or the <b>frame</b> <b>ends).</b>|$|E

The freeze <b>frame</b> <b>ending</b> of The Color of Money (1986) also featured Paul Newman.|$|R
50|$|In IEEE 802.3, a {{datagram}} {{is called}} a packet or frame. Packet is {{used to describe the}} overall transmission unit and includes the preamble, start frame delimiter (SFD) and carrier extension (if present). The frame begins after the start frame delimiter with a frame header featuring source and destination MAC addresses and a field giving either the protocol type for the payload protocol or the length of the payload. The middle section of the frame consists of payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> with a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check, which is used to detect corruption of data in transit. Notably, Ethernet packets have no time-to-live field, leading to possible problems {{in the presence of a}} switching loop.|$|E
5000|$|CIRC {{encoding}} {{plus the}} subcode byte generate 33-bytes long frames, called [...] "channel-data" [...] frames. These frames are then modulated through eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM), where each 8-bit word is {{replaced with a}} corresponding 14-bit word designed {{to reduce the number}} of transitions between 0 and 1. This reduces the density of physical pits on the disc and provides an additional degree of error tolerance. Three [...] "merging" [...] bits are added before each 14-bit word for disambiguation and synchronization. In total there are 33 × (14 + 3) = 561 bits. A 27-bit word (a 24-bit pattern plus 3 merging bits) is added to the beginning of each frame to assist with synchronization, so the reading device can locate frames easily. With this, a <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> up containing 588 bits of [...] "channel data" [...] (which are decoded to only 192 bits music).|$|E
50|$|Using Alice Guy-Blachè's adapted {{screenplay}} {{from the}} Edgar Allan Poe short story, Alice built upon the lucid and dream-like piece of fiction {{by adding a}} significant amount of narrative structure to her adapted screenplay. Rather than having unexplained pain and trauma inflicted upon the films protagonist, Guy built a narrative surrounding the Spanish Inquisition and the film's protagonist fear. The first reel begins with a young and pretty girl named Isabelle (played by Blanche Cornwall) sitting upon a hill. It is then that she is attacked by Pedro (played by Fraunie Fraunholz). And following the common thematic trajectory of the time, Isabelle is then rescued by the kind and brave medical student who spends his time as a minister for the poor, Alonzo (played by Darwin Karr). Pedro is insistent on revenge and applies to the local monastery where Alonzo works in order to frame him. He hopes to frame him for the mysterious and sudden disappearance of the church's jewels. The <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> immediately after Pedro plants the jewels in Alonzo's home and the monks are quick to punish Alonzo and Isabelle.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Quad" [...] head {{assembly}} rotates at 14,400 rpm (NTSC). The four head pieces (quad) are switched successively so that recorded stripes cross the video portion (most {{of the tape}} middle, audio is on one edge, control track is on the other) so that head to tape write speed is well {{in excess of the}} 15 inch per second physical motion. They wrote the video vertically across the width of a tape that was 2 inches (5 cm) wide and ran at 15 inches (38 cm) per second. This allowed hour-long television programs to be recorded on one reel of tape. In 1956, one reel of tape cost $300; and Ampex advertised the cost of the recorder as $45,000. A 7.5 inch per second version was released later, and this required a new, narrower headwheel. This vertical writing facilitated mechanical editing, once the control track was developed to display the pulse that indicates where a <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> and the next one begins. Later, Ampex developed electronic editing.|$|E
40|$|An uplink {{controlling}} assembly speeds {{data processing}} using a special parallel codeblock technique. A correct start sequence initiates processing of a frame. Two possible start sequences can be used; {{and the one}} which is used determines whether data polarity is inverted or non-inverted. Processing continues until uncorrectable errors are found. The <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> by intentionally sending a block with an uncorrectable error. Each of the codeblocks in the frame has a channel ID. Each channel ID can be separately processed in parallel. This obviates the problem of waiting for error correction processing. If that channel number is zero, however, it indicates that the frame of data represents a critical command only. That data is handled in a special way, independent of the software. Otherwise, the processed data further handled using special double buffering techniques to avoid problems from overrun. When overrun does occur, the system takes action to lose only the oldest data...|$|E
40|$|A {{manual welding}} wire feeder {{apparatus}} comprising a bendable elongate metal frame with a feed roller mounted {{at the center}} thereof for rotation about an axis transverse to the longitudinal axis of the frame. The <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> are turned up as tabs and each provided with openings in alignment {{with each other and}} the mid-width center of the roller surface. The tab openings are sized to accommodate welding wire and each extends to a side edge of the tab, both opening {{on the same side of}} the frame, whereby welding wire can be side-loaded onto the frame. On the side of the frame, opposite the roller a lock ring handle is attached tangentially and is rotatable about the attachment point and an axis perpendicular to the frame. The device is grasped in the hand normally used to hold the wire. A finger is placed through the loop ring and the frame positioned across the palm and lower fingers. The thumb is positioned atop the wire so it can be moved from the back of the frame across the roller, and towards the front. In doing so, the wire is advanced at a steady rate in axial alignment with the tab openings and roller. To accommodate different wire diameters the frame is bendable about its center in the plane of the frame axis and wire so as to keep the wire in sufficient tension against the roller and to keep the wire fixed when the frame is tilted and thumb pressure released...|$|E

If a <b>frame</b> <b>ended</b> in a tie, the purple was re-spotted on the black spot. The extra colours allowed a maximum break of 210. This variant failed to gain popularity but has appeared in some video games such as the World Snooker Championship series.|$|R

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{results from a}} stitched VaRTM carbon-epoxy composite panel tested under uni-axial compression loading are presented along with nonlinear finite element analysis prediction of the response. The curved panel is divided by frames and stringers into six bays with a column of three bays along the compressive loading direction. The frames are supported at the <b>frame</b> <b>ends</b> to resist out-of-plane translation. Back-to-back strain gages are used to record the strain and displacement transducers were used to record the out-of-plane displacements. In addition a full-field-displacement measurement technique that utilizes a camera-based-stereo-vision system was used to record the displacements. The panel was loaded to 1. 5 times the predicted initial buckling load (1 st bay buckling load, P(sub er) from the nonlinear finite element analysis and then {{was removed from the}} test machine for impact testing. After impacting with 20 ft-lbs of energy using a spherical impactor to produce barely visible damage the panel was loaded in compression until failure. The buckling load of the first bay to buckle was 97 % of the buckling load before impact. The stitching constrained the impact damage from growing during the loading to failure. Impact damage had very little overall effect on panel stiffness. Panel stiffness measured by the full-field-displacement technique indicated a 13 % loss in stiffness after impact. The panel failed at 1. 64 times the first panel buckling load. The barely visible impact damage did not grow noticeably as the panel failed by global instability due to stringer-web terminations at the frame locations. The predictions from the nonlinear analysis of the finite element modeling of the entire specimen were very effective in the capture of the initial buckling and global behavior of the panel. In addition, the prediction highlighted the weakness of the panel under compression due to stringer web terminations. Both the test results and the nonlinear predictions serve to reinforce the severe penalty in structural integrity caused by the low cost manufacturing technique to terminate the stringer webs, and demonstrates the importance of this type of sub-component testing and high fidelity failure analysis in the design of a composite fuselage...|$|E
