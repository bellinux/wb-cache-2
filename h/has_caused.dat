50|$|Kone, {{also called}} Gariboldi, {{is made up}} of seven nested calderas, lava flows and basaltic cinder cones. (Not to be {{confused}} with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in Northern America.) There are two fault lines that <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> the volcanic activity within Kone, normal faults, which are part of the Wonji fault belt and ring fractures. The normal faults cause magma to rise inducing the volcanic activity. The ring fractures <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> the calderas collapse. Both of these faults <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> activity within Kone’s recent history. The calderas widths can range from 1.5 to 5 km.|$|R
