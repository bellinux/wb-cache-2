500|$|Del Rey {{was born}} in New York City, New York in 1985 and was raised in Lake Placid, a quiet village outside of New York. At age fifteen, she was sent to {{boarding}} school in Connecticut, before moving to New York City at eighteen to study metaphysics at Fordham University. While attending the university, according to Del Rey, her musical experience began here, discovering the right acquaintances on her own. After her uncle {{taught her how to}} play guitar, she realized that she could probably write [...] "a million" [...] songs with only those six chords. She then began performing in clubs in New York City, using various stage names such as Sparkle Rope Jump Queen and Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena. Recalling the experience, Del Rey said, [...] "I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously. When I got to New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn – <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point – and that was it".|$|E

However, on January 9, 2005, Pryor's wife, Jennifer Lee, rebutted this statement in a post on Pryor's official website, citing Richard as saying: [...] "I'm sick of hearing this shit about me not talking... not true... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> days, bad days... but I still am a talkin' motherfucker!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In autumn 1909 a Divisional Conference of the Irish Party {{was summoned}} {{for the purpose}} of [...] "organising" [...] Sheehan out of Mid-Cork and taking over his constituency. But {{whenever}} their delegations made an appearance in Cork they were quickly put to rout by Sheehan's followers. Opposed by the official IPP+UIL+AOH nominee William Fallon in the 24 January 1910 general election, as well as denounced by Catholic clerics for pitting labourer against farmer, he was returned with 2824 votes against 1999 for his opponent. Sheehan later commented on the contest: [...] I was left to fight my battle almost single handed, having arrayed against me two canons of my Church, and every Catholic clergyman in the constituency, with two or three notable exceptions. The odds seamed hopeless [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] [...] but [...] [...] [...] I scored a surprising majority [...] [...], and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>good</b> reason for stating that 95 percent of the illiterate votes were cast in my favour, although a most powerful personal canvass was made of every vote in the constituency by the clergy.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> dressed {{me as well}} as I could; for though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>good</b> linen left still, yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> but a poor head-dress, and no knots, but old fragments; no necklace, no earrings; all those things were gone long ago for mere bread.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] replied McLeod stoutly. [...] "I {{forgive him}} for getting angry with me, but I am not called on to ask {{forgiveness}} for being indignant with a man whom <b>I</b> supposed <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>good</b> reason to believe was a deceiver." ...|$|R

60|$|When we {{were inside}} the cabin once more, with the door and windows barred and the man and lad whom we had rescued eating ravenously from the store of food my mother set before them, there was in my mind the thought that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>good</b> reason {{to be proud of}} the part <b>I</b> <b>had</b> so lately played.|$|R
