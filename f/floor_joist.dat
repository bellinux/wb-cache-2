The store at Camp Douglas was closed on December 12. After a successful tunneling escape on December 3, Colonel DeLand ordered all floors torn out of barracks, {{to be replaced by}} dirt even with the <b>floor</b> <b>joist.</b> This resulted in conditions that increased sickness and mortality. The garrison also tore out partitions in the barracks. DeLand confiscated warm coats, possibly to prevent escapes but as likely {{in retaliation for}} past escapes and attempts. On December 17, 1863, the prison camp officials closed the barber shop and newsstand, and stopped sales of stamps, envelopes and writing paper, likely also in retaliation for the major escape attempt. When Sergeant–Major Oscar Cliett of the 55th Georgia Infantry Regiment reported to DeLand that his men rejected an offer of amnesty if they joined the Union Navy because they could not swim, DeLand had him placed in the dungeon for twenty-one days. Despite these harsh actions, DeLand also worked to free fifty underage prisoners who he discovered were between the ages of 14 and 17 The Army did not free them.|$|E

Successively, by means of a wide comparison between the lateral stiffness of a structural model based on the "equivalent beam" and the 3 D structural model including all the joists, a correction factor is proposed to improve the accuracy of the formulation based on the simplified theoretical model...|$|R

Since the house was plastered when built, the summer beams were reduced in depth and concealed within the plaster ceiling. According to Connecticut Architectural historians, the introduction of plaster, as an interior finish, brought about the end to the tradition of using summer beams. The home builder, holding onto more traditional building methods, included summer beams in the framing, but in a reduced size, as they were being phased out altogether.|$|E
5000|$|The {{municipality}} of Bugallon was formerly called [...] "Salasa" [...] (meaning <b>floor</b> <b>joist</b> in the dialect, {{a part of}} a wooden house where the floor is attached to). In the Spanish colonial era, the Spanish authorities established the town center in Poblacion (now Barangay Salasa). Because of the 1914 massive flooding and erosion, the town center was later transferred to Barrio Anagao (became Barangay Poblacion) but the Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, one of the oldest churches in the country, could not be transferred (every time someone attempts, he dies). A new Catholic church was created in the Poblacion, the Saint Andrew Catholic Church. This is the reason why Bugallon has two Catholic Churches (one in Salasa and the other in Anagao).|$|E

5000|$|Lime-ash is {{the residue}} {{found at the}} bottom of a {{wood-fired}} lime kiln, consisting of waste lime and wood ash. These kilns became common in the early 15th century and continued to be used until newer technology replaced them in the late 19th century. Lime-ash could also be made in coal-fired kilns. In areas where gypsum was common they were known as plaster floors. Lime ash was used on the upper floors of yeomans houses and in great houses such as Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire, where the upper surface would be buffed to a fine finish using a mixture of egg-white, curdled milk and fish-gelatine. The underside could be left bare or smoothed with a lime-plaster. Alternatively the <b>floor</b> <b>joist</b> could be concealed with a conventional lath and plaster ceiling.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{very little}} {{surviving}} of the structure, the basic layout of {{some areas of}} Bramber Castle can still be identified. The most prominent feature is a large, rugged lump of stone masonry, {{all that remains of}} the Gatehouse tower. Still standing to almost its full height, a single window, and some <b>floor</b> <b>joist</b> holes, are clearly visible within the structure. Beyond the Gatehouse are the existing foundations of what {{is believed to have been}} the living quarters and a guardhouse. The dressed pillars of an entrance can be identified, but the bulk of the remaining walls now consist of only the basic rough stone infill, the better quality dressing stone having long since been robbed away for use elsewhere. Situated to the north of the gatehouse is the original castle motte, its earthen mound rising to a height of some 30 ft (10 m). A short distance away is a section of the curtain wall which survives to a height up to 10 ft (3 m) in places. There is also a small church, still in use today as the parish church, located directly next to the castle's entrance, which used to be a chapel for the castle's inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|Joists must {{exhibit the}} {{strength}} to support the anticipated load {{over a long period}} of time. In more developed countries such as the United States, the fabrication and installation of all framing members including joists must meet building code standards. Considering the cross section of a typical joist, the overall depth of the joist is critical in establishing a safe and stable floor or ceiling system. The wider the spacing between the joists, the deeper the joist will need to be to limit stress and deflection under load. Lateral support called dwang, blocking, or strutting increases its stability, preventing the joist from buckling under load. There are approved formulas for calculating the depth required and reducing the depth as needed; however, a rule of thumb for calculating the depth of a wooden <b>floor</b> <b>joist</b> for a residential property is to take half the span in feet, add two, and use the resulting number as the depth in inches; for example, the joist depth required for a 14‑foot span is 9 inches. Many steel joist manufacturers supply load tables in order to allow designers to select the proper joist sizes for their projects.|$|E

5000|$|He {{used the}} {{interior}} to evoke {{both of the}} ancestor buildings. At the south end, he created a great room, 54-ft (16.5 m) on each side - the interior dimensions of the Great Meeting House - and a soaring 45-ft (13.7 m) tall. Dramatically, he left the 1755 roof trusses exposed, high overhead. At the north end, he represented {{the length of the}} 12th Street building's extension with a 1-story [...] "activities room." [...] A continuous line of wainscoting around the interior visually united the two spaces. He turned a side entrance to the women's meeting room into the building's main entrance, and inserted a staircase between it and the northwest corner. This led to a second floor balcony overlooking the great room, and to a basement with bathrooms and utilities. At the northeast corner, he inserted a kitchenette and closets. Benches, railings, waincoting and other interior woodwork were refinished and reused. Hough's attention to detail extended to using replicas of the 1813 nails to attach the reused floorboards. Along the north wall, he installed the minister's gallery and elders bench - a raised platform traditionally reserved for visiting ministers and persons of authority. In a crowning gesture, he mounted the [...] "signed" [...] 1755 <b>floor</b> <b>joist</b> above it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house is}} a {{combination}} of local Indian and Anglo-American construction techniques. Construction elements discussed are all of primary historical significance. Split cedar (Thuja plicata, Western red-cedar) logs on fieldstone and undressed Tenino quarry stone support hewn-log cedar girders and split-log cedar floor joists. The girders are 11"x11" [...] hand-hewn, with adze marks on all sides. The tops are notched for the floor joists. The <b>floor</b> <b>joist</b> logs were charred prior to splitting, a local Indian wood-preserving construction technique. Second-story floor joists are rough-sawn 2"x8" [...] cedar. The frame is made from milled cedar lumber using square nails. The walls are formed from vertical rough-sawn 1"x12" [...] cedar planks planed smooth on the edges to allow a tight seam. Two layers allow the seams between planks in one layer to be covered by the planks in the other layer. Two-ply walls also allow sufficient structural strength for two stories and give much better weather insulation than one-ply box frame construction. Upper and lower girders hold the vertical planks in position. Exterior siding is high quality, quarter-sawn, 1/2"x6" [...] horizontal cedar lap siding with tight-edge grain and a 5 3/4" [...] exposure attached with square iron nails. Rough-sawn corner boards are used on all building corners.|$|E
