40|$|In 1933 F. A. Gibbs, by his {{description}} of a thermoelectric blood <b>flow</b> <b>recorder</b> of small bulk and simple construction, enormously expanded {{the application of the}} well known physical principle of the thermocouple to physiological research. Since its introduction, and that of the somewhat similar invention of Schmidt, the instrument has been of especial·value in problems relating to the cerebral circulation. Much of the work, such as that of Lennox and Gibbs (1933, 1934, 1935), is based on qualitative estimations of variations in the total blood flow through the brain. The thermocouiple has been put to a yet more interesting use in the detection of focal changes in flow, which use is exemplified by the work of Schmidt, and, at the Montreal Neurological Institute, by that of Norcross, Penfield and Erickson in animals and Penfield in human patients during operative procedures. [ [...] . ] It will be seen that the problem is twofold and I have analysed the experimental findings under two main heads - the nature of the activity responsible for the circulatory changes, and the cortico-subcortical connections as revealed by the method. During the course of the work facts bearing on the problems of the central vasomotor tracts came to light and have been included, together with observations on autonomic functions recorded on several occasions.

40|$|Numerous {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} elaborated {{in attempts to}} explain the puzzling phenomenon of sleep. Thus sleep {{has been attributed to}} arterial anoxemia, to cerebral ischemia or anoxia, or to a generalized narcosis on the basis of one or another metabolic alteration. Little information is avail-able, however, on the subject of cerebral metabo-lism and function during natural sleep. This might be explained to a great extent by the diffi-culties inherent in any experimental investigation during so labile a state as physiological sleep. Moreover, reasonably quantitative techniques for measuring the blood flow and oxygen consumption of the brain in unanesthetized animals and in man have become available only recently. Early at-tempts (1) to obtain at least qualitative informa-tion on the cerebral blood flow in man during sleep by means of brain plethysmography through tre-phine holes have yielded contradictory results. Later attempts with better methods of recording (2) have suggested a decrease in cerebral blood flow on passage from the waking state to short or long periods of sleep. More recently, Gibbs, Gibbs, and Lennox have attempted to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} cerebral circulation during sleep by means of the thermoelectric <b>flow</b> <b>recorder</b> (3). They found no significant altera-tion in cerebral blood flow during short periods of sleep in four epileptic patients. Unfortunately, arterio-cerebral venous oxygen differences were not measured simultaneously, and no information on the important question of the oxygen consump-tion of the brain was obtained. Recently developed methods permit a more quantitative determination of the cerebral blood ' This investigation was supported in part by a re...|$|E

40|$|Salivary flow {{has been}} {{recorded}} from conscious rabbits during 1 min periods whilst continuously chewing standard laboratory dry pellets or pieces of carrot and, in some animals, a mash of pellets with water. Flow was measured using contact drop recorders or a continuous <b>flow</b> <b>recorder</b> via Polythene tubes permanently inserted into one or both parotid ducts. Large variations in flow were obtained with unilateral recordings particularly during dry pellet chewing. Bilateral recordings showed that the flow was always greater on one side than on the other and that dominant secretion alternated {{from side to side}} in an apparently random manner. Rabbits chew unilaterally. Videotaped recordings of chewing movements showed that the greater secretion was always produced on the chewing side. To test the possibility that drying of the oral mucosa, or the prolonged hardness of the pellets may result in higher flow rates in animals with cannulated ducts than would normally be seen in intact animals, water was injected downstream into the mouth through a third cannula. This was inserted in an anterograde direction in the parotid duct on one side. Significant reductions in flow were recorded during dry pellet eating, but not during carrot eating. When animals were fed a soft pellet mash, salivary flow was significantly lower than with dry pellets. Recordings have been made from strain gauges attached to the ascending ramus of the mandible. Previous findings that dry pellets produce greater strain than carrots have been confirmed. It has also been shown that less strain is produced with soft pellet mash. The strain gauge data suggested that a relation exists between masticatory force and parotid salivary flow. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that intra-oral mechanoreceptors may be involved in a masticatory-salivary reflex...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the country}} {{regional}} and district councils {{are being asked}} to balance abstractive demands against flows required for maintenance of in-stream values in small streams. In many cases these streams do not have flow data and there is limited information on the in-stream values to be protected. Unfortunately, the in-stream values of small streams are often perceived to be relatively low, {{despite the fact that they}} are often important habitat for native fish and key spawning and rearing areas for sports fish. Technical methods to assess flow requirements in larger streams and rivers are relatively well developed. However, these methods are not necessarily applicable to small streams because most research on the flow requirements of aquatic life has been carried out on larger rivers and the equations used in hydraulic models work poorly in small turbulent streams. These techniques are also time consuming and expensive and often can not be justified on a small stream. In most cases, decisions on water allocation and environmental flows in small streams currently are based on historic flow methods (e. g. minimum flow at the 1 in 5 -year low flow) and thus require transfer of flow records from the nearest <b>flow</b> <b>recorder,</b> which is usually on a nearby larger stream or river and thus not necessarily a good predictor of flows in the small stream of interest. Abstractions from groundwater and seepage galleries have the potential to drop ground water levels causing springs and nearby small streams to recede or dry up. These concerns led to two small stream studies in Marlborough and Tasman. The first study was of the values and threats across a range of spring-fed waterways on the Wairau Plain in conjunction with the Marlborough District Council. The second was an assessment of some techniques to guide management of water abstraction in a small headwater stream in the Motueka River catchment as part of the Motueka integrated catchment management (ICM) project (se...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the milk flow pattern in Italian Mediterranean Buffaloes in {{relation}} to parity and oxytocin administration. A total of 330 milk <b>flow</b> <b>recorders</b> were collected during morning and evening milkings by using an electronic milk flow meters (Lactocorder (R)). Milk flow curves were examined and subject were divided according milk flow pattern in: normal pattern, bimodal pattern and "double pattern". Data were analysed by using ANOVA and Chi square test. Total milk yield per milking was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in pluriparous and consistent with the average DIM of 205 days. No differences in milk yield and maximum milk flow were found between the oxytocin groups while both parameters were higher in bimodal and double pattern groups compared to normal milk flow pattern. Lag time was higher (P< 0. 01) in oxytocin treated group and in normal vs the other two pattern groups. Length of main milking phase was higher in pluriparous, oxytocin treated group (P< 0. 01) and in bimodal vs the normal one (P< 0. 05) while double pattern showed the highest value (P< 0. 01). Percentage of bimodal milk flow was 13. 7 % while a double flow pattern was 12. 4 %. A higher percentage of double pattern was found in oxytocin treated buffaloes vs normal and bimodal ones (18. 1 % vs 8. 1 % and 7. 5 % respectively; P< 0. 05) and in pluriparous vs primiparous (74. 4 % vs 25. 6 %; P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|A study (2004 – 11) of a dairy {{catchment}} stream entering an {{oligotrophic lake}} {{in an area}} of very high rainfall (~ 5 m year– 1) yielded median concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), suspended sediment (SS) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) of 0. 584, 0. 074 and 3. 7 g m– 3, and 405 / 100 mL (most probable number method), respectively. Trend analysis indicated significant (P < 0. 01) decreases for TN (– 0. 08 ± 0. 02 g m– 3 year– 1), TP (– 0. 01 ± 0. 005 g m– 3 year– 1) and SS (– 0. 45 ± 0. 14 g m– 3 year– 1) and were partly attributable to improved exclusion of cattle from the stream. Water balance calculations indicated that approximately one-half the rainfall left as deep drainage that by-passed catchment outlet <b>flow</b> <b>recorders.</b> Estimates of catchment yields for TN were improved by taking into account groundwater hydrology and concentrations from well samples. Storm-flow monitoring inflows exceeding the 97. 5 th percentile contributed ~ 40 % of total loads leaving the catchment so that specific yields for SS, TN and TP augmented by groundwater inputs and storm flows were ~ 960, 45 and 7 kg ha– 1 year– 1, respectively. These compared well with modelled results for losses from dairy farms in the catchment of 40 – 60 kg N ha– 1 year– 1 and 5 – 6 kg P ha– 1 year– 1 and indicated that attenuation losses were relatively small. © CSIRO, 2013...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} photopolymerization {{kinetics}} {{and degree of}} conversion of different commercial dental composites when photoactivated by a LED curing unit using two different modes (standard and soft-start mode). The investigation was performed on with RelyX ARC (dual-cured), Filtek Z- 350 (Nanocomposite), Filtek Z- 250 (Hybrid), and Filtek Z- 350 flow (Flowable) resin composites. The analysis used was attenuated total reflection with a Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR). The RelyX ARC resin demonstrated the highest degree of conversion with both LED photoactivation modes. For this resin a 28 % decrease in maximum rate was observed and the time to reach its highest rate was almost 2. 3 times higher than when the soft-start photoactivation light curing was used. Z- 350 <b>flow</b> resin <b>recorder</b> a higher maximum rate using the soft-start mode rather than the standard mode. In contrast, the Z- 250 showed a higher value using the standard mode.

40|$|Abstract—Hemodialysis is {{the most}} common {{treatment}} for pa-tients with end-stage renal disease. For hemodialysis, consistently functional vascular access must be surgically created with an anas-tomosis of artery and vein, referred to as an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, AVF dysfunction may occur over time. Angiog-raphy and Doppler ultrasound are usually used to detect the flow or the diameter of the AVF. But they require well-trained opera-tors and are expensive, and even angiography is invasive. In this study, a noninvasive approach based on stethoscope auscultation for monitoring AVF stenosis was proposed. Here, a wireless blood <b>flow</b> sound <b>recorder</b> was designed to record blood flow sounds wire-lessly. In order to effectively extract the varying feature of blood flow sounds for AVF stenosis, the 2 -D feature pattern built from S-transform was also proposed as the feature in the AVF stenosis detecting algorithm. Different from other frequency-related coef-ficients, the feature pattern can contain the information of blood flow sounds in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Pre-liminary findings showed that the proposed approach can provide high-quality estimation of AVF stenosis (positive predictive value= 87. 84 % and sensitivity = 89. 24 %).

40|$|Two {{theoretical}} models {{were developed to}} predict the thermal response of the phase change material to a given hot plate temperature. A two-dimensional pure conduction model was developed to predict the melting of the phase change material when heat transfer was a function of conduction. A combined conduction-convection model, also two-dimensional, was developed to predict the phase change phenomena when heat transfer was a function of conduction and gravity-induced free convection. Both models were solved using explicit finite difference approximations on a digital computer. The experimental equipment consisted of a rectangular cell utilizing a heat chamber, an expansion chamber, and a test chamber; a sixteen channel multipoint recorder, and a fluid <b>flow</b> system. The <b>recorder</b> monitered hot and cold plate temperatures and interior node temperatures at two second intervals.
