In this paper, we study efficient algorithms for similarity joins with an edit distance constraint. Currently, the most prevalent approach is based on extracting overlapping grams from strings and considering only strings that share a certain number of grams as candidates. Unlike these existing approaches, we propose a novel approach to edit similarity join based on extracting non-overlapping substrings, or chunks, from strings. We propose a class of chunking schemes based on the notion of tail-restricted chunk boundary dictionary. A new algorithm, VChunkJoin, is designed by integrating existing filtering methods and several new filters unique to our chunk-based method. We also design a greedy algorithm to automatically select a <b>good</b> <b>chunking</b> scheme for a given dataset. We demonstrate experimentally that the new algorithm is faster than alternative methods yet occupies less space.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{efficient}} exact query processing algorithms for edit similarity queries and their variants. An edit similarity query finds database strings within edit distance threshold t from the query string. It {{plays an important}} role in many application areas, such as deduplication, data integration and cleansing, query suggestion, bioinformatics, and pattern recognition. Consequently, there has been much interest in developing efficient algorithms for this problem. We study three specific problems in this thesis. The first problem is efficient algorithms for similarity joins with an edit distance constraint. Currently, the most prevalent approach is based on extracting overlapping grams from strings and considering only strings that share a certain number of grams as candidates. Unlike these existing approaches, we propose a novel approach to edit similarity join based on extracting non-overlapping substrings, or chunks, from strings. We propose a class of chunking schemes based on the notion of tail-restricted chunk boundary dictionary. A new algorithm, VChunkJoin, is designed by integrating existing filtering methods and several new filters unique to our chunk-based method. We also design a greedy algorithm to automatically select a <b>good</b> <b>chunking</b> scheme for a given dataset. We demonstrate experimentally that the new algorithm is faster than alternative methods yet occupies less space. The second problem we study is efficient algorithms for similarity search with an edit distance constraint. We define a general signature-based framework and show that the minimum signature size is t + 1. In order to achieve this bound, we propose asymmetric signature schemes, i. e., extracting different number of signatures for the data and query strings. We first propose a basic asymmetric scheme based on matching q-chunks and q-grams between two strings. Two efficient query processing algorithms (IndexGram and IndexChunk) are developed on top of this scheme. We also propose novel candidate pruning methods to further improve the efficiency. We then generalize the basic scheme by incorporating novel ideas of floating qchunks, optimal selection of q-chunks, and reducing the number of signatures using global ordering. As a result, we develop the Super and Turbo families of schemes together with their corresponding query processing algorithms. We have conducted a comprehensive experimental study using the six asymmetric algorithms and nine previous state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiment results clearly showcase the efficiency of our methods and demonstrate space and time characteristics of our proposed algorithms. The last problem we study is the problem of query autocompletion that tolerates errors in users inputs modeled by an edit distance constraint. Previous approaches index data strings in a trie, and continuously maintain all the prefixes of data strings whose edit distance with the query are within the threshold. The major inherent problem is that the number of such prefixes is huge for the first few characters of the query and is exponential in the alphabet size. This results in slow query time even if the entire query approximately matches only few prefixes. We propose a novel neighborhood generation-based algorithm, IncNGTrie, which can achieve up to three orders of magnitude speedup over existing methods for the error-tolerant query autocompletion problem. Our proposed algorithm only maintains a small set of active nodes, thus saving both space and time to process the query. We also study efficient duplicate removal methods which is a core problem in fetching query answers. In addition, we propose optimization techniques to reduce our index size, as well as discussions on several extensions to our method. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated against existing methods through extensive experiments on real datasets...|$|R

Formed in Milan in 1994, they released a demo tape in 1996 strongly influenced by Paradise Lost and Type O Negative. The band [...] "turned a lot of heads in Italy's ambient/goth scene" [...] with their self-titled EP in 1998. Their debut album In a Reverie was released in 1999 with a style that bore [...] "some similarities to contemporaries like the Gathering and Moonspell". Lacuna Coil's music was also [...] "more accessible than many of their peers". A second album Unleashed Memories arrived in 2001 but it was their third full length Comalies that became their breakthrough album, [...] "highly praised by the metal world after its release in October 2002". On the strength of Comalies, Lacuna Coil became the most successful artist {{in the history of}} their label Century Media Records as well as the highest selling rock act in their home country Italy.

Their highly anticipated fourth album Karmacode was even more successful, debuting at number28 on the Billboard charts, and also debuting on many European music charts. The Comalies and Karmacode albums [...] "reportedly sold nearly 1million units combined worldwide, a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> of that in the States".

60|$|Washington, Tuesday forenoon, May 19, 1863. DEAREST MOTHER--... I sent George {{a letter}} yesterday--have not got any letter myself from Georgy, but have sent him {{quite a good}} many and papers. Mother, what a tramp the 51st has had--they only need now to go to California, and they will finish the job complete. O mother, how welcome the shirts were--I was putting off and putting off, to get some new ones. I could not find any one to do them as I want them, {{and it would have}} cost such a price--and so my old ones had got to be. When they came back from the wash I had to laugh; they were a lot of rags, held {{together}} with starch. I have a very nice old black aunty for a washwoman, but she bears down pretty hard, I guess, when she irons them, and they showed something like the poor old city of Fredericksburg does, since Burnside bombarded it. Well, mother, when the bundle came, I was so glad--and the coats too, worn as they are, they come in very handy--and the cake, dear mother, I am almost like the boy that put it under his pillow and woke up in the night and eat some. I carried a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> to a young man wounded I think a good deal of, and it did him so much good--it is dry, but all the better, as he eat it with tea and it relished. I eat a piece with him, and drinked some tea out of his cup, as I sat by the side of his cot. Mother, I have neglected, I think, what I ought to have told you two or three weeks ago, that is that I have discarded my old clothes--somewhat because they were too thick, and more still because they were worse gone in than any I have ever yet wore, I think, in my life, especially the trowsers. Wearing my big boots had caused the inside of the legs just above the knee to wear two beautiful round holes right through cloth and partly through the lining, producing a novel effect, which was not necessary, as I produce a sufficient sensation without--then they were desperately faded. I have a nice plain suit of a dark wine color; looks very well, and feels good--single breasted sack coat with breast pockets, etc., and vest and pants same as what I always wear (pants pretty full), so upon the whole all looks unusually good for me. My hat is very good yet, boots ditto; have a new necktie, nice shirts--you can imagine I cut quite a swell. I have not trimmed my beard since I left home, but it is not grown much longer, only perhaps a little bushier. I keep about as stout as ever, and the past five or six days I have felt wonderful well, indeed never did I feel better. About ten or twelve days ago, we had a short spell of very warm weather here, but for about six days now it has been delightful, just warm enough. I generally go to the hospitals from 12 to 4--and then again from 6 to 9; some days I only go {{in the middle of the}} day or evening, not both--and then when I feel somewhat opprest, I skip over a day, or make perhaps a light call only, as I have several cautions from the doctors, who tell me that one must beware of continuing too steady and long in the air and influences of the hospitals. I find the caution a wise one.|$|E
