2500|$|Living {{in a rural}} community, {{whether in}} the United States, or around the globe, reduces access to medical services, health insurance, and changes health culture. Differentials exist between rural and urban communities, and some health {{disadvantages}} exist for impoverished rural residents. Since health of a population increases in geographical locations that have a higher prevalence of primary care physicians, rural areas face worse health. According to certain studies, measures of health and well-being indicate that rural populations have worse health outcomes. Rural residents have a greater rate of premature mortality (less than age 75 at death) than urban residents. According to certain studies in the United States, the death rate of individuals age 1–24 years was 31% higher than those in urban counties. The death rate of adults 25 to 64 years old was 32% higher among rural residents than those of suburban counties and of urban counties. These higher death rates were contributed to unintentional injuries, suicide, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 1997 in the United States, 18% of adults in rural areas had chronic health conditions, compared to only 13% of suburban adults. The National Health Interview Survey indicated that in 1998, 16% of rural adults reported poor health. Poor rural residents have only 21% Medicaid coverage, while poor urban populations report 30% coverage.

50|$|The Newfoundland {{pine marten}} (Martes {{americana}} atrata) is a genetically distinct subspecies of the American marten (Martes americana) found {{only on the}} island of Newfoundland in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada; it is sometimes referred to as the American marten (Newfoundland population) and is one of only 14 species of land mammals native to the island. The marten was listed as endangered by the COSEWIC in 2001 and has been protected since 1934, however the population still declines. The Newfoundland marten has been geographically and reproductively isolated from the mainland marten population for 7000 years. The Newfoundland pine marten is similar in appearance to its continental cousin, but is slightly larger, with dark brown fur with an orange/yellow patch on the throat. Females are an average weight of 772 grams and males have an average weight of 1275 grams. The Newfoundland subspecies is also observed to inhabit a wider range of forest types than its mainland counterparts. The population characteristics suggest that the Newfoundland marten is a product of unique <b>ecological</b> <b>setting</b> and evolutionary selective factors acting on the isolated island population. The Newfoundland pine marten is omnivorous, feeding on mainly small mammals, along with birds, old carcasses, insects and fruits; it is currently found in suitable pockets of mature forest habitat, on the west coast of Newfoundland and in and around Terra Nova National Park. The Pine Marten Study Area (PMSA) is located in southwestern Newfoundland and is a 2078 km2 wildlife reserve that was created in 1973 to protect the Newfoundland Marten.|$|E

40|$|Quantified palaeoenvironmental reconstructions are {{essential}} to estimate the impact of future climate changes on ecosystems. Based on faunistic data from regional multireference sites and limnological surveys, <b>ecological</b> training <b>sets</b> {{can be used to}} build transfer functions to infer major environmental variables (e. g., temperature, conductivity, DOC, and pH value) in a greater study area. The remote Polar regions are affected by bigger amplitude of climate change than elsewhere on this planet and make <b>ecological</b> training <b>sets</b> in this region so important. Freshwater ostracods from Arctic nvironments have the potential to hindcast glacial/interglacial and stadial/interstadial alaeoclimate variations. Various methods can be applied to fossil assemblages such as indicator species approach, modern analoguetechniques and transfer functions based on <b>ecological</b> training <b>sets.</b> The present training set combines data from the Canadian (Southampton Island at 63 - 65 °N; Bylot Island at 72 - 73 °N) and the Siberian (Central Yakutia at 61 °N; Northeast Yakutia at 66 °N; Lena Delta at 72 °N) high latitudes with reference areas in Central Canada (Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik at 50 - 55 °N; Churchill at 58 °N). A total of 75 localities were sampled during field work in 2005 - 2007. In general, life conditions for aquatic organisms such as freshwater ostracods in the high latitude regions are extremeand limited by short open water periods during the summer and strong variations of water temperatures in the shallow waters. The host waters in periglacial regions are affected by permafrost and thermokarst processes and mostly represented as polygonal ponds or thermokarst lakes in different stages of their development. Generally, the waters in our study area have a mean pH-value of 7. 6, ranging from pH 6. 0 to pH 9. 2. They are characterised by low ionic contents (Condmean = 231 &# 956;S*cm&# 8722; 1), but the training set includes sites between 4. 4 &# 956;S*cm&# 8722; 1 (e. g., on Bylot Island) and 1433 &# 956;S*cm&# 8722; 1 (e. g., in Central Yakutia). A principal component analysis reveals that 88. 5 % of the variability of the environmental data is explained by the first ordination axis corresponding to pH, conductivity and major cations (i. e., Ca, Na). The studied ostracod assemblages are characterised by dominance of single species indifferent regions, e. g., Cyclocypris ovum on Bylot Island, Fabaeformiscandona pedata in the Lena Delta. In general, the species diversity in northern latitudes is relatively low due to the harsh environmental conditions affecting ostracods ontogeny.

Total glutathione (tGSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), plasma antioxidant capacity (OXY), and plasma-reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) were measured in more than 700 breeding great tits (Parus major). The main results revealed a pronounced sex difference, with females having lower ROM and OXY, but higher tGSH compared with males. In addition, birds breeding in the evergreen areas had higher tGSH compared with those in the deciduous habitat, but the experimentally manipulated breeding density had no significant effect on any of the redox markers. Independent of the sex differences, the larger the reproductive investment the lower the ROM of both males and females. Taken together, the extracellular markers - ROM and OXY - revealed similar results and were highly correlated. Interestingly, the direction of their effects was in the opposite direction to the endogenously synthesized tGSH and GSSG. This highlights the need to combine extracellular markers with endogenously synthesized antioxidants to understand its implications for the origin and evolution of trade-offs in an <b>ecological</b> <b>setting...</b>|$|E

It is observed that the sand dune ecosystems of Goa which are over 6000 years old have borne the maximum brunt of this "development". The beach- dune environment is a highly organized system. Sand dunes which generally back wide beaches, are features of extreme fragility and sensitive to anthropogenic stress. Sand dunes are Nature's line of defense from {{the forces of the}} ocean.
