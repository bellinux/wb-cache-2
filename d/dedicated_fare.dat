50|$|Fare tickets can {{be bought}} with local {{currency}} {{using a combination of}} coins and notes at the vending machines, which automatically return change, or at the ticket counters. Currently, there are two ticketing areas - one {{on each side of the}} track. There are also <b>dedicated</b> <b>fare</b> gates that are operated with contactless value-stored cards as these are installed with the card readers. Unlike most halts and stations, commuters are not allowed to cross between the two sides, once passed the gates, without going through the fare gates again.|$|E

50|$|Into a {{world where}} a {{bisexual}} protagonist is non-news. I'm so proud of the comedic ambitions of Lost Girl, that it's <b>dedicated</b> genre <b>fare</b> that doesn't take itself too seriously, but I also love exploring the shades of gray; the moral ambiguity of characters who may live forever and their relationships with mortals who will not.|$|R

This service uses a <b>dedicated</b> fleet, special <b>fares</b> {{and its own}} web-site. An orange winged 'A' logo adorns the web site and the interior/exterior of the vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1980s and 1990s, {{the term}} became conflated with [...] "independent film" [...] in the U.S., which shares {{many of the}} same stylistic traits with [...] "art film". Companies such as Miramax Films {{distributed}} independent films which were deemed commercially unviable at the major studios. When major motion picture studios noted the niche appeal of independent films, they created special divisions <b>dedicated</b> to non-mainstream <b>fare,</b> such as the Fox Searchlight Pictures division of Twentieth Century Fox, the Focus Features division of Universal, the Sony Pictures Classics division of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and the Paramount Vantage division of Paramount. Film critics have debated whether the films from these special divisions can truly be considered to be [...] "independent films", given that they have financial backing from major studios.|$|R
