50|$|From 1903 to 1911 Piet Kramer {{worked in}} the {{architectural}} practice of Eduard Cuypers, where he {{came into contact with}} the architects Johan van der Mey and Michel de Klerk. In 1911 van der Mey received the commission to design the Scheepvaarthuis (Shipping <b>House),</b> a <b>cooperative</b> <b>building</b> for six Dutch shipping companies. Van der Mey sought the assistance of his former colleague-architects Piet Kramer and Michel de Klerk to realize this building. The Scheepvaarthuis (1913-1916) is considered the starting point of the Amsterdam School movement. Later Piet Kramer collaborated with Michel de Klerk on the well-known De Dageraad housing project in Amsterdam South (1919-1923). Outside Amsterdam he built one of his masterpieces, the De Bijenkorf Store in The Hague (1924-26). After the death of Michel de Klerk in 1923, Piet Kramer was the leading architect of the Amsterdam School until the end of this movement {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s.|$|R
