50|$|If you proceed West on Main St., {{out of town}} towards Tulameen, on {{your left}} {{you will see a}} large {{concrete}} pillar, which was the lower anchor point for the Tramway. The “Tipple”, or lower terminal for the Tramway, was a large three story building, and once surrounded this structure. There are some other ruins in the area, notably the old Power House, now just a foundation, and everywhere you look you can see pieces of the steel cable from the Tramway, embedded in the spilled coal which litters the area. If you look at the larger pieces of coal, you will often find veins of clear yellow amber running through it, and green amber (resinite) has also been found. There are also large piles of “clinkers” which is <b>fused</b> <b>coal</b> ash from the Power House. Looking North, across the highway, there are still two buildings standing that were part of “Upper Town”. Just across the KVR right of way is a house, still in use, on the East side of the highway, and further to the East of it is the derelict remains of the last of the “Seven Sisters”, a row of seven identical buildings that housed some of the workers.|$|E
40|$|Hodgson, G. A., and Whiteley, H. J. (1970). Brit. J. industr. Med., 27, 160 - 166. Personal {{susceptibility}} to pitch. During the years 1957 to 1963, 59 cases of hyperplastic squamous lesions {{were referred to}} us from a local patent fuel works where ovoids were made by <b>fusing</b> <b>coal</b> dust and pitch together by steam heat. We carried out a survey of all the personnel exposed to the pitch hazard {{and at the same}} time examined a control group of men of the same age group. The pitch workers examined totalled 144 and they were re-examined after a period of two years. The control group consisted of 263 persons selected from dermatological out-patients. The clinical findings were classified into six main groups: (1) benign proliferative lesions; (2) pre-malignant and malignant epidermoid lesions; (3) pitch acanthoma (pitch warts); (4) photo-sensitivity; (5) acneiform lesions; and (6) scrotal changes...|$|R
2500|$|Exploitation of the Pittsburgh-seam coal began slowly. Initially, blacksmiths and foundrymen made coal into coke to use {{in their}} hearths and small furnaces. During the early nineteenth century, {{entrepreneurs}} in western Pennsylvania adapted British coke-making practices to produce coke for local iron works. To make coke, coal is burned under controlled conditions to drive off volatile matter (gases expelled when coal is burned), leaving carbon and ash from the <b>coal</b> <b>fused</b> together {{in the form of}} coke. They made coke in turf-covered [...] "mounds," [...] in which coal burned slowly and without oxygen to drive off impurities. [...] The adoption of beehive coke ovens in the 1830s spurred the use of Pittsburgh-seam coal in iron furnaces, and these ovens made better-quality coke than mounds.|$|R
