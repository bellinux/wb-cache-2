25|$|In {{the second}} year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar has a dream. When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some <b>important</b> <b>message,</b> so he consults his wise men. Wary of their {{potential}} to fabricate an explanation the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth. Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God's kingdom, which would endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's god, raises Daniel over all his wise men, and places Daniel and his companions over the province of Babylon.|$|E

By this time some of his captors suspected Hess's true identity, though he continued to insist his name was Horn.|$|E

500|$|Echoing {{the actions}} of Kent's {{previous}} landlord, Parsons had not repaid Kent's loan—of which about three guineas was outstanding—and Kent therefore instructed his solicitor to sue him. [...] He managed to recover the debt by January 1762, just as the mysterious noises at Cock Lane began again. [...] Catherine Friend had lodged there shortly after the couple left but moved out when she found the noises, which had returned intermittently and which were becoming more frequent, could not be stopped. [...] They apparently emanated from Elizabeth Parsons, who also suffered fits, {{and the house was}} regularly disturbed by unexplained noises, likened at the time to the sound of a cat scratching a chair. [...] Reportedly determined to discover their source, Richard Parsons had a carpenter remove the wainscotting around Elizabeth's bed. He approached John Moore, assistant preacher at St Sepulchre's since 1754 and rector of St Bartholomew-the-Great in West Smithfield since June 1761. [...] The presence of one ghost, presumed to belong to Fanny's sister, Elizabeth, had already been noted while Fanny lay dying, and the two concluded that the spirit now haunting Parsons' house must be that of Fanny Lynes herself. [...] The notion that a person's spirit might return from the dead to warn those still alive was a commonly held belief, and the presence of two apparently restless spirits was therefore an obvious sign to both men that each ghost had an <b>important</b> <b>message</b> to disclose.|$|E
500|$|Despite being a [...] "critically acclaimed" [...] film, {{according}} to Rotten Tomatoes, {{not all of}} its reviews were this positive.

Smith stated, [...] "clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it." [...] Marc Mohan from The Oregonian stressed it {{can be compared to}} after-school specials due to its [...] "lack of originality in plot and character."

According to Nick Hartel, the series touches on [...] "genocide and self-doubt" [...] themes without frightening younger children; rogue characters are redeemable, sending an <b>important</b> <b>message</b> that people can change and are not bonded to [...] "destiny". Chris Mitchell called the plot [...] "fantastic". D. F. Smith compared the series' plot to Japanese action cartoons, calling its tone and dialogue [...] "very American" [...] and praising the humor leavening an epic, dramatic theme suitable for all ages. Rob Keyes also praised the series' humor and affecting plot: [...] " [...] will capture your hearts". According to Mike Noyes, the series amalgamates elements of [...] "classic fantasy epics". Todd Douglass, Jr. called the plot engaging, well-thought-out and meaningful. The series' concept is [...] "well-realized", with a consistent story. Douglass wrote that the characters [...] " [...] {{a real sense of}} progression", and praised the writers for their humor, drama, and emotion. Joshua Miller called the series surprisingly dark despite its [...] "silly" [...] theme; the plot is livelier than Lost and, similar to the latter, emphasizes character development. According to Miller, its writing was [...] "true adult levels of storytelling". Tim Janson described the series as more than fantasy- and superhero- themed, seeing the characters as central and relateable. [...] "Cricket" [...] Te praised the series' use of Buddhist philosophies and the diverse presentation of its themes of courage and life.|$|E

500|$|In August 1942, {{during the}} Partisan Long March west through the Independent State of Croatia ( [...] , NDH), Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslav Partisans {{captured}} {{a group of}} eight Germans from the civil and military engineering group Organisation Todt near Livno. The leader of the captured group was a mining engineer, Hans Ott, who was also {{an officer of the}} Abwehr, the Wehrmacht's intelligence organisation. The captured group had been identifying new sources of metal and timber for the Germans, but Ott had also been tasked by the Abwehr with making contact with the Partisans. Following their capture, Ott told his captors that he had an <b>important</b> <b>message</b> to deliver to Partisan headquarters, and after he had been taken there he suggested to the Partisans that his group be exchanged for Partisans held by the Germans in jails in Zagreb. On that basis, Ott was sent to Zagreb on parole, where he met with the German Plenipotentiary General in Croatia, General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Edmund Glaise-Horstenau. He advised Glaise-Horstenau that Tito was willing to exchange the eight Germans for ten Partisans who were being held by the Germans, Italians and NDH authorities. Glaise-Horstenau contacted the commander of the Italian 2nd Army, Generale designato d'Armata (acting General) Mario Roatta, who had most of the identified Partisan prisoners in his custody. On 14 August, the German ambassador to the NDH, SA-Obergruppenführer (Lieutenant General) Siegfried Kasche, sent a telegram to the Reich Foreign Ministry advising of the proposed exchange and asked the Ministry to intercede with the Italians. In his book Tito, Mihailović, and the Allies, 1941–1945, published in 1973, the former US diplomat Walter Roberts argued that the Abwehr considered some sort of modus vivendi with the Partisans might be possible, and were thinking of more than prisoner exchanges when they gave Ott the task of making contact with the Partisans. The number of Germans in Partisan custody had been increasing, and this made some sort of prisoner swap agreement more likely. These agreements were initially led by Marijan Stilinović on behalf of the Partisan Supreme Headquarters. On 5 September, a prisoner swap was completed in an area between Duvno and Livno, where 38 Partisans and family members were exchanged for one senior German officer who had been captured during the Battle of Livno in December 1942.|$|E

In addition to that, traffic substantially increases as a result of people attempting {{to get in touch with}} friends, relatives or the rescue teams. To address such requirements of a challenged network, we propose a communication framework based on messages that exploits namebased replication of content and enables ad-hoc communications with spatial and temporal scoping and prioritisation of named messages. We evaluate our design against less sophisticated replication strategies and show that <b>important</b> <b>messages</b> (e. g., from first responders) get disseminated to more nodes than less <b>important</b> <b>messages.</b> I...|$|R
