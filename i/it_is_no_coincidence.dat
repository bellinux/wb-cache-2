25|$|Deepak's {{works are}} characterised by their tragic, dark endings. His {{characters}} find {{death as a}} constant companion, and often succumb to it. Often, critics have suggested that Deepak walks alongside his characters with a loaded gun—recoiled and ready to fire. Maybe, one can trace the beginnings of Deepak's present mental ordeal to the dark stories that he was writing even in the early 1970s. Perhaps, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Deepak's favourite authors are Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, who succumbed to mental agony themselves.|$|E
25|$|Furman {{may have}} been the most {{successful}} coach in the history of chess, although some would give that title to Mark Dvoretsky. Chess culture has traditionally and typically credited the player for chess success, with the coach recognized in a much lesser fashion, or not at all. Chess coaches were not commonly seen for top players until the post-World War II period, when competition became much stiffer. They were first developed in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that top players from these nations have dominated chess for the past sixty years. Furman, with a very significant role in Karpov's development from his late teens, building upon earlier roles with World Champion Botvinnik and world-class players such as Bronstein, Korchnoi, and Geller, may have done more than any other coach, from the early 1950s until the late 1970s, to help ensure Soviet dominance.|$|E

Robin Jahdi writes that [...] "the Isis sound, debuted proper on the 2002 album, is still present and correct, but there's more subtle shifts in mood here, most interestingly when they take influence from outside (Tool's Adam Jones plays on two songs). The basslines bounce and jolt with that familiar elasticity, but the seismic six-string shifts on songs like 'Hand of the Host' and '20 Minutes / 40 Years' are the sort not heard from this band in years. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that these are highlights."

500|$|Æthelstan's {{court was}} {{the centre of}} {{a revival of the}} {{elaborate}} hermeneutic style of later Latin writers, influenced by the West Saxon scholar Aldhelm (c.639–709), and by early tenth-century French monasticism. Foreign scholars at Æthelstan's court such as Israel the Grammarian were practitioners. The style was characterised by long, convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms. The [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] charters were written in hermeneutic Latin. In the view of Simon Keynes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that they first appear immediately after the king had for the first time united England under his rule, and they show a high level of intellectual attainment and a monarchy invigorated by success and adopting the trappings of a new political order. The style influenced architects of the late tenth-century monastic reformers educated at Æthelstan's court such as Æthelwold and Dunstan, and became a hallmark of the movement. After [...] "Æthelstan A", charters became more simple, but the hermeneutic style returned in the charters of Eadwig and Edgar.|$|E
500|$|The Byzantines {{followed}} this {{up with the}} destruction of the North African flotillas, and coupled their successes at sea with severe trading limitations imposed on Muslim traders. Given the Empire's new ability to control the waterways, this strangled Muslim maritime trade. With the collapse of the Umayyad state shortly thereafter and the increasing fragmentation of the Muslim world, the Byzantine navy was left as the sole organized naval force in the Mediterranean. Thus, during {{the latter half of the}} 8th century, the Byzantines enjoyed a second period of complete naval superiority. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that in the many Islamic apocalyptic texts composed and transmitted during the first and second Islamic centuries, the End Times are preceded by a seaborne Byzantine invasion. Many traditions from the period stress that manning the guard posts (ribāṭ) on the coasts of Syria is tantamount to partaking in the jihād, and authorities like Abu Hurayrah were cited as considering one day of ribāṭ more pious an act than a night of prayer in the Kaaba.|$|E
500|$|Other {{examples}} of the work as a parody can be taken from {{the names of the}} Scriptores themselves. It has been suggested that [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] and [...] "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius" [...] were invented, with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in Cicero's letters and speeches in the 1st century BC. With respect to [...] "Trebellius Pollio", this is a reference to Lucius Trebellius, a supporter of Mark Antony who was mentioned in the Philippics (Phil, 11.14), and another reference to him in Epistulae ad Familiares along with the term [...] "Pollentiam" [...] reminded the History's author of Asinius Pollio, who was a fellow Plebeian Tribune alongside Lucius Trebellius and a historian as well. This is reinforced by noted similarities between the fictitious criticism of [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] by [...] "Flavius Vopiscus" [...] {{at the start of the}} Life of Aurelian, with similar comments made by Asinius Pollio about Julius Caesar's published Commentaries. Significantly, Lucius Trebellius adopted the Cognomen Fides for his actions as Plebeian Tribune in 47 BC to resist laws that would abolish debts; later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment, Cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule. According to this theory <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that, in selecting the name [...] "Trebellius Pollio", the author is playing with the concepts of fides and fidelitas historica at the precise point in the lives that are assigned to [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] and [...] "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius".|$|E

2500|$|Alexandria was {{not only}} a center of Hellenism, but was also home to the largest urban Jewish {{community}} in the world. The Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there.

2500|$|The Royal Zoological Society of Dublin was {{established}} {{at a meeting}} held at the Rotunda Hospital on 10 May 1830 [...] and the zoo, then called the Zoological Gardens Dublin, was {{opened to the public}} on 1 September 1831. The animals, 46 mammals and 72 birds, were donated by London Zoo. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that the founders of Dublin Zoo were members of the medical profession. Their interest was in studying the animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead. In the 1830s the laws concerning cadavers for medical use changed. Up until then, anyone not associated with one of the big medical institutions had to resort to grave-robbing in order to obtain a cadaver for study, so getting hold of the corpse of a primate without having to rob a grave was considered quite a coup.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. {{was founded}} in the year 1913.

In May, Samuel Owensby, a Black man in Hogansville, Georgia was lynched near the local jail, after which his body was riddled with bullets.

A BBC source described Ronnie as the ice to Roxy's fire, and Simons deemed her [...] "armoured", as well as the [...] "less flamboyant, darker" [...] sister, with a more controlling nature. Womack feels that Ronnie is [...] "deeply damaged", describing her as unable to be honest with herself or others {{as a result of her}} guarded personality. She explained that she has been taught to hide her feelings and to be a survivor, which she accomplishes by controlling others, concluding that Ronnie is defined by her childhood trauma. The sisters have been compared to the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie. Womack has noted that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that the siblings are named Ronnie and Roxy. She describes them as [...] "co-dependent and dysfunctional", as well as [...] "chilling, dark and absolutely in touch with what the other is doing".

2500|$|England had a {{formidable}} batting line up and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> {{that in this}} period they played 27 Tests without defeat. The weak Australian bowling was unable to dismiss them twice in the same Test, except the last which they lost anyway. They were exceptionally strong {{at the top of}} the order; Boycott and Luckhurst opened in the first five Tests, then Boycott and Edrich in the 6th and Edrich and Luckhurst in the 7th as injuries took hold. Together they added 995 runs for the first wicket at an average of 90.45, with five century and three half-century opening stands. The [...] "Great Accumulator" [...] Geoff Boycott had his best series making 657 runs (93.85) with two unbeaten centuries and his name became a byword for long, stonewalling innings. It is noteworthy that he performed best under Illingworth, an old Yorkshire colleague of great seniority who had no objection to his slow, deliberate play. John Edrich also had his most prolific series, making 648 runs (72.00) and two centuries, a stalwart left-hander with {{a formidable}} defence and always a thorn in Australia's side. Brian Luckhurst was a Kent opener who had already 'debuted' against the Rest of the World and made an unbeaten 113 in England's only victory. He did well again, making 455 runs (56.87) and two centuries despite badly bruised fingers, but unlike Boycott he was willing to hit the ball and was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1971. England's middle order was more fragile. In 1970 the vice captain Colin Cowdrey was the only man to have played over a hundred Tests and had made more runs (7,228) than any other player, but was in the sunset of his career and failed on tour. He had always dreamed of leading England to victory in Australia, but each of his record six tours down under was made under a different captain and this was his fourth as vice-captain. Keith Fletcher was at the start of a promising career and had made few runs as yet, but in the 1970s he would become a leading England runmaker. Basil d'Oliveira was the best of the strokemakers, making 369 runs (36.90) in the series with a century at Melbourne. He was a brilliant Cape-Coloured batsman who qualified for England by residence in his mid-thirties, an unflappable player with a low backlift and powerful arms whose gentle, smiling face concealed a very determined man. His match-winning 158 against Australia at the Oval in 1968 led to his selection for the 1968-69 tour of South Africa and a cricketing crisis. John Hampshire was a dashing Yorkshire batsman who is the only England player to make a century on debut at Lord's, 107 against the West Indies in 1969, but never made another and was dropped after a short Test career. England's lower middle order added real strength with the wicket-keeper Alan Knott worth his place for his perky, unorthodox batting alone. Skipper Ray Illingworth made 476 runs (52.89) against the Rest of the World in 1970 and did well again in Australia. John Snow began and ended his cricketing life as a batsman and in 1969-71 averaged 34.50 in Tests, so could be regarded as another all-rounder.|$|E
