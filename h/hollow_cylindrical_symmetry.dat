40|$|To study {{simultaneously}} the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic {{behaviors in}} compressible flow systems with spherical or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>symmetry,</b> {{we present a}} theoretical framework for constructing Discrete Boltzmann Model(DBM) with spherical or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>symmetry</b> in spherical or cylindrical coordinates. To this aim, a key technique is to use local Cartesian coordinates to describe the particle velocity in the kinetic model. Thus, the geometric effects, like the divergence and convergence, are described as a “ force term”. Even though the hydrodynamic models are one- or two-dimensional, the DBM needs a Discrete Velocity Model(DVM) with 3 dimensions. We use a DVM with 26 velocities to formulate the DBM which recovers the Navier-Stokes equations with spherical or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>symmetry</b> in the hydrodynamic limit. For the system with global <b>cylindrical</b> <b>symmetry,</b> we formulated also a DBM based on a DVM with 2 dimensions and 16 velocities. In terms of the nonconserved moments, we define two sets of measures for the deviations of the system from its thermodynamic equilibrium state. The extension of current model to the multiple-relaxation-time version is straightforward. Comment: 49 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Objective of {{this study}} is to enhance radius of {{curvature}} of return loss, input impedance & explore SWR and radiation pattern. Hollow CDRA has been used instead of single-element CDRA to achieve the above mentioned goal. The impedance bandwidth of a high permittivity <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> dielectric resonator antenna excited by micro-strip lines was significantly improved by modifying the feed geometry. The main idea of the present study is to upgrade the bandwidth of the dielectric resonator Antenna. A new <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> dielectric antenna above the ground plain is proposed here. The matching bandwidth is 4. 45 - 5. 85 GHz and maximum radiation gain are 5. 37 dB at 5. 045 GHz. The 10 dB return loss bandwidth enhance 12 % to 27. 75 % (4. 45 - 5. 85 GHz) without much affecting the gain and other radiation properties of antenna. The performance of the dielectric resonator antenna is simulated by electromagnetic simulator CST Microwave Studio.
