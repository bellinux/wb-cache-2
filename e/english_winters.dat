5|$|Kilner first {{played for}} Yorkshire as a batsman before the First World War, {{establishing}} a regular {{place in the}} side. After being wounded in the war, he returned in 1919 to a Yorkshire side which was short of bowlers. As a result, Kilner began to practise his bowling {{to the point where}} he became highly regarded as a slow left-arm bowler. His aggressive batting and warm personality made him a popular player with both cricketers and spectators. His form brought selection by England in 1924 and a visit to Australia for the Ashes tour of 1924–25. Although the second most successful bowler of the tour, his bowling subsequently declined in effectiveness, and did not trouble batsmen on good pitches. He was selected during the 1926 Ashes but dropped for the final Test. Kilner went on several coaching trips to India during <b>English</b> <b>winters,</b> and on one of these, in 1928, he contracted an illness; on his return to England, he died aged 37. His funeral was attended by over 100,000 people and there was widespread sadness at his death.|$|E
25|$|From then until 1938, he {{was largely}} a county player, {{although}} in both 1935-36 and 1937-38 (but not 1936-37) {{he went back to}} India in the <b>English</b> <b>winters</b> to play for a variety of teams, including three times for the semi-official Australians in 1935-36 and once in each season for the Europeans. His best first-class bowling return was the 6-51 he took for Worcestershire against Northamptonshire in July 1935, while in May 1936, he made his highest first-class score when he struck 115 for Worcestershire against Lancashire.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan also {{extensively}} coached and lectured {{around the}} county, {{spending time in}} the <b>English</b> <b>winters</b> raising the team's profile. He encouraged the search for promising young cricketers, {{and most of the}} club's professional cricketers during its successful years in the 1930s were discovered during Gilligan's drive for new talent. Percy Fender believed that Gilligan allowed the team's professionals a greater say in Sussex's affairs than previously permitted. Fender wrote that Gilligan's teams enjoyed playing under him and that Gilligan {{was one of the most}} popular captains in county cricket. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow said: [...] "With him there was no sharpnesses, no petty restraints, no mathematical cricket. He won or lost plumb straight". Swanton wrote that [...] "Gilligan was essentially a friendly man, hail-fellow-well-met, and it is hard to think that in the world of sport he ever made an enemy." ...|$|E

500|$|Constantine's [...] {{first season}} was difficult; {{both he and}} the {{residents}} of the town were at that stage uncertain of each other. Few black people had been seen in Nelson, and although some residents wrote welcoming letters, the Constantines also received racist and abusive ones. He quickly established boundaries over what he considered acceptable, permitting and even sharing small jokes over skin colour but protesting strongly at outright racism. John Arlott wrote: [...] " [...] fought discrimination against his people with a dignity firm but free of acrimony." [...] Although Constantine later attributed some of the initial uneasiness to ignorance, at the time he seriously considered returning to Trinidad after the first season. His wife persuaded him otherwise, pointing out the benefits from remaining to complete his contract. From 1930 Constantine found life more comfortable; the family began to develop friendships and to engage in the social life of the town. They continued to visit Trinidad in the <b>English</b> <b>winters,</b> but Nelson became the family's permanent home.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the example}} of Wilfred Rhodes, several Yorkshire cricketers in the 1920s spent <b>English</b> <b>winters</b> {{coaching}} in India for the Maharaja of Patiala. Leyland coached {{in the winter of}} 1926–27, along with Arthur Dolphin, the Yorkshire wicketkeeper. That same winter, a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team toured India; although not chosen in the touring party, both Leyland and Dolphin played a handful of matches for the MCC. During the 1927 season Leyland scored 1,625 runs at 41.66, and, against Middlesex, scored his first double-century. Wisden suggested that he [...] "was not so dependable as could have been desired", but batted in an entertaining fashion. In August, he was selected in a trial game to assess players who might represent England in Test matches—he played against the England team for a side named [...] "The Rest"—and scored 102. In the winter of 1927–28, Leyland once more coached in India for the Maharajah of Patiala.|$|E

2500|$|... {{a career}} best {{that he would}} equal six years later for Middlesex. In the <b>English</b> <b>winter</b> of 1983–84 he played for his native Barbados, as he would do again (albeit very briefly) in 1984–85.|$|R
2500|$|He was {{particularly}} popular among fellow-cricketers, who spoke feelingly of their respect and sorrow when he died. He was mourned, too, in New Zealand, where he coached in five <b>English</b> <b>winters.</b> Slack {{was buried in}} his prized England blazer, bat at his side, and as the funeral cortege drove past Lord's, the Grace Gates bore a sign reading [...] "Farewell Wilf".|$|E
60|$|My {{voice is}} thawing too, {{with all the}} rest. If the cold had lasted I should have been dumb {{in a day or}} two more, and as it was, I was forced to refuse to see Mrs. Jameson (who had the {{goodness}} to come again) because I couldn't speak much above my breath. But I was tolerably well and brave upon the whole. Oh, these murderous <b>English</b> <b>winters.</b> The wonder is, how anybody can live through them....|$|E
60|$|This {{distribution}} of the seasons has a most important effect upon vegetation, to which sufficient attention has not been paid by cultivators of alpine Indian plants; in the first place, though <b>English</b> <b>winters</b> are cold enough for such, the summers are too hot and dry; and, in the second place, the great accession of temperature, causing the buds to burst in spring, occurs in the Himalaya in March, when the temperature at 7000 feet rises 8 degrees above that of February, raising the radiating thermometer always above the freezing point, whence the young leaves are never injured by night frost: in England the corresponding rise is only 3 degrees, {{and there is no}} such accession of temperature till May, which is 8 degrees warmer than April; hence, the young foliage of many Himalayan plants is cut off by night frosts in English gardens early in the season, of which Abies Webbiana is a conspicuous example.|$|E
50|$|Another {{motivation}} {{of the song}} may have been to Christianize old <b>English</b> <b>winter</b> season songs used in wassailing the apple orchards — pouring out libations or engaging in similar ceremonies to seek fertility of the trees.|$|R
50|$|During the 2014-15 <b>English</b> <b>winter</b> Thomas {{played for}} Sunshine Coast Scorchers in Brisbane Grade Cricket in Queensland. During the 2015-16 {{off-season}} he cycled from Land's End to John O'Groats, raising more than £4,000 for the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young.|$|R
60|$|The Harvest Festival day was perforce kept by him in bed, {{blistered}} {{and watched}} from hour to hour {{to arrest the}} autumn cold, which {{was the one thing}} dreaded as imperilling him in the <b>English</b> <b>winter</b> which he must face for the first time for four years.|$|R
60|$|Janet, {{though not}} in the most amiable mood, chose to go with her, and they set forth by the shorter way, across Belforest park, {{skirting}} the gardens where the statues stood up, looking shivery and forlorn, {{as if they were}} not suited to <b>English</b> <b>winters,</b> and the huge house looked down on them like a London terrace that had lost its way, with a dreary uninhabited air about it. Even by this private way they had two miles and a half of park to traverse, before they reached a heavy miry lane, where the beds of mud, alternated with rugged masses of stone, intended to choke them. It led up between high hedges to the brow of one of the many hills of the county, whence they could look down into the hollow, a perfect cup, scooped out as it were between the hills that closed it in, except at the outlet of the river that intersected it, making the meadow on either side emerald green, even in the winter. Corn lands of rich red soil, pasture fields dotted with cattle, and broad belts of copse wood between clothed the slopes; and a picturesque wooden bridge, with a double handrail, crossed the river. The farm-house, built of creamy stone, stood {{on the opposite side of}} the river, some way above the bank, and the mother and daughter agreed that it deserved to be sketched next summer.|$|E

50|$|In May 1820 Keats {{decided to}} leave for Kentish Town; and, over the next months, the two {{continued}} an emotional correspondence. Doctors had urged him to relocate to Italy for recovery, as another <b>English</b> <b>winter</b> would most likely prove deadly. He returned, for the last time, to Wentworth Place on 10 August 1820.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>English</b> <b>winter</b> of 1891-92, Lord Hawke led a touring {{party of}} English amateur cricketers {{on a tour}} of North America.

The tour {{contained}} two first-class fixtures, both contested against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia.|$|R
500|$|In the <b>English</b> <b>winter</b> of 1888–89, he {{was chosen}} to tour South Africa with the MCC, and played in two matches which were later {{designated}} as Test matches, though Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described them as been [...] "arguably not even first-class." [...] He took 119 first-class wickets during his career, of which eight came in his two Tests.|$|R
50|$|Rhondda Gillespie ceased {{playing in}} the 1990s due to {{arthritis}} in her fingers. She had come to spend {{much of her time}} (including the <b>English</b> <b>winters)</b> in Barbados, where she died on 30 December 2010, aged 69. Her former husband Denby Richards had died on 7 December.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Henning was {{appointed}} Head of the Department of Languages and Cultures of Near and Middle East at SOAS (he had been acting Head {{from the year}} before). He found the administrative duties irksome and the damp of <b>English</b> <b>winters</b> tiresome, so in September 1961 he accepted a position as Professor of Iranian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E
5000|$|A popular {{figure in}} the game, his Wisden {{obituary}} commented on the response to his death:He was particularly popular among fellow-cricketers, who spoke feelingly of their respect and sorrow when he died.

50|$|Boocock married Cynthia Boon in 1958, {{and they}} had three children, Victoria, Darren and Mandy. He and Cynthia retired to Australia, which he had visited on {{numerous}} occasions with British Lions and England teams during the <b>English</b> <b>winter</b> months. For some time they lived in Maroubra (Sydney), NSW; and Darren and Mandy attended Maroubra Bay Public School.|$|R

25|$|Cass had a wretched {{time even}} when he did play, with a {{first-class}} average of under 10 and a top score of 30 from 12 innings. His two 1971–72 outings for Tasmania proved little more successful with the bat than they had the previous <b>English</b> <b>winter,</b> with 59 runs coming from four innings, and he still made only one dismissal.|$|R
50|$|In 1929 Martin {{made his}} debut in England, playing for MCC against Oxford University at Lord's,and {{although}} {{he returned to}} Natal during the <b>English</b> <b>winters,</b> he played no further cricket outside England until after the Second World War.He appeared quite regularly for MCC in 1929 and 1930; his best bowling return for them was the 7-43 he claimed in the first innings against the Royal Navy in July 1929,while his highest score was the 97 he made against the Army in August 1930.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the National Health Service in Britain had drastically changed Ida's work and she was dissatisfied with the impact on ophthalmology. Perhaps more pressingly her husband had retired from Mill Hill and was suffering from ill-health which was exacerbated by the <b>English</b> <b>winters.</b> They were immediately smitten with Perth and {{within a short time}} Ida purchased a bungalow in Dalkeith, resigned from Moorfields, and arranged for all their belongings to be shipped to Australia. Here they conducted experiments on cancer viruses using in-bred strains of mice to ensure consistency. She started a private practice as an ophthalmologist, which was always her insurance against economic uncertainty.|$|E
50|$|Warne {{was back}} with Worcestershire for the 1935 English season, {{and had the}} most {{successful}} summer of his career. He hit precisely 1,000 first-class runs (the only time he ever achieved that landmark), and took 44 wickets, by some distance his highest season's tally.From then until 1938, he was largely a county player, although in both 1935-36 and 1937-38 (but not 1936-37) {{he went back to}} India in the <b>English</b> <b>winters</b> to play for a variety of teams, including three times for the semi-official Australians in 1935-36 and once in each season for the Europeans.

25|$|Higgins was in India {{during the}} 1922–23 <b>English</b> <b>winter,</b> playing four {{first-class}} games including two for Europeans in the Lahore Tournament.
