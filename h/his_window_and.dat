5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out <b>his</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon.

Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the tense}} {{situation}} and deplorable socio-cultural crime {{committed by the}} mob, Lafontaine proceeded cautiously, fought off armed thugs who had shot through <b>his</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> maintained restraint and resolve in his actions. Jailed members of the mob were released on bail soon after their arrest and a force of special constables established to keep the peace. Though there was public concern {{this might be a}} crushing blow to the reform movement, Lafontaine persevered despite the opposition, and would continue in his role developing the tenets of Canadian federalism – peace, order, and good government. Within a decade public opinion had shifted overwhelmingly {{in the development of a}} sovereign Canada.|$|E

After the storm passes, Harkin keeps her promise and tells London's story on air.|$|E
60|$|There {{was that}} in the tone of this short speech which made the {{conscientious}} man to whom it was addressed uneasy. It hinted to him that he might, without meaning it, turn aside a trustfulness beneficial to a mis-shapen young mind and perhaps to his own power of directing and improving it. They were within sight of the lights in <b>his</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> he stopped.|$|R

The receptionist (Feng Yuying) will not let her in without valid identification, though, and says the only way she can enter is with permission from the station manager, whom she describes as [...] "a man with glasses". For the rest of the day, Wei stands by the station's only gate, stopping every man with glasses, but she does not find the station manager, and spends the night asleep on the street.

2500|$|The Jeffersonians {{were opposed}} to Britain, preferring support for France in the wars raging in Europe, and they argued that the treaty with France from 1778 was still in effect. They {{considered}} Britain {{as the center of}} aristocracy and the chief threat to the United States' Republican values. They denounced Hamilton and Jay (and even Washington) as monarchists who betrayed American values. They organized public protests against Jay and his treaty; one of their rallying cries said: Damn John Jay! Damn everyone that won't damn John Jay!

[...] In his nude speeches of 1967 and 1968 Hundertwasser condemned the enslavement of humans by the sterile grid system of conventional architecture and by the output of mechanised industrial production.

2500|$|Art {{historian}} Ronald Pickvance {{says that}} with [...] "its arbitrary collage of separate motifs," [...] The Starry Night [...] "is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'." [...] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes {{them with the}} village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination. Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east, as does Jirat-Wasiutyński. Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh [...] "telescoped" [...] the view in certain of {{the pictures of the}} view from <b>his</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> {{it stands to reason that}} Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the morning star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of planet.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{concluded}} that burglary {{was the least}} dangerous of the four crimes, Scalia contended that attempted burglary was less risky than completed burglary.

[...] "The so-called 'confrontation' the Court envisions between a would-be burglar and a third party while the burglar is still outside the home is likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant's yelling 'Who's there?' from <b>his</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> the burglar's running away". [...] The danger posed by burglary arises {{from the fact that the}} burglar has entered the building, and thus attempted burglary is categorically less dangerous than completed burglary.|$|E
