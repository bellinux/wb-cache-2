When he came home he learned she had married Admiral Chandler, however this incident did nothing to lessen the ties of friendship between the two men. Poirot forces Frobisher to tell him more details of the incident with the sheep and finds out that on the night concerned, the Admiral found his son in bed with blood on his clothes and blood in the washbasin but Hugh remembered nothing of what he had done. Poirot questions the Admiral who has aged immensely since these incidents started and who feels that breaking the engagement is best for everyone, remarking {{that there will be no}} more Chandlers at Lyde Manor after he and his son have died.|$|E

One good thing came from the visit, there were talks of making her an honorary citizen of the town. Ultimately, a statue of Madonna, wearing conical bra was elected in her name, at the center of the town.

500|$|Marshall {{originally}} intended to include 1980s synth music in his film, but he {{found it difficult to}} combine the music with the intense action. Instead, composer Tyler Bates composed a score using heavy orchestra music. The film also included songs from the bands Adam and the Ants, <b>Fine</b> <b>Young</b> Cannibals, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and Kasabian. The song [...] "Two Tribes" [...] by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was the only song to remain in the film from the first draft of the screenplay. [...] "Spellbound" [...] by Siouxsie and the Banshees was a favorite song of the director, who sought to include it. Marshall also hoped to include the song [...] "Into the Light" [...] by the Banshees, but it was left out due to the producer disliking it and the cost being too high to license it.|$|E

He has traveled to England, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan to promote baseball. In appreciation for his efforts, Commissioner Bud Selig penned a thank-you letter to Granderson which read in part, [...] "There are so many <b>fine</b> <b>young</b> men playing Major League baseball today, but I {{can think of no}} one who is better suited to represent our national pastime than you." [...] He has also served as something of an unofficial baseball ambassador to the African-American community, often participating in and initiating dialogue about the lack of black players {{at all levels of the}} sport. When he endorsed Nike, Inc., Louisville Slugger and Rawlings, he asked them to donate money to his foundation or equipment to inner-city baseball programs rather than pay him.|$|E
500|$|Monteux {{wished to}} {{continue}} his work in helping young conductors: [...] "Conducting is not enough. I must create something. I am not a composer, so I will create <b>fine</b> <b>young</b> musicians." [...] In addition to his classes in Paris and Les Baux in the 1930s he had given private lessons to Igor Markevitch; later private students included André Previn, Seiji Ozawa, José Serebrier and Robert Shaw. Previn called him [...] "the kindest, wisest man I can remember, {{and there was nothing}} about conducting he didn't know." [...] After a performance conducted by Previn, Monteux said to him, [...] "Did you think the orchestra was playing well? ... So did I. Next time don't interfere with them." [...] Previn said that he never forgot this advice. Monteux's best-known undertaking as a teacher was the Pierre Monteux School for conductors and orchestral musicians, held each summer at his home in Hancock, Maine from 1943 onwards. Internationally known alumni of the school include Leon Fleisher, Erich Kunzel, Lorin Maazel, Neville Marriner, Hugh Wolff and David Zinman. Other Monteux students included John Canarina, whose 2003 biography was the first full-length study of the conductor in English, Charles Bruck, one of Monteux's first pupils in Paris, who became music director of the school in Hancock after Monteux's death, and Emanuel Leplin.|$|E

500|$|On May 24, 1989, Yankovic started {{recording}} the second parody for the album, [...] "Spam". The song, {{a play on}} R.E.M.'s hit [...] "Stand", is an ode to the canned luncheon meat Spam. Yankovic noted that it was [...] "fun to pick [...] and figure out some of those almost subliminal parts — parts that would fade in and out, little bell sounds, things you don't really hear on first listening." [...] On May 25, 1989, Yankovic recorded [...] "Isle Thing", a parody of [...] "Wild Thing" [...] by Tone Lōc, {{about a woman who}} introduces the narrator to the television show Gilligan's Island. Notably, the song is Yankovic's first rap parody; an earlier rap, [...] "Twister", is a Beastie Boys style spoof, but not a direct parody. Another Tone Lōc hit, [...] "Funky Cold Medina", is referenced in the lyrics: [...] "Ginger and Mary Ann coulda used some funky cold medina". The final parody, [...] "She Drives Like Crazy" [...] — recorded the same day as [...] "Isle Thing" [...] — is a spoof of <b>Fine</b> <b>Young</b> Cannibals' 1988 single [...] "She Drives Me Crazy". Lyrically, the song is about a man who fears his girlfriend's crazy driving habits.|$|E
500|$|On draft day, Phillips {{made good}} on his promise not to draft Taylor and the Saints instead {{selected}} Heisman Trophy-winning halfback George Rogers with the first pick, leaving the Giants with the decision of whether to select Taylor. To the raucous approval of the crowd in attendance at the draft (which was held in New York City), the Giants selected him. Privately, Taylor was hesitant about playing for New York as {{he had hoped to}} be drafted by the Dallas Cowboys, and was unimpressed with a tour of Giants Stadium he was taken on, after the draft. Publicly, however, he expressed excitement about the opportunity to play in the city. Taylor changed his stance after he was drafted as Harry Carson made a point to reach out to him, and Taylor said he [...] "talked to some players and coaches" [...] and [...] "got things straightened out." [...] One of the factors that the Giants said they considered in selecting Taylor was his solid reputation. [...] "He was the cleanest player in the draft. By that I mean there was no rap on him", said head coach Ray Perkins. [...] "Great potential as a linebacker, a <b>fine</b> <b>young</b> man, free of injuries." [...] Taylor chose to wear number 56 because he was a fan of Cowboys linebacker Thomas Henderson. As it would turn out, Taylor would have the longer and more successful career while Rogers, although successful in his own right with several 1,000-yard rushing seasons and two Pro Bowl selections, was injury-prone and forced to retire following the 1987 season with the Washington Redskins.|$|E
