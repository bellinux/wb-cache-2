50|$|The silver stain {{does not}} require fog centres on crystals, {{although}} they tend to occur in or near exposed areas. The silver stain can take a range of appearances, but one example is <b>dichroic</b> <b>fog.</b> Silver stains form on various hosts, such as tiny silver sulfide particles that may {{be present in the}} emulsion coating. They are very tiny and not visible, unless they are grown to larger sizes. Usual developers (that require silver ions supplied from within the silver halide crystal) do not grow these particles, but physical developers (that use silver ions from the solution to grow the development site) do. All modern practical developers function primarily as non-physical developers, but this type of fog may be seen when developed film is brought directly into exhausted fixer solution.|$|E
