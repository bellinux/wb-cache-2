40|$|Civic <b>engagement</b> <b>systems</b> to date {{frequently}} {{focus on}} purely rational aspects of deliberation void of emotions. In order to empower youth in a largely immigrant and lower-income neighborhood, we designed a location-based storytelling and story experiencing system for web-enabled mobile phones. The system {{is based on}} a novel concept of pervasive play where stories emerge and develop on several dimensions – most notably for our design a geographical one. This system functions as a research instrument in this paper. Through a qualitative analysis of the comments made through the system, we find (1) memories, feelings, and attitudes to be prime means of expression for youth, (2) the expression of such personal emotions leading to civic discussions, and (3) such discussions expanding over geographic areas in the neighborhood. Consequently, we argue for an approach to locative civic <b>engagement</b> <b>systems</b> that takes a vantage point in youth’s emotions rather than a very rational and dry approach to deliberation.

40|$|Laser <b>engagement</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used}} for {{training}} by many military and security organizations around the world. Advanced laser <b>engagement</b> <b>systems</b> communicate using coded bursts which contain a multitude of information. These bursts must be sampled precisely {{in order to be}} correctly decoded. It is important to be able to correctly decode the messages from the laser transmitters when developing a decoder, or even just for verification of correct transmitter operation. Power measurements can be calculated from the sampled waveforms, but require proper sampling rates to ensure accurate power calculations. Calculating power accurately is important when verifying transmitter power, which is often measured to ensure that a transmitter is not operating above safe levels that can cause ocular damage. The aim of this work is to obtain a test setup that will accurately sample the waveforms of the transmitted coded bursts for proper decoding and power measurement calculations. Digitizer selection will be discussed, as well as an analysis of the algorithmic method used for decoding the messages from the bursts.
