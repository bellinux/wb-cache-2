40|$|Background Accreditation {{is usually}} a {{voluntary}} plan supported by a non-governmental institution and trained evaluators that examine the competency of organizations providing health service according to pre-specified performance standards. Objectives The current study aimed to determine the degree of establishment of accreditation standards using logical framework of Zachman. Methods This descriptive research was conducted during year 2015. The population of the study included {{people involved in the}} establishment of accreditation standards. Sampling was conducted in the form of complete enumeration according to 36 standards of accreditation. The instrument used for data collection was the “Logical framework of Zachman”. Columns of framework consisted of people involved in conducting the work (Who), the purpose of the work (Why), strategy of the work (What), work time (When), and sub-system of <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> (Where) and way of <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> (How), and rows of framework included the view of hospital chief, director/assistants of hospital, officials and personnel. Test chi-square was used to compare between accreditation standards text and studied hospital gap. Descriptive statistical method was used for variables. Results People involved in <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> and sub-systems of <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> at the hospital were consistent with specified accreditation standards. In 27 % of the standards, time interval of <b>doing</b> <b>work</b> in the hospital was not conducted according to accreditation standards. In terms of way of <b>doing</b> <b>work,</b> 25 % of standards had not been established, and 26 % of them had been established incompletely. During interviews, it was found that 59 % of personnel of purpose of <b>doing</b> <b>work,</b> and 94 % of them are not informed about the strategy of <b>doing</b> <b>work,</b> according to accreditation standards in the hospital. Conclusions Uncertainties in the accreditation standards in dimensions of purpose, people involved, strategy and time interval of <b>doing</b> <b>work,</b> respectively, led to a lack of understanding the intention of author/developers of standards by personnel. As a result, this led to lack of complete establishment of accreditation standards in the studied hospital...|$|R

25|$|When {{one side}} of the piston is open to the atmosphere, the {{operation}} is slightly different. As the sealed volume of working gas comes in contact with the hot side, it expands, doing work on both the piston and on the atmosphere.

25|$|If {{the system}} doesn't change in time, they {{eliminate}} all {{movement in the}} direction of the constraint, thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system, as the velocity of that object is constrained to be 0 parallel to this force, due to this force. This only applies for a single particle system. For example, in an Atwood machine, the rope <b>does</b> <b>work</b> on each body, but keeping always the net virtual work null. There are, however, cases where this is not true.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures.

25|$|At low frequencies, {{molecules}} in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the microwave frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. The field <b>does</b> <b>work</b> against the bonds {{and the energy}} is absorbed by the material as heat. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commonly}} considered {{model is}} the heat pump or refrigerator. Again there are four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir, and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir. Then the work reservoir <b>does</b> <b>work</b> on the working body, adding more to its internal energy, making it hotter than the hot reservoir. The hot working body passes heat to the hot reservoir, but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir. Then, by allowing it to expand without doing work on another body and without passing heat to another body, the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir. It can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle.|$|E
25|$|Fictitious {{forces can}} be {{considered}} to do work, provided that they move an object on a trajectory that changes its energy from potential to kinetic. For example, consider {{a person in a}} rotating chair holding a weight in their outstretched hand. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, {{from the perspective of the}} rotating reference frame, they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let go, it spontaneously flies outward relative to the rotating reference frame, because the centrifugal force <b>does</b> <b>work</b> on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from them because it is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can be different in a non-inertial frame than an inertial one.|$|E
