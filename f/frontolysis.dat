40|$|Sting jets, or surface windmaxima {{at the end}} of bent-back fronts in Shapiro–Keyser cyclones, are {{one cause}} of strong winds in extratropical cyclones. Although {{previous}} studies identified the release of conditional symmetric instability as a cause of sting jets, the mechanism to initiate its release remains unidentified. To identify this mechanism, a case studywas selected of an intense cyclone over the NorthAtlanticOcean during 7 – 8 December 2005 that possessed a sting jet detected from the NASA Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT). A couplet of Petterssen frontogenesis and <b>frontolysis</b> occurred along the bent-back front. The direct circulation associated with the frontogenesis led to ascent within the cyclonically turning portion of the warm conveyor belt, con-tributing to the comma-cloud head. When the bent-back front became frontolytic, an indirect circulation as-sociated with the <b>frontolysis,</b> in conjunction with alongfront cold advection, led to descent within and on the warm side of the front, bringing higher-momentum air down toward the boundary layer. Sensible heat fluxes from the ocean surface and cold-air advection destabilized the boundary layer, resulting in near-neutral static stability facilitating downward mixing. Thus, descent associated with the <b>frontolysis</b> reaching a near-neutral boundary layer provides a physical mechanism for sting jets, is consistent with previous studies, and synthesizes existing knowledge. Specifically, this couplet of frontogenesis and <b>frontolysis</b> could explainwhy sting jets occur {{at the end of}} the bent-back front and emerge from the cloud head, why sting jets are mesoscale phenomena, and why they only occurwithin Shapiro–Keyser cyclones. A larger dataset of cases is necessary to test this hypothesis. 1...|$|E

The results of the model simulations indicate that the heavy precipitation just behind the surface cold front was associated with a low-level warm rain process driven by the severe prefrontal updraft. The precipitation well behind the leading edge of cold front resulted from the melting of graupel. The sensitivity studies for the rain water distribution indicated that the Analytical Gamma distribution may be a more suitable functional fit for the raindrop distribution as compared with the Marshall-Palmer distribution. The differential heating due to microphysical processes (condensation and evaporation) at the leading edge of the surface cold frontal region facilitated the required density contrast across the front and thus maintained the propagation of the density current. The leading edge of the cold front was also characterized by frontogenesis for levels above 0. 9 kin and <b>frontolysis</b> just ahead and immediately behind the cold front. The low level <b>frontolysis</b> indicated that buoyancy effects were almost negligible at the leading edge of the cold front. Instead the upward motion was created by mechanical lifting (pressure effects).

40|$|The {{frontogenesis}} and <b>frontolysis</b> {{processes of}} the subpolar front (SPF) in the surface mixed layer of the Japan Sea are investigated using state-of-the-art oceanic reanalysis data. The SPF experiences a 9 month weakening period from January to September, which shifts to a strengthening period in October. Our analysis shows that horizontal advection consistently contributes to the intensification of the SPF. After September, as the weakening effect of surface heat flux diminishes, horizontal advection becomes the dominant factor that contributes {{to changes in the}} SPF strength. Thus, the SPF enters a 3 month strengthening period. The geostrophic component of horizontal advection provides the most important contribution to strengthening the SPF, acting to intensify the SPF year-round. Ekman advection also promotes SPF strengthening with a smaller but still important contribution. During the weakening period, SPF strength is largely controlled by heat flux. The heat flux, especially the shortwave radiation component, is the primary cause of the surface front disappearance in the summer...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA hydrostatic, primitive equation model with frontogenetical deformation forcing {{is used to}} simulate the passage of cold fronts over a two-dimensional ridge. The model includes a K-theory planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization with implicitly defined diffusion coefficients. Numerical simulations are performed for synoptic-scale ridges of varying widths both with and without frontal forcing. These results are compared to simulations that do not include a PBL parameterization, similar to previous inviscid studies by Williams et al. Relative to the inviscid results, the PBL simulations produced reduced <b>frontolysis</b> on the upwind slope and reduced frontogenesis on the lee slope, resulting in significantly smaller frontogenetic variations over the mountain. This is caused by convergence forcing in the well-mixed layer offsetting the overall frontolytical forcing on the upwind slope, and greatly reduced lee side convergence forcing due to the PBL. In contrast to the inviscid results, the final downstream front is weaker in the mountain simulations than in the flat-topography control case when PBL effects are included. In all PBL simulations, gravity wave generation is greatly reduced and no lee side hydraulic jumps are observed.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{mesoscale}} subduction at the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) is conducted {{by use of}} hydrographic data from a high-resolution, quasi-synoptic survey of the front. The geostrophic velocity and isopycnal potential vorticity (PV) fields are computed, and the ageostrophic flow diagnosed from the semigeostrophic omega equation. It is found that the ageostrophic circulation induced by baroclinic instability counteracts the frontogenesis and <b>frontolysis</b> effected by the confluence and difluence, respectively, of the geostrophic velocity field. Though {{the sense of the}} ageostrophic circulation is reversed repeatedly along the front, the existence of PV gradients along isopycnals leads to a net cross-front ‘‘bolus’ ’ transport. In response to a reversal of this gradient with depth (a necessary condition for the onset of baroclinic instability), the bolus transport is northward at the protruding temperature minimum layer that characterizes the PF, and southward above. This net cross-front overturning circulation acts to flatten the isopycnals of the front and results in a subduction of the temperature minimum layer as it progresses northward along isopycnals. Consistently, a net baroclinic conversion rate of approximately 1 cm 2 s 22 d 21, corresponding to a net subduction rate of O(20 m yr 21), is calculated in the survey area. The similarity between the PV field of the PF and other Southern Ocean fronts suggests that the authors ’ results may also be applicable there. This has profound implications for the understanding of the zonation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} {{is determined}} that an aircraft will encounter moderate or severe high-level turbulence during a 100 -mi. flight segment when particular values of certain meteorological quantities exist in that locality. The turbulence data used are pilot reports {{collected by the}} U. S. Weather Bureau Clear Air Turbulence Project for March 12 - 24, 1962 and February 4 - 9, 1963. The meteorological quantities which were computed from standard data include vertical vector wind shear, vertical wind direction shear, temperature lapse rate, horizontal wind shear, vorticity, and resultant deformation. A correlation of 0. 45 was found between turbulence frequency and the product of vertical vector wind shear and deformation. This value is the highest correlation found so far with data of this type. The product of wind shear and deformation {{is an important factor}} in the development of fronts. One might expect that a tendency for frontogenesis would correlate better with turbulence than would <b>frontolysis.</b> The data however, indicate that both processes are equally important. Temperature lapse rate appeared to have little influence on the turbulence frequency except for a few occasions when conditions were nearly dry adiabatic. The regression equations between turbulence frequency and meteorological quantities that have been derived appear useful in estimating the risk of encountering turbulence in a given locality. Such turbulence estimates can be made at a particular time from the concurrent upper-air data, or on a climatological basis from the climatology of the pertinent meteorological factors. 1...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} found the South American subtropics to exhibit high climatological {{frontogenesis}} in equivalent potential temperature during the austral summer. An important contribution to this pattern is given by frontogenesis over the Argentinean Col (AC), which separates the Northwestern Argentinean Low (NAL) from transient troughs {{to the south of}} it. The NAL and the Low Pressure Tongue east of the Andes (LPT) promote efficient transport of Amazonian humidity to the subtropics during the incursion of transient disturbances over the continent. The convergence of this strong warm and humid flow with mid-latitude air brought into the subtropics by the disturbance occurs preferentially in the neighborhood of the AC. The main difficulty in quantifying the contribution of the NAL, AC and LPT structure to frontogenesis in the South American subtropics is the automatic detection of the AC and LPT. In this paper an algorithm developed to this end is briefly presented and applied to obtain statistics on the role of these structures in frontogenesis. Six-hourly data from ECMWF ERA- 40 Reanalysis over 21 austral summer periods (December–March) is used. Occurrences of the AC are highly concentrated between 34 – 39 &deg; S and 66 – 69 &deg; W, being present in this region in 42 % of the time instants analyzed. The spatial average of the positive values of the frontogenesis over this region was calculated for each time step as a measure of intensity and histograms were built for the cases when the AC was and was not found inside this region. Mean, median and mode are larger for the distribution of cases with the presence of the AC. In addition, we present the frequency of occurrence of the AC {{as a function of the}} frontogenesis, showing that it grows with the intensity of the frontogenesis, rising above the 0. 955 quantile.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Upper air {{soundings}} taken {{every three}} hours {{are used to}} examine a cold front of average intensity {{over a period of}} 24 hours. Vertical cross sections of potential temperature and wind and horizontal analyses are compared and adjusted until they are consistent with one another. These analyses are then used to study the evolution of the front. The front is found to consist of a complex system of fronts occurring {{at all levels of the}} troposphere. Low level fronts are strongest at the surface and rapidly weaken with height. Fronts in the middle and upper troposphere are much more intense. The warm air ahead of the fronts is nearly barotropic while the cold air behind the fronts is baroclinic through deep layers. A deep mixed layer is observed to grow in this cold air. Examination of cross sections of potential temperature and potential vorticity indicates that the air in at least the upper portions of the upper level fronts originates in the stratosphere. No evidence is found, however, of an extrusion of stratospheric air to very low levels. Diabatic processes seem to destroy the extrusion as it descends. The structure of the upper level fronts is complex. These fronts are observed to split apart, recombine, and descend to low elevations. This descent is due to the incorporation into the front of pre-existing stable/baroclinic layers. An equation for parcel-following frontogenesis in isentropic coordinates is developed and applied. No single process was found to be dominant in changing frontal intensity. Frontogenesis occurs on the leading edge of the fronts and <b>frontolysis</b> on the trailing edge. The magnitudes of the computed frontogenesis decrease downstream from the axis of the upper level trough. Isentropic trajectories are constructed in order to verify the computed values of parcel-following frontogenesis. Poor correlations are found between the computed and trajectory-following values of frontogenesis. This is believed to be due to nonlinearities in the field of frontogenesis and to errors in the trajectories. Such nonlinearities cast doubt on the usefulness of conventional data for the study of frontogenesis. Vertical velocities are computed using a kinematic technique. Reasonable fields of vertical velocity are obtained in the vicinity of the fronts and jet streaks. Good correlations are found between the vertical displacement between endpoints of the trajectories and the value of computed vertical velocity integrated over the path of the trajectory. The field of vertical velocity is also found to be highly nonlinear...|$|E

Pela singularidade deste ciclone extratropical, este foi simulado numericamente em alta resolução (9 e 3 km) pelo modelo WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting), permitindo deste modo a identificação e análise das várias estruturas particulares dos ciclones extratropicais do tipo Shapiro-Keyser, tais como cloud head, bent back front, intrusão de ar seco, fratura frontal e núcleo quente. O estudo da performance das parametrizações utilizadas mostrou que os resultados das simulações são sensíveis às parametrizações utilizadas. A intrusão de ar seco estratosférico atingiu níveis muito próximos da superfície dentro da camada limite na região junto à costa portuguesa. A análise desenvolvida no presente trabalho indicou que este ciclone extratropical se inclui na classe de ciclones descritos pelo modelo de Shapiro-Keyser, capazes de produzir ventos muito intensos à superfície. Este jato à superfície foi identificado e designado por sting jet por Browning. Contudo a metodologia de diagnóstico de sting jet aqui aplicada foi a desenvolvida recentemente por Schultz, baseada na frontogênese de Petterssen, apontando esta como responsável pelo movimento vertical necessário à libertação de instabilidade. The Gong storm has affected mainland Portugal on 19 th January, 2013. Given {{the uniqueness of}} this extra tropical cyclone, it was numerically simulated in high resolution (9 and 3 km) by the WRF model, allowing the identification and analysis of various particular structures of Shapiro–Keyser extra tropical cyclones, such as cloud head, bent back front, dry air intrusion, frontal fracture and warm core.

This surface jet was identified and named sting jet by Browning.

40|$|International audienceStochastic {{models can}} be {{developed}} to perform ensemble forecasts of geophysical fluid dynamical systems to more efficiently handle subgrid parametrizations. As numerical simulations do not usually resolve all temporal scales, solutions can be found by decomposing the velocity into a smooth resolved component and an unresolved one, uncorrelated in time and inhomogeneous in space. In turn, this new point of view changes the usual interpretation of transport and fundamental conservation laws (mass, momentum and 1 st principle). Indeed, following a stochastic version of the Reynolds transport theorem (Mémin, 2014), three terms naturally emerge: a multiplicative noise, an anisotropic and inhomogeneous diffusion, and a drift correction. For instance, neglecting diabatic effects implies the conservation of the temperature T along the flow as : DT/Dt= 0, with the material derivative D/Dt, now understood in a stochastic sense. As such, the rigorous derivation of this model relates the random forcing to the subgrid parametrization. This further ensures important properties such as energy conservation and also simplifies the derivation of ensemble forecasts in defining a clear mathematical framework. Using this new framework, stochastic versions of geophysical models have been derived, namely: Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating frame, the Boussinesq approximation, Quasi-Geostrophy (QG) and Surface Quasi-Geostrophy (SQG). Depending {{on the amount of}} randomness, the QG approximation can lead to two different models. With moderate uncertainty, the horizontal transport of the Potential Vorticity (PV), in the interior of the fluid, has 3 sources terms. For homogeneous turbulence, two of them, disappear. The remaining term, a noise uncorrelated in time, encodes the interactions between the resolved and the unresolved velocity gradient tensors. The ensuing SQG model is then derived assuming a zero PV in the interior, as in the deterministic case (Held et al., 1995). Yet, the buoyancy transport at the surface of the fluid has to be understood in the stochastic sense. Increasing to strong uncertainty, the QG approximation further leads to a vanishing PV in the interior. As such, a classical SQG relationship remains. However, for that case, an ageostrophic component appears, contributing to intensify asymmetries between cyclones and anticyclones, as in the SQG+ model (Hakim et al., 2002). Frontogenesis occurs on the cold side of fronts, on uncertain locations, and <b>frontolysis</b> smooths the warm side of fronts. As obtained, the flow topology is changed by the noise and the divergent component, and the symmetry breaks more rapidly. Larger the uncertainty, faster the symmetry is broken. Simulating an ensemble of realizations then enables to track the different possible topologies and all the bifurcations of the system...|$|E
