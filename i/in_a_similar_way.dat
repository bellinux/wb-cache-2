5|$|The main {{response}} {{of the immune system}} to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>way</b> to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>way,</b> especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|E
