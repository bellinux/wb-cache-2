25|$|Gibraltar were humiliated by Canada: Abraham took 5-9 as the Gibraltarians were {{dismissed}} for 46, the lowest total of the tournament, and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> {{as they were}} 17/7 at one point. In reply the Canadians smashed 48 from just 23 balls to record the easiest of ten-wicket wins. CAC Browne made 57 as Fiji posted a competitive total of 251 against the United States, but an unbeaten 104 by Lashkari and 74 from Kamran Rasheed ensured a five-wicket win for the Americans. The Dutch put on 200 for the second wicket against Hong Kong (Atkinson 107, Gomes 101) and their opponents could only manage 157/9 from their allotted overs. Finally, Harry made 162 and Maha 52 as Papua New Guinea (377/6) destroyed Israel (100); Amini took 5-19 for the Papuans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first leg}} of the round of 16 was played in the Basel and Sevilla had not won a European away game all season, so the goalless draw in Switzerland {{represented}} an improvement. Three second-half saves from Basel goalkeeper Tomáš Vaclík kept the home team in contention, but reigning Europa League title holders Sevilla cannot be unhappy with a goalless draw in this first leg. Marc Janko jumped high to head Basel's first chance {{just a little bit}} wide as early as the seventh minute – easily Basel's best chance of the first half – with Sevilla dominating possession thereafter. Steven N'Zonzi went quite close with headers {{at either end of the}} period, while Éver Banega twice found Coke with free-kicks but the Sevilla captain was unable to find the target from either position. Basel's resolve returned after the half time break, if not their composure, Birkir Bjarnason blazing off target from a loose ball after a Renato Steffen shot was blocked. The Icelandic midfielder then pulled a decent ball across from the right, only for substitute Adama Traoré to scuff his attempted conversion. However, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>worse</b> for the Swiss team but for Vaclík, who was very awake and saved with his feet after N'Zonzi was played in and then kept out Kévin Gameiro's low drive, going to ground once more to repel Yevhen Konoplyanka as time ticked down. [...] Midfielder N'Zonzi's dismissal near the end of the game offered Basel hope, but Sevilla held firm.|$|E
