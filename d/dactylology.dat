25|$|Fingerspelling (or <b>dactylology)</b> is the {{representation}} of the letters of a writing system, and sometimes numeral systems, using only the hands. These manual alphabets (also known as finger alphabets or hand alphabets), have often been used in deaf education, and have subsequently been adopted as a distinct part of a number of sign languages; there are about forty manual alphabets around the world. Historically, manual alphabets have had a number of additional applications—including use as ciphers, as mnemonics, and in silent religious settings.|$|E

50|$|The {{deficiency}} of class-books was an evil which Baker soon {{found to be}} pressing. Although the deaf and dumb had been gathered together in various institutions for forty years, no attempt {{had been made to}} provide such a course as they required. This want he set himself to supply. He wrote the Circle of Knowledge in its various gradations, consecutive lessons, picture lessons, teachers' lessons, the Book of the Bible in its several gradations, and many other works which had special relation to the teaching of the deaf and dumb. The Circle of Knowledge obtained great popularity. It was used in the education of the royal children, and of the grandchildren of Louis-Philippe. It was largely used throughout the British Empire and in Russia, and the first gradation has been translated into Chinese, and is used in the schools of China and Japan. Many years ago the publisher reported that 400,000 copies had been sold. Baker also wrote for the Penny Cyclopædia various topographical articles, and those on the Instruction of the Blind, <b>Dactylology,</b> Deaf and Dumb, George Dalgamo, and the Abbé Sicard. He contributed to the Journal of Education, to the Polytechnic Journal, and the publications of the Central Society of Education, and translated Ammann's Dissertation on Speech (1873).|$|E
30|$|The RuleAnalyzer class {{applies the}} {{translation}} rules, {{developed by a}} human specialist, to the sequence of tokens and uses a BP to LIBRAS dictionary to do the lexical replacement step. By excluding the rules from the Remove Tokens, Lexical Replacement and <b>Dactylology</b> Replacement steps, nine high-level translation rules developed by the human specialists were taken into account. The translation rules are loaded from a file and are specified using an XML representation that allows LIBRAS specialists to easily add new rules and also modify or remove previously defined ones. Thus, {{it is possible to}} extend the set of translation rules in a simple way, just editing that file.|$|E
40|$|Language {{of signs}} is usually {{used by the}} {{deaf-mute}} persons in order to convey their message. But, it becomes very difficult {{for those who have}} no knowledge of the sign language. The aim of this research work is to resolve this problem using Digital <b>Dactylology</b> Converser (DOC) which is a device that converts a sign language into voice signal and text message. Primarily a hands gesture is recognised by computer vision program and based on that image a speech and text is played and displayed on the speaker and LCD respectively. Purpose of this device is to make conversation easy between dumb and the normal people around the world. In order to minimize their limitations and enable them to expand their boundaries, this is best suitable device. Experimental results verify the operational accuracy of the device for different users. The proposed device can work well and translates the letters, alphabets to text and soun...|$|E
30|$|After the tokens are classified, {{we apply}} some {{translation}} rules (defined by LIBRAS specialists) to translate these tokens (or words) for a representation in gloss notation. Initially, we simplify the text by removing some tokens (the Remove Tokens step). We chose this step because LIBRAS does not define prepositions and articles. Thus, these classes of tokens can be removed. Afterwards, some tokens (or words) are replaced (the Lexical Replacement step) {{in order to}} adapt {{the meaning of the}} sentence rewritten to LIBRAS, since the LIBRAS vocabulary is smaller than BP’s [36]. For example, the words HOME, HOUSE, HABITATION in BP have the same sign (i.e., the same visual representation) in LIBRAS, the HOME sign. Furthermore, while the BP verbs have a high degree of inflection, the LIBRAS verbs do not inflect. In this case, the BP verbs are replaced by non-inflected gloss verbs (i.e., the LIBRAS verbs). To do this replacement, we use a set of BP to LIBRAS synonyms (BP-LIBRAS dictionary). Finally, proper names and technical terms are spelled in LIBRAS [by handshapes that represent the letters of the token (word)]. Thus, we also apply a <b>dactylology</b> replacement to spell proper names and technical terms. The output generated is a representation in LIBRAS gloss notation.|$|E
