40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>relay</b> {{contacts}} {{have traditionally}} been made of materials, primarily Ag/CdO, which are resistant to welding under short, high power pulses. However, since 2006, RoHS prohibits the use of cadmium in electronics, driving the elimination of Ag/CdO and its replacement with Ag/SnO 2. The reliability of relays made with Ag/SnO 2 contacts {{has been shown to}} be vendor specific. This thesis focuses on developing an understanding of the metallurgical and design factors that vary by manufacturer and their effect on welding susceptibility of Ag/SnO 2 electromagnetic relay contacts and other related relay failure mechanisms. In addition, it aims to predict a safe operating area of power and energy over which specific relay contacts will not weld under high power DC conditions. Relays from various manufacturers were subjected to capacitor discharge pulses of 250 V at 10 - 80 uF to characterize relay reliability. Failure analysis was then conducted on the welded contacts using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) in order to address material properties and design variations that affect the welding susceptibility of relays. The incidence and extent of degradation is correlated to material characteristics including contact composition, oxide content, hardness, contact geometry, and surface roughness using a physics of failure approach. The relays with a higher percent content of indium oxide exhibited a greater reliability than those without. Both power and energy were then varied to further investigate the one cycle to failure boundary region and a failure map is presented...|$|E

Theoretical {{justification}} {{and engineering}} of induction motors heat protection method from overload currents {{taking into account}} nonlinear distortion of the phase current and implementation as a microprocessor device functioning algorithm. Methodology. To solve the problem used {{the theory of the}} representing complex harmonic oscillations analog signals expansion into the oscillation spectrum forming elementary harmonic components in order to compare their properties by applying the theory of discrete signals and systems, as well as methods of spectral analysis and discrete signals filtering. The harmonic analysis versatility is that any periodic signal may be synthesized from harmonic oscillation of certain amplitude, frequency and initial phase. A mathematical model for determining the phase current harmonic content of power supply networks with isolated neutral and non-linear loads types and, as a consequence, the distortion of sinusoidal phase current change is developed by multiplying the analog current in time dependency on the grate delta-function with different sampling intervals, in which the use of simple and widely used in relay protection units, in particular <b>electronic</b> overcurrent <b>relays,</b> mathematical operations of integration squares instantaneous current allows the most in harmony with the mathematical tools to build other network protection types. Findings. The necessity to increase the sensitivity of the induction motors heat protection from overload currents taking into account nonlinear distortion of the phase currents is proved. By nonlinear distortion harmonic analysis of the phase currents the motor protection reliability increasing provided by taking into account the higher harmonic components of the phase currents, which causes to additional losses and heating of the stator winding. It uses the simplest and widely used in protective relaying mathematical apparatus determining of most significant higher harmonics currents RMS. Originality. A possibility of extending the implemented protection list of <b>electronic</b> overcurrent <b>relays</b> based on the digital processing of signals from the current sensors is theoretical research by the harmonious analysis of phase current spectrum with the nonlinear distortions presence.
