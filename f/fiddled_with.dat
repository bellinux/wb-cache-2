[...] He compared the songs to fabled works of American music: [...] "The Basement Tapes are a testing and a discovery of roots and memory ... they are no more likely to fade than Elvis Presley's 'Mystery Train' or Robert Johnson's 'Love In Vain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garbage {{began writing}} their second album, which would {{go under the}} working title of Sad Alcoholic Clowns, in March 1997 in the band's label head Jerry Moss's {{vacation}} house in Friday Harbor, Washington. The group demoed and made rough outlines for new songs. When they felt they had made a good start, Garbage took the work they made in Washington back to their Madison, Wisconsin, base at Smart Studios and begin fleshing out the ideas and rough sketches over the following year. The group recorded all of their work for the second album through a 48-track digital system digitally, direct to hard drives utilizing a 24-bit Pro Tools rig. While only one recorder {{was up in the}} early sessions, eventually another was installed to edit, and ultimately a third so Manson could record vocals while the other members <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> recordings. Vig estimated that the sample collage approach led to [...] "probably have five albums' worth of music", and songs featuring up to 120 audio tracks. After the digital file was ready, mixing was done in an analog tape deck, which held only 14 tracks.|$|E

She too was pretty, but with an impudent, not quite pleasant manner.

50|$|There is {{disagreement}} {{regarding the}} relevance of the music itself. While some writers consider it always subordinate to the text in terms of importance, others such as Ramón Barce have theorised that the music comes first in the composition of the work; incoherent texts, called monstruos ("monsters"), merely gave the librettist a rhythm to which he must fit his words; these words were then often inexpertly <b>fiddled</b> <b>with</b> by the composer). In any case, the music does not usually correspond closely to the action, but rather is something in the background, sometimes coming in unexpectedly.|$|E
