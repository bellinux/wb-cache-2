40|$|Abstract. —The {{relationship}} between the movement of small (, 150 -mm) Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma and cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii and stream discharge is not well known in streams of southeast Alaska. We measured movement in a small headwater stream using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and stationary antennas to record time and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> Fish with PIT tags were detected by transceivers and stationary antennas in the stream. The date and time of detection at an antenna were matched with stream discharge (m 3 /s) at the same date and time. Most Dolly Varden moved upstream during late summer and early fall. Most cutthroat trout movement was in May, and movement declined through the summer. Few fish moved during the winter. Most fish moved within a narrow discharge range, with a few moving at higher discharges. More than 97 % of fish from both species were detected as moving upstream at discharges below the 5 % exceedance level during the 4 -year period of discharge measurements. Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout moved throughout {{the entire length of}} usable habitat in the stream. Connectivity throughout watersheds even within headwater streams is important and can be maintained for these species by use of road crossings that ensure passage over a range of flow conditions such as those described here.

40|$|International audienceWhen the {{recurrence}} {{intervals of}} large earthquakes span several thousands <b>of</b> years, the <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> fault <b>movements</b> over long time intervals {{is essential for}} estimating the next event.

In recent years, cosmogenic nuclides have provided new insights into the <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> these ground <b>movements.</b> Approaches to gathering this information can be direct, such as dating fault surfaces with 36 Cl, or indirect, such as dating fault-offset alluvial fans with 10 Be or 26 Al.

5000|$|The {{primary use}} for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology is dating {{metamorphic}} and igneous minerals. 40Ar/39Ar {{is unlikely to}} provide the age of intrusions of granite as the age typically reflects the time when a mineral cooled through its closure temperature. However, in a metamorphic rock that has not exceeded its closure temperature the age likely <b>dates</b> the crystallization <b>of</b> the mineral. <b>Dating</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> on fault systems is also possible with the 40Ar/39Ar method. Different minerals have different closure temperatures; biotite is ~300°C, muscovite is about 400°C and hornblende has a closure temperature of ~550°C. Thus, a granite containing all three minerals will record three different [...] "ages" [...] of emplacement as it cools down through these closure temperatures. Thus, although a crystallization age is not recorded, the information is still useful in constructing the thermal history of the rock.|$|R

We present the r sults of a preliminary thermoluminescence (TL) <b>dating</b> study <b>of</b> sand and interdune-playa deposits from the Sede Hallamish area of the northern Negev. The results appear to indicate that: (a) sediments inthe interdune area were deposited over a period from at least 43 ka to 9 ka and include several depositional cycles; and (b) the lower parts of the linear dunes were formed 6 - 10 ka and the dune flanks have been stabilized since then. These results are placed in the context of existing studies of the palaeoclimate of the Negev during the Late Pleistocene.

The relative motion of the land at these stations is indicated by the relationship between monthly mean sea levels measured at pairs of stations.

40|$|This thesis characterises and quantifies the {{influence}} of lateral ground-tilting on rivers in terms of: i) channel planform changes and migration style, ii) temporal and spatial patterns <b>of</b> channel <b>movement,</b> and, iii) the preserved alluvial architecture formed by aggrading fluvial systems. A dual field and physical modelling approach is {{used to examine the}} impact of tilting on river channels at a range of temporal and spatial scales. Fieldwork was undertaken on the Carson River, Nevada, USA which has been proposed as an example of avulsive downdip channel movement towards an active basin-bounding fault (Leeder, 1993). Froude scale models of both meandering and braided rivers were established in a stream table which could simulate aggradation and be tilted laterally. Quantification of the Holocene history of the Carson River, combined with independent <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> on the basin-bounding fault, allows the alluvial-tectonic relationships to be analysed. In addition to local tectonics, factors which may also affect channel movement such as climate change, regional periods of channel incision and intrinsic channel avulsion are investigated. The Carson River is shown to possess a more complex spatial relationship with fault movement and lateral tilting than that envisaged by Leeder (1993). Phases of channel onlap towards the locus of subsidence after fault events are separated by channel offlap during periods of tectonic quiescence. In addition, lag times between faulting and channel movement appear to be short. The preserved alluvial architecture modelled in flume experiments on aggrading braided streams is subdivided into a number of key depositional niches and their geometries quantified. A number of cross-stream and vertical variations in niche geometries {{can be attributed to the}} timing, magnitude and frequency of imposed lateral tilting, and confirm Leeder and Alexander's (1987) conceptual model of progressive downdip channel movement in response to lateral tilting. No unambiguous relationship between channel bend parameters and imposed lateral ground-tilting could be defined in the meandering river experiments because the rate and type of bend development masks the impact of tilting. However, the rate <b>of</b> channel <b>movement</b> towards the downtilted margin appears to increase after tilting and be directly related to tilt magnitude. A new model of progressive downdip channel migration in response to lateral tilting is presented which resolves the incompatibility of previous models. In addition, a criterion based on the rate of tilting is proposed in order to distinguish between channels that respond to tectonic tilting either by avulsion or by gradual downdip migratio...|$|R

Most mechanisms proposed to explain its elevation gain imply mantle processes. The {{age of the}} uplift and the different steps of relief growth are still debated.

On the other hand, geomorphological studies suggest a Late Cenozoic uplift scenario (< 30 Ma). However few attentions were paid {{to the evolution of}} the overall geomorphic system, from the upstream erosional system to the downstream depositional system. This study is based on two different approaches: - Onshore, on the mapping and chronology of all the macroforms (weathering surfaces, pediments and pediplains, incised rivers, wave-cut platforms) dated by intersection with the few preserved sediments and the volcanics. - Offshore, on a more classical dataset of seismic lines and petroleum wells, coupled with biostratigraphic revaluations (characterization and <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> vertical <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> the margins - sediment volume measurement).

40|$|Landslide chronologies are {{essential}} both {{for understanding the}} causes <b>of</b> mass <b>movements</b> and {{for the assessment of}} landslide hazards. The Fadalto landslide (Venetian Prealps, Italy) studied in this paper has been active, as shown by morphological and stratigraphical data, for several thousands years since the Late Glacial. The chronology of this large and complex landslide was significantly improved through identification and radiocarbon and dendrochronological <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> several mass <b>movements</b> which occurred during the Holocene: one in the late Atlantic (5375 ± 95 years BP) and others in historical times (within the last 14 centuries).

30|$|Even {{though the}} agro-ecological {{environment}} is similar, the political context {{could not be}} more different. In the Chinese Altay-Dzungarian region, the start date for transhumance movements to any seasonal pasture (pastures used only in a specific season, i.e. spring, summer, autumn and winter), the duration of stay on a pasture, the location and size of a household’s pastures and the animal numbers per household are defined by the local government (Squires et al. 2010). A (household’s) pasture is always in state ownership and in the study region is normally an unfenced but clearly delimited rangeland management unit for grazing assigned to an individual herder household; in the whole of Qinghe county, there was only one fenced winter pasture for cattle. Representatives of the local government followed the herders year-round to ensure their compliance with the mentioned regulations. However, the prescribed <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> transhumance <b>movements</b> to the seasonal pastures were often circumvented by sending un-herded livestock ahead (especially cattle, horses and camels). In Mongolia, in contrast, the timing <b>of</b> transhumance <b>movement</b> is determined by social and environmental factors (start of school holidays, weather conditions, herbage yield and water availability). The compliance with regulations of traditional rangeland utilization and the number of animals kept are largely self-controlled by the individual herder and a communally nominated ‘major’ herder elected by the local herders themselves (Upton 2010).|$|R
30|$|In the Altay-Dzungarian region, {{a highly}} mobile and {{flexible}} transhumance strategy is of major importance for pastoral herds {{to cope with}} the seasonal and spatial variability in {{the quality and quantity of}} pasture vegetation. The regulation of animal numbers, a larger number of utilized pastures and the control <b>of</b> prescribed <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> transhumance <b>movements</b> (especially <b>of</b> small ruminants) to the summer and autumn pasture seem to maintain herbage yield and quality in China. Nevertheless, changes of the transhumance routes of small ruminants (triggered by expansion of irrigated agricultural land and mining activities) may hamper these positive regulation effects. On the other hand, these restrictions are likely to prevent the flexible reaction of herders to the high inter- and intra-annual variation of precipitation and sudden adverse weather conditions. In Mongolia, however, high stocking densities (particularly due to a high number of goats), a diminished frequency of pasture changes (especially at the spring and winter pastures characterized by low precipitation) and grazing of the summer pasture before flowering of herbaceous plants seem to decrease the herbage offer. The introduction <b>of</b> access <b>dates</b> and the reduction of stocking densities and/or the duration of the herds’ sojourn in particular areas may help to improve herbage offer and to sustain animal production.|$|R
