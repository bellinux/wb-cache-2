5|$|Madlax {{was often}} {{accused of being}} {{secondary}} and reusing Noir stylistic solutions, such as the story premise, the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style. Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and subplots being tightly intertwined and <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> the primary plot.|$|E
5|$|A hadron is a {{composite}} particle made of quarks <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> the strong force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern Universe.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{happiness}} of Bobby Dodd's early life came to a sad end in 1924 when his father committed suicide due to business failure and financial troubles. The family was forced to move, but was <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> the perseverance of Dodd's mother. During the next three seasons, the Kingsport Indians were very successful, gaining two state titles. They were helped by Dodd, who moved from receiver to quarterback and kicker. In 1926, Bobby Dodd graduated and {{was admitted to the}} University of Tennessee with a football scholarship.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> a common meter alone.|$|E
5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within the Milky Way, a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view.|$|E
500|$|Articulate ("jointed") brachiopods have a {{tooth and}} socket {{arrangement}} {{by which the}} pedicle and brachial valves hinge, locking the valves against lateral displacement. Inarticulate brachiopods have no matching teeth and sockets; their valves are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> only <b>by</b> muscles. (R.C.Moore, 1952) ...|$|R
50|$|In biochemistry, a metabolon is a {{temporary}} structural-functional complex formed between sequential enzymes of a metabolic pathway, <b>held</b> <b>together</b> both <b>by</b> non-covalent interactions and by structural elements of the cell, such as integral membrane proteins and proteins of the cytoskeleton.|$|R
50|$|Pan is {{a contact}} binary, {{composed}} of two lobes in mutual contact, <b>held</b> <b>together</b> only <b>by</b> their weak gravitational attraction, and typically show a dumbbell-like shape (also see 4769 Castalia). A large number of near-Earth objects {{are thought to be}} contact binaries.|$|R
5|$|The Smart Cover, {{introduced}} {{with the}} iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically {{attaches to the}} face of the iPad. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> magnets. The Smart Cover can also assume other positions by folding it. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the unit when the cover is removed. It comes in five colors of both polyurethane and the more expensive leather.|$|E
5|$|The {{other type}} of solids is weak {{molecular}} crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, thus they are termed “low energy”. Depending {{on the type of}} liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.|$|E
5|$|The quarks are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> {{the strong}} {{interaction}} (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, {{are held to}} each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E

40|$|The Greek government’s {{decision}} to close ERT has been criticised in various activist channels as anti-democratic or even irrational. Yet these activists {{and opponents of}} the ERT decision are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> only <b>by</b> thin strands and, in truth, represent heterogenous and conflicting interests and agendas...|$|R
5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate {{much faster than}} the amount of visible matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter {{is not enough to}} hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> huge quantities of dark matter. Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the}} naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the fuselage which was <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
50|$|Renuka was {{a devoted}} {{wife and a}} power of her {{chastity}} that was manifest. Such was her chastity, {{that she used to}} fetch water from the river in a pot made of unbaked clay every day, <b>held</b> <b>together</b> only <b>by</b> the power of her devotion to Jamadagni.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{increased}} pressure to her hull, Rena was expected {{at any point}} to split in two, furthering {{the environmental impact of}} the disaster. It was reported on 14 October 2011, that Rena had cracked in two, <b>held</b> <b>together</b> only <b>by</b> her internal structure and the reef itself.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn improved, {{straightforward}} purification {{procedure for}} E. coli α-haemolysin has been developed. The protein {{exists in the}} form of large aggregates, <b>held</b> <b>together</b> mainly <b>by</b> hydrophobic forces. In the presence of urea or other chaotropic agents, the size of the aggregates decreases, while the specific activity is increased...|$|R
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular}} the ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the cohesive energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
5|$|Like all insects, wasps {{have a hard}} {{exoskeleton}} {{which protects}} their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the petiole, joining {{the first and second}} segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females there is usually a rigid ovipositor which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely or can be retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defence and for paralysing prey.|$|E
5|$|The Smart Cover, first {{introduced}} with the iPad 2, is a screen protector that magnetically {{attaches to the}} face of the iPad. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> magnets. While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive than the polyurethane version.|$|E
50|$|The multimeric {{structure}} of IgM is shown schematically in Figure 1. Figure 1A shows the “heterodimer” composed of one light chain, denoted L, and one heavy chain, denoted µ. The heavy and light chains are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> both <b>by</b> disulfide bonds (depicted as red triangles) and by non-covalent interactions.|$|R
60|$|The {{band was}} a large one--a few on horseback, many on foot; some being Indians and half-castes, others {{disappointed}} miners and desperadoes. A fierce villain among the latter {{was the leader of}} the band, which was <b>held</b> <b>together</b> merely <b>by</b> unity of purpose and interest in regard to robbery, and similarity of condition in regard to crime.|$|R
50|$|Many Epitonium {{species have}} shells {{that are very}} {{attractive}} and quite interesting in their structure. However this species is particularly striking, partly because it is very large compared with {{the great majority of}} other species within the genus, but also because the whorls themselves do not touch and so the shell is <b>held</b> <b>together</b> only <b>by</b> the well-developed ribs or costae.|$|R
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 {{was the culmination of}} a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> the strong nuclear force. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} (plural – proboscises) {{is formed}} from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It {{consists of two}} tubes <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families and are often folded.|$|E
5|$|Type III toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a toxic protein and an RNA antitoxin. The toxic {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. One example is the ToxIN system from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora. The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be toxic to E. coli. The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>by</b> extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E
50|$|Lingulata shells are {{composed}} {{of a combination of}} calcium phosphate, protein and chitin. This is unlike most other shelled marine animals, whose shells are made of calcium carbonate. The Lingulata are inarticulate brachiopods, so named for the simplicity of their hinge mechanism. This mechanism lacks teeth and is <b>held</b> <b>together</b> only <b>by</b> a complex musculature. Both valves are roughly symmetrical.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{no central}} body to oversee {{all of the}} Grand Lodges in the world (nor, indeed, all of Freemasonry), and therefore, {{individual}} Grand Lodge policies and practices can and do vary, though they have a similar basic framework in common. The lack of a central authority means that Grand Lodges are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> simply <b>by</b> fellowship with one another.|$|R
50|$|As a {{testimonial}} to {{the integrity}} of the original design, the explosive detonations used for the first demolition attempt resulted in the whole structure remaining intact and simply listing to one side, still <b>held</b> firmly <b>together</b> <b>by</b> its network of external supporting braces. Subsequently, the braces were cut away using large industrial cutting torches.|$|R
