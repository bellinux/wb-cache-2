40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Mahasarakham Primary Healthcare Centre, Mahasarakham {{province}} in the area of Northeastern of Thailand. The experiment was randomized control trial clinical study in order to examine the efficacy of TTHF in the treatment of antihelmintic activity of mixed worms infection in human. The experimental group consisted of 10 and 5 patients for control group with inclusion and exclusion criteria which were screened by the selection of mixed worm infection symptoms samples. The investigation and <b>extraction</b> of <b>worm</b> Eggs Per Gram of patient feces method (EPG) were performed with Ether Formalin Sedimentation Test. The percentage of reduction of Eggs Per Gram (EPG) of patient feces were collected, counted and confirmed by parasitologist and the clinical efficacy was investigated by the physician and the pharmacist. The EPG (%) data were collected before and after the treatment with TTHF and with Mebendazole. The result showed that TTHF had higher efficacy in antihelmintic activity than Mebendazole and placebo which had the reduction (%) of egg per gram of feces as 93. 69 with TTHF and reduction (%) of egg per gram of feces as 87. 50 in Mebendazole. The suggestion of this study should increase the number of samples of worm infected patients which the samples can be identified with the specific helminthes genus and species in order to obtain the efficacy by the treatment using TTHF and Mebendazole comparatively...|$|R
40|$|The 1970 s and 1980 s saw {{the rise}} and rapid {{development}} of online textual databases, particularly those covering science and technology. Online patents files are amongst the most used of these databases, and are now accessed worldwide by both patent specialists and researchers. However, most online databases covering intellectual property are based on an original document or publication which includes highly meaningful drawings, chemical structures or diagrams. Until recently these have not been available in electronic format. The recent rapid advances in image handling and distribution technology, such as Document Image Processing (DIP), image <b>extraction,</b> CD-ROM, <b>WORM</b> discs, erasable optical discs, high speed laser printing, and the delivery of images over high speed telecommunications networks or by Group 4 fax, will enable {{the next generation of}} information products to be developed during the 1990 s. The ability to mix searchable text with corresponding images, held either locally or delivered online, will enable the benefits of the original printed document or product to be made available to users in an electronic format. Since images are such a key element in making the most effective use of patent information this will mean that patent information products will be amongst the first to experience this image handling revolution. This paper reviews some of the present developments in image handling, and speculates on what kinds of information tools might evolve during the decade. ...|$|R
40|$|Cyathostomins are {{the most}} common and {{important}} group of large intestine nematodes, infecting horses worldwide. The current control strategy is associated with the development of anthelmintic resistance, which has been reported worldwide. Therefore, experiments with this family of parasites have become progressively important to provide their monitoring and control strategies. The aim {{of the present study was}} to propose a faster and more economic assay for isolation of genomic DNA from the adult stage of Cyathostomin parasites than reported. Adult parasites were collected from a single horse from a farm in São José dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil, and were identified. Genomic DNA was isolated from ten individual female adult parasites using a standardized procedure developed. Then, extraction from ten individual female was carried out by another DNA extraction method. DNA concentration from both methods were measured and compared. We obtained a good DNA quality with this standardized procedure. As a result of this analysis, we propose a modified phenol-chloroform method, which will contribute to assays that require DNA <b>extraction</b> from adult <b>worms</b> for genomic DNA sequences of cyathostomin, or species-specific identification...|$|R
50|$|There is no vaccine or {{medicine}} to treat or prevent Guinea worm disease. Once a Guinea worm begins emerging, {{the first step}} is to do a controlled submersion of the affected area in a bucket of water. This causes the worm to discharge many of its larvae, making it less infectious. The water is then discarded on the ground far away from any water source. Submersion results in subjective relief of the burning sensation and makes subsequent <b>extraction</b> of the <b>worm</b> easier. To extract the worm, a person must wrap the live worm around a piece of gauze or a stick. The process can be long, taking anywhere from hours to a week. Gently massaging the area around the blister can help loosen the worm. This is nearly the same treatment that is noted in the famous ancient Egyptian medical text, the Ebers papyrus from 1550 BC. Some people have said that extracting a Guinea worm feels like the afflicted area is on fire. However, if the infection is identified before an ulcer forms, the worm can also be surgically removed by a trained doctor in a medical facility.|$|R
40|$|Background: Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a universally established modality in {{the evaluation}} and treatment of adults with suspected biliary and pancreatic disease. Experience with ERCP in children has been relatively limited especially in a developing country like Bangladesh. Objec-tive: Aim {{of this study is}} to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic yields of ERCP for biliary and pancreatic diseases in Bangladeshi children. Design and settings: This retrospective study was conducted in the departments of Gastroenterology & Hepatology of Bangabandhu Memorial Hospital and Chattagram Metropolitan Hospital, Chittagong, Bangladesh between 2004 and 2013. Patients: Seventy-three patients (14 males and 59 females) aged 1 year 7 months to 18 years with the suspi-cion of biliary or pancreatic diseases were included in this study. Interventions: Seventy-six procedures of ERCPs were performed. Main outcome measures: Common indications for ERCP and its therapeutic outcomes were assessed. Results: The most common indications were biliary ascariasis (25), choledocho-lithiasis (17), biliary dilatation of unknown cause (11), chronic pancreatitis (3), choledochal cyst (1), and Mirizzi syndrome (1). Therapeutic procedures included sphincterotomy (41), <b>worm</b> <b>extraction</b> (25), stone extraction (12), and biliary stenting (2). Adverse events were uncommon and usually minor. Conclusion: ERCP is a highly effective and safe diagnostic and therapeutic modality with highest indication for biliary ascariasis in Bangladeshi children...|$|R
40|$|SummaryFor centuries, the Guinea worm {{parasite}} (Dracunculus medinensis) {{has caused}} disabling misery, infecting people who drink stagnant water contaminated with the worm's larvae. In 2012, there were 542 cases of Guinea worm reported globally, of which 521 (96. 1 %) {{were reported in}} South Sudan. Protracted civil wars, an inadequate workforce, neglect of potable water provision programs, suboptimal Guinea worm surveillance and case containment, and fragmented health systems account {{for many of the}} structural and operational factors encumbering South Sudan's Guinea worm eradication efforts. This article reviews the impacts of six established Guinea worm control strategies in South Sudan: (1) surveillance to determine actual caseload distribution and trends in response to control measures; (2) educating community members from whom worms are emerging to avoid immersing affected parts in sources of drinking water; (3) filtering potentially contaminated drinking water using cloth filters or filtered drinking straws; (4) treating potentially contaminated surface water with the copepod larvicide temephos (Abate); (5) providing safe drinking water from boreholes or hand-dug wells; and (6) containment of transmission through voluntary isolation of each patient to prevent contamination of drinking water sources, provision of first aid, and manual <b>extraction</b> of the <b>worm.</b> Surveillance, community education, potable water provision, and case containment remain weak facets of the program. Abate pesticide is not a viable option for Guinea worm control in South Sudan. In light of current case detection and containment trends, as well as capacity building efforts for Guinea worm eradication, South Sudan is more likely to eradicate Guinea worm by 2020, rather than by 2015. The author highlights areas in which substantial improvements are required in South Sudan's Guinea worm eradication program, and suggests improvement strategies...|$|R
