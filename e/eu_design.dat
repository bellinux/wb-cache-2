It is frequently treated as synonymous with 'democracy,' yet the <b>EU's</b> <b>design</b> is such that, in theory, legitimacy in the EU derives not only from formal, democratic representation, but from norms of rationality, efficiency and bureaucracy. This paper marshals and classifies the existing and contrasting politico-legal approaches to legitimacy in the EU context {{with the aim of}} establishing a set of parameters according to which the legitimacy of the EU's institutions, and the integration process and its outcomes, can be both appraised and compared with the legitimation of politics in other political systems...|$|R

50|$|The V-Prop {{was fitted}} to the {{prototype}} Twister {{and to some}} of the Twisters built in the <b>EU.</b> <b>Designed</b> by brothers Thomas and Mattheus Strieker, this microprocessor-controlled automatic propeller has a vaned spinner ahead of the main spinner. The main spinner is fixed to the output shaft in the normal fashion; but the vaned spinner is free to contra-rotate, and in doing so both generates its own power and derives rpm data that it uses to determine the ideal blade angle. The unit then automatically adjusts the blades between the coarse and fine positions. On the ground, the electronic control system can be tailored to suit each aircraft by varying some soldered connections, which give some 16 options.|$|R
40|$|Building on {{the model}} of the {{enlargement}} policy, the European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>designed</b> the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership to further promote its norms and principles. One of the goals of its new policies has been to foster regional cooperation among partner countries and their neighbours. This article specifies the EU’s framework for promoting regional cooperation through the aforementioned policies and discusses its potential impact on the example of the South Caucasus republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. The South Caucasus has not only been an arena of intraregional conflicts, but has also often been troubled by disputes between its neighbours. This article argues that, {{due to a lack of}} proactive and consistent engagement, the EU’s framework risks leaving regional conflicts in the current state of stagnation and without advancement in regional cooperation...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} power {{asymmetry}} concept, this paper aims to qualitatively assess the goodness of fit of the final agricultural package to the Romanian objective needs and possibilities. The power asymmetry will {{be linked to the}} common agricultural setup that the <b>EU</b> <b>designed</b> for all the newcomers, Romania included, but also to the differences between Romania’s initial position paper and the final outcome of the negotiations. The goodness of fit judgment implies reference to Romania’s output and structure as well as to its experience with Community compatible measures and institutional systems. For this purpose, the paper will focus (1) on some quantitative aspects of the negotiations (levels of single area payments and of reference areas or quantities) as well as (2) on the challenging aspects deriving from the adoption of particular parts of the relevant acquis communautaire (rural development regulations and cross-compliance) ...|$|R

40|$|Since the European Union adopted uniform sui generis design rights, an {{increasingly}} complex system of cumulative and overlapping {{intellectual property rights}} has emerged.

40|$|Gas markets {{based on}} virtual hubs {{has been the}} {{preferred}} <b>EU</b> <b>design.</b> Such market designs are based on socializing network flexibility services. Nonetheless, shippers have different preferences about the network flexibility, which are not reflected in current allocation models. We propose the introduction of auction mechanisms to deal with network service allocation in the short term. The auction aims to represent simultaneously the diversity of players' preferences and the trade-offs implied by network constraints. Two sealed-bid auctions are proposed. On the one hand, an auction with one product allocates network services through the minimization of gas price differences. On the other, a multi-product (gas and line-pack storage) auction is designed to facilitate the revelation of preferences on line-pack storage...|$|E
40|$|Financial crisis {{exposed the}} bad state of European public finance. Budget deficits are so domesticated in Europe, {{that it is}} hard {{nowadays}} to encounter a budget surplus, or at least a balanced budget. Greece once again entered the history, but this time Greeks have absolutely nothing to be proud of. Financial crisis has reintroduced phenomenon known only from war periods - heavily indebted rich countries. European Union never imagined such situation could occur and threaten the existence of the Eurozone, so there was no plan B prepared. In the thesis we would like to analyze the process of finding the plan B. Hundreds of billions euro were spent on bailouts of heavily indebted Eurozone Members. Using case studies of the most affected Eurozone economies we want to decide if the Euro was the cause of the European debt crisis.

40|$|On many fronts, EU {{development}} policy is {{at a critical}} juncture. In the face of major new challenges, such as the current impasse in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and increasing concerns over security threats, the European Union is having to rethink much of its {{development policy}} both with its ‘near neighbours’ and in the South. How has the process of enlargement impacted on EU development policy? What would a ‘development-friendly’ trade policy look like?

40|$|In {{comparison}} to functionality doctrine in trade dress cases, scholars have paid relatively {{little attention to}} the role of functionality doctrine in design protection systems such as the U. S. design patent system and the EU Community Design regime. Yet functionality considerations potentially affect many validity and scope determinations in the design protection area. In this Article, we critically evaluate judicial application of the functionality doctrine in design protection systems, focusing on the U. S. design patent and <b>EU</b> <b>design</b> protection regimes. We argue that the doctrine as applied in these settings is too often aimless and inconsistent. Some simple doctrinal refinements would help, particularly in the U. S., where the Federal Circuit should definitively adopt the “dictated by” standard and should distinguish explicitly between functionality for invalidity purposes and functionality for scope purposes. Ultimately, a more carefully-considered theoretical justification for the functionality doctrine in design protection systems is needed, one that recognizes that trade dress functionality and design protection functionality serve different goals...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{examine how}} {{transnational}} tobacco companies (TTCs) tried {{to penetrate the}} Bulgarian cigarette market and influence tobacco excise tax policy {{after the fall of}} communism and during Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union (<b>EU).</b> <b>Design</b> Analysis of internal tobacco industry documents supplemented by analysis of press coverage, tobacco industry journals, market reports and key informant interviews. Results TTCs have been involved in cigarette smuggling to and through Bulgaria since at least 1975 and used smuggling as a market-entry strategy. National tobacco company Bulgartabac appears to have been involved in smuggling its own cigarettes from and reimporting them to Bulgaria. Since Bulgaria’s accession to the EU opened the market to the TTCs, TTCs have exaggerated the scale of the illicit trade to successfully convince politicians and public health experts that tax increases lead to cigarette smuggling. Yet, sources point to TTCs ’ continued complicity in cigarette smuggling to and through Bulgaria between 2000 and 2010. TTCs aimed to influence the Bulgarian tobacco excise tax regime, import duties and pricing mechanism, but appear to have been less successful than in other former communist countries in part due to the co-existence of a state-owned tobacco company. Undisclosed meetings between the tobacco industry and government ministers and officials are ongoing despite Bulgaria being a party to the Framework Convention o...|$|E

40|$|In {{the long}} run, the most {{important}} tensions between Europe and the United States may not derive from differing policies toward Russia, or China, or the Middle East. The most important issues may arise over something that is fundamental to the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s own structure and legitimacy-namely, its systematic program of eroding or reconfiguring national sovereignty. This EU posture has many practical ramifications for US policy. But it also presents a clear ideological alternative. A world more in accord with <b>EU</b> <b>designs</b> will be {{a world in which}} national sovereignty has less and less meaning. Is that the kind of world Americans want to inhabit?
