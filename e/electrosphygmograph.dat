40|$|As {{reported}} earlier (l), simulated diving experiments can be per-formed on many animals {{commonly used in}} the physiology teaching laboratory, with excellent results illustrating the diving reflex. The present report details several simulated diving ex-periments on the human, suitable for the undergraduate or graduate teaching laboratory in human or environmental physiology. In our studies, a Narco Bio-Systems Physiograph was used to Table 1 shows representative results from a recent experiment conducted in our undergraduate physiology lab. Means are plotted in Fig. 1. Heart rate falls during breath-holding and during apneic diving. M. A. P. rl’ses during breath-holding and apneic diving. The bradycardia and increased peripheral blood pressure (due to peripheral vasoconstriction) seen during the dive are the so-called “diving reflex. ” record EKG, impedance pneumogram, indirect blood pressure by electrosphygmomanometry, and peripheral pulse. To record EKG and impedance pneumogram, place self-adhering surface electrodes (with electrolyte paste in the well) two inches lateral to the nipple {{on either side of}} the chest. Place the <b>electrosphygmograph</b> cuff on the left arm, with the Korotkov sounds microphone just over the antecubital fossa. Place the photoelectric pulse transducer on a finger of the left hand. Connect each transducer to its appropriate coupler/amplifier on the physiograph. cl REST III APNEA...|$|E
