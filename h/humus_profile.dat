40|$|Humus, {{both in the}} {{chemical}} sense (soil organic matter) and in the pedological sense (humus form, <b>humus</b> <b>profile),</b> {{is known to be}} slowly built-up through the agency of microbial, faunal and non-biological oxidative processes. Varied processes put the organic matter produced by plants, microbes and animals from the state of dead organs to that of one or several soil horizons where organic matter cannot be longer identified as to its living origin, except at strong magnification (Toutain et al. 1982, Ponge 1991) or by recording biochemical signals (Disnar & Harouna 1994). All these humus-forming processes are time-consuming, but the scale at which they operate may vary from seconds to months and even years if not centuries and millenaries. Given that each <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> is submitted to environmental influences, any periodical process in its immediate environment will be reflected in the state of change of soil organic matter. The subject of the present paper is to portrait briefly the cycle of change of humus and to discern stable and changing environmental influences. First, let us imagine what happens during a day-night (circadian) cycle in a forest mull. During the night, sme of the decaying leaves still staying on the forest floor have been buried by anecic earthworms in underlying mineral horizons, where they will be submitted t...|$|E

The present document describes the components of a moder <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> under Scots pine, as they can be observed under a dissecting and a light microscope. Plant litter debris, roots and animal feces were collected over a small area (5 x 5 cm) in order to be sectioned and stained. All animals and microbes (fungi, bacteria, micro-algae) collected within a small area of litter (5 x 5 cm) were identified to the finest possible taxonomic level. Gut contents were analyzed and compared with the composition of the immediate environment in order to have the most reliable view of trophic relationships between plants, animals and microbes living in the same restricted environment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA non-random {{sampling}} design allowed to distinguish within a virgin beech ecosystem two main components of <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> heterogeneity. The stratification of the profile into horizons reflects {{changes in the}} composition of the soil/litter matrix occurring {{under the influence of the}} anisotropic deposition of leaf and wood litter and the stratified occurrence of soil organisms (roots, microbes, animals). The horizontal heterogeneity is mainly influenced by changes in vegetation, in particular the decreasing influence of beech (and the increasing influence of ground vegetation) when passing from the tree trunk base, where the influence of the tree reaches a maximum, to the centre of adjacent gaps where the influence of beech is replaced by that of another vegetation. The use of multivariate methods, used for description rather than for modelling, is suggested to be the best procedure for understanding patterns underlying heterogeneity without a priori assumptions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{our study}} was to {{describe}} succession related changes in <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> on moderate slopes of a tropical inselberg (Nouragues, French Guiana). Nine <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> were collected in a stratified manner under two main communities on well-drained sites: carpets of Pitcairnia geyskesii (Bromeliaceae) and shrub thickets of Clusia minor (Clusiaceae), the latter including two stages of its dynamic development. The 53 sampled layers were analysed by an optical method, the volume ratio of 109 classes of litter/humus components being quantified by a count point method. Correspondence analysis (CA) revealed marked differences among humus forms. Pitcairnia carpets were characterized by the dominance of cyanobacteria which formed crusts with low faunal activity, except when they were colonized by enchytraeid worms. With advancing succession, we observed that leaf litter did not accumulate but rather was incorporated into organo-mineral excrements of macro-invertebrates under C minor. The late developmental stage of Clusia thickets, characterised by the establishment of Myrcia saxatilis (Myrtaceae), showed {{a thick layer of}} undecayed litter and near absence of organo-mineral aggregates. The humus form varied from mor in cyano-bacterial crusts to tropical moder (with a few mull features) in Clusia thickets, but comparisons among <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> revealed more complex successional processes than expected {{on the basis of the}} composition of plant and soil animal communities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe common {{development}} of vegetation and soil {{is a central}} issue in plant succession. We hypothesized that areas of woody vegetation decay and accumulation on the ground (zones of destruction or 'micro-chablis') {{played a role in}} the successional {{development of}} vegetation patches on tropical inselbergs and that disturbance events could be inferred from the analysis of the organic matter accumulated along a successional gradient. The study was conducted in French Guiana (South America). Nine <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> (each comprised of a varying number of layers) were selected in shrub thickets (similar to 1 acre each) representative of three vegetation types of the rock savanna: canopies of pure Clusia minor (Clusiaceae), C. minor in mixture with Myrcia saxatilis (Myrtaceae) and zones of destruction. Using a dissecting microscope, a count point optical method for small soil volumes was employed to measure the volume ratio of each kind of humus component (107 categories) in the 62 layers sampled. Micro-morphotogicat data were analysed by correspondence analysis (CA). <b>Humus</b> <b>profiles</b> varied with canopy tree type and revealed traits of past as well. as trends for future plant succession. The lack of OL and OF horizons, and the presence of charred material differentiated the zones of destruction from other <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> and confirms the impact of spatially limited fires or lightning strikes in the cyclic development of vegetation patches...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCommonly {{reported}} {{effects of}} pine on topsoil include acidification, {{a decrease in}} biological activity, and an accumulation of surface organic matter. Such effects have not been documented for Mediterranean woodland and scrubland areas. This research evaluated <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> beneath pine and adjacent vegetation {{on the basis of}} previous knowledge on soil animal communities and vegetation. Two Mediterranean sites with aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis P. Mill.) and scrubland vegetation were compared, one in Spain (Navarre), the other in Italy (Sicily), <b>Humus</b> <b>profiles</b> were sampled under main vegetation types, comprising aleppo pine, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L,), and bare ground in both sites, along transects with increasing pine influence. Quantitative morphological methods were used to analyze and compare <b>humus</b> <b>profiles,</b> and data were analyzed using correspondence analysis. In both sites the influence of aleppo pine on humus forms was well-defined but minor, increasing the appearance of an Oe horizon characterized by intense activity of litter-dwelling fauna and fungi, Under all vegetation types, and in both sites, the organomineral A horizon was of the mull type, although the composition of the soil-building fauna varied between Navarre and Sicily, There was more heterogeneity among vegetation types in Navarre, where aleppo pine was planted on derelict land, than in Sicily where aleppo pine was a component of natural vegetation (maquis). A decreasing influence of pine was perceptible in the inner edge of the pine plantation in Navarre, or under the crown of individual trees in Sicily...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the profile- genetic {{approach}} {{in the study of the}} humus matters in the high-mountainous ecosystems of the Western Andes, some peculiarities were established of today's stage of the humus formation in the soils in this scantily studied region of Azuay. These studies characterise the humus nature of the soils on the transect (the profile line) between 2, 190 and 4, 150 m a. s. l. in the valley of the Tomebamba river (Southern Ecuador). Through accounting the changes in the indices of the humus condition of the soils (degree of humification; qualitative composition of the humus or type humus - Cha:Cfa; nitrogen contents; free or connected with Ca humic acids; unextractable organic carbon; optic density of the humic acids) and through the extended possibilities of the applied scientific approach, the ecological and genetic significance were established of the self humus profiles of the investigated Leptosols, Cambisols and Histosols. The obtained data show that the basic characteristics of the humus nature of the soils from the ecosystems with different vegetation character do not exceed the limits of the zonal <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> and express the integral action of the soil formation factors...|$|E
40|$|Two {{examples}} are given of strong {{relationships between the}} activity of soil animals {{and the development of}} humus forms in a mountain spruce forest and a lowland Scots pine stand. Both were based on field distributions of fauna and humus components. The vertical heterogeneity of soil animal communities in a moder <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> under Scots pine is related to successional processes occurring during litter decomposition. Accumulation of faecal pellets by litter-dwelling animals influences in turn the development of the root system of pine and associated ectomycorrhizal fungi. The heterogeneity of humus forms in a mountain spruce forest is related to the developmental phases of spruce stands. Typical earthworm mull humus forms are restricted to regeneration sites with a low herbaceous vegetation. Typical moder humus forms with a thick OH horizon (dysmoder) are restricted to the pole phase of spruce stands. Between these two stages of the forest successional cycle, intermediary humus forms are found. They correspond to changes in soil animal communities, mostly burrowing earthworms, occurring together with changes in vegetation. These observations are discussed in terms of feed-back loops involving humus forms, soil animal and plant communities...|$|E
40|$|Soil humus {{substances}} {{are considered}} as a multicomponent system of amphiphilic (exhibiting both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties) substances. Hydrophilic components of humus substances ensure the eluvial and eluvial—illuvial differentiation of the soil profile; hydrophobic components {{are responsible for the}} accumulative type of <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> and the water stability of soil aggregates. Possible mechanisms for the formation of hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties of humus substances and its role in stable aggregates formation are discussed. The suitability of mathematical equations has been considered for the description of the decomposition dynamics of the soil aggregates in time, the selection of the best model, and the statistical analysis of the parameters of the corresponding models. The quantitative analysis of the interrelations between the parameters characterizing the water stability and the characteristics of the soil organic matter has revealed a unimodal relationship between the parameter responsible for the water stability of the aggregates and the content of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic components for the studied typical chenozem (Voronic Chernozems Pachic, WRB, 2006 or Haplic Chernozems, FAO, 1988) (Orenburg oblast). The optimal relation between hydrophobic and hydrophilic components for high aggregates water stability of typucal chernozem is about 60 % of hydrophilic and 40 % of hydrophobic components in the composition of soil organic matter...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMultivariate {{methods have}} been widely used for {{revealing}} the structures of communities, and in this paper we explore one particular method, namely correspondence analysis (also called reciprocal averaging), for studying <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> by the 'method of small volumes'. The present study was done on <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> under holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia), an evergreen Mediterranean species, in the High Atlas of Morocco. Three sites (1500 m, 1700 m, 1900 m altitude) and 2 years (1999 and 2002) were compared. The humus form is Dysmull (mull with thick litter horizons), with variations in the thickness of the OL (entire leaves), OF (fragmented leaves with faecal pellets) and A (hemorganic) horizons according to altitude and year. The dead leaves are rapidly incorporated into holorganic (earthworm, insect) and hemorganic (enchytraeid) animal faeces, which form the bulk of the OF and A horizons. The S horizon (weathering parent rock) shows the greatest development of the root system. As altitude increases more fresh litter (OL) or more humified organic matter (OF, A) is accumulated. Variation from year to year is depicted by opposite differences in the amount of entire oak leaves and of dead roots. Humus components (classes) are used as active (main) variables, after standardization of their means and variances. The addition of numerous passive (additional) variables, standardized {{in the same way as}} active variables, enabled us to understand the influence of biological and climatic effects on the composition of <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> and soil trophic networks...|$|R

40|$|Smelters in {{northern}} France are a serious source of soil pollution by heavy metals. We have studied a poplar plantation downwind {{of an active}} zinc smelter. Three <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> were sampled at increasing distance from the smelter, and the thickness of topsoil horizons was measured along a transect.

Near the smelter, poplar trees are stunted or dead and the humus form is a mor, with a well-developed holorganic OM horizon. Here faunal activity is inhibited, so there is little faecal deposition and humification of plant litter. At the distant site poplar grows well and faunal activity is intense, so there are skeletonized leaves and many organo-mineral earthworm and millipede faecal pellets.

40|$|There are {{changes in}} almost all the {{properties}} of chernozems under locally overmoistening. In general, changes in the properties and conditions of chernozems under the development of local wetlands went in a particular way, regardless of the peculiarities of soil formation factors and causes waterlogging. The most noticeable change is the transformation of physical properties of soil and organic matter status. According to our research, more quickly and clearly excessive moisture causes {{a change in the}} physical properties of the soil. There are changes of the structural state, bulk density and amount of water-stable aggregates. The significant change is the transformation of soil organic matter. There is increasing of total humus content. In a group composition, the fraction of humic and fulvic acids increases the share. The <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> is stretched. In the majority of cases in investigated soils was diagnosed secondary salinization. The periodic waterlogging of the soil also contributes to the change in the amount of soil carbonates and their distribution in the profile. Chernozems gradually lose calcium, the main structurant and humates maker. Among the most studied soil of Zernogradsky region in the cationic part of the prevailing spot goes sodium. In addition, the narrowing ratio of calcium to magnesium was observed. That is the hallmark of the aqueous extract of locally overmoistening soil...|$|E
40|$|Sulphate (SO 42 -) {{reduction}} {{rates are}} generally low in freshwater wetlands and are {{regulated by the}} scarce availability of the ion. Increased concentrations of this electron acceptor due to sulphur (S) pollution of groundwater and surface water may, however, lead to high sulphate reduction rates now regulated by the availability of appropriate electron donors. Due to variations in this availability, the response to S pollution (e. g. from surface water or groundwater) is expected to differ between soils. This hypothesis was tested in laboratory mesocosm experiments by comparing two wetland soil types with distinctly different humus profiles: a Hydromoder and a Rhizomull type. In the first type, {{expected to have a}} higher availability of degradable soilorganic matter (SOM), sulphate availability appeared to be rate limiting for sulphate reduction. In the Rhizomull soils, in contrast, the electron acceptor did not limit sulphate reduction rates at higher concentrations. These differences in response could not, however, be attributed to differences in the various SOM fractions or in SOM densities. Eutrophication and free sulphide accumulation, two major biogeochemical problems caused by sulphate pollution, occurred in both types. The absolute extent of phosphorus mobilisation was determined by the concentration of this element in the soil (C/P ratio), while the level of sulphide accumulation was governed by the concentration of dissolved iron in the pore water. It was therefore concluded that neither the <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> nor the concentrations of different SOM fractions in the soils are reliable indicators for the sensitivity of wetland types to S pollution...|$|E

The aboveground plant community was recorded in small patches corresponding to contrasting microhabitats. Animal communities and humus layers were sampled within the same patches. The relationships between <b>humus</b> <b>profile,</b> faunistic and floristic compositional gradients were investigated by Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and, {{for the first time}} in ecology, a Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis (HMFA) was used to interpret differences among humus layers. The analysis revealed a pattern with three main groups of microhabitats. The thorough study of separate humus layers could explain this result. The interplay of plant-animal-soil interactions is likely to drive the ecosystem toward three alternative states supporting humus traditional classification between mull-mor-moder. HMFA revealed the importance of depth to explain this contrast among humus forms, using humus layers as diagnostic tools in both inert and living components. HMFA also showed contrast between unexploited and exploited parts of the forest, but the study of soil and vegetation indicate that this contrast does not only hold in forest management but also in geomorphology. RV-coefficients among the six groups of variables showed significant fauna-fauna relationships in almost all humus layers except Actinedida. Plant-soil interactions are not as strong as expected and are even weaker when the soil in question is deep. In addition, HMFA failed to show direct interactions between plant and soil fauna but, paradoxically, HMFA does suggest that indirect plant-fauna interactions are at the focus of the ecosystem strategy that leads to the differentiation of ecological niches within the forest mosaic...|$|E

40|$|Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) -feathermoss {{forests are}} a common subtype of the {{northern}} boreal forests. These forests are associated with large accumulations of mor humus, which is regarded as {{an important source of}} nutrients, contributor to soil structure, moisture retention and vital to the long-term sustainability of these forests. Harvesting with protection of advance regeneration (CPRS) is currently used in northwestern Quebec as the method for sustainable management, which reduces soil compaction and protects advance regeneration, and genetic diversity. We examined the effects of CPRS on organic matter and advance regeneration 6 years after harvesting. During the summer of 2002, a humus classification based on observable field characteristics was developed and applied to six CPRS sites in the northern Abitibi claybelt region of Quebec. At each site 75 humus profiles were surveyed and classified by order and thickness of horizons present. Humus horizons were easily observed using morphological features, and master horizon classes were distinguished by their nutritional and biochemical attributes with differences occurring {{as a result of the}} natural process of decomposition. Individual humus horizon and total profile thickness was the variable that most affected profile nutrient mass. High forest floor disturbance was associated with shallow profile depth, resulting in low <b>humus</b> <b>profile</b> nutrient mass and low density advance regeneration. Lower forest floor disturbance resulted in deeper profiles associated with higher available nutrients in humus profiles and higher density of advance regeneration.

Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) was the dominant tree species, with several developmental phases forming the forest patchwork. Sessile oak [Quercus petraea (Mattus.) Liebl. ] was present but only as old relictual individuals. Gaps in the canopy cover were abundant, mostly caused by wind storms 2 years previously. The next most recent storm was 25 years before, resulting in distinct patches of full-grown trees. <b>Humus</b> <b>profiles</b> were classified and compared with the distribution of earthworm communities, canopy cover, and soil types. Geomorphology {{was responsible for the}} main part of the observed variation. Absence of lime in the substrate and direct contact with a sandstone stratum near the ground surface was associated with the absence of earthworms and the appearance of an OH horizon (moder humus). Elsewhere, earthworms were present and <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> did not display any OH horizon (mull or mull-like moder humus), but species composition was variable and strongly influenced by the thickness of the superficial sand deposit overlying limestone. On a thick (1 m or more) sandy substrate earthworm communities were dominated by epigeic species together with the anecic Lumbricus terrestris L. The species richness was higher on a shallower sandy substrate (50 cm) where lime was more accessible to tree roots and burrowing animals. The influence of the forest cycle of beech was visible in the latter case (covering most of the area), with an increase in the thickness of the OL and OF horizons and a decrease in endogeic earthworm populations during the phase of intense growth of beech. This fall in burrowing activity was apparent in gaps created by wind storms and fungal diseases within mature stands as early as 2 years after the fall of the trees...|$|R

The community structure was evaluated in terms of both fungal species and their ability to explore soil (exploration types). From the 128 <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> sampled over the two study periods, 31 ECM species were recorded.

Taking examples in shifts observed in plant communities following gap opening, the authors show that, as Oldeman viewed it, tree-fall gaps {{seem to be the}} driving force in sylvigenesis as well as a source of spatial biodiversity. Studies carried out on macromorphological features of <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> and on the behaviour of soil invertebrate communities (Lumbricidae and Nematoda) pointed out two key aspects of forest functioning. First, the renewal of the forest ecosystem is linked to the dynamics of humus forms and of soil animal functional groups, featuring the regeneration of trees. Second, tree-fall gaps are places where the forest ecosystem is destabilized and thereafter may renew itself or on the contrary may evolve towards another ecosystem, showing either a co-adaptation between the sylvigenetic and the edaphic cycle, or a discordance between these two cycles. These two aspects (co-adaptation and discordance), important {{from the point of view}} of fundamental ecology and forest management, suggest a need for further field research...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{statistical analysis of}} the basic chemical characteristics of dystric cambisol, its depth and clay content in Posavsko forest economic district. The aim was to define the influence of pedogenetic factors (primarily parent rock) {{on the characteristics of}} dystric cambisols, using statistical analysis. The analysis was based on the data from the Interpreter of Soil and Typological Maps of Posavsko forest economic district. 35 soil profiles were analyzed. A and (B) horizons were analyzed separately, then compared with each other in terms of similarities and differences. Variability is greater in the A horizon. The values of variability, analysis of variance, linear and multiple regression, correlation and cluster analysis were determined. Three main subtypes were defined {{based on the results of}} chemical characteristics, depth, and clay content, namely: leached (4 <b>profiles),</b> <b>humus</b> (1 <b>profile)</b> and typical (30 profiles). The results show that the properties of this soil type are significantly influenced by the character of parent material...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHumus {{profiles}} were sampled {{along an}} altitudinal gradient in the Macot-La-Plagne Forest (France, northern Alps) to investigate variation occurring under carpets of Vaccinium myrtillus present within Picea abies forests. The vertical distribution of subterranean organs of V. myrtillus was compared with (1) that of P. abies roots and other accompanying vegetation and (2) other components of <b>humus</b> <b>profiles,</b> in particular humified organic matter mainly consisting of animal faeces. It was shown that V. myrtillus roots were mostly concentrated in mineral horizons, while P. abies roots and V. myrtillus rhizomes occupied litter horizons. This was interpreted {{in terms of}} competition for nutrient capture between P. abies and V. myrtillus. The effects of altitude were (1) {{a change in the}} vegetation accompanying V. myrtillus in dense V. myrtillus carpets, bryophytes at the montane level being replaced by forbs at the sub-alpine level and (2) a decrease in the thickness of ecto-organic horizons. This was interpreted as a shift from a moder system characterized by recalcitrant litter (moss) processed by an active faunal community (stabilized in the form of animal faeces) to a mor system characterized by low animal abundance but with litter of better quality which is easily leached in the absence of prominent faunal activity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhether the {{structure}} of Oa and A horizons varies according to animal activity is still a matter of conjecture, especially in amphi, a humus form with mixed features of mull and moder, which has been described in environments with strong seasonal contrasts. The Oa and A horizons of spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ] coniferous forests of the Province of Trento (Italy) were sampled in six sites {{with a total of}} 134 <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> along transect lines, embracing the variety of parent rocks, climate, and vegetation conditions that prevail at the upper montane level in this region. The distribution of humus components (plant debris, roots, animal feces, minerals) was assessed by an optical method and analyzed with correspondence analysis (CA). Moder humus forms were characterized by enchytraeid activity, with concomitant deposition of organic and mineral-organic feces in Oa and A horizons, respectively. Conversely, amphis were characterized. by the concomitant deposition of organic and mineral-organic earthworm feces in Oa and A horizons, respectively. We conclude that Oa and A horizons of moders and amphis differed only quantitatively in the content of mineral matter in animal feces. The fine-grained mineral-organic structure that is mostly found in the A horizon of amphis results from. the alimentary activity of small epigeic earthworms that mix organic matter with mineral matter, like anecic earthworms do in mulls...|$|R
40|$|In a {{spruce forest}} of the Autonomous Province of Trento, located on an acid {{substrate}} {{and with a}} north exposition, within the Village of Pellizzano, a transect has been traced; along this transect 19 <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> have been examined, one at every three meters. For each of them, OH and A horizons (respectively the humic organic and the organo-mineral horizon) have been sampled and studied following the methodology formulated by Ponge (1984) and Bernier et al.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experiment}} was designed at a mountain site {{to study the}} distribution of adult Lumbricus terrestris {{in relation to a}} small-scale mosaic of humus forms representative of different stages of a spruce forest ecosystem. Good agreement was found between distribution in the mosaic and that in the field. ANOVA tests demonstrated the strong influence of humus form on earthworm abundance when comparing a vermimull (high earthworm burrowing activity) taken from a spruce regeneration site (61. 8 individuals m- 2) with a leptomoder (no earthworm burrowing activity) taken from a 60 -year-old spruce stand (6. 2 individuals m- 2). Other humus forms were intermediate (mean density 34. 6 individuals m- 2). The same pattern was found with individual biomass, but with lower significance. Main differences observed in the experimental design were attributed to the immediate carrying density of the humus forms. A distinction was made between <b>humus</b> <b>profiles</b> built up with or without spruce cover. In the latter case (regeneration site and bilberry heath), the immediate carrying capacity indicated by the experimental approach overestimated the field density by a factor of 4. Under spruce this overestimate was even higher (approximately 10 times too high in an adult spruce stand (160 years old) and 30 times too high under moss cover). The increase in density due to experimental conditions was not determined for leptomoder humus accumulated under the actively growing spruce stand (160 years old) since the earthworm density was near zero in both cases. Relationships between humus form and earthworm populations are discussed...|$|R
