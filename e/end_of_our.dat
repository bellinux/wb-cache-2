25|$|Finally, we {{actually}} don't need uDummy because it's there {{just to put}} all unmatched vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That we can do as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which is the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.|$|E

500|$|In 1909, after Heinze {{abandoned}} his properties in Basin, the Butte and Superior Mining Company used buildings and machinery {{at the site}} of the Basin Reduction Works to treat zinc ore by a new process called froth flotation. Sued for patent infringement, the company shut down its Basin plant in 1912. Max Atwater, a mining engineer who had worked for Butte and Superior, obtained a license for the process and ran a smaller zinc-extraction plant in Basin from 1914 through 1918. His wife, Mary Meigs Atwater, described Basin as [...] "a mining camp, subject to recurring periods of [...] boom and bust... A tiny telephone office and a drugstore died with the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> era of boom... Just above the town were the headframe of our mine, and the old mill, and the never-quite-finished skeleton of a projected smelter." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, after {{finishing}} the world tour {{in support of}} their sixth studio album Hail to the Thief (2003), Radiohead went on hiatus. As Hail to the Thief was the last album released on Radiohead's six-album contract with EMI, the band had no contractual obligation to release new material. Drummer Philip Selway said: [...] "It was definitely {{time to take a}} break. There was still a desire amongst us to make music, but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected. And we’d come to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> contract, which gives you a natural point to look back over at what you've achieved as a band." [...] Singer and songwriter Thom Yorke worked on his first solo album, The Eraser (2006), and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood composed his first soundtracks, for Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007).|$|E

"I {{have spoken}} to Mr. Ames about it," [...] said Dr. Tolbridge to Miss Panney, as two days later they were sitting {{together}} in his office, [...] "and we are both agreed that teachers in Thorbury are like the vines on the gable <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> church; they are needed there, {{but they do not}} flourish.

500|$|In November 1943, when German-installed Latvian {{authorities}} {{threatened to}} resign over conscription, Berger suggested they {{be sent to}} a concentration camp. By the end of 1943, the former [...] "national legions" [...] had been significantly expanded. The Dutch regiment of SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland was used to form an independent SS-Panzergrenadierbrigade Nederland, and a revamped Flemish contingent was assembled into the SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Langemarck. The Wehrmacht also gave up its French volunteer regiment and the Wallonian Legion, which became the SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade France and SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Wallonien. By {{the end of the}} war, all of these formations had been given divisional status in the Waffen-SS, {{despite the fact that they}} never grew to more than brigade strength. In relation to these recruits, Berger cynically observed, [...] "For every foreign-born soldier who dies, no German mother weeps". By August 1943, the crisis in the [...] "Germanic" [...] project was obvious, with Berger observing that [...] "we have come to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> tether in the Germanic countries".|$|E

[...] "Anybody can be forgiven for being scared in the night, I think, if they see things they don't understand. We've broken out <b>of</b> <b>our</b> pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty of us, just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at home in Australia till we were scared to death <b>of</b> the loose <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> head-ropes." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} reflectivity of Saturn's rings between 0. 36 and 1. 06 microns {{is derived}} from observations of the combined light of the Saturn system and the previously determined spectrum of the disk of Saturn.

2500|$|Green {{announced}} that she intended to retire as {{chief executive of the}} organisation in 2009, saying: [...] "I will be 60 at [...] and I have always intended to retire when I reached that milestone.

2500|$|Eliade even {{suggests}} that traditional thought offers {{relief from the}} vague anxiety caused by [...] "our obscure presentiment {{of the end of}} the world, or more exactly of the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> world, our own civilization". Many traditional cultures have myths about the end of their world or civilization; however, these myths do not succeed [...] "in paralysing either Life or Culture". These traditional cultures emphasize cyclic time and, therefore, the inevitable rise of a new world or civilization on the ruins of the old. Thus, they feel comforted even in contemplating the end times.|$|E
2500|$|The song Goodbye Tiger {{came about}} after Clapton {{met up with}} a bunch of people who were in Sydney for the day Hunter S. Thompson hit town. [...] Clapton got drunk and the {{drinking}} binge continued as he got on a flight to Germany before crashing out at a friends' place in Berlin. [...] After all this, the song Goodbye Tiger was born. [...] Clapton said {{it was the only time}} he'd ever written a song and not gone back to change something.

6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] The {{examiner}} {{pushed the}} signed blue slip {{across the table}} to me, and rose from his chair. Somehow this seemed a very abrupt <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> relations, and I felt almost sorry to part from that excellent man, who was master of a ship before the whisper of the sea had reached my cradle. He offered me his hand and wished me well. He even made a few steps toward the door with me, and ended with good-natured advice.|$|R
2500|$|We {{were at the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{recording}} {{contract with}} Century Media, and basically they didn't know {{if we were going}} to re-sign with them, so they gave us a very small budget for our last album to work with. That was about $20,000 which is a nothing deal to do a record. What we needed to do at the time was to find a producer that was immediately available to make a record with such a small budget, and that guy was Kelly Gray (laughs). Unfortunately, he was just not the right guy to do this album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their second album, You Lucky People, {{was issued}} on 15 November 1990, which was {{produced}} by Hawk Wolinski and Daddy-O.

Walker felt the album was [...] "more subtle and rounded" [...] showcasing their [...] "blend of thumping bass, strong vocals, blues harmonica and, of course multitudinous drummers".|$|E
2500|$|Mike Rose, {{reviewer}} for Strategy Informer, lauded the split-screen multiplayer, but {{noted that}} the online play needed adjustment. [...] He gave some examples of his online experience; [...] "if a player leaves partway through a race, they are not penalised, and you don't gain the experience points [...] only one other player stuck around until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> race - and that's only because they won!" [...] Reviewer Bryce Zubriski of GamesRadar felt that the game's Mega Quest was short in length, but gave high remarks towards the developer's decision to provide various event types {{and to provide a}} [...] "high energy level" [...] during gameplay to keep players interested.|$|E

60|$|After {{an hour or}} two of valiant {{achievement}} with {{knife and}} fork came the dessert; and at the point of the festival where finger-glasses are usually introduced, a large silver basin was carried round to the guests, containing rose-water, into which we dipped the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> napkins and were conscious of a delightful fragrance, instead of that heavy and weary odor, the hateful ghost of a defunct dinner.

I would hang little models of spaceships for these little movies I made with a Super 8 camera." [...] He was an artistic prodigy and displayed his very detailed drawings at art shows.
