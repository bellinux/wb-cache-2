It is presently authorised for use with chickens for fattening at a minimum dose of 1 x 107 CFU/kg of complete feedingstuffs. The applicant is now seeking authorisation for use with chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, <b>guinea</b> fowl, <b>pigeons,</b> geese for fattening and ostriches. B. subtilis is a species that is considered by EFSA to be suitable for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment. The sensitivity to antibiotics {{and the absence of}} toxigenic potential qualified the strain for QPS status. On this basis the product can be presumed safe for chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, <b>guinea</b> fowl, <b>pigeons,</b> geese for fattening, and ostriches, for consumers of products derived from thes...|$|R

40|$|Initial {{velocities}} of energy-dependent Ca++ uptake {{were measured}} by stopped-flow and dual-wavelength techniques in mitochondria isolated from hearts of rats, <b>guinea</b> pigs, squirrels, <b>pigeons,</b> and frogs. The rate of Ca++ uptake by rat heart mitochondria was 0. 05 nmol/mg/s at 5 µM Ca++ and increased sigmoidally to 8 nmol/mg/s at 200 µM Ca++. A Hill {{plot of the}} data yields a straight line with slope n of 2, indicating a cooperativity for Ca++ transport in cardiac mitochondria. Comparable rates of Ca++ uptake and sigmoidal plots were obtained with mitochondria from other mammalian hearts. On the other hand, the rates of Ca++ uptake by frog heart mitochondria were higher at any Ca++ concentrations. The half-maximal rate of Ca++ transport was observed at 30, 60, 72, 87, 92 µM Ca++ for cardiac mitochondria from frog, squirrel, <b>pigeon,</b> <b>guinea</b> pig, and rat, respectively. The sigmoidicity and the high apparent Km render mitochondrial Ca++ uptake slow below 10 µM. At these concentrations the rate of Ca++ uptake by cardiac mitochondria in vitro {{and the amount of}} mitochondria present in the heart are not consistent with the amount of Ca++ to be sequestered in vivo during heart relaxation. Therefore, it appears that, at least in mammalian hearts, the energy-linked transport of Ca++ by mitochondria is inadequate for regulating the beat-to-beat Ca++ cycle. The results obtained and the proposed cooperativity for mitochondrial Ca++ uptake are discussed in terms of physiological regulation of intracellular Ca++ homeostasis in cardiac cells...|$|R

Magnitude of mean head deviation was significantly different between perstimulus and poststimulus periods. 2) Head nystagmus associated with eye nystagmus was consistently observed in seven of nine squirrel monkeys during optokinetic stimulation. Squirrel monkeys are thereby less prone to display head nystagmus than either <b>guinea</b> pigs, <b>pigeons</b> or chickens. 3) Slow phase speeds of coupled head and eye nystagmus were subjected to statistical analysis. A highly significant negative correlation was found between slow phase head and eye speeds. The correlation coefficient was - 0. 81 at 60 degrees / sec stimulus (n = 119) and - 0. 72 at 100 degrees / sec stimulus (n = 131).

40|$|In {{confirmation}} of Shirai's observation, {{we find that}} transplantable mouse tumors grow actively when inoculated into the brains of rats, <b>guinea</b> pigs, and <b>pigeons,</b> whereas subcutaneous or intramuscular grafts in the same animals fail. This growth of foreign tissue in the brain, however, takes place only when the grafted material lies entirely in the brain tissue; if it comes {{in contact with the}} ventricle a cellular reaction takes place with resultant destruction of the graft.

Mice highly immune to subcutaneous transplants of mouse cancer show no resistance to such tumors when the inoculation is made into the brain. Although the brain is without obvious power of resistance to implants of transplantable heteroplastic mouse tumors, yet grafts of spontaneous tumors fail to grow there even, as a rule, when tumor implanted and animal host are of the same species...|$|R
40|$|The pH {{dependence}} of the kinetics of the binding of cyanide ion to methemoglobins A and S and to <b>guinea</b> pig and <b>pigeon</b> methemoglobins appears to be not directly correlated with the net charges on the proteins.

Kinetic second order rate constants have also been determined for the binding of cyanide ion by the four sets of methemoglobin species present in solution. The pKi values and the rate constants of methemoglobin S are strikingly different from those of methemoglobin A. This result is explained in terms of different electrostatic contributions to the free energy of heme linkage arising from differences in the environments of ionizable groups at the surfaces of the two molecules...|$|R

40|$|When azide ion {{reacts with}} methemoglobin in {{unbuffered}} solution the pH {{of the solution}} increases. This phenomenon is associated with increases in the pK values of heme-linked ionizable groups on the protein which give rise to an uptake of protons from solution. We have determined {{as a function of}} pH the proton uptake, Ah', on azide binding to methemoglobin at 20 °C. Data for methemoglobins A (human), <b>guinea</b> pig and <b>pigeon</b> are fitted to a theoretical expression based on the electrostatic effect of three sets of heme-linked ionizable groups on the binding of the ligand. From these fits the pK values of heme-linked ionizable groups are obtained for liganded and unliganded methemoglobins. In unliganded methemoglobin pK 1, which is associated with carboxylic acid groups, ranges between 4. 0 and 5. 5 for the three methemoglobins; pK,, which is associated with histidines and terminal amino groups, ranges from 6. 2 to 6. 7. In liganded methemoglobin pK 1 lies between 5. 8 and 6. 3 and pK, varies from 8. 1 to 8. 5.

40|$|Micro livestock  {{appears to}} be the most {{sustainable}} means of producing high quality animal protein for the expanding populations of the lesser developing countries. Diversification in animal agriculture through inclusion of non-conventional livestock such as micro livestock species (goat, sheep, poultry, rabbits, <b>guinea</b> pigs, <b>pigeon,</b> ducks, snails, grasscutter etc) provide options that would guarantee fully participation of women in livestock production to alleviate rural households protein shortage or deficiencies. The micro livestock   are likely to become increasingly important source of animal protein as a result of rapid increase in human population and in the light of dwindling land sizes and natural resources in general. This is on the backdrop that micro livestock have  diverse economic and social functions in rural communities, and different types of micro livestock have been associated with women due to their  significant potential for alleviating malnutrition and food insecurity. Therefore, supporting micro livestock should be considered as a means to empower women in  rural development which has the capacity to improve household nutrition and food security.   This discussion looks at the opportunities of empowering women through micro livestock as a mean of alleviating poverty and  solving the food insecurity challenges in rural communities. The challenges which women might face in engaging in micro livestock are also highlighted. The basis of micro livestock farming may be taken from the perspective of animal products supply being outpaced with the increased human population in Africa. In this case, alternative sources of animal protein such as micro livestock need to be promoted, and if not, livestock products will be  {{beyond the reach of the}} majority of the ordinary persons.   The space for classic livestock rearing have decreased, and this scenario will suit the keeping of smaller animals which are prolific and easy to manage. This warrant serious consideration of micro livestock  farming as one of the major  component of the livestock production systems where women can be empowered in rural areas. Micro livestock  farming has greater opportunities  in improving livelihoods among the rural poor households, provided that productivity is enhanced and appropriate input and services can be availed. Gender sensitive  programs that promote micro livestock farming contribution to optimization of  animal product supply and enhance food security on sustainable basis are recommended. In most cases livestock professionals such as veterinarians and animal scientists often do not have the necessary familiarity and competence with gender analysis and participatory skills to implement a gender balanced assessment or response in livestock production issues. </p...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} emphasis on understanding the breeding biology of domestic fowl, turkeys and duck {{but not of}} the other commercially significant species, such as ratites, gamebirds, <b>guinea</b> fowl and <b>pigeons.</b> In general, our understanding of breeding in these species is poor relative to that of commercial poultry. The only exception is the ostrich, {{which has been the}} subject of numerous studies of breeding behaviour, fertility and incubation, both in the wild and in captivity. Other ratite species have received less attention. Despite the economic importance of gamebirds in Europe and North America, especially pheasant and partridge, studies on reproduction in these species are mainly limited to a few investigations into factors affecting fertility. Improving our understanding of guinea fowl breeding would greatly assist in maximizing production in its native Africa. Of the species described in this chapter, the pigeon is of note because its pattern of reproduction is reliant on long-term pairing of birds and their role in the rearing of the altricial offspring. The paucity of information made it difficult to derive general trends between species in their reproductive biology. However, it was clear that to maximize productivity many of these species of birds needed to be kept as pairs or at least in small groups. This contrasts with industrial poultry production, where group sizes are typically in the thousands. Another aspect of the breeding biology of these minor species is a general lack of breeding technology, e. g. artificial insemination, in egg production. There {{is considerable}} scope for further research into these species, which will yield information of both scientific and commercial interest...|$|R
40|$|Five {{cultures}} of Bacillus welchii {{have been studied}} and compared Four came from infected wounds in the western theatre of war, and one was obtained from a personal article of clothing. Each culture possesses the essential characteristics ascribed to that group of bacteria. The infectious processes caused by the five cultures in rabbits, <b>guinea</b> pigs, and <b>pigeons,</b> are local in character; and very few or no bacilli enter or {{are found in the}} general blood stream during life or immediately after death. Glucose broth cultures, injected intravenously, are fatal to rabbits. Death occurs, almost immediately or after a few hours. Agglutinative bacterial emboli have been ruled out as the cause of death, as has been an acid intoxication. The fluid part of the culture acts {{in the same manner as}} the full culture and irrespective of neutralization with sodium hydroxide. The full cultures and supernatant fluid are hemolytic when injected directly into the circulation of rabbits and pigeons, and the acute death produced may be ascribed to a massive destruction of red corpuscles. The passage of the fluid portion of glucose broth cultures through Berkefeld filters reduces materially the hemolytic and poisonous effects. Cultures of the Welch bacilli in plain broth to which sterile pigeon or rabbit muscle is added are highly toxic, and the toxicity is not noticeably diminished by Berkefeld filtration. The filtrates are hemolytic when injected intravenously and inflaming and necrotizing when injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly. The local lesions produced in the breast muscles of the pigeon closely resemble those caused by infection with the bacilli. The toxicity of these filtrates is not affected by neutralization with sodium hydroxide, but is materially reduced by heating to 62 °C. and entirely removed by heating to 70 °C. for 30 minutes. Successive injections of carefully graded doses of this toxic filtrate in pigeons and rabbits give rise to active immunity. The blood taken from the immunized rabbits is capable of neutralizing the toxic filtrate in vivo and in vitro. The filtrate has therefore been designated as toxin and the immune serum as antitoxin. The antitoxin neutralizes the toxin in multiple proportions. Hence the latter would seem to possess the properties of an exotoxin. Moreover, it neutralizes the hemolytic as well as the locally. injurious toxic constituent. Antitoxic serum prepared from a given culture of Bacillus welchii is neutralizing for the toxins yielded by the other four {{cultures of}} that microorganism. The antitoxin is protective and curative against infection with the spore and the vegetative stages of Bacillus welchii in pigeons. The limits of the protective and curative action are now under investigation...|$|R
