5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President <b>Johnson</b> <b>to</b> negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President <b>Johnson</b> <b>to</b> begin negotiations for a settlement between North Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{contracted}} {{to finish the}} edition in 18 months but as the months passed, his pace slowed. He told Charles Burney in December 1757 {{that it would take}} him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, in February 1758 he was arrested again for an unpaid debt of £40. The debt was soon repaid by Tonson, who had contracted <b>Johnson</b> <b>to</b> publish the work; this motivated <b>Johnson</b> <b>to</b> finish the edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E

In October 1976, Johnson clashed with the Progressive Liberal Party leader, Prime Minister Lynden Pindling during the ZNS-TV radio programme, Contact. Contact was a monthly, live broadcast where Sir Lynden was questioned by journalists. Sir Lynden became angry when answering Johnson's questions. In November 1976, Sir Lynden refused <b>to</b> appear with <b>Johnson.</b> <b>Johnson</b> continued <b>to</b> goad Sir Lynden in The Tribune.

5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas <b>Johnson</b> <b>to</b> refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance {{of the dollar}} coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin.

5|$|Jackson's {{faith in}} <b>Johnson</b> <b>to</b> balance the ticket proved misplaced. In the general election, Johnson cost the Democrats {{votes in the}} South, where his {{relationship}} with Chinn was particularly unpopular. He also failed to garner much support from the West, where {{he was supposed to}} be strong due to his reputation as an Indian fighter and war hero. He even failed to deliver his home state of Kentucky for the Democrats. Regardless, the Democrats still won the popular vote.|$|E

Johnson's success encouraged him to take up the sport professionally. By June 1784 he had declared himself to be the champion, although whether of England or the world is uncertain.|$|E
