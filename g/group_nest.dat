Schaub and Larsen, 1978). Most data on Neotropical anuran preda-tors are sparse or anecdotal, but a few detailed natural hjstory studies provided impor-tant information on this topic (e. g., Kluge, 1981; Ryan, 1985). The hylid frog flylafaber, a member of the boans <b>group</b> (<b>nest</b> building gladiator frogs, cf. Kluge, 1979), occurs from northern Argentina to eastern Brazil and breeds in permanent ponds adjacent to streams in the Atlantic Forest (Martins and Haddad, 1988). Kluge (1981) observed adults and larvae of Hyla rosenbergi (another species of the boans group) being preyed upon by diverse predators, such as aquatic insects, tadpoles of the same and other species, frogs, snakes, and mammals.

40|$|Predation {{pressure}} {{has long been}} considered a leading explanation of colonies, where close neighbors may reduce predation via dilution, alarming or group predator attacks. Attacking predators may be costly in terms of energy and survival, leading {{to the question of}} how neighbors contribute to predator deterrence in relationship to each other. Two hypotheses explaining the relative efforts made by neighbors are byproduct-mutualism, which occurs when breeders inadvertently attack predators by defending their nests, and reciprocity, which occurs when breeders deliberately exchange predator defense efforts with neighbors. Most studies investigating <b>group</b> <b>nest</b> defense have been performed with birds. However, colonial fish may constitute a more practical model system for an experimental approach because of the greater ability of researchers to manipulate their environment. We investigated in the colonial fish, Neolamprologus caudopunctatus, whether prospecting pairs preferred to breed near conspecifics or solitarily, and how breeders invested in anti-predator defense in relation to neighbors. In a simple choice test, prospecting pairs selected breeding sites close to neighbors versus a solitary site. Predators were then sequentially presented to the newly established test pairs, the previously established stimulus pairs or in between the two pairs. Test pairs attacked the predator eight times more frequently when they were presented on their non-neighbor side compared to between the two breeding sites, where stimulus pairs maintained high attack rates. Thus, by joining an established pair, test pairs were able to reduce their anti-predator efforts near neighbors, a...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Orchid bees (Euglossini) {{provide a}} {{potentially}} informative contrast for examining origins of advanced social behaviour in bees {{because they are}} the only tribe in the apine clade that do not form large colonies or have queens and workers. We investigated natural nests of Euglossa hyacinthina Dressler, an orchid bee that nests singly or in groups. By comparing the two types of nests, we examined if individuals in a group merely share the nest (are communal) or exhibit a level of social organization where there is repro-ductive division of labour among the females. Observations are consistent with communal nesting, indicating that all females in <b>group</b> <b>nests</b> are reproductively similar to the soli-tary nesting females because the provisioning of young, as well as the ovary development and mating status of females sharing nests were not different than that of solitary-nesting females. Also, multiple female nests did not produce a female-biased brood as predicted for nests with reproductive division of labour. We also investigated potential advantages of <b>group</b> <b>nesting</b> vs. individual nesting. We demonstrate that per capita offspring production is lower in nests with more than one female. However, we found that nests with single females were left unattended {{for longer periods of time}} dur-ing foraging, and that there was a high incidence of natural enemy attack in nests when females were absent. <b>Group</b> and solitary <b>nesting</b> may be advantageous under different condi-tions.

30|$|A fourth {{assumption}} is that human nature is intensely social. Early humans evolved in savannah-like environments in Africa where predation risks were high and resources were scattered (Foley, 1997).

Evolutionary psychologists assume that this tribal history is reflected in how human brains are designed. Humans have a considerably larger neo-cortex than other primates, arguably because it enabled early humans to live and thrive in large, complex social groups (the social brain hypothesis; Dunbar, 2003).|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Two new E-optimal <b>nested</b> <b>group</b> {{divisible}} {{designs are}} reported Sinha and Shah (1988) established E-optimality {{of a class}} of 3 -concurrence most balanced designs. The construction of these designs were not considered by them. Sinha and Kageyama (1992) gave methods of constructions of E-optimal <b>nested</b> <b>group</b> divisible designs, along with a table of designs {{in the range of}} r ≤ 20, k ≤ 10. The constructions of <b>nested</b> <b>group</b> divisible designs have also been given recently by Bhagwandas et al. (1992). E-optimal <b>nested</b> <b>group</b> divisible designs form a special class of E-optimal 3 -concurrence most balanced designs. The definition of E-optimal <b>nested</b> <b>group</b> designs may be recalled from Sinha and Kageyama (1992) as: Let there be v(= 2 pt) treatments divided into t sets of 2 p treatments each and b blocks of k, satisfying the following: (I) Each of t sets consists of 2 groups of size p(≥ 2); and any two treatments (i) in the same group and same set are called first associates, (ii) in the differ-ent group and same set are called second associates (iii) otherwise called third associates. (II) Each treatment is repeated r times. (III) Any two treatments which are i-th associates occur together in λi blocks for i = 1, 2, 3, where λ 1 = u − 1, λ 2 = u + 1, λ 3 = u for a positive integer u. The initial blocks: (125) (257) mod 12 yields an E-optimal <b>nested</b> <b>group</b> divisible design with parameters...|$|R
