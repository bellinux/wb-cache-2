500|$|When it {{was first}} {{published}} in 1792, the Rights of Woman was reviewed favourably by the Analytical Review, the <b>General</b> <b>Magazine,</b> the Literary Magazine, New York Magazine, and the Monthly Review, although the assumption persists even today that Rights of Woman received hostile reviews. It was almost immediately released in a second edition in 1792, several American editions appeared, and it was translated into French. Taylor writes that [...] "it was an immediate success". Moreover, other writers such as Mary Hays and Mary Robinson specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft's text in their own works. Hays cited the Rights of Woman in her novel Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796) and modelled her female characters after Wollstonecraft's ideal woman.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>General</b> <b>Magazine</b> was {{the house}} organ of Avalon Hill, and as such, {{regularly}} promoted ASL by in-depth articles on gameplay, [...] "series replay" [...] features where games were recorded and printed move for move for further analysis, {{and of course}} published scenarios. [...] There were three main categories of ASL Scenarios printed in the General; conversions of scenarios from the original Squad Leader system, new scenarios, and tournament scenarios.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from regular}} {{features}} in The <b>General</b> <b>Magazine,</b> AH also produced {{a series of}} magazines focused on ASL but with some original SL content also, beginning in 1989. [...] The ASL Annual was, as the name implies, released once a year, with issues in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, and two issues were published in 1993 (called ASL Annual '93a and ASL Annual '93b). [...] No issue was published in 1994, with issues again appearing in 1995, 1996 and 1997. [...] The 1995 issue was named ASL Annual '95w (Winter) {{in anticipation of a}} second issue that year being printed in the summer, but it did not materialize. [...] Scenarios located in the ASL Annual were numbered sequentially with an [...] "A" [...] prefix, either ASL Scenario A1, A2, etc., or SL Scenario A1, A2, etc., Deluxe ASL Scenario A1, A2, etc.|$|E

2500|$|Playtester Jon Mishcon {{described}} the new game rather more succinctly in Volume 21, Number 5 of The <b>General</b> <b>Magazine,</b> {{in relation to}} Squad Leader; he wrote that the game was [...] "Closely akin to SL but NOT the same." [...] ASL took longer to play, punished use of [...] "cheats" [...] that worked in the old game system (one example was flooding an isolated defending unit by moving multiple units towards him; in ASL, units could fire more than once at moving targets in certain situations, which was impossible in the original SL), and emphasized realism over playability. [...] He clarified that while playability had in many cases increased with the new rules organization, there were still many [...] "special" [...] circumstances that called for special rules. [...] The new rules did, however, {{have a very strong}} systemic approach whereby, in his words, you could ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1733, Franklin {{began to}} publish the noted Poor Richard's Almanack (with content both {{original}} and borrowed) under the pseudonym Richard Saunders, on which much of his popular reputation is based. Franklin frequently wrote under pseudonyms. Although it was no secret that Franklin was the author, his Richard Saunders character repeatedly denied it. [...] "Poor Richard's Proverbs", adages from this almanac, such as [...] "A penny saved is twopence dear" [...] (often misquoted as [...] "A penny saved is a penny earned") and [...] "Fish and visitors stink in three days", remain common quotations in the modern world. Wisdom in folk society meant the ability to provide an apt adage for any occasion, and Franklin's readers became well prepared. He sold about ten thousand copies per year—it became an institution. In 1741 Franklin began publishing The <b>General</b> <b>Magazine</b> and Historical Chronicle for all the British Plantations in America, the first such monthly magazine of this type published in America.|$|E
