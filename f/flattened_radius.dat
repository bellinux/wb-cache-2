Cathodes are often made from porous tungsten filled with a barium compound, which gives low work function; the structure of cathode has to be tailored for the application. Anodes are usually made from pure tungsten, or, when good machinability is required, lanthanum-alloyed tungsten, and are often machined to provide extra surface area to cope with power loading. DC arc lamps often have a cathode with a sharp tip, {{to help keep the}} arc away from the glass and to control temperature. Flashtubes usually have a cathode with a <b>flattened</b> <b>radius,</b> to reduce the incidence of hot spots and decrease sputter caused by peak currents, which may be in excess of 1000 amperes. Electrode design is also influenced by the average power. At high levels of average power, care has to be taken to achieve sufficient cooling of the electrodes.

The parameters of models include the asymptotic rotation velocity of spiral arms, halo <b>flattening,</b> core <b>radius</b> and rising or falling parameter of rotation curve. We obtain the best fit parameters of galactic models through the maximum likelihood analysis, comparing the high resolution radial velocity data of HI in Magellanic Stream with that of theoretical models. The initial condition of the Magellanic Clouds is taken from the six different values reported in the literature. We find that oblate and nearly spherical shape halos provide a better fit to the observation than the prolate halos.

There are a large number (20, 000) of these tracers available over an impressive 14, 000 square degrees in both Northern and Southern Galactic hemispheres, and they provide a robust measurement of the shape of the Milky Way stellar halo. After masking out stars {{in the vicinity of the}} Virgo Overdensity and the Sagittarius stream, the data are consistent with a smooth, oblate stellar halo with a density that follows a broken power-law. The best fitting model has an inner slope = 2. 3 and an outer slope = 4. 6, together with a break radius occurring at 27 kpc and a constant halo flattening (that is, ratio of minor axis to major axis) of q = 0. 6. Although a broken power-law describes the density fall-off most adequately, it is also well fit by an Einasto profile. There is no strong evidence for variations in <b>flattening</b> with <b>radius,</b> or for triaxiality of the stellar halo. Comment: 13 pages, 12 figures. Accepted for publication by MNRA...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship of}} the H II region luminosity function (H II LF) to the H II region size distribution and density wave triggering in grand-design spiral galaxies. We suggest that the differential nebular size distribution is described by a power law of slope ∼ − 4, with <b>flattening</b> at <b>radii</b> below ∼ 130 pc. This contrasts with the conventional exponential description, but it is physically and quantitatively consistent with the typical observed value of − 2 for the H II LF slope. We have developed an interactive code that computes spatial isochrones for the evolving loci of spiral density waves in disk galaxies. This allows comparison of the nebular spatial distribution with the spatial isochrones for simple rotation curve parameters. Our comparisons for four grand-design galaxies suggest that the corotation radius rco coincides with the outer ends of the star-forming arms. This value for rco yields the best spatial correspondence between the H II regions and the isochrones, and also appears to yield a coincidence between the Inner Lindblad Resonance with the radial onset of star formation in the arms. Thus, we suggest that isochrones offer a new, simple, and effective technique for determining rco, and thus the spiral pattern speed. However, application of the isochrones also demonstrates that evolution of the nebular population is difficult to spatially isolate in these galaxies.

In GM 1 two lamellar, one hexagonal and two cubic (aspects # 5 and 13) phases were identified, in addition to the isotropic micellar solution. In GM 1 (acetyl) two of the phases are cubic (aspects # 8 and 13), one is the fluid isotropic solution. The structure of the lamellar and the hexagonal phases are trivial. The structure of the cubic phases was determined using a combination of freeze-fracture electron microscope and X-ray scattering experiments. The three cubic phases consist of lipid micelles of type I (oil-in-water); in two of the phases (Q 225 and Q 229) the micelles are all identical and of quasi-spherical shape. Phase Q 223 was previously known to contain two types of micelles, one quasi-spherical, the other slightly <b>flattened.</b> The <b>radii</b> of the micelles determined from the dimensions of the electron density troughs were consistent with the chemical data.

40|$|Non-axisymmetric components, such as spirals {{and central}} bars, {{play a major}} role in shaping galactic discs. An {{important}} aspect of the disc secular evolution driven by these perturbers is the radial migration of stars. It has been suggested recently that migration can populate a thick-disc component from inner-disc stars with high vertical energies. Since this has never been demonstrated in simulations, we study in detail the effect of radial migration on the disc velocity dispersion and disc thickness, by separating simulated stars into migrators and non-migrators. We apply this method to three isolated barred Tree-SPH N-body galaxies with strong radial migration. Contrary to expectations, we find that as stellar samples migrate, on the average, their velocity dispersion change (by as much as 50 %) in such a way as to approximately match the non-migrating population at the radius at which they arrive. We show that, in fact, migrators suppress heating in parts of the disc. To confirm the validity of our findings, we also apply our technique to three cosmological re-simulations, which use a completely different simulation scheme and, remarkably, find very similar results. We believe the inability of migration to thicken discs is a fundamental property of internal disc evolution, irrespective of the migration mechanism at work. We explain this with the approximate conservation of the (average) vertical and radial actions rather than the energy. This "action mixing" can be used to constrain the migration rate in the Milky Way: estimates of the average vertical action in observations for different populations of stars should reveal <b>flattening</b> with <b>radius</b> for older groups of stars.

40|$|PURPOSE: Myopia {{has been}} found to be {{predominantly}} axial in nature, i. e. myopic eyes have longer than normal axial lengths, with corneal radius variations having only a small influence on the magnitude of the refractive error. In this study we assess whether a similar relationship exists for hyperopia. METHODS: Biometric data were collected on 57 subjects with either emmetropic or hyperopic refractive errors ranging in magnitude from - 0. 37 D to + 17. 25 D. Our main analysis concentrated on subjects with less than + 10 D of hyperopia (group 1, n = 53), as subjects with + 10 D of hyperopia or more (group 2, n = 4) exhibited marked differences in their biometric characteristics. RESULTS: Analysis of group 1 data revealed a significant relationship (r 2 = 0. 611, p = 0. 0001) between the degree of hyperopia and the measured axial lengths. A weak but statistically significant relationship (r 2 = 0. 128, p = 0. 009) was also found between mean corneal radius measures and mean spherical refractive errors, with the mean corneal <b>radius</b> <b>flattening</b> with increasing hyperopia. In group 2, three of the four subjects exhibited much steeper corneal characteristics than predicted from the group 1 data.

40|$|Large scale {{structures}} such as {{groups and}} clusters of galaxies show a universal, nearly linear entropy radial profile K(r). Using deprojected 16 clusters and 12 groups from the literature, we find that K∝ r^ 0. 96 ± 0. 01, consistent with the mean power-law index (0. 9 [...] 1. 1) of previous studies. A similarly good fit is given by a τ∝ r^ 0. 72 ± 0. 01 ratio between cooling and free-fall times. Both profiles slightly <b>flatten</b> at small <b>radii,</b> as τ becomes of order unity. The entropy profile is usually attributed to self-similar shock accretion (shown to be inconsistent with the data), to non-standard heat conduction, or to turbulent heating. We argue that a dynamical mechanism is needed to sustain such a universal profile, oblivious to the temperature peak {{at the edge of}} the core and to the virial shock at the outskirts, and robust to the presence of ongoing cooling, merger, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In particular, we show that such a profile can be naturally obtained in a spiral flow, which is likely to underlie most galaxy aggregates according to the ubiquitous spiral patterns and cold fronts observed. Generalizing a two-phase spiral flow model out to the virial radius surprisingly reproduces the thermal profile. A generalized Schwarzschild criterion indicates that observed spiral patterns must involve a convective layer, which may regulate the thermal profile. Comment: ApJ (accepted...|$|R

In this limit the disturbance decays exponentially in time {{at a rate that}} is linked to a pole of the associated linear inviscid problem (known as a Landau pole). As a model of a typical vortex distribution that can give rise to cat's eyes, here distributions are examined that have a basic Gaussian shape but whose profiles have been artificially <b>flattened</b> about some <b>radius</b> r_c. A numerical study of the Landau poles for this family of vortices shows that as r_c is varied so the decay rate of the disturbance moves smoothly between poles as the decay rates of two Landau poles cross. Cat's eyes that occur in the nonlinear evolution of a vortex lead to an axisymmetric azimuthally averaged profile with an annulus of approximately uniform vorticity, rather like the artificially flattened profiles investigated. Based on the stability of such profiles it is found that finite thickness cat's eyes can persist (i. e. the mean profile has a neutral mode) at two distinct radii, and in the limit of a thin flattened region the result that vanishingly thin cat's eyes only persist at a single radius is recovered.

The DFs have five free parameters, controlling {{the inner and}} outer density slope, break <b>radius,</b> <b>flattening</b> and anisotropy respectively. The DFs generate flattened stellar haloes with a rapidly varying logarithmic slope in density, as well as a spherically aligned velocity ellipsoid with a long axis that points towards the Galactic centre - all attributes possessed by the stellar halo of the Milky Way. We use our action-based distribution function to model the blue horizontal branch stars extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as stellar halo tracers in a spherical Galactic potential. As the selection function is hard to model, we fix the density law from earlier studies and solve for the anisotropy and gravitational potential parameters. Our best fit model has a velocity anisotropy that becomes more radially anisotropic on moving outwards. It changes from β≈ 0. 4 at Galactocentric radius of 15 kpc to ≈ 0. 7 at 60 kpc. This is a gentler increase than is typically found in simulations of stellar haloes built from the mutiple accretion of smaller systems. We find the potential corresponds to an almost flat rotation curve with amplitude of ≈ 200 kms^- 1 at these distances.

40|$|With the {{construction}} of the VLTI (Very Large Telescope Interferometer of the European Observatory ESO for the southern hemisphere) it is now possible to make observations with resolutions of the order of milli-arc-seconds, especially in IR with AMBER instrument (Astronomical Multi Beam Recombine). These new capabilities allow us to better constrain the stellar structures such as polar jets, equatorial disks and flattened photospheres of rotating stars. Thus the estimation of stellar fundamental parameters allows to explore in detail the mechanisms of mass loss, pulsation and magnetism governing the variability and the evolution of the stars. This thesis presents the results of fast rotating stars observations carried out on the AMBER spectro-interferometer VLTI in its high & medium spectral resolutions modes. The observations were highly degraded by the optical defects of AMBER and their analysis required the development of specific digital reduction tools to reach the necessary precision for the interferometric measurements interpretation. In order to interpret those measures I developed a chromatic semi-analytical model of rapidly rotating star that allowed me to estimate, from the differential phases; the degree of <b>flattening,</b> the equatorial <b>radius,</b> the rotation velocity, the angle of inclination, the position angle of the star rotation axis in the sky, the local distribution of the effective temperature and the surface gravity of the star within the von Zeipel theorem.

If these candidates are at the distance of NGC 2784, then they have absolute magnitudes greater than M_V = - 9. 5 mag and effective radii larger than 170 pc.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of metals {{in groups of}} galaxies holds important information about the chemical enrichment history of the Universe. Here we present radial profiles of temperature and the abundance of iron and silicon of the hot intragroup medium for a sample of 15 nearby groups of galaxies observed by Chandra, selected for their regular X-ray morphology. All but one group display a cool core, the size of which is found to correlate with the mean temperature of the group derived outside this core. When scaled to this mean temperature, the temperature profiles are remarkably similar, being analogous to those of more massive clusters at large radii but significantly flatter inwards of the temperature peak. The Fe abundance generally shows a central excess followed by a radial decline, reaching a typical value of 0. 1 solar within r_ 500, a factor of two lower than corresponding results for clusters. Si shows less systematic radial variation, on average displaying a less pronounced decline than Fe and showing evidence for a <b>flattening</b> at large <b>radii.</b> Off-centre abundance peaks are seen both for Fe and Si {{in a number of}} groups with well-resolved cores. Derived abundance ratios indicate that supernovae type Ia are responsible for 80 per cent of the Fe in the group core, but the type II contribution increases with radius and completely dominates at r_ 500. We present fitting formulae for the radial dependence of temperature and abundances, to facilitate comparison to results of numerical simulations of group formation and evolution.

The following article appeared in Physics of Fluids 20 (2008) and may be found at [URL] paper considers the relaxation of a smooth two-dimensional vortex to axisymmetry after the application of an instantaneous, weak external strain field. In this limit the disturbance decays exponentially in time {{at a rate that}} is linked to a pole of the associated linear inviscid problem (known as a Landau pole). As a model of a typical vortex distribution that can give rise to cat's eyes, here distributions are examined that have a basic Gaussian shape but whose profiles have been artificially <b>flattened</b> about some <b>radius</b> rc. A numerical study of the Landau poles for this family of vortices shows that as rc is varied so the decay rate of the disturbance moves smoothly between poles as the decay rates of two Landau poles cross. Cat's eyes that occur in the nonlinear evolution of a vortex lead to an axisymmetric azimuthally averaged profile with an annulus of approximately uniform vorticity, rather like the artificially flattened profiles investigated. Based on the stability of such profiles it is found that finite thickness cat's eyes can persist (i. e., the mean profile has a neutral mode) at two distinct radii, and in the limit of a thin flattened region the result that vanishingly thin cat's eyes only persist at a single radius is recovered. The decay of nonaxisymmetric perturbations to these flattened profiles for larger times is investigated and a comparison made with the result for a Gaussian profile...|$|R
40|$|There is good {{evidence}} that the centers of massive early-type galaxies have a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) compared to the IMF of the Milky Way. Here we study the radial variation of the IMF within such galaxies, {{using a combination of}} high quality Keck spectroscopy and a new suite of stellar population synthesis models that cover a wide range in metallicity. As in the previous studies in this series, the models are fitted directly to the spectra and treat all elemental abundance ratios as free parameters. Using newly obtained spectroscopy for six galaxies, including deep data extending to ~ 1 Re for the galaxies NGC 1407, NGC 1600, and NGC 2695, we find that the IMF varies strongly with galactocentric radius. For all six galaxies the IMF is bottom-heavy in the central regions, with average mass-to-light ratio "mismatch" parameter a~ 2. 5 at R= 0. The IMF rapidly becomes more bottom-light with increasing <b>radius,</b> <b>flattening</b> off near the Milky Way value (a~ 1. 1) at R> 0. 4 Re. A consequence is that the luminosity-weighted average IMF depends on the measurement aperture: within R=Re we find = 1. 3 - 1. 5, consistent with recent lensing and dynamical results from SLACS and ATLAS- 3 D. Our results are also consistent with several earlier studies that were based on analyses of radial gradients of line indices. The observed IMF gradients support galaxy formation models in which the central regions of massive galaxies had a different formation history than their outer parts. Finally, we make use of the high signal-to-noise central spectra of NGC 1407 and NGC 2695 to demonstrate how we can disentangle IMF effects and abundance effects.

40|$|We {{report a}} series of {{high-resolution}} cosmological N-body simulations designed to explore the formation and properties of dark matter halos with masses close to the damping scale of the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations. We further investigate {{the effect that the}} addition of a random component, v_rms, into the particle velocity field has on the structure of halos. We adopted as a fiducial model the Lambda Warm Dark Matter cosmology with a non-thermal sterile neutrino mass of 0. 5 keV. The filtering mass corresponds then to M_f = 2. 6 x 10 ^ 12 M_sun/h. Halos of masses close to M_f were simulated with several million of particles. The results show that, on one hand, the inner density slope of these halos (at radii <~ 0. 02 the virial radius Rvir) is systematically steeper than the one corresponding to the NFW fit or to the CDM counterpart. On the other hand, the overall density profile (radii larger than 0. 02 Rvir) is less curved and less concentrated than the NFW fit, with an outer slope shallower than - 3. For simulations with v_rms, the inner halo density profiles <b>flatten</b> significantly at <b>radii</b> smaller than 2 - 3 kpc/h (<~ 0. 010 - 0. 015 Rvir). A constant density core is not detected in our simulations, {{with the exception of one}} halo for which the flat core radius is ~ 1 kpc/h. Nevertheless, if ``cored'' density profiles are used to fit the halo profiles, the inferred core radii are ~ 0. 1 - 0. 8 kpc/h, in rough agreement with theoretical predictions based on phase-space constrains, and on dynamical models of warm gravitational collapse. A reduction of v_rms by a factor of 3 produces a modest decrease in core radii, less than a factor of 1. 5. We discuss the extension of our results into several contexts, for example, to the structure of the cold DM micro-halos at the damping scale of this model.

40|$|We have mapped {{the central}} region of NGC 4945 in the J = 2 → 1 {{transition}} of 12 CO, 13 CO, and C 18 O, {{as well as}} the continuum at ∼ 1. 3 mm, at an angular resolution of 5 " x 3 " with the Submillimeter Array. The relative proximity of NGC 4945 (distance of only 3. 8 Mpc) permits a detailed study of the circumnuclear molecular gas and dust in a galaxy exhibiting both an active galactic nucleus (AGN; classified as Seyfert 2) and a circumnuclear starburst in an inclined ring with radius ∼ 2. 5 " (∼ 50 pc). We infer the systemic velocity ∼ 585 km s _ 1 from chanel maps and PV-diagrams. We find that all three molecular lines trace an inclined rotating disk with the major axis aligned with that of the starburst ring and large-scale galactic disk and which exhibits solid-body rotation within a radius of ∼ 5 " (∼ 95 pc). The rotation curve <b>flattens</b> beyond this <b>radius,</b> and the isovelocity contours exhibit an S-shaped asymmetry suggestive of a highly inclined bar, as has been invoked to produce a similar asymmetry observed on larger scales. We infer an inclination for the nuclear disk of 62 ° ± 2 °, somewhat smaller than the inclination of the large-scale galactic disk of ∼ 78 °. The continuum emission at 1. 3 mm also extends beyond the starburst ring and is dominated by thermal emission from dust. If it traces the same dust emitting in the far-infrared, then the bulk of this dust must be heated by star-formation activity rather than the AGN. We discover a kinematically decoupled component {{at the center of the}} disk with a radius smaller than 1. 4 " (27 pc), but which spans approximately the same range of velocities as the surrounding disk. This component has a higher density than its surroundings and is a promising candidate for the circumnuclear molecular torus invoked by AGN unification models. © 2007.

40|$|We characterise the radial density, {{metallicity}} and {{flattening profile}} of the Milky Way's stellar halo, based on the large sample of 1757 spectroscopically confirmed giant stars from SDSS/SEGUE- 2 after excising stars that were algorithmically attributed to apparent halo substructure (including the Sagittarius stream). Compared to BHB stars or RR Lyrae, giants are more readily understood tracers of the overall halo star population, with less bias in age or metallicity. The well-characterized selection function of the sample enables forward modelling of those data, based on ellipsoidal stellar density models, ν_* (R,z), with Einasto profiles and (broken) power laws for their radial dependence, combined with {{a model for the}} metallicity gradient and the flattening profile. Among models with constant flattening, these data are reasonably well fit by an Einasto profile of n= 3. 1 ± 0. 5 with an effective radius r_eff = 15 ± 2 kpc and a flattening of q= 0. 7 ± 0. 02; or comparably well by an equally flattened broken power-law, with radial slopes of α_in= 2. 1 ± 0. 3 and α_out= 3. 8 ± 0. 1, with a break-radius of r_break= 18 ± 1 kpc; this is largely consistent with earlier work. We find a modest, but significant metallicity gradient within the "outer" stellar halo, [Fe/H] decreasing outward. If we allow for a variable flattening q = f(r_GC), we find the distribution of halo giants to be considerably more <b>flattened</b> at small <b>radii,</b> q(10 kpc) ∼ 0. 57, compared to q(> 30 kpc) ∼ 0. 8. Remarkably, the data are then very well fit by a single power-law of index ∼ 4. 2 ± 0. 1 of the variable r_q≡√(R^ 2 +(z/q(r)) ^ 2). In this simple and better fitting model, there is a break in flattening at ∼ 20 kpc, instead of a break in the radial density function. Comment: accepted by ApJ. Final versio...|$|R
40|$|The disks of disk galaxies {{contain a}} {{substantial}} fraction of their baryonic matter and angular momentum, {{and much of}} the evolutionary activity in these galaxies, such as the formation of stars, spiral arms, bars and rings, and the various forms of secular evolution, takes place in their disks. The formation and evolution of galactic disks are therefore particularly important for understanding how galaxies form and evolve and the cause of the variety in which they appear to us. Ongoing large surveys, made possible by new instrumentation at wavelengths from the UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), via optical (Hubble Space Telescope and large groundbased telescopes) and IR (Spitzer Space Telescope), to the radio are providing much new information about disk galaxies over a wide range of redshift. Although progress has been made, the dynamics and structure of stellar disks, including their truncations, are still not well understood. We do now have plausible estimates of disk mass-to-light ratios, and estimates of Toomre's Q parameter show that they are just locally stable. Disks are mostly very flat and sometimes very thin, and they have a range in surface brightness from canonical disks with a central surface brightness of about 21. 5 B-mag arcsec- 2 down to very low surface brightnesses. It appears that galaxy disks are not maximal, except possibly in the largest systems. Their Hi layers display warps whenever Hi can be detected beyond the stellar disk, with low-level star formation going on out to large radii. Stellar disks display abundance gradients that <b>flatten</b> at larger <b>radii</b> and sometimes even reverse. The existence of a well-defined baryonic (stellar + Hi) Tully-Fisher relation hints at an approximately uniform baryonic to dark matter ratio. Thick disks are common in disk galaxies, and their existence appears unrelated to the presence of a bulge component; they are old, but their formation is not yet understood. Disk formation was already advanced at redshifts of ˜ 2, but at that epoch disks were not yet quiescent and in full rotational equilibrium. Downsizing (the gradual reduction with time in the mass of the most actively star-forming galaxies) is now well-established.

40|$|We use N-body {{simulations}} {{to study}} the shape of mean cluster density and velocity profiles in the nonlinear regime formed via gravitational instability. The dependence of the final structure on both cosmology and initial density field is examined, using a grid of cosmologies and scale-free initial power spectra P(k) is-proportional-to k(n). Einstein-de Sitter, open (OMEGA 0 = 0. 2 and 0. 1) and flat, low density (OMEGA 0 = 0. 2, lambda 0 = 0. 8) models are examined, with initial spectral indices n = - 2, - 1 and 0. For each model, we stack clusters in an appropriately scaled manner to define an average density profile in the nonlinear regime. The profiles are well fit by a power law rho(r) is-proportional-to r(-alpha) for radii whereat the local density contrast is between 100 and 3000. This covers 99 % of the cluster volume. We find a clear trend toward steeper slopes (larger alpha's) with both increasing n and decreasing OMEGA 0. The OMEGA 0 dependence is partially masked by the n dependence; these is degeneracy in the values of alpha between the Einstein-de Sitter and flat, low-density cosmologies. However, the profile slopes in the open models are consistently higher than the OMEGA = 1 values for the range of n examined. Cluster density profiles are thus potentially useful cosmological diagnostics. We find no evidence for a constant density core {{in any of the}} models, although the density profiles do tend to <b>flatten</b> at small <b>radii.</b> Much of the flattening is due to the force softening required by the simulations. An attempt is made to recover the unsoftened profiles assuming angular momentum invariance. The recovered profiles in Einstein-de Sitter cosmologies are consistent with a pure power law up to the highest density contrasts (10 (6)) accessible with our resolution. The low-density models show significant deviation from a power law above density contrasts approximately 10 (5). We interpret this curvature as reflecting the non-scale-invariant nature of the background cosmology in these models. These results are at the limit of our resolution and so should be tested in future using simulations with larger numbers of particles. Such simulations will also provide insight on the broader problem of understanding, in a statistical sense, the full phase space structure of collapsed, cosmological halos...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{catalogue}} of positions, magnitudes and velocities for 3300 emission-line objects found by the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph {{in a survey of}} the Andromeda galaxy, M 31. Of these objects, 2615 are found likely to be planetary nebulae (PNe) associated with M 31. The survey area covers the whole of M 31 's disc out to a radius of 1 degrees 5. Beyond this radius, observations have been made along the major and minor axes, and the Northern Spur and Southern Stream regions. The calibrated data have been checked for internal consistency and compared with other catalogues. With the exception of the very central, high surface brightness region of M 31, this survey is complete to a magnitude limit of m(5007) similar to 23. 75, 3. 5 mag into the PN luminosity function. We have identified emission-line objects associated with M 31 's satellites and other background galaxies. We have examined the data from the region tentatively identified as a new satellite galaxy, Andromeda VIII, comparing it to data in the other quadrants of the galaxy. We find that the PNe in this region have velocities that appear to be consistent with membership of M 31 itself. The luminosity function of the surveyed PNe is well matched to the usual smooth monotonic function. The only significant spatial variation in the luminosity function occurs in the vicinity of M 31 's molecular ring, where the luminosities of PNe on the near side of the galaxy are systematically similar to 0. 2 mag fainter than those on the far side. This difference can be explained naturally by a modest amount of obscuration by the ring. The absence of any difference in luminosity function between bulge and disc suggests that the sample of PNe is not strongly populated by objects whose progenitors are more massive stars. This conclusion is reinforced by the excellent agreement between the number counts of PNe and the R-band light. The number counts of kinematically selected PNe also allow us to probe the stellar distribution in M 31 down to very faint limits. There is no indication of a cut-off in M 31 's disc out to beyond four scalelengths, and no signs of a spheroidal halo population in excess of the bulge out to 10 effective bulge radii. We have also carried out a preliminary analysis of the kinematics of the surveyed PNe. The mean streaming velocity of the M 31 disc PNe is found to show a significant asymmetric drift out to large radii. Their velocity dispersion, although initially declining with <b>radius,</b> <b>flattens</b> out to a constant value in the outer parts of the galaxy.
