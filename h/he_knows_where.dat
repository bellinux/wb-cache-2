As Mis lies dying, he tells Toran, Bayta, and Magnifico that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> the Second Foundation is. But {{just before he}} can reveal the Second Foundation's location, however, Bayta kills him. Bayta had realized, shortly before, that Magnifico was actually the Mule, who had used his powers in every planet they had previously visited. In the same way, he had forced Mis to continue working and find what the Mule was looking for. Bayta had killed Mis {{to prevent him from}} revealing the Second Foundation's whereabouts to the Mule.|$|E
500|$|Selänne's primary {{attribute}} is his skating speed. Nicknamed the [...] "Finnish Flash", {{he uses his}} speed to evade opposition defenders. [...] According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström, [...] "He's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> {{to be on the}} ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added, [...] "He's just a very elegant player. He's got a very nice stride to his skating, he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill he has, it just makes for a heck of a great player." ...|$|E
500|$|Amir, a well-to-do Pashtun boy, and Hassan, a Hazara {{who is the}} son of Ali, Amir's father's servant, {{spend their}} days kite {{fighting}} in the hitherto peaceful city of Kabul. Hassan is a successful [...] "kite runner" [...] for Amir; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> the kite will land without watching it. Amir's father, a wealthy merchant Amir affectionately refers to as Baba, loves both boys, but is often critical of Amir, considering him weak and lacking in courage. Amir finds a kinder fatherly figure in Rahim Khan, Baba's closest friend, who understands him and supports his interest in writing, whereas Baba considers that interest to be worthy only of females.|$|E

500|$|Mahone is {{depicted}} as an intelligent FBI agent with [...] "an amazingly sharp mind", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, [...] "It's like <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> we're going, what we're thinking."

[...] Michael and Mahone have been described as [...] "two sides of the same brilliant coin"; however, Mahone notes, [...] "there's one big difference between you and I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely." [...] Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he [...] "doesn't do everything he does because he wants to do it. He's not OK about it. It's going to start to come out." ...|$|E

Mick and Tina arrive at his door, but he demands to see Shirley if they want their money. Speaking of Stan's intentions behind giving the money to Shirley, West said, [...] "He’s got the money to spare {{and he wants to}} see them all together in the pub. If <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> they are, he can use {{it as a way to}} get back into their lives. Also, giving someone money gives you a certain hold over them, which is what Stan wants." [...] Stan appeared again on 20 February 2014, before arriving permanently on 31 March 2014.|$|E
