The entire flower cluster can be dipped in batter and fried while petals can be eaten raw or {{made into a}} fragrant and tasty tea.

Elderberry is highly prized by both Spaniards and Cahuillas. Throughout the months of July and August the small clusters of berries are gathered in large quantities. These clusters are dried carefully on the drying floor and preserved in considerable amounts. When wanted, they are cooked into a rich sauce that needs no sweetening. A Cahuilla family during this season of the year will subsist largely on these messes of "sauco. " Frequently, the elderberry was so greatly enjoyed that families would live for weeks on little else. Many were dried {{for use in the}} winter, and were either recooked or eaten raw. Elderberries are still highly prized for food by modern Indian people.
