40|$|Experience {{with the}} use of the Universal Subcutaneous Endoscope (USE) system in {{surgical}} treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome in 35 patients is reported. Patients included in the study had pre- and postoperative clinical and electrophysiological data, and had undergone a minimum follow-up period of 13 months. Mean patient age was 59. 5 years and the mean follow-up period was 25. 9 months. The operation was performed under local anaesthesia without pneumatic tourniquet and on an out-patient basis. A 1. 5 cm portal is made at the cubital tunnel and the USE system is inserted next to the ulnar nerve, first distally and then proximally. The nerve is endoscopically assessed and only the tissue that compresses the nerve is released, in keeping with the principles of minimally invasive treatment. Preoperative tingling sensations disappeared postoperatively in 63 % of cases. Pain and sensory disturbance recovered to normal in 92 % and 89 % of cases, respectively. Abnormal motor nerve conduction velocities improved in 77 %. Abductor digiti minimi weakness MMT 0, 1, 2 in 16 hands recovered to MMT 4 or 5 in eight. First-dorsal interosseous weakness in 18 hands recovered to MMT 4 or 5 in seven. There were no complications in this series. The <b>endoscopic</b> approach facilitates <b>inspection</b> of the ulnar nerve so that selective release of the tissue that compresses the nerve can readily be performed.

40|$|BackgroundThere {{are many}} {{standard}} repair options for choanal atresia including puncture, dilatation and drilling of the atretic plate. Most {{of these techniques}} involve postoperative stenting, which may promote granulation and scarring, with possible progression to restenosis. This article describes a novel approach for choanal atresia repair without postoperative stenting. MethodsThis article describes our experience with this choanal atresia repair technique utilized in 16 pediatric patients and 1 adult patient across multiple tertiary pediatric and rhinology centers during 2008 through 2015. Seven cases were bilateral and 10 were unilateral. Surgery was performed using an endoscopic transseptal approach with preservation of the mucosa and creation of flaps. No stents or packing was used. The main outcome measures were: response to treatment based on endoscopic examination, need for further revision and incidence of complications. ResultsAll patients underwent routine postoperative <b>endoscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of their nasal cavity, postnasal space, and assessment of neochoanal patency. The neochoanae of all patients remained patent to a minimum follow-up duration of 9 months with most patients follow up for 2 years or more. Two neonatal patients required transfusion postoperation from intraoperative bleeding. Two pediatric patients developed postoperative respiratory complications. One patient required revision surgery for nasal vestibule scarring from incision made on the nasal alar to facilitate the initial endoscopic approach. Conclusion This novel endoscopic transseptal repair technique is effective {{in the management of}} choanal atresia. Careful fashioning of mucosal flaps and the omission of stenting has resulted in lasting patency of the neochoana...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{quality of}} Barrett's {{surveillance}} relies on an adequate <b>endoscopic</b> <b>inspection,</b> obtaining {{a sufficient number}} of biopsy specimens, good communication of the endoscopic findings to the pathologist, and an accurate description of the histological findings by the pathologist. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the quality of Barrett's surveillance in daily practice in The Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured scoring list was developed to evaluate systematically the quality of endoscopy and pathology reports. From 15 hospitals, endoscopy reports and corresponding pathology reports were selected randomly and evaluated by two observers. In case of disagreement, the observers re-evaluated the reports in a consensus meeting. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty cases were evaluated. The adherence to current standard biopsy protocols (four quadrant biopsies every 2 cm) decreased with increasing Barrett's length: 0 - 5 cm: 79 %; 5 - 10 cm: 50 %; 10 - 15 cm: 30 %. The indication for the endoscopy was mentioned in 28 % of the pathology reports, in 4 % the presence/absence of oesophagitis was communicated, and in 19 % the location and/or aetiology of biopsies was described. The presence/absence of dysplasia was mentioned in 93 % of pathology reports. CONCLUSION: Endoscopy reports and pathology reports in current practice do not include all relevant information for an adequate Barrett's surveillance. In short Barrett's oesophagus, the adherence to current standard biopsy protocols is acceptable, but in longer segments (with a higher risk for neoplastic progression) this is clearly insufficient.

40|$|Metachronous {{gastric tumor}} (MGT) {{is one of}} major {{concerns}} after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer (EGC). Optimal follow-up strategy has not been yet well-established. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the different clinical features of the patients according to the time interval to development of MGT. Among 1, 780 consecutive patients with EGC who underwent ESD between 2005 and 2014, 115 patients with MGT were retrospectively reviewed. MGT was defined as secondary gastric cancer or dysplasia detected > 1 year after initial ESD. Clinicopathological factors associated with early development of MGT were evaluated. The median interval to development of MGT was 37 months. In univariate analysis, the median interval to MGT was shorter if EGC lesion was non-elevated type (39. 4 vs 57. 0 months, p = 0. 011), or synchronous primary lesion was absent (39. 8 vs 51. 4 months, p = 0. 050). In multivariate Cox's proportional hazards analysis, the hazard ratios for early occurrence of MGT were 1. 966 (95 % CI: 1. 141 - 3. 386, p = 0. 015) and 1. 911 (95 % CI: 1. 163 - 3. 141, p = 0. 011), respectively. There was no significant difference in overall survival after diagnosis of MGT between the early occurrence group and the late occurrence group. Non-elevated gross type and absence of synchronous gastric tumor were independent risk factors for early development of MGT.

40|$|Although gastric {{gastrointestinal}} stromal tumors (GISTs) {{are usually}} identified by endoscopic examinations, the diagnostic value of endoscopy {{has not been}} fully evaluated. We assessed the diagnostic performance of endoscopy for gastric GISTs according to lesion characteristics. Furthermore, the benefits of periodic endoscopy prior to diagnosis of gastric GISTs were evaluated. We reviewed patients who underwent surgery for gastric GISTs at Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, between January 2008 and April 2014. In addition, we administered a questionnaire to determine the usage of periodic <b>endoscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> and the period from the penultimate endoscopy to the diagnosis. Of 174 included patients, 109 (62. 4 %) showed intraluminally growing GISTs and 65 (37. 4 %) showed extraluminally growing GISTs. The proportions of lesions that were initially diagnosed via endoscopy were 99. 1 % for intraluminally growing GISTs and 49. 2 % for extraluminally growing GISTs (P ? 0. 001). In patients with intraluminally growing GISTs, patients who had undergone endoscopy within 3 {{years prior to the}} diagnosis showed smaller tumor sizes (P = 0. 015) and fewer tumors with ulceration (7. 1 vs. 28. 4 %, P = 0. 021). The proportion of GISTs with a high mitotic index did not differ according to the usage of periodic endoscopy (P = 0. 639). In contrast, lesion characteristics of the extraluminally growing GISTs did not differ according to whether an endoscopy was performed within 3 years prior to the diagnosis. Endoscopic examinations had a limited role in the diagnosis of extraluminally growing GISTs. However, periodic endoscopy was associated with relatively earlier detection of growth in intraluminal gastric GISTs...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the rate of complications in maxillary sinus augmentation surgery and the impact of complications on subsequent implant treatment in a patient population with severe maxillary atrophy scheduled for treatment under general anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 70 patients (124 sinuses) with severe maxillary atrophy who underwent maxillary sinus augmentation. Sixteen patients were scheduled to have a unilateral procedure and 54 patients a bilateral procedure. Sinus augmentation was performed with autogenous bone alone in 93 sinuses; in 31 sinuses, a 1 : 1 mixture of autogenous bone and corticocancellous pig bone particles was used. Twenty-six of 124 procedures involved both sinus augmentation and autogenous block grafting for the treatment of severely atrophic maxillae. RESULTS: The most common intraoperative complication was the perforation of the sinus membrane, which was observed in 31 sinuses (25 %). Seven (5. 6 %) sinuses in 7 patients exhibited suppuration of the maxillary sinus. Five of the 7 patients with sinus infection were smokers, showing a prevalence of complications significantly greater in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Moreover, the use of an onlay bone graft in conjunction with sinus augmentation appeared to significantly increase the rate of infective complications. Infections were treated by drainage and the administration of systemic antibiotics. Two clinical cases showing persistent signs of infection required an <b>endoscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of the maxillary sinus. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In the present study sinus membrane perforation was not shown to be a significant factor in the rate of implant complications. However, the combination of smoking and onlay bone grafting could significantly increase the rate of postoperative infection following sinus grafting...|$|E
40|$|After {{radiofrequency}} ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus, it may {{be difficult}} to determine whether complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia at the neosquamocolumnar junction (neo-SCJ) in the cardia has been achieved. It is claimed that narrow band imaging (NBI) may predict the presence of intestinal metaplasia, which would enable immediate treatment. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether inspection of the neo-SCJ with NBI after RFA results in reliable detection of intestinal metaplasia. Patients with a normal-appearing neo-SCJ who were scheduled for RFA were included in the study. Two expert endoscopists obtained images from the neo-SCJ in overview (high resolution white light and NBI mode) and from four areas using NBI zoom, followed by corresponding biopsies. Four other blinded expert endoscopists evaluated the images for the presence of intestinal metaplasia and type of mucosal pattern (round, small tubular, large tubular, villous). Endpoints were sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients and areas with intestinal metaplasia. From 21 patients overview images from 21 neo-SCJs and NBI zoom images from 83 neo-SCJ areas were obtained. Intestinal metaplasia was present in five overview images (24  %) and nine zoom images (11  %). Using the overview images, sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with intestinal metaplasia were 65  % (95  % confidence interval [CI] 38  -  86) and 46  % (95  %CI 33  -  60), respectively.

40|$|Many {{advances}} {{have been made}} in terms of sensor technology for sensitivity optimization. Mostly available optical tactile sensors are bulky, inflexible and lack dexterity for applications with limited or space constraint. In view of this, current tactile sensors cannot be used in <b>endoscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> applications. Hence, this issue aims to provide analysis on the behaviour of a newly developed tactile sensor for sensing surface characteristics as the main objective of the research work. In this research, the main objective of this research work is to analyze the behaviour of a newly developed optical tactile sensor for sensing surface characteristics. In this research, the characteristics of the developed tactile sensor are calibrated with respect to changes in diameter, area, perimeter and centroid of the inner surface deformation when subjected to normal and shear forces at the point of interaction. A surface exploration computer algorithm to obtain the sensing information was developed in order to analyse the characteristic of the optical tactile sensor. The overall image analysis technique involves the following algorithms: image acquisition (capturing of images), processing (thresholding, noise filtering and boundary detection) and recognition (force measurement). The measured forces were then compared with the actual forces to determine the accuracy of the tactile sensor's characteristics. The image acquisition technique provides high quality image resolution while the image analysis algorithm generated a measurement that has good accuracy and recognized image consistently. The outcome of the research showed that the functionality of the newly developed image computer algorithm analysis coupled with the silicone tactile sensor is able to facilitate in biomedical applications such as in endoscopic surgery for measurement of tissue softness thus overcoming some of the current limitations of tactile sensor...|$|E
40|$|Although {{augmentation}} of the maxillary sinus {{floor with}} autogenous bone grafts {{has become a}} well established preimplantology procedure, {{its effect on the}} function of the maxillary sinus has not been the subject of prospective human studies. In this prospective study the effects of sinus floor augmentation on maxillary sinus performance were evaluated. Seventeen consecutive patients who were to undergo augmentation of the maxillary sinus floor with an iliac crest autogenous bone graft agreed to participate in this study. All patients were subject to (i) extensive anamnestic and clinical investigation on sinusitis, (ii) conventional radiography (Waters' projection) and (iii) unilateral <b>endoscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of the maxillary sinus. This triad of evaluations was performed preoperatively, immediately preceding the augmentation procedure (the maxillary sinus to be inspected endoscopically was randomly selected), and at 3 (at insertion of the implants) and 9 months (at uncovering of implants) postaugmentation. None of the 17 patients showed clinical or radiological signs of actual sinus pathology preoperatively, though 5 patients had a history of an impeded sinus clearance. By contrast, unilateral endoscopic evaluation revealed preexisting subclinical mucosal pathology in two out of five patients with a history of sinus clearance impairment and in one out of the other 12 patients. At 3 months' postaugmentation, clinical and radiographical examination showed chronic maxillary sinusitis in one non-compromised patient. Moreover, serial unilateral endoscopic evaluation revealed subclinical maxillary mucosal pathology in four other patients (two of whom had a history of an impeded sinus clearance), confirmed by Waters' projection in three of these four patients. At 9 months' postaugmentation, only subclinical maxillary mucosal pathology was detected endoscopically in two patients (one compromised, one non-compromised patient), confirmed by Waters' projection in this last patient. Five implants were lost during the 9 -month observation period. As is obvious from this prospective evaluation, the effects of the augmentation procedure on maxillary sinus performance in patients without signs of maxillary sinusitis are of no clinical significance...|$|E
40|$|EDITORIAL COMMENT The {{prevalence}} of urinary stone disease is increasing worldwide. The dissemination {{of the clinical}} use of the ultrasound has increased the rate of diagnosis of stones at an earlier stage, thus, has increased {{the expansion of the}} indications for flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS). With the advancements in flexible ureteroscopy (FU), more successful outcomes are being reported. The most recent EAU guidelines state that fURS can be the first choice of treatment for all stones smaller than 2 cm. Especially for the lower pole stones, the stone-free rate is better than that with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. For stones larger than 2 cm, staged procedures may be necessary. This paper recommends a standardized technique for fURS which is aimed to decrease the rate of possible complications and increase the success rate. Endourological techniques are widely adopted by most of the urological surgeons, hence fURS is an expansion of our surgical armamentarium. In this paper, an experienced group recommended some tips and tricks for each step of the procedure. The authors recommended general anesthesia over spinal anesthesia for two reasons: larger tidal volume during spinal anesthesia may cause movement, which can make the procedure harder. Secondly, the duration of the spinal anesthesia may be too short for some cases. Placement of ureteral access sheath (UAS) should be done under fluoroscopic guidance and proper force should be applied. Ideally, the distal tip of the UAS should be just below the ureteropelvic junction. For preventing functional deterioration of the FU, the tip of the laser probe should be out of the scope as far as one-quarter of the screen diameter. For preventing excessive prolonged deflections, the stones in the lower pole should be repositioned in order to allow a more straight working channel. Pulverization of the stone is preferred over fragmentation since it decreases the operative time and risk of injury during removal of the fragments. A power setting of low frequency (10 - 15 Hz) and high energy (1 - 2 J) is recommended for kidney stones. It is advised to keep the laser tip 1 - 2 mm to the stone and start from the outer part of the stone rather than causing holes and tunnels in the center, which leads to larger fragments. The use of small fiber diameters (200 - 275 nm) is recommended. However, since they are more prone to fiber degradation, it should be cleaved at each 10 minutes of firing with a simple metallic scissor by protruding from the tip of the FU without removing and replacing the laser probe. When extraction of fragments is necessary, zero tip nitinol baskets are recommended. The most important exit strategy is <b>endoscopic</b> <b>inspection</b> of the ureter wall during the removal of UAS by keeping the tip of the scope a few centimeters out of the UAS. Routine stenting whenever a UAS has been used is recommended. When the surgery is uneventful, and the endoscopic examination of the ureter seems normal, short-term stenting is offered...|$|E
