5|$|The Sugababes {{are shown}} {{standing}} {{together in the}} next scene, where they are presented in a dark environment and covered in glitter. Range is represented as the season of autumn, and is decorated with a leaf motif on <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> well as hair that resembles tree branches. The subsequent clip depicts Berrabah in a winter environment. The group is shown together for a second time, although in a natural environment. The next scenes depict Buchanan in the centre of a large purple flower, and leaves blowing past Range. Towards {{the end of the}} video, the Sugababes are shown in the same dark environment and eventually in their solo settings. Mickey McMonagle from the Sunday Mail praised the group's seasonal outfits in the video.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} purple liquid forming the word 'JANET'. Jackson is then shown {{sitting on top of}} a planet in outer space, wearing a {{bodysuit}} adorned with jewelry, long ponytail, and mask. Various asteroids and dancers mounting planets in black latex attire and helmets are shown. Jackson flips her ponytail, revealing <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> cosmic dust is tossed about. Several dancers leap to other planets as Jackson descends to a cratered surface, performing abstract choreography with two dancers. Jackson jumps to another setting, shown in slow motion as the audio is filtered, landing on a white liquid surface with a crimson atmosphere. Backed by eight dancers, Jackson performs the song's choreography as various objects crash into the liquid. Jackson and the dancers fall into the liquid, with Jackson reemerging in a red catsuit. Jackson then performs a dance routine with six glowing spheres. The final sphere ascends upward as fourteen white liquid objects explode.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|Citizen {{witnesses}} {{said that no}} first aid appeared to be offered to Morris, nor were any apparent efforts made to stabilize her head before moving her or placing her in the ambulance. Witnesses also said that before Morris {{was placed in the}} ambulance, Officer Berry used Morris' jacket to cover <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> if to indicate that she was already dead.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 revival {{starring}} Bernadette Peters, {{the final}} dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise {{walks through the}} stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> she takes {{one last look at}} the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.|$|E
25|$|Yeo Yann Yann as Mei: Although the {{producers}} were unacquainted with Yann Yann, they used <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> a reference when {{writing for the}} character, Mei. Back in Singapore, Yann Yann accepted their offer to cast as Mei. In the film, Mei is the underappreciated daughter of the family, married to CK, whom she occasionally henpecks. Indignant that Seng was sent overseas when {{she was the one}} whose academic performance was more distinguished, she bears a patent grudge against Seng.|$|E
60|$|She turned towards him. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was <b>as</b> {{cold and}} {{destitute}} of emotion as the stone {{on which she}} sat.|$|R
60|$|Her voice died away, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> burnt <b>as</b> {{she looked}} down; {{but a few}} words of {{interest}} led her on.|$|R

25|$|To explore these {{questions}} through her art, Kahlo developed a complex iconography, extensively employing pre-Columbian and Christian symbols and mythology in her paintings. In {{most of her}} self-portraits, she depicts <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> mask-like, but surrounded by visual cues which allow the viewer to decipher deeper meanings for it. Aztec mythology in particular features heavily in Kahlo's paintings {{in the form of}} symbols like monkeys, skeletons, skulls, blood, and hearts; often these symbols referred to the myths of Coatlicue, Quetzalcoatl, and Xolotl. Other central elements that Kahlo derived from Aztec mythology were hybridity and dualism. Many of her paintings depict opposites: life and death, pre-modernity and modernity, Mexican and European, male and female.|$|E
500|$|When mature, Chicado V stood [...] tall. She was a brown mare, with a {{connected}} star, stripe, and snip on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> {{her only}} markings, or identifying marks. [...] Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing {{career as a}} groom for Vessels, had the care of ChicadoV after she was born, and said of her that she [...] "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke." [...] When she stood in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said {{she looked like a}} rabbit, because [...] "she had big ears and that's all you could see, she was so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E
500|$|Mahesh Bhatt, {{with whom}} she first worked in Kaash (1987), remarked that Kapadia [...] "has gone through so much in her life that she need not read up the text books of method acting to play a real woman." [...] Speaking of her venture into art cinema years later, Bhatt commended her for not turning into [...] "a victim of her own success" [...] by refusing to become [...] "a part of the money-making machine". Mrinal Sen, who {{directed}} her in Antareen (1994), compared her to Sophia Loren and described <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a landscape of desolation". According to Drishti (1990) director Govind Nihalani, Kapadia is [...] "genuinely interested in doing serious work, something that challenges her talent." [...] Following her success with Rudaali, a 1993 edition of Asiaweek reported that by this time Kapadia had long been [...] "a critic's darling".|$|E

500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich deemed the episode {{a tribute to}} Lady Gaga's [...] "genius", explaining that the costumes the characters wear are not exact replicas of Gaga's, giving the impression the glee club members made them themselves. Rachel wears two dresses, the first inspired by Gaga's Kermit the Frog dress and the second based on Gaga's silver mirrored triangle dress. Murphy selected Tina to wear the Hussein Chalayan–inspired bubble dress, which Eyrich adapted into a vest {{to make it easier}} to take on and off. Kurt's costume is inspired by the Alexander McQueen outfit Gaga wears in the [...] "Bad Romance" [...] video, described by Colfer as [...] "George Washington meets an Oceanic whale disco ball type thing". Eyrich strove for authenticity in replicating McQueen's ten-inch 'Armadillo' platforms. She was unable to buy a pair to fit Colfer, as they were not made in large enough sizes. Quinn wears the Armani Privé orbit dress Gaga wore to the 52nd Grammy Awards, fitted around her pregnant stomach. The most complicated costume was the Philip Treacy lobster hat, worn by Brittany (Heather Morris), as to get it to stay in place during the [...] "Bad Romance" [...] dance, Eyrich had to build a Buckram orb which could be safety–pinned on her head, then solder steel tentacles onto the sphere. It took 45 minutes to get the hat on and off Morris each day, and restricted her vision to what was directly in front of her. In solidarity with Kurt, Finn wears a vinyl floor–length red dress, based on the latex Atsuko Kudo dress Gaga wore to meet Elizabeth II. Mercedes wears a glittery bodysuit and a purple hair bow and wig, and Santana wears the Jeffrey Bryant lace bodysuit, and black rose Charlie Le Mindu hat, with lace airbrushed onto <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> mentioned in the episode, members of Vocal Adrenaline wear red Chantilly lace full-body outfits and headpieces (as well as blonde wigs) inspired by the Fall 1998 Alexander McQueen dress Gaga wore whilst accepting her award for Best New Artist at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Lilly is not {{considered}} to be very pretty; Mia often describes <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> being [...] "squashed in like a pug's". Lilly does however have a well-developed figure which earns her several romantic suitors including Boris Pelkowski, Mia's cousin Hank, Jangbu, J.P. Reynolds, and Kenny Showalter.|$|E
2500|$|Karolína Kurková ( [...] ; born 28 February 1984), also Karolina Kurkova, is a Czech model, {{best known}} as a former Victoria's Secret Angel, and actress. Mario Testino praised the [...] "proportions of her body and <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> well as her energy level", which he said [...] "ma her a model who could fit almost into any moment". Vogue editor Anna Wintour called her the [...] "next supermodel".|$|E

2500|$|In an April 15 {{interview}} with Elizabeth Vargas for ABC's 20/20, Lane stated: [...] "I didn't really specify {{anything in my}} contract about getting onscreen credit or anything ... I didn't do the movie to get fame or recognition or anything." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not speaking because I feel like I should be heralded .... I'm speaking because [...] are completely lying {{about the amount of}} dancing Natalie did in the movie. When those incorrect things are coming out, and they threaten the entire principle of ballet, then I feel like I need to say something." [...] When Vargas asked if it is possible that both interpretations of the [...] "math" [...] can be correct, Lane responded: [...] "It's possible, like I said, if you're counting the close-ups of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> actual dancing shots. But I don't call close-ups of her face actual dancing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Corby {{was taken}} from her prison to a Bali {{hospital}} in June 2008 to be treated for depression. In July 2008, she was permitted to leave her hospital ward under armed guard to visit a beauty salon located within the hospital grounds to have her hair done and for a pedicure. While {{she was at the}} salon, word of her presence got out and, upon leaving the salon, Corby was faced with a large number of reporters. She attempted to hide <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> she left the salon and her doctor stated that her condition was [...] "back to zero" [...] and that additional treatment for depression would be needed. On 9 July 2008, she was returned to the prison, ending a stay of {{two and a half weeks}} in the hospital. Corby was again taken to the hospital on 22 May 2009 for depression.|$|E
2500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was directed and produced by Tomu Izawa, and despite Utada's previous musical work, {{it is her}} visual debut. The visual opens with a small intro screen of Utada and the songs title, and disappears to show Utada sitting and singing on a yellow sofa, {{in front of a}} closed garage door. As the chourus, she starts to dance with various close-up shots of her face. The second verse and chorus showcases Utada in a small blue room lit by a LED light, and superimposed the songs title on various scenes. It ends with the singers title against <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> the screen is tinted blue. The clip was included on her 1999 DVD collection Singles Clip Collection Vol. 1, and subsequently on the 15th anniversary edition of First Love, which included all the visuals from the record. The yellow sofa and garage door scene was parodied in Halcali's single [...] "Tandem", and subsequently through Utada's single [...] "Goodbye Happiness" [...] (Nov 2010), which she directed herself.|$|E

2500|$|It was in 1898 {{that the}} first Western pilgrims visited `Abdu'l-Bahá and Bahíyyih in Palestine. The westerners {{included}} Phoebe Hearst, Lua Getsinger, Ella Goodall Cooper, the first African-American Bahá’í Robert Turner, the very young May Maxwell, amongst others. Despite her poor health, Bahíyyih Khánum received these pilgrims. The pilgrimage profoundly affected Bahíyyih Khánum and {{was a source of}} happiness for `Abdu’l-Bahá's family in the penal-colony. Due to cultural and religious reasons of Acre Bahíyyih spent much of her time with the female pilgrims rather than the male ones. Ella Goodall Cooper describes her as [...] "tall, slender and of noble bearing" [...] and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> [...] "feminine counterpart of `Abdu'l-Bahá's" [...] with [...] "understanding eyes". The pilgrims remembered her quietness, demure and gentle behaviour. Lady Blomfield writes that Bahíyyih Khánum was [...] "passionately attached", to her brother and the memory of her parents. She describes her [...] "sense of humour", and [...] "remarkable" [...] intelligence. Shortly after the pilgrimage, Bahíyyih wrote a letter to a Persian Bahá'í woman writing: ...|$|E
2500|$|Pocahontas and Rolfe {{lived in}} the suburb of Brentford, Middlesex, for some time, {{as well as at}} Rolfe's family home at Heacham Hall, Heacham, Norfolk. In early 1617, Smith met the couple at a social gathering, and later wrote that when Pocahontas saw him, [...] "without any words, she turned about, {{obscured}} <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> not seeming well contented", and was left alone for two or three hours. Later, they spoke more; Smith's record of what she said to him is fragmentary and enigmatic. She reminded him of the [...] "courtesies she had done", saying, [...] "you did promise Powhatan what was yours would be his, and he the like to you". She then discomfited him by calling him [...] "father", explaining Smith had called Powhatan [...] "father" [...] when a stranger in Virginia, [...] "and by the same reason so must I do you". Smith did not accept this form of address because, he wrote, Pocahontas outranked him as [...] "a King's daughter". Pocahontas then, [...] "with a well-set countenance", said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
