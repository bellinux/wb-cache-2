5|$|Bulk cargo {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems {{has been linked to}} a spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large <b>hatchways,</b> important for efficient cargo handling. New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E
5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the <b>hatchways</b> leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down <b>hatchways</b> and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E

Compact three-degree-of-freedom mechanism guides hatch through <b>hatchway</b> or holds hatch {{off to one side}} to facilitate passage of crew and/or equipment.

6000|$|... "Very {{carefully}} {{we brought}} packages and bales under the <b>hatchway,</b> till we {{built up a}} sort of platform about four feet below it. We reckoned that, standing as thick as we could there, and all lifting together, we could make sure of hoisting the <b>hatchway</b> up, and could then spring out in a moment.|$|R
25|$|On 22 May Telegraph {{came into}} Plymouth. A gale {{a few days}} earlier had put Telegraph on her beam ends for several minutes with water up to the combing of her <b>hatchways.</b> It was only when the fore top-mast and the {{bowsprit}} went that she righted.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April, while about 30 miles to the {{south-east}} of Cape St. Sebastian, thick smoke was seen coming from the fore and main <b>hatchways.</b> Attempts were made to find {{the source of the}} fire but no flames could be discovered. Orders were given to throw the ship's gunpowder overboard and an unsuccessful attempt was made to flood the magazine.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{there are}} two {{platforms}} above ground level, accessed by near-vertical timber steps and <b>hatchways</b> in the floors. The tower framework features original components, including: 140mm x 100mm timber stud work; circular girts made from beech; a combination of diagonal timber bracing and steel spiral strapping; timber floor joists on each level supported on a circular steel angle; and floors lined with wide tongue and groove boards. A small number of timber components were replaced after the 1999 move when the tower was damaged, and some steel bracket work was installed. The steel, angled bottom plate and tie-down brackets bolting the structure to the slab also date from , with some original brackets remaining as examples. Some early timber shelving remains, {{as well as some}} of the 1940s electrical conduit, wiring and switches (no longer in use). Signage and a safety strap on the top ladder have been introduced since restoration of the structure in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|After {{struggling}} {{to fight the}} fire for about 7 hours, but when they were still [...] from shore, flames suddenly erupted from the <b>hatchways.</b> The crew was able to run Hindostan aground in Rosas Bay, {{about a mile from}} the Fort of Ampurius and the Church of Saint Peter. By the time she beached, about [...] from the shore, she was completely aflame. Local vessels were initially afraid to approach too closely, but using the ship's own boats and an improvised raft, the ship's passengers and crew were saved shortly before the ship blew up.|$|E
2500|$|Boreas was {{commissioned}} {{for the first}} time in August 1757 under Captain Robert Boyle, who was to command her for the next two years. Her rigging and fitout were completed by September and she was sailed to Portsmouth to take on her guns. Flaws in her design were apparent even at this early stage; in December 1757 Captain Boyle advised Admiralty that the fir planks adjacent to the <b>hatchways</b> were already badly worn, as were the strakes along the hull. Boyle unsuccessfully recommended that the hatchway timbers and the hull be re-covered with elm. He also observed that the aft hatchway had been constructed directly above the entrance to the magazine, which [...] "may be of fatal consequence in time of action." [...] Further, the sides of the vessel above the level of the deck were too low, leaving the crew exposed to enemy fire should Boreas run alongside an opposing ship.|$|E
6000|$|Happily a fresh {{burst of}} riotous clamour, {{from one of}} the <b>hatchways,</b> {{interrupted}} the intention; and then was heard the cry of,--- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{pointed down}} the <b>hatchway,</b> where the {{complication}} of rods and cranks glistened in the hold.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will do rarely," [...] Adolphe said, {{when it was}} {{finished}} and the <b>hatchway</b> experimentally placed in its position. [...] "Now, {{all you have to}} do is just to knock the ends of the beams off their ledges. The bit we have cut out will fall down, and you will be able easily enough to lift the <b>hatchway</b> from its place. It is no great weight now.|$|R
60|$|He quitted the <b>hatchway,</b> and led {{his companions}} toward the {{accommodations}} in {{the stern of}} the vessel.|$|R
60|$|The {{bursting}} of a thunder-clap, {{the explosion}} of a powder-magazine, could not have more effectually awakened the slumberers than this abrupt stoppage of the ship's engines. Instantly all the <b>hatchways</b> poured forth anxious inquirers.|$|E
60|$|The <b>hatchways</b> of some armed {{vessels are}} but poorly secured in bad weather. This was peculiarly {{the ease with}} those of the Neversink. They were merely spread over with an old tarpaulin, cracked and rent in every direction.|$|E
60|$|But {{all this}} availed not {{to check the}} flames. The men were quickly driven upon deck, and it soon became evident that the vessel must perish. The fire burst through the <b>hatchways,</b> and {{in a short time}} began to leap up the rigging.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that all}} {{immediate}} danger {{was at an}} end, the marquis took the tiller, and Rupert lifted the <b>hatchway.</b>|$|R
60|$|Once {{the boys}} heard {{somebody}} at the forward <b>hatchway,</b> and presently the hatch was lifted {{for a few}} inches.|$|R
50|$|Carling {{knees are}} timbers going traversely, {{from the sides}} to the <b>hatchway,</b> serving to sustain the deck on both sides.|$|R
60|$|That same night, {{when the}} first watch was set, the men in a body drove the two boatswain's mates from their {{stations}} at the fore and main <b>hatchways,</b> and unshipped the ladders; thus cutting off all communication between the gun and spar decks, forward of the main-mast.|$|E
60|$|We had {{scarcely}} time to draw breath {{after the}} violence of this shock, {{when one of the}} most tremendous waves I had then ever known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way clear off, bursting in the <b>hatchways,</b> and filling every inch of the vessel with water.|$|E
60|$|At length, {{when the}} last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great <b>hatchways</b> are unsealed, {{the bowels of the}} ship are thrown open, and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are replaced, and {{hermetically}} closed, like a closet walled up.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, {{the next}} thing to do," [...] Harry said, [...] "is to fix the beams so as to hold the wood in its place again." [...] Four pieces of wood, each three inches long, were screwed against the combing of the <b>hatchway</b> in such a {{position}} that when the beams were placed upon them they were exactly level with the top, and supported the piece cut out from the <b>hatchway</b> in its original position.|$|R

60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour; and yet no response. The moon is shining clearly now. They can see her <b>hatchways,</b> the stumps of her masts, great tangles of rigging swaying and lashing down across her deck; but that {{delicate}} upper curve is becoming more ragged after every wave; and the tide is rising fast.|$|E
60|$|Sir Oliver {{sat down}} upon a coil of rope, his guard about him, {{an object of}} curious {{inspection}} to the rude seamen. They thronged the forecastle and the <b>hatchways</b> to stare at this formidable corsair who once had been a Cornish gentleman and who had become a renegade Muslim and a terror to Christianity.|$|E
6000|$|Morning {{brings a}} summons. Whistling it calls, Shrilled through the pipes of the boatswain's [...] four aids; Trilled down the <b>hatchways</b> along the dusk [...] halls: Muster to the Scourge!--Dawn of doom and [...] its blast! As from cemeteries raised, sailors swarm before [...] the mast, Tumbling up the ladders from the ship's nether [...] shades.|$|E
60|$|With caution {{they came}} up behind the man, and just as Groot leaned over the open <b>hatchway,</b> they caught him tightly.|$|R
