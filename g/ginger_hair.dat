It can be found with {{a wide array of}} skin tones and eye colors, but {{as is the case with}} most red hair, it is commonly associated with light skin features. The chemical pigments that cause the coloration of auburn hair are frequently pheomelanin with high levels of eumelanin, however the auburn hair is due to a mutated melanocortin 1 receptor gene in the people of Northwestern European descent and by a mutated TYRP1 gene in the Austronesians, both genes that reduce the melanin production of the hair cells.|$|R

After Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade arrive, the three bump into two first-years (one of whom reminds Mildred very strongly of someone, the other with <b>ginger</b> frizzy <b>hair</b> in bunches). The one who seems familiar bursts into tears and clings onto Mildred when she hears {{that many of the}} teachers (including Miss Hardbroom) are quite strict. Mildred also accidentally slips a made-up story about Miss Hardbroom turning a student into a frog when she was just two seconds late for a lesson.

60|$|Mrs. Denton was helpful, {{and would}} have been more so, if Joan had only understood. Mrs. Denton lived alone in an old house in Gower Street, with a high stone hall that was always echoing to sounds that no one but itself could ever hear. Her son had settled, it was supposed, in one of the Colonies. No one knew what had become of him, and Mrs. Denton herself never spoke of him; while her daughter, on whom she had centred all her {{remaining}} hopes, had died years ago. To those who remembered the girl, with her weak eyes and wispy <b>ginger</b> coloured <b>hair,</b> it would have seemed comical, the idea that Joan resembled her. But Mrs. Denton's memory had lost itself in dreams; and to her the likeness had appeared quite wonderful. The gods had given her child back to her, grown strong and brave and clever. Life would have a new meaning for her. Her work would not die with her.|$|R

40|$|Ginger (Zingiber officinale) {{has been}} {{traditionally}} used to check hair loss and stimulate hair growth in East Asia. Several companies produce shampoo containing an extract of ginger {{claimed to have}} anti-hair loss and hair growth promotion properties. However, {{there is no scientific}} evidence to back up these claims. This study was undertaken to measure 6 -gingerol, the main active component of <b>ginger,</b> on <b>hair</b> shaft elongation in vitro and hair growth in vivo, and to investigate its effect on human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in vivo and in vitro. 6 -Gingerol suppressed hair growth in hair follicles in culture and the proliferation of cultured DPCs. The growth inhibition of DPCs by 6 -gingerol in vitro may reflect a decrease in the Bcl- 2 /Bax ratio. Similar results were obtained in vivo. The results of this study showed that 6 -gingerol does not have the ability to promote hair growth, on the contrary, can suppress human hair growth via its inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects on DPCs in vitro, and can cause prolongation of telogen phase in vivo. Thus, 6 -gingerol rather than being a hair growt...|$|R

In these writings, Maclean {{was referred to as}} John Ross, possibly a nickname on account of his <b>ginger</b> <b>hair,</b> though it has been alleged that Isaacs invented that name because he had forgotten Maclean's real name.|$|E
