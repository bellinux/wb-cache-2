5|$|Citygarden's plants, {{including}} various <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> wildflowers, {{were selected}} by the Missouri Botanical Garden.

Although <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts. In open, uncultivated areas of the plains, grasses such as buffalograss, western wheatgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem and little bluestem thrive.|$|E

It may eat {{the flowers and}} shoots of <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> other plants, and will take fallen apples and plums. It forages within its breeding habitat and in open fields, sometimes sharing these feeding areas with redwings or fieldfares.|$|E
30|$|Fuel {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> tree leaf litter. Fuel characteristics were {{described by the}} following variables before fires were applied: fuel load (kg m− 2), moisture content (%), <b>and</b> <b>grass</b> height (cm). Fuel was collected on ten 1  m 2 quadrats per plot shortly (minutes) before burning. Fuel was separated into litter (fallen dead <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> tree leaves) and standing fuel (standing <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> stems), and immediately weighed for fresh mass. Samples were oven-dried at 80  °C to constant weight and weighed for dry mass. Moisture content was then calculated.

40|$|Recently we have {{demonstrated}} that <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> cut <b>grass</b> are important sources of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions into the atmosphere. The production of these VOCs {{can be traced back}} to plant growth, maintenance and wound defence mechanisms. The gases emitted as part of these wound defence mechanisms are responsible for the smell of freshly cut <b>grass,</b> <b>and</b> are also highly photochemically reactive. These emissions from <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> cut <b>grass</b> are not currently included in urban and global emissions inventories. Our preliminary estimate is that, within an urban airshed, during the growing season, about one third of the emissions of photochemically reactive VOCs come from <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> cut <b>grass.</b> These grass emissions should be included in models of urban photochemical pollution so that accurate smog predictions can be obtained...|$|R
