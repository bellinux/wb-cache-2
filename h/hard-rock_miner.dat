40|$|This video showcases Jim Mortensen, a "gypo" miner {{for nearly}} 40 {{years in a}} deep, {{underground}} silver mine in the west. Jim is paid for what he produces and consistently out-produces {{everyone else in the}} area. He has never lost a day to a lost-time injury. In the video, Jim explains to a young miner, Ted, what he has learned over the years. He tells young Ted how to survive and how to do the job right. He discusses such things as proper work practices and personal protective equipment, and at the same time, provides valuable lessons on {{what it means to be}} a <b>hard-rock</b> <b>miner.</b> Jim is a master and is highly credible as a trainer. This video runs 33 minutes., and while it is filmes in a hardrock enviroment, it's and ecxellent introduction to the necessary interaction between working safely and working hard in any mine.

50|$|Beyond mining in general, radon is a {{particular}} problem in the mining of uranium;significant excess lung cancer deaths {{have been identified in}} epidemiological studies of uranium <b>miners</b> and other <b>hard-rock</b> <b>miners</b> employed in the 1940s and 1950s. Residues from processing of uranium ore can also be a source of radon. Radon resulting from the high radium content in uncovered dumps and tailing ponds can be easily released into the atmosphere.|$|R
5000|$|Big Bend grew slowly {{until the}} late 1930s, when Pacific Gas and Electric Company began {{construction}} on the [...] and Pit Five Power House. The dam construction brought thousands of jobs and people to Big Bend. This included engineers, builders, tunnel diggers (around 2000 <b>hard-rock</b> <b>miners),</b> and service workers to the area. Big Bend saw a [...] "boom and bust" [...] cycle, and the population was declining by the late 1940s, after the dam work was completed. Although {{the maintenance of the}} hydroelectric facilities and a large commercial logging industry still require numerous employees, almost all of the people working in such jobs live outside of Big Bend, contributing further to the population decline.|$|R
40|$|In 1909 - 10 the Queensland Parliamentary Labor Party was {{rebuilding}} {{its strength}} from the Opposition benches after a damaging split with its former leader, William Kidston, who continued as premier in alliance with more conservative politicians. Reflecting the cocnerns of <b>hard-rock</b> <b>miners,</b> the party campaigned to ameliorate the occupational disease silicosis (miners' phthisis). In December 1910 a Royal Commission {{was appointed to}} enquire into this 'evil', This opportunity was squandered by the commission's conservative findings, the government's action in placing responsibility for dust suppression on tributers and contractors and the reluctance of mining unions to alientate the latter groups by making silicosis an industrial issue.

40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is one of}} the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both industrialized and developing countries. Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for COPD. However, relevant information from the literature published within the last years, either on general population samples or on workplaces, indicate that about 15 % of all cases of COPD is work-related. Specific settings and agents are quoted which have been indicated or confirmed as linked to COPD. Coal <b>miners,</b> <b>hard-rock</b> <b>miners,</b> tunnel workers, concrete-manufacturing workers, nonmining industrial workers have been shown to be at highest risk for developing COPD. Further evidence that occupational agents are capable of inducing COPD comes from experimental studies, particularly in animal models. In conclusion, occupational exposure to dusts, chemicals, gases should be considered an established, or supported by good evidence, risk factor for developing COPD. The implications of this substantial occupational contribution to COPD must be considered in research planning, in public policy decision-making, and in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the large}} variety of subtypes of chronic cough, either defined by their {{clinical}} or pathogenetic causes, occupational chronic cough may {{be regarded as}} one of the most preventable forms of the disease. Next to obstructive airway diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are sometimes concomitant with chronic cough, this chronic airway disease gains importance in the field of occupational medicine since classic fiber-related occupational airway diseases will decrease in the future. Apart from acute accidents and incidental exposures which may lead to an acute form of cough, there are numerous sources for the development of chronic cough within the workplace. Over the last years, a large number of studies has focused on occupational causes of respiratory diseases and it has emerged that chronic cough is one of the most prevalent work-related airway diseases. Best-known examples of occupations related to the development of cough are coal <b>miners,</b> <b>hard-rock</b> <b>miners,</b> tunnel workers, or concrete manufacturing workers. As chronic cough is often based on a variety of non-occupational factors such as tobacco smoke, a distinct separation into either occupational or personally -evoked can be difficult. However, revealing the occupational contribution to chronic cough and to the symptom cough in general, which is the commonest cause for the consultation of a physician, can significantly lead to a reduction of the socioeconomic burden of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The lure {{of gold in}} {{the great}} reefs of Johannesburg {{near the end of}} the 19 th century not only {{attracted}} the famous mining barons such as Cecil John Rhodes, Alfred Beit and Barney Barnato: working men also came from far and wide to feed their families with their labour. Among them was my great-grandfather, the miner from the Isle of Man, William Cogeen. He arrived via the tin mines of Cornwall and the silver mines of Colorado, and was among those Uitlanders who flocked in those early days to the Transvaal as skilled artisans - wheelwrights, farriers, bricklayers and, especially, experienced <b>hard-rock</b> <b>miners.</b> It was their labour, as well as of black tribesmen from all over southern Africa, that laid the financial foundation for what became the rich city of Johannesburg. It was also their influx that was the excuse that precipitated the Anglo-Boer War. His wife and daughters joined him in what was still a rough boom town, and they stayed on, until forced to flee as refugees from Johannesburg at the start of the war in 1899. Intrigued by the stories my mother and grandmother told me as a child, I began to research my familyâ€™s history and travelled to the Isle of Man, Cornwall and Colorado to trace their origins - and my own. This is the remarkable story of what happened to an ordinary working-class family who lived in extraordinary times, and my journey in their footsteps...|$|R
