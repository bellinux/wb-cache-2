Small fine grasses especially sheep's fescue, with fine-leaved sheep's fescue, hard fescue, squirrel-tail fescue, early hair-grass. Herbs include sheep's sorrel, mouse-eared <b>hawkweed,</b> cat's ear and yarrow.|$|E
5|$|This former quarry has undulating {{calcareous}} grassland which is grazed by rabbits and cattle. It has a rich variety of flora, including sheep's fescue, dwarf thistle, mouse-ear <b>hawkweed,</b> wild thyme and common rock-rose. There are many bryophytes and lichens.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{cochineal}} {{lives on}} herbaceous plants growing in sandy and arid, infertile soils. Its primary host plant is the perennial knawel (Scleranthus perennis), {{but it has}} also been known to feed on plants of 20 other genera, including mouse-ear <b>hawkweed</b> (Hieracium pilosella), bladder campion (Silene inflata), velvet bent (Agrostis canina), Caragana, smooth rupturewort (Herniaria glabra), strawberry (Fragaria), and cinquefoil (Potentilla).|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on plantains, hawkbits, <b>hawkweeds,</b> {{and other}} low-growing plants.|$|R

5|$|Radyr <b>hawkweed</b> is {{the common}} name of Hieracium radyrense, a very rare endemic member of the aster, daisy, or {{sunflower}} family. It is a microspecies, so far only identified at Radyr. It was first identified in 1907 at the quarry, {{was described as a}} variety in 1948 and then as a separate species in 1955. It has rarely been seen and regular surveys between 1998 and 2004 indicate that today only a single population of about 25 plants survives in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{the species}} nor the sites have any current legal protection, {{and it could}} be under {{significant}} threat of survival in the long term from inappropriate gardening or care. Seed samples of the Radyr <b>hawkweed</b> have been provided to the Millennium Seed Bank, the international conservation project coordinated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and plants are being carefully cultivated. The plant normally flowers between May and early July and Radyr residents are urged by botanists to be on the look out for further examples of the endangered species while walking in the area.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} heath grass (Danthonia decumbens), pill sedge (Carex pilulifera), mat grass (Nardus stricta), fine-leaved sheep's-fescue (Festuca filiformis), mouse-ear <b>hawkweed</b> (Hieracium pilosella) and field wood-rush (Luzula campestris). Clay heaths have become very rare within the Lüneburg Heath. They are found on the Wilseder Berg and south of Niederhaverbeck.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, <b>hawkweeds</b> are {{invasive}} pests in alpine regions, {{all species}} of Hieracium are listed or declared under various State Acts.|$|R
50|$|Other {{plants with}} superficially similar flowers include <b>hawkweeds</b> (Hieracium) and hawksbeards (Crepis). These are readily {{distinguished}} by branched flowering stems, {{which are usually}} hairy and bear leaves.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{mainly on}} Cichorieae, such as Cichorium (chicories), Hieracium (<b>hawkweeds)</b> and Picris (oxtongues), {{but also on}} Plantago (plantain herbs). More unusually, they have been {{recorded}} to feed on plant refuse and dry leaves.|$|R
25|$|At least 15 {{species and}} genera, both living and extinct, {{have been named}} in Attenborough's honour. Plants named after him include an alpine <b>hawkweed</b> (Hieracium attenboroughianum) {{discovered}} in the Brecon Beacons, a species of Ecuadorian flowering tree (Blakea attenboroughi), one of the world's largest-pitchered carnivorous plants (Nepenthes attenboroughii), along with a genus of flowering plants (Sirdavidia). Arthropods named after Attenborough include a butterfly, Attenborough's black-eyed satyr (Euptychia attenboroughi), a dragonfly, Attenborough's pintail, (Acisoma attenboroughi), the millimetre-long goblin spider Prethopalpus attenboroughi, an Indonesian flightless weevil (Trigonopterus attenboroughi), and a Madagascan ghost shrimp (Ctenocheloides attenboroughi). Vertebrates have also been named after Attenborough, including the Namibian lizard Platysaurus attenboroughi, the bird Polioptila attenboroughi, the Peruvian frog Pristimantis attenboroughi and one of only four species of long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus attenboroughi).|$|E
2500|$|The Amrum {{forest was}} mainly planted in 1948 on {{an area of}} heath. Until then only a few forested regions could be found around the decoy ponds. With 180 hectares, Amrum has the largest ratio of forested land of all Germany's North Sea islands. Mainly pines, firs and birches can be found here. Meanwhile, the forest has largely lost its {{artificial}} nature. So one will encounter numerous plants on all levels and many species of fungi. The [...] "geestland", east of the forest, is mostly used for farming. Its grassland grows plants such as Harebell (Campanula rotundifolia), Sea Thrift (Armeria maritima) and Carthusian Pink (Dianthus carthusianorum) and several species of <b>hawkweed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the weather}} and the poverty of the soil, the plateau is mostly heath and bare dirt with only a few common juniper shrubs and some moor birches. The {{principal}} vascular plants one encounters are snowbed willow, Alpine bearberry, Alpine <b>hawkweed,</b> crowberry, cowberry, blue whortleberry and alpine azalea. But that which renders the vegetation of the Fulufjället plateau particularly unique in Sweden is its richness in lichens, with in particular the vast carpets of reindeer lichen and of fönsterlav, not affected there by the pasture of domestic reindeer, unlike most of the Swedish mountains. It is also in these inaccessible areas that one finds Old Tjikko, a Norway spruce [...] old, {{making it one of the}} oldest trees in the world.|$|E
50|$|The larva is {{brown or}} green with darker {{diamonds}} along the back. It feeds on {{the flowers and}} buds of various yellow-flowered Asteraceae such as hawksbeards, <b>hawkweeds</b> and sow thistles. The species overwinters as a pupa.|$|R

2500|$|The shaded {{and moist}} {{northern}} {{slopes of the}} massif like, for example, the Wettersteinwald, {{are some of the}} most species-rich environments on the Zugspitze. The mountain pine grows at elevations of up to [...] 1,800metres. The woods lower down consist mainly of spruce and fir, but honeysuckle, woodruff, poisonous herb paris, meadow-rue and speedwell also occur here. Dark columbine, alpine clematis, blue and yellow monkshood, stemless carline thistle, false aster, golden cinquefoil, round-leaved saxifrage, wall <b>hawkweed,</b> alpine calamint and alpine forget-me-not flower in the less densely wooded places, whilst cinquefoil, sticky sage, butterbur, alpenrose, Turk's cap lily and fly orchid thrive on the rocky soils of the mountain forests. Lily of the valley and daphne also occur, especially in the Höllental, in Grainau and by the Eibsee.|$|E

40|$|Mendel used <b>hawkweeds</b> {{and other}} plants to verify the laws of {{inheritance}} he discovered using Pisum. Trait segregation was not evident in <b>hawkweeds</b> because many form seeds asexually by apomixis. Meiosis does not occur during female gametophyte formation and the mitotically formed embryo sacs do not require fertilization for seed development. The resulting progeny retain a maternal genotype. <b>Hawkweeds</b> in Hieracium subgenus Pilosella form mitotic embryo sacs by apospory. The initiation of sexual reproduction is required to stimulate apospory in ovules and to promote {{the function of the}} dominant locus, LOSS OF APOMEIOSIS, which stimulates the differentiation of somatic aposporous initial (AI) cells near sexually programmed cells. As AI cells undergo nuclear mitosis the sexual pathway terminates. The function of the dominant locus LOSS OF PARTHENOGENESIS in aposporous embryo sacs enables fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm development. Deletion of either locus results in partial reversion to sexual reproduction, and loss of function in both loci results in reversion to sexual development. In these apomicts, sexual reproduction is therefore the default reproductive mode upon which apomixis is superimposed. These loci are unlikely to encode factors critical for sexual reproduction but might recruit the sexual pathway to enable apomixis. Incomplete functional penetrance of these dominant loci is likely to lead to the generation of rare sexual progeny also derived from these facultative apomicts...|$|R
25|$|Some {{species of}} {{crawling}} plants can also sprout adventitious roots, {{but are not}} considered stoloniferous: a stolon is sprouted from an existing stem and can produce a full individual.

50|$|Larva pale brown, darker {{along the}} sides; the dorsal and subdorsal lines pale, dark-edged; spiracular line ochreous yellow.The larva feeds {{on a range}} of plants: It has been {{recorded}} on bedstraws, docks, <b>hawkweeds,</b> heather, lettuce, plantains and willows as well as grasses such as Poa. This species overwinters as a very small larva.|$|R
60|$|The topmost {{place of}} all in the {{hierarchy}} of seed life, it seems to me, is taken by the feathery fruits and seeds which float freely hither and thither wherever the wind may bear them. An immense number of the very highest plants--the aristocrats of the vegetable kingdom, such as the lordly composites, those ultimate products of plant evolution--possess such floating feathery seeds; though here, again, the varieties of detail are too infinite for rapid or popular classification. Indeed, among the composites alone--the thistle and dandelion tribe with downy fruits--I can reckon up more than a hundred and fifty distinct variations of plan among the winged seeds known to me in various parts of Europe. But if I am strong, I am merciful: I will let the public off with a hundred and forty-eight of them. My two exceptions shall be John-go-to-bed-at-noon and the hairy <b>hawkweed,</b> both of them common English meadow-plants. The first, and more quaintly named, of the two has little ribbed fruits that end in a long and narrow beak, supporting a radial rib-work of spokes like the frame of an umbrella; and from rib to rib of this framework stretch feathery cross-pieces, continuous all round, so as to make of the whole mechanism a perfect circular parachute, resembling somewhat the web of a geometrical spider. But the hairy <b>hawkweed</b> is still more cunning in its generation; for that clever and cautious weed produces its seeds or fruits in clustered heads, of which the central ones are winged, while the outer are heavy, squat, and wingless. Thus does the plant make the best of all chances that may happen to open before it: if one lot goes far and fares but ill, the other is pretty sure to score a bull's-eye.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} the downs. Their very {{emptiness}} and desolation, which frightens the stranger from them, only serves {{to make them more}} fascinating to those who are intimate with and have learned to love them. That dreary aspect brings to mind the other one, when, on waking with the early sunlight in the room, you look out on a blue sky, cloudless or with white clouds. It may be fancy, or the effect of contrast, but it has always seemed to me that just as the air is purer and fresher on these chalk heights than on the earth below, and as the water is of a more crystal purity, and the sky perhaps bluer, so do all colours and all sounds have a purity and vividness and intensity beyond that of other places. I see it in the yellows of <b>hawkweed,</b> rock-rose, and birds'-foot-trefoil, in the innumerable specks of brilliant colour--blue and white and rose--of milk-wort and squinancy-wort, and in the large flowers of the dwarf thistle, glowing purple in its green setting; and I hear it in every bird-sound, in the trivial songs of yellow-hammer and corn-bunting, and of dunnock and wren and whitethroat.|$|E
6000|$|... {{far below}} me, contrasted strangely {{with the rich}} soft inland {{character}} of the deep woods, luxuriant ferns, and gaudy flowers. It is that very contrast which makes the place so unique. One is accustomed {{to connect with the}} notion of the sea bare cliffs, breezy downs, stunted shrubs struggling for existence: and instead of them behold a forest wall, 500 feet high, of almost semi-tropic luxuriance. At one turn, a deep glen, with its sea of green woods, filled up at the mouth with the bright azure sheet of ocean.--Then some long stretch of the road would be banked on one side with crumbling rocks, festooned with heath, and golden <b>hawkweed,</b> and London pride, like velvet cushions covered with pink lace, and beds of white bramble blossom alive with butterflies; while above my head, and on my right, the cool canopy of oak and birch leaves shrouded me so close, that I could have fancied myself miles inland, buried in some glen unknown to any wind of heaven, but that everywhere between green sprays and grey stems, gleamed that same boundless ocean blue, seeming, from the height at which I was, to mount into the very sky. It looked but a step out of the leafy covert into blank infinity. And then, as the road wound round some point, one's eye could fall down, down, through the abyss of perpendicular wood, tree below tree clinging to and clothing the cliff, or rather no cliff; but perpendicular sheet of deep wood sedge, and broad crown ferns, spreading their circular fans.--But there is no describing them, or painting them either.--And then to see how the midday sunbeams leapt past one down the abyss, throwing out here a grey stem by one point of burnished silver, there a hazel branch by a single leaf of glowing golden green, shooting long bright arrows down, through the dim, hot, hazy atmosphere of the wood, till it rested at last upon the dappled beach of pink and grey pebbles, and the dappled surge which wandered up and down among them, and broke up into richer intricacy with its chequer-work of woodland shadows, the restless net of snowy foam.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 11. Some {{essential}} points {{respecting the}} flower I shall note, however, before ending. There is one large and frequent species of it {{of which the}} flowers are delicately yellow, touched with tawny red, forming {{one of the chief}} elements of wild foreground vegetation in the healthy districts of hard Alpine limestone.[26] This is, I believe, the only European type of the large Cape varieties, in all of which, judging from such plates as have been accessible to me, the crests or fringes of the lower petal are less conspicuous than in the smaller species; and the flower almost takes the aspect of a broom-blossom or pease-blossom. In the smaller European varieties, the white fringes of the lower petal are the most important and characteristic part of the flower, and they are, among European wild flowers, absolutely without any likeness of associated structure. The fringes or crests which, towards the origin of petals, so often give a frosted or gemmed appearance to the centres of flowers, are here thrown to the extremity of the petal, and suggest an almost coralline structure of blossom, which in no other instance whatever has been imitated, still less carried out into its conceivable varieties of form. How many such varieties might have been produced if these fringes of the Giulietta, or those already alluded to of Lucia nivea, had been repeated and enlarged; as the type, once adopted for complex bloom in the thistle-head, is multiplied in the innumerable gradations of thistle, teasel, <b>hawkweed,</b> and aster! We might have had flowers edged with lace finer than was ever woven by mortal fingers, or tasselled and braided with fretwork of silver, never tarnished--or hoarfrost that grew brighter in the sun. But it was not to be, and after a few hints of what might be done in this kind, the Fate, or Folly, or, on recent theories, the extreme fitness--and consequent survival, of the Thistles and Dandelions, entirely drives the fringed Lucias and blue-flushing milkworts out of common human neighbourhood, to live recluse lives with the memories of the abbots of Cluny, and pastors of Piedmont.|$|E
60|$|Give me truths; For I am {{weary of}} the surfaces, And die of inanition. If I knew Only the herbs and simples of the wood, Rue, cinquefoil, gill, vervain and agrimony, Blue-vetch and trillium, <b>hawkweed,</b> sassafras, Milkweeds and murky brakes, quaint pipes and sundew, And rare and virtuous roots, which in these woods Draw untold juices from the common earth, Untold, unknown, and I could surely spell Their fragrance, and their {{chemistry}} apply By sweet affinities to human flesh, Driving the foe and stablishing the friend,-- O, that were much, and I could be a part Of the round day, related to the sun And planted world, and full executor Of their imperfect functions. But these young scholars, who invade our hills, Bold as the engineer who fells the wood, And travelling often in the cut he makes, Love not the flower they pluck, and know it not, And all their botany is Latin names. The old men studied magic in the flowers, And human fortunes in astronomy, And an omnipotence in chemistry, Preferring things to names, for these were men, Were unitarians of the united world, And, wheresoever their clear eye-beams fell, They caught {{the footsteps of the}} SAME. Our eyes Are armed, but we are strangers to the stars, And strangers to the mystic beast and bird, And strangers to the plant and to the mine. The injured elements say, 'Not in us;' And night and day, ocean and continent, Fire, plant and mineral say, 'Not in us;' And haughtily return us stare for stare. For we invade them impiously for gain; We devastate them unreligiously, And coldly ask their pottage, not their love. Therefore they shove us from them, yield to us Only what to our griping toil is due; But the sweet affluence of love and song, The rich results of the divine consents Of man and earth, of world beloved and lover, The nectar and ambrosia, are withheld; And in the midst of spoils and slaves, we thieves And pirates of the universe, shut out Daily to a more thin and outward rind, Turn pale and starve. Therefore, to our sick eyes, The stunted trees look sick, the summer short, Clouds shade the sun, which will not tan our hay, And nothing thrives to reach its natural term; And life, shorn of its venerable length, Even at its greatest space is a defeat, And dies in anger that it was a dupe; And, in its highest noon and wantonness, Is early frugal, like a beggar's child; Even in the hot pursuit of the best aims And prizes of ambition, checks its hand, Like Alpine cataracts frozen as they leaped, Chilled with a miserly comparison Of the toy's purchase with the length of life.|$|E
