25|$|Along the African coast {{you will}} hear that dirge-like strain in all their songs, as at work or {{paddling}} their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations {{you will hear}} it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It seems like the dirge of national degradation, the wail of a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor… And here I cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to which my attention was specially directed by an incident <b>I</b> <b>witnessed</b> or rather heard.|$|E
25|$|From January 1993 {{until my}} {{resignation}} from the United Nations in August 1998, <b>I</b> <b>witnessed</b> first hand the duplicitous Iraq {{policies of the}} administration of Bill Clinton, the implementation of which saw a President lie to the American people about a threat he knew was hyped, lie to Congress about his support of a disarmament process his administration {{wanted nothing to do}} with, and lie to the world about American intent, which turned its back on the very multilateral embrace of diplomacy as reflected in the resolutions of the Security Council Hillary Clinton so piously refers to in her speech, and instead pursued a policy defined by the unilateral interests of the Clinton administration to remove Saddam Hussein from power.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – <b>I</b> <b>witnessed</b> their cruelty. I {{remember}} as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|... {{was about}} how when my grandma was {{standing}} over my grandfather {{while he was}} dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it was for me in that moment when <b>I</b> <b>witnessed</b> it." ...|$|E

2500|$|William Wood was {{slightly}} {{wounded in the}} leg just yards from the wall, probably by a spent round. Upon reaching the wall, Lieutenant Wood wrote that he: [...] "...looked {{to the right and}} left and felt we were disgraced. Where were those who started in the charge? With one single exception <b>I</b> <b>witnessed</b> no cowardice, and yet we had not a skirmish line." [...] Seeing large numbers of Federal troops moving in a wide flanking movement around the Confederates' right (Stannard's Second Vermont Brigade of the I Federal Corps), Wood realized that staying in place would mean capture, but retreat meant running the gauntlet of fire back across the field. Despite the risk, he chose the latter, and made it safely back across the field to Seminary Ridge, although being wounded by a ball that punctured his coat, vest, and shirt, but failed to penetrate his skin.|$|E

2500|$|In December, {{the company}} went on to produce their best known {{theatrical}} performance Kamra No. 9 (Room No. 9) a radio play written by Saadat Hasan Manto and directed by Azeem Hamid. The performance was well received by critics and audiences, the Daily Times wrote [...] "Kamra #9 ... mystery musical {{is an example of}} Urdu theatre at its finest." [...] Shoaib Ahmed of Dawn Newspaper wrote [...] "The 60-minute three-act play had such a strong production value that it kept glued the audience to their seats till the end. The literary piece was deeply and meaningfully tailored for the play.", while during an interview to The Express Tribune, director Azeem Hamid said, [...] "Visualising and creating a 1930s Delhi feel for a radio play was an immense challenge; we walked around Jalander, India to get inspiration for Kamra #9’s set design." [...] The Mani-Nama blog reviewed the performance saying, [...] "The set was quite modest- a realistic one with an old radio, telephone and chairs. After sometime <b>I</b> <b>witnessed</b> some quality lighting which was done by Shakeel Siddique, who literally set the pace of play with classic lights." [...] and The News on Sunday wrote, [...] "Kamra #9 provided insight into human complexities." [...] Aleeza Rasool, writer and critic, of Youlin Magazine reported praising the performance as she wrote, [...] "Firstly, a radio play by Manto was a refreshing choice, for {{it is one of the}} lesser-known genres that Manto composed during his brief lifetime. Secondly, the play was very well-acted, and most importantly, the direction was even-tempered, making the play engaging., adding that, [...] "It is unusual to come across the genus of anticipation and suspense in Pakistani stage plays, which is why Azeem Hamid, actor and director of the play, deserves a pat on the back for putting up a wonderful performance on Manto’s radio play." ...|$|E
