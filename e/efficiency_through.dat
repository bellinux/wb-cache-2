Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup.|$|E

In 2005, the World Bank increased its involvement with PSI II, by investing US$10.26 million of a US$22 million project, aimed at extending improved irrigation systems and WUBs capacity building to all the coastal region. Currently the World Bank is collaborating with Peru's Government to extend PSI's technical and financial support to the Sierra.|$|E

25|$|By far {{the biggest}} problem with the {{conventional}} approach is cost; solar cells require a relatively thick layer of doped silicon in order to have reasonable photon capture rates, and silicon processing is expensive. There {{have been a number of}} different approaches to reduce this cost over the last decade, notably the thin-film approaches, but to date they have seen limited application due to a variety of practical problems. Another line of research has been to dramatically improve <b>efficiency</b> <b>through</b> the multi-junction approach, although these cells are very high cost and suitable only for large commercial deployments. In general terms the types of cells suitable for rooftop deployment have not changed significantly in efficiency, although costs have dropped somewhat due to increased supply.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} insect flight {{is the body}} tilt. As flight speed increases, the insect body tends to tilt nose-down and become more horizontal. This reduces the frontal area and therefore, the body drag. Since drag also increases as forward velocity increases, the insect is making its flight more efficient as this efficiency becomes more necessary. Additionally, by changing the geometric angle of attack on the downstroke, the insect is able to keep its flight at an optimal <b>efficiency</b> <b>through</b> as many manoeuvres as possible. The development of general thrust is relatively small compared with lift forces. Lift forces {{may be more than}} three times the insect's weight, while thrust at even the highest speeds may be as low as 20% of the weight. This force is developed primarily through the less powerful upstroke of the flapping motion.|$|E
25|$|The Intel Core {{microarchitecture}} (previously {{known as}} the Next-Generation Micro-Architecture) is a multi-core processor microarchitecture unveiled by Intel in Q1 2006. It {{is based on the}} Yonah processor design and can be considered an iteration of the P6 microarchitecture, introduced in 1995 with Pentium Pro. The high power consumption and heat intensity, the resulting inability to effectively increase clock speed, and other shortcomings such as the inefficient pipeline were the primary reasons for which Intel abandoned the NetBurst microarchitecture and switched to completely different architectural design, delivering high <b>efficiency</b> <b>through</b> a small pipeline rather than high clock speeds. The Core microarchitecture never reached the clock speeds of the Netburst microarchitecture, even after moving to 45nm lithography; however, after many generations of successor microarchitectures which are developed with the Core as the basis (such as Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and more) Intel managed to surpass the clock speeds of Netburst using the Devil's Canyon (Improved version of Haswell) microarchitecture which reached a base frequency of 4 GHz and a maximum tested frequency of 4.4 GHz using 22nm lithography and ultimately derives from the P6 microarchitecture through the Core microarchitecture and many other succeeding improvements.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{sustainability}} {{as a business}} opportunity {{has led to the}} formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the Society for Organizational Learning, the Sustainable Business Institute, and the World Council for Sustainable Development. The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of green-collar workers. [...] Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability, and led to emergence of the concept of [...] "embedded sustainability"—defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as [...] "incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium". Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased <b>efficiency</b> <b>through</b> reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation.
