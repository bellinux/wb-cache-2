Moreover, a docition-based real-time scheme is also proposed in [15] to improve the learning ability and accuracy of Q-learning process, which solves the unstable decision-making problem and the drawbacks of complex learning process and slow learning speed. Considering the uplink capacity and interference cancelation problems in CDMA-based <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks,</b> the uplink capacity and time-hop (TH)-based CDMA interference cancelation technology are proposed and analyzed with the outage probability constraints of macrocell and femtocell in co-channel frequency deployment scenario [16].

40|$|We {{investigate}} complex synchronization patterns such as cluster synchronization {{and partial}} amplitude death in networks of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators with fractal connectivities. The study of fractal or self-similar topology {{is motivated by}} the network of neurons in the brain. This fractal property is well represented in <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks,</b> for which we present three different models. In addition, we introduce an analytical eigensolution method and provide a comprehensive picture of the interplay of network topology and the corresponding network dynamics, thus allowing us to predict the dynamics of arbitrarily large <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> simply by analyzing small network motifs. We also show that oscillation death can be induced in these networks, even if the coupling is symmetric, contrary to previous understanding of oscillation death. Our results {{show that there is}} a direct correlation between topology and dynamics: <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> exhibit the corresponding hierarchical dynamics.

30|$|FBS and optimal RB {{resource}} ratio ρ {{will affect}} the capacity of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks.</b> However, the self-deployment and uncertainty of switch-on and switch-off features of FBS in practice are key challenges. Besides the time delay of information, exchange among <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> via a third party backhaul is another problem. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} make an optimal resource allocation scheme based on the FBS density in a practical scenario. Moreover, the co-channel frequency allocation scheme can provide an efficient spectrum utilization solution, but it inevitably introduces the strong co-channel interference which will decrease the system capacity.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>network</b> models was mainly {{motivated by the}} failure of the other scale-free models in incorporating the scale-free topology and high clustering into one single model. Since several real-life networks (metabolic networks, the protein interaction network, the World Wide Web or some social networks) exhibit such properties, different hierarchical topologies were introduced in order to account for these various characteristics.|$|E

HQLIP, an underlying QoS-based uni-cast routing protocol, handles a <b>network</b> as a <b>hierarchical</b> structure for scalable QoS-based routing. We have designed and implemented an algorithm to compute PQ (hierarchical PQ) corresponding to aggregated link information on <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> for SRSVP to compute better QoS paths.

50|$|<b>Hierarchical</b> <b>network</b> {{models are}} usually derived in an {{iterative}} way by replicating the initial cluster {{of the network}} according to a certain rule. For instance, consider an initial network of five fully interconnected nodes (N=5). As a next step, create four replicas of this cluster and connect the peripheral nodes of each replica to the central node of the original cluster (N=25). This step can be repeated indefinitely, thereby for any k steps the number of nodes in the system can be derived by N=5k+1.|$|E
50|$|Deterministic {{models are}} {{especially}} useful to explain empirically observed phenomena and demonstrate {{the existence of}} networks with certain properties. For example, the Barabási-Albert model predicts a decreasing average clustering coefficient {{as the number of}} nodes increases, whereas empirical evidence suggests otherwise. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>network</b> models can explain this phenomenon while also retaining the scale-free property. Another notable example is {{that it is possible to}} generate networks deterministically, which are scale-free and linear world at the same time, showing that small-world property is not a necessary consequence of the scale-free property.|$|E

For many applications, a clear explanation of why the data was classified a certain way {{is just as important}} as the classification itself. However, the complexity of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> makes them ill-suited for existing explanation methods. We propose a new method, contribution propagation, that gives per-instance explanations of a trained network 2 ̆ 7 s classifications. We give theoretical foundations for the proposed method, and evaluate its correctness empirically.

40|$|This paper proposes an eigenvector-based {{method for}} {{analysis}} {{and design of}} <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> for multi-agent systems. We first define the concept of eigen-connection by characterizing low rank information flow between layers based on the eigenvector of lower level interconnection structures. It is shown that the resulting intergroup interconnections affect only a few eigenvalues of interconnection structures in the lower layer, and we derive explicit expressions for shifted eigenvalues. Then a procedure for designing <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> that result in desirable eigenvalue distributions is proposed, where the eigen-connection is used for a key to move undesirable eigenvalues selectively.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of real-life {{networks}} share two remarkable generic topological properties: scale-free behavior and modular organization, and it is natural and important to study how these two features affect the dynamical processes taking place on such networks. In this paper, we investigate a simple stochastic process [...] trapping problem, a random walk with a perfect trap fixed at a given location, performed on a family of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> that exhibit simultaneously striking scale-free and modular structure. We focus on a particular case with the immobile trap positioned at the hub node having the largest degree. Using a method based on generating functions, we determine explicitly the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for the trapping problem, which is {{the mean of the}} node-to-trap first-passage time over the entire network. The exact expression for the MFPT is calculated through the recurrence relations derived from the special construction of the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks.</b> The obtained rigorous formula corroborated by extensive direct numerical calculations exhibits that the MFPT grows algebraically with the network order. Concretely, the MFPT increases as a power-law function of the number of nodes with the exponent much less than 1. We demonstrate that the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks</b> under consideration have more efficient structure for transport by diffusion in contrast with other analytically soluble media including some previously studied scale-free networks. We argue that the scale-free and modular topologies are responsible for the high efficiency of the trapping process on the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>networks.</b> Comment: Definitive version accepted for publication in Physical Review...|$|R
