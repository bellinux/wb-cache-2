After being accelerated by a dcJotentia 1, the beam induces a traveling wave in a concentric output TWR, in which the beam energy is converted to RF with very high efficiency. Results of calculations of drive power and efficiency, as well as special matching and coupling requirements, are reviewed. I. Principle of Operation The trirotron is an RF vacuum tube amplifier being developed {{in an attempt to}} combine the inherent high efficiency of the gyroconl with a simpler drive system. Here, the drive system consists of a circulating waveguide resonant at the device frequency. This waveguide is concentric to the output resonator, which in all respects is similar to the gyrocon output. The phase propagation constant of the two waveguides is adjusted so that the drive resonator guide can be located inside the output resonator, leaving space for a dc accelerating field between them. The central portion of the inner wall of the <b>input</b> <b>resonator</b> is replaced by a cathode, insulated from the remainder of the waveguide. The outer wall opposite the cathode is replaced by grids (see Fig. 1). E=Eo cOs(wt-PZ) -Ebi,...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—New {{cross-coupled}} bandpass filters using half-wavelength (λ/ 2) and branch-line resonators are proposed. The branch-line resonators {{are made}} of two quarter-wavelength (λ/ 4) resonators in which a shorted circuit is realized by one open stub. In the first case, a non- 0 ◦ feed structure at the <b>input</b> and output <b>resonators</b> is used to produce one pair of transmission zeros near the passband to improve the selectivity.

40|$|An {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) detecting device having a null-detecting receiver is disclosed. An excitation signal is <b>input</b> to a <b>resonator</b> which holds a sample for ESR detection. A response signal from the resonator is coupled to a balance signal to form a detection signal received by a detector. The detector also receives a reference signal having a phase relationship with the excitation signal, whereby the detector's output is indicative of {{a difference between the}} detection signal and the reference signal. The detector's output is used in a feedback loop to generate an adjustment signal which causes the balance signal to substantially cancel the response signal. The adjustment signal can be used to measure resonance, while the input to the detector is minimised to reduce the effect of noise on measurements...|$|R
5000|$|Klystrons amplify RF {{signals by}} {{converting}} the kinetic energy in a DC electron beam into radio frequency power. A {{beam of electrons}} is produced by a thermionic cathode (a heated pellet of low work function material), and accelerated by high-voltage electrodes (typically {{in the tens of}} kilovolts). This beam is then passed through an <b>input</b> cavity <b>resonator.</b> RF energy is fed into the input cavity at, or near, its resonant frequency, creating standing waves, which produce an oscillating voltage which acts on the electron beam.

Thus the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted to potential energy of the field, increasing the amplitude of the oscillations. The oscillations excited in the catcher cavity are coupled out through a coaxial cable or waveguide. The spent electron beam, with reduced energy, is captured by a collector electrode.|$|R
40|$|Usually, {{starting}} of oscillation in a {{quartz crystal}} oscillator requires a <b>resonator’s</b> <b>input</b> {{power in the}} range of – 20 dBm, but under storage a phenomenon known as Drive Level Dependency (DLD) or Drive Level Sensitivity (DLS) may appear that prevents the starting of oscillation. Several studies performed in the past have shown that at low drive level some quartz resonators may exhibit a large increase of their series resistance preventing the starting of oscillation. This work reviews the studies and results obtained for nearly fifty years on very low drive level sensitivity of quartz. The various mechanisms and models based on the hypothesis of moving particles and surface defects in the resonator inducing resistance increase and its relation with noise mechanism are reviewed as well. Also, the paper describes several experimental set-ups, and measurement procedures used to obtain very low drive level motional parameters. This work is a contribution to understand the problem of starting quartz after a long storage period. Some preliminary results of the series resistance measured at very low drive level are also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — For {{high quality}} factor magnetically coupled {{resonator}} wireless power systems, constant {{wireless power transfer}} efficiency can be achieved over a greater range and higher efficiency than an inductively coupled system. However, as the distance varies between two near-field <b>resonators,</b> the <b>input</b> and output impedances to the resonators change. Therefore, {{in order to achieve}} constant efficiency, the <b>resonator</b> <b>input</b> impedance must be adaptively matched to the source impedance of the transmit resonator and the load impedance of the output device. Previous techniques have demonstrated adaptive frequency tuning control algorithms to track the resonant peaks. However, government regulations strictly limit the radiating electric field strength of wireless applications outside specific bandwidths which will be exceeded by these frequency tuning algorithms. Adaptive impedance matching (AIM) networks automatically change the input and output impedances in order to maintain maximum wireless power transfer efficiency. In this paper, the input impedance is characterized for a four-element resonant wireless power system. Two algorithms are presented to determine the component values for any adaptive impedance matching network topology to achieve constant wireless power transfer efficiency at a single frequency. These techniques are demonstrated and verified with a π-match network. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} design optimization of brass wind instruments. The shape of a trumpet's bore is optimized to improve intonation using a physics-based sound simulation model. This physics-based model consists of an acoustic model of the <b>resonator</b> (<b>input</b> impedance), a mechanical model of the excitator (the lips of a virtual musician) and {{a model of the}} coupling between the excitator and the resonator. The harmonic balance technique allows the computation of sounds in a permanent regime, representative of the shape of the resonator according to control parameters of the virtual musician. An optimization problem is formulated, in which the objective function to be minimized is the overall quality of the intonation of the different notes played by the instrument (deviation from the equal-tempered scale). The design variables are the physical dimensions of the resonator. Given the computationally expensive function evaluation and the unavailability of gradients, a surrogate-assisted optimization framework is implemented using the mesh adaptive direct search algorithm (MADS). Surrogate models are used both to obtain promising candidates in the search step of MADS and to rank-order additional candidates generated by the poll step of MADS. The physics-based model is then used to determine the next design iterate. Two examples (with two and five design optimization variables, respectively) are presented to demonstrate the approach. Results show that significant improvement of intonation can be achieved at reasonable computational cost. The implementation of this method for computer-aided instrument design is discussed, considering different objective functions or constraints based on intonation but also on the timbre of the instrument...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this program}} {{was to develop a}} 50 MW, {{multiple}} beam klystron at 11. 424 GHz. The device uses eight electron guns and beam lines to achieve the required power level at a beam voltage of 190 kV, consistent with solid state power supplies. The electron gun operates with confined flow focusing, which is unique among current multiple beam sources, and allows operation at power levels consistent with producing 10 s of MWs of pulsed RF power. The circuit consists of a ring <b>resonator</b> <b>input</b> cavity, eight sets of buncher cavities, and a ring resonator output cavity. The RF output power is coupled into four rectangular waveguides equally spaced around the klystron. Eight individual collectors absorb the spent beam power in each beam. The klystron operates in a solenoid. The principle challenges in the design included development of the beam optics using confined flow focusing, shaping of the magnetic field in the gun region to avoid beam spiraling, coupling input power equally to all eight beam lines from a single input, and obtaining the required frequency and Q in the output cavity. The mechanical design was particularly complex due to the large parts count, number of braze and weld joints, and close proximity of the beam lines that limited access. Addressing vacuum leaks and cold testing the complex structures was particularly troublesome. At the conclusion of the program, the klystron is experiencing several vacuum leaks that are under repair. Efforts will continue to seal and test the klystron...|$|R
40|$|In {{designing}} a laser cavity, the laser engineer is frequently concerned {{with more than}} {{the stability of the}} resonator. Other considerations include the size of the beam at various optical surfaces within the resonator or the performance of intracavity line-narrowing or other optical elements. Laser resonators obey the laws of Gaussian beam propagation, not geometric optics. The Gaussian Beam Laser Resonator Program models laser resonators using Gaussian ray trace techniques. It can be used to determine the propagation of radiation through laser resonators. The algorithm used in the Gaussian Beam Resonator program has three major components. First, the ray transfer matrix for the laser resonator must be calculated. Next calculations of the initial beam parameters, specifically, the beam stability, the beam waist size and location for the <b>resonator</b> <b>input</b> element, and the wavefront curvature and beam radius at the input surface to the first resonator element are performed. Finally the propagation of the beam through the optical elements is computed. The optical elements can be modeled as parallel plates, lenses, mirrors, dummy surfaces, or Gradient Index (GRIN) lenses. A Gradient Index lens is a good approximation of a laser rod operating under a thermal load. The optical system may contain up to 50 elements. In addition to the internal beam elements the optical system may contain elements external to the resonator. The Gaussian Beam Resonator program was written in Microsoft FORTRAN (Version 4. 01). It was developed for the IBM PS/ 2 80 - 071 microcomputer and has been implemented on an IBM PC compatible under MS DOS 3. 21.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spurious suppressed microstrip dual mode bandpass filter (BPF). High selectivity and good adjacent channel interference rejection are required of modern transmitting and receiving devices. Conventionally, square <b>resonator</b> with orthogonal <b>input</b> and output feedlines is employed {{to achieve a}} quasi-elliptic type of bandpass response with two transmission zeros near its passband edges. However, this resulted in spurious response of unwanted harmonics at higher frequencies. The proposed spurious suppressed dual mode BPF utilized novel M-shaped defected ground structures (DGS) etched in the ground plane beneath a square <b>resonator</b> <b>input</b> and output feedlines to attain spurious suppressed bandpass responses. The presence of DGS leads to the increment in the current path and effective permittivity, and also decrement of the effective phase velocity and effective wavelength. In addition, DGS of different sizes, patterns and positioning, equivalent L-C ratio, coupling coefficients and other electrical parameters will result in various spurious suppression responses. It can be represented by a parallel tuned circuit arranged in series with the main circuit transmission line {{to which it is}} coupled. The prototyped BPF is fabricated on a Ro 4003 C substrate with relative permittivity of 3. 38 and loss tangent of 0. 0021. The center frequency is 2. 55 GHz. The best measured S₁₁ is obtained at 2. 58 GHz with a value of - 23. 76 dB and the corresponding S₂₁ is - 3. 7 dB which is slightly lower as compared to the simulated response. This is mainly due to fabrication tolerance and misalignment loss. One transmission zero is obtained at 2. 25 GHz and 2. 85 GHz respectively. The lower and upper stopband attenuation is greater than 20 dB/GHz. The bandwidth of the passband response at - 3 dB level is 3. 2 %. Validation of the BPF design is obtained via good agreement between the simulated and measured results...|$|R
