40|$|A hole-patterned {{electrode}} {{liquid crystal}} (LC) lens with electrically switching coaxial bi-focus and single focus modes of tuning is demonstrated. The proposed LC lens mainly {{consists of a}} two LC layer (TLCL) structure with different thicknesses to achieve higher focusing power than the conventional hole-patterned electrode LC lens with the same aperture size. In the TLCL structure, one LC layer, doped with 3 wt % RM 257, was photopolymerized to achieve a <b>fixed</b> <b>focusing</b> power of 18. 5 Diopter. Due to polarization dependence in TLCL lenses, an additional 90 ° twisted nematic (TN) cell was used to change the incident polarization in order to switch lens functions on or off. As a result, a <b>fixed</b> <b>focusing</b> power of 18. 5 Diopter was achieved when voltages of 10 Vrms were applied to the 90 ° TN cell. In addition, the switching capabilities of the bi-focus and single focus modes were achieved when operating individually with applied voltages from 20 Vrms to 90 Vrms, and higher voltages of over 90 Vrms, respectively. The maximum focusing power in the fabricated TLCL lens is 30. 9 Diopter...|$|R

We propose Route Bazaar, a backward-compatible system for flexible Internet con-nectivity. Inspired by the decentralized construction of trust in cryptocurrencies, Route Bazaar uses a decentral-ized public ledger and cryptography to provide ASes with automatic means to form, establish, and verify end-to-end connectivity agreements. ...|$|R
