30|$|At the circuit/system level, {{asynchronous}} design {{methods have}} been drawing continued interest from the research community {{over the past few}} decades due to several inherent advantages such as low noise (Paver et al. 1998) and almost nil electro-magnetic interference (Bouesse et al. 2004), greater modularity (van Kees Berkel et al. 1999), capacity to withstand process, temperature, and parametric variations (Kulikowski et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2010), consumption of power only when and where active (van Kees Berkel et al. 1999; Akgun et al. 2010), and being self-checking (David et al. 1995). Low noise and <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> imply that asynchronous circuits are inherently resistant to side channel attacks (Yu et al. 2003; Sokolov et al. 2005) and are therefore preferable for secure environments demanded in cyber physical systems, banking and financial applications, and other consumer and industrial applications. Modularity, also known as design reusability, and the ability to tolerate process, temperature and parametric variations signifies that asynchronous circuits are well placed to cope with statistical timing analysis and reliability issues whilst delivering a good average case performance (Sparsø and Furber 2001). Due to power consumption only on demand, depending on when and where required, asynchronous circuits form a natural choice for low power VLSI designs where complimentary design strategies such as multiple supplies, multiple thresholds, and dynamic voltage and/or frequency scaling may be employed to leverage the maximum benefits from an asynchronous design.|$|E

Outdoor Power-Line Communications (PLC) systems represent {{an alternative to the}} other classical 'last-mile solutions' such as ADSL, cable modems, or wireless access systems. We developed an accurate powerline channel simulation tool based on the Multiconductor Transmission Line theory. This tool is able to predict the end-to-end channel responses {{on the basis of the}} multiconductor cable structure and the network topology. Then the issue of optimal resource allocation in a multiuser environment was addressed in the light of the Multiuser Information Theory. Simultaneously active users are in competition for the limited resources that are the power (constrained by <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> restrictions) and the bandwidth (in the range of 1 to 10 MHz for outdoor PLC). The concept of multiuser balanced capacity was introduced to characterize the optimal resource allocation providing the maximum data rates with fairness constraints among the subscribers. The optimal PLC system was shown to require the shaping of the signal spectrum in the transmitters, and successive decoding in the receiver. A generic multiple access scheme based on Filter Banks (FB) was proposed, which offers the required spectral shaping with limited degrees of freedom. Classical multiple-access techniques (TDMA, CDMA, OFDMA) can be obtained by selecting the appropriate FB.

In particular, the power link should be installed in a train running tunnel, which induces specific constraints like limited available space, limited time access for operation and maintenance of the transmission line due to the railway traffic. The possibility of using a separate emergency tunnel or a pilot one [1, 2] was not in the scope of the project. The actual challenge was to include the cable system whereas the tunnel was originally designed for railway operation only. The paper envisages several technical choices namely AC and DC technologies and demonstrates that the HVDC solution is the only possibility owing to space requirements inside the proper railway tunnel: two poles and a metallic return have been considered for HVDC.
