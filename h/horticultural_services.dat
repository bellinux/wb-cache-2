40|$|More {{than half}} of the U. S. {{workforce}} is employed in business establishments with fewer than 100 employees. Prevention of occupational illness and injury is often difficult in these small business establishments because they have few safety and health resources, cannot usually hire staff devoted to safety and health activities, and often lack the ability to identify high-risk small business industries from national data on occupational injury, illness, and fatality. Both the total number of cases and incidence rates were considered. Small business industries were identified as those with standard industrial classification (SIC) codes in which at least 80 % of the employees work in business establishments with fewer than 100 employees. In this report, 253 small business industries were identified with data from the U. S. Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the years 1994 - 1995. These industries represent nearly 4 million establishments and more than 30 million employees [...] roughly one-third of all employees in private industry. Occupational injury, illness, and fatality data were available for 105 of these industries. From the data for these industries, the top 25 % (n= 26) were ranked according to their injury, illness, and fatality experience. A combined risk index (i. e., the combined risk of occupational injury, illness, and fatality) was also used to include Logging (SIC 241); Cut Stone and Stone Products (SIC 328); Trucking Terminal Facilities (SIC 423); Roofing, Siding, and Sheet Metal Work (SIC 176); Camps and Recreational Vehicle Parks (SIC 703); Landscape and <b>Horticultural</b> <b>Services</b> (SIC 708); Animal and Marine Fats and Oils (SIC 2077); Concrete, Gypsum, and Plastic Products (SIC 327); and Taxicabs (SIC 412).

Ten of the fourteen acres in the Peerless fernery were equipped with oil heaters for protection against damaging temperatures. The fouracre test plot was not equipped with heaters and was separated from the rest of the fernery by a high board fence which isolated it from the heated area.

40|$|The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) {{estimates}} that the global value of tourism will be US$ 10. 8 trillion by 2018. Tourism has become a crucial contributor to the GDP with the total export earnings of many countries’ being {{a major source of}} employment. With definitions acknowledged for nature-based or ecotourism the author establishes horticultural tourism as a niche market in green tourism and describes the benefits and potential of the green assets, such as public parks and recreation facilities, historic and heritage gardens, national and international horticultural events, rural farm visits, community gardens and farmers markets, all of which have as yet untapped tourism potential in many countries. Horticultural tourism initiatives require the effective integration of these horticultural assets, products and services in the tourism supply chain. The objective of the paper is to provide a definition of horticultural tourism and discuss the successful methods being used in countries to integrate <b>horticultural</b> products and <b>services</b> into the tourism supply chain as well as discuss the challenges and research opportunities facing this dynamic sector of the industry and the need for it to move towards a more sustainable operating base. Evidence suggests that in most developed and developing countries it is possible to establish a viable supply chain that stretches from the producer/service manager of the asset to the tourism and hospitality industry. However, the challenges {{that need to be addressed}} include a better understanding of the tourism supply chain, an acknowledgement that all stakeholders have to be involved and there is active government assistance to achieve significant horticulture-tourism integration. Horticultural tourism will continue to grow in both developed and developing countries provided it is founded on the principles and practices associated with sustainable development, with minimal impact on the environment, promotes health and active living, and is supportive of local culture and economy...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two major}} public {{blackberry}} (Rubus L. subgenus rubus Watson) breeding programs in the United States: one at the University of Arkansas (UA) and another at the U. S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research <b>Service</b> <b>Horticultural</b> Crops Research Unit (USDA-ARS HCRU) based in Corvallis, OR. The germplasm and breeding objectives of these two breeding programs are diverse, but frequent collaboration necessitated a standardized method of characterizing plant and fruit traits. A phenotyping protocol for blackberry was developed at UA and implemented for two years on UA seedling populations. The protocol included plant traits (health, vigor, estimated crop load, peak bloom date, and number of canes) and fruit compositional traits (firmness by compression, berry weight, soluble solids content, pH, and titratable acidity). Multivariate analysis indicated that quantitative measurements, rather than qualitative, were best for phenotypic resolution, particularly for specific traits contributing to larger overall characteristics. Fruit compositional traits were evaluated on juice from one year from populations of blackberries grown at UA and UDSA-ARS HCRU, and included soluble solids content, pH, titratable acidity, and organic acids and sugars. Analysis of variance of fruit compositional traits indicated that population means in UA material had more significant differences for several attributes when compared to USDA-ARS HCRU material. Generally, UA seedlings had lower soluble solids content, higher pH, and lower titratable acidity as well as acid content than USDA-ARS HCRU seedlings. Another interesting attribute of fresh-market blackberries is red drupelet reversion, a postharvest phenomenon in which drupelets on the berry turn red. Nine UA advanced selections and cultivars were harvested {{at different times of}} days and evaluated for weight lost by berry, change in firmness, and incidence of red drupelet reversion after storage. Results indicated that a novel “crispy” genotype performed better than other genotypes in regard to red drupelet reversion. However, for both change in firmness and incidence of reversion, a significant genotype and harvest time interaction effect was observed. Overall, it is suggested that growers harvest blackberries at earlier, cooler times to avoid the postharvest disorder, regardless of genotype...|$|R

Abstract The effect of continuous application of small quantities of nitrogen (N) in irrigation water and N applied as starter on growth and development of processing tomato, from transplanting to beginning of fruit set, was studied in two experiments — a pot experiment and a field trial. The pot experiment was carried out with eight treatments, including two soil types and four levels of N application (13. 2, 18. 2, 28. 2 and 48. 2 mg/L of N). The field trial consisted of four N treatments, including a control with only 6. 4 mg/L of N available naturally in the irrigation water, 15 kg/ha of N applied at pre-plant, 15 kg/ha of N applied at pre-plant plus 20 mg/L of N applied continuously during irrigation, and 15 kg ha- 1 N applied at pre- plant plus 40 mg/L of N applied continuously during irrigation. Plant growth was significantly affected by soil type and N level under controlled conditions, increasing linearly in luvisol (sandy loam) and regosol (sand) soil at an average rate of 0. 52 and 0. 64 g dry weight per mg N in the irrigation water, respectively. However, under field conditions in luvisol soil, additional N, whether added at pre-plant or continuously during irrigation, {{had no effect on}} any measure of aboveground plant growth, including leaf area, plant dry weight or early fruit production, but reduced root length density below ground. Overall, N in the irrigation water was sufficient for the young tomato plants between planting and fruit set, and adding more N at pre-plant or by fertigation only resulted in luxury N consumption...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Horticulture)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2004 The term "horticultural therapy" is {{unfamiliar}} to most South Africans. However {{it is well}} accepted in South Africa that horticulture {{plays an important role}} in human well being both physically and psychological. It is generally believed that people who engage in gardening tend to benefit. The research study investigates whether plant related activities integrated into rehabilitation programme, actually benefit participants. It shows how patients at a chosen healthcare institution respond upon exposure to various horticulture activities in order to identify activities appropriate for the inclusion and design in a horticultural therapy programme. The study identifies factors necessary for the design of a business plan for a horticulturist engaging in a horticultural therapy programme under local conditions. The methodology adopted was mainly quantitative. The study is also descriptive in nature. It seeks to develop a model from a range of activities that would best meet the needs of specific groups subjects, through the careful and deliberate observation and evaluation of patients as they engage with the activities. The measuring instruments have been designed for experimentation research purpose. It involved setting up an experiment (patients engaged in a designed horticulture activity) and collecting the data. Information regarding the participant response to designed activities was also gathered on the basis of observations and interviews. The population consisted of patients admitted at a public (State) psychiatric institution in the Western Cape. The sample consisted of 12 patients, four patients from each of the following categories: Forensics, Intellectually Challenged, and Psychiatric. The designed activities consisted of 10 activities, and were centered around the following activities: Growing of herbs, learning to take cuttings, planting cuttings, planting seeds for outdoor garden, preparing a garden site, vegetable gardening, weeding, watering, and planting flowering annuals. The first objective of the study was to determine whether the response of different categories of patients to specific horticulture activities differ, in order to select the appropriate activity for each category. Forensic patients responded positively to all ten activities and recorded a high level (70 %) of task accomplishment. Intellectually challenged patients had a medium level (46 % to 69 %) of task accomplishment for the majority of the activities. Psychiatric patients had a high level (70 %) for 50 percent of the activities and a medium level (46 % to 69 %) of task accomplishment for the remainder of the activities. The second objective of the study was to evaluate the degree of effect of the different horticulture activities on each category of patients, in order to determine the relative importance of each activity in the programme in meeting the patients needs. The general findings are that the various categories responded differently to the subsections as shown in the results. Individual patients within the categories also differed in their response to various activities. The results of the study indicate that certain horticultural activities have an impact on patient's deficiencies and encourage their specific needs in the areas of a vocational/educational, interpersonal/social, and responsibility/development The study identified factors necessary for the design of a business plan for a horticulturist to engage in a horticultural therapy programme under local conditions.

40|$|For the New Zealand nursery {{industry}} {{to survive in}} an increasingly competitive environment, {{it is vital to}} cater effectively for its customers. One of the major factors complicating the required shift towards a consumer oriented industry, is a lack of information on consumer attitudes towards, and perceptions of nursery products. The current study was aimed at contributing {{to the future of the}} industry by enhancing knowledge and understanding of the consumer market for nursery products. Data on perceptions of outdoor ornamental plants were obtained through personal interviews with garden centre customers in three major areas within New Zealand. Compared to the New Zealand population in general, the sample of garden centre customers interviewed, included higher percentages of females, home owners, of families living without dependent children at home, and of people between the ages of 45 and 65 years of age. Interviews were structured according to a fractional factorial design that allowed for uncorrected estimation of eight plant factors and selected interactions. Of the plant characteristics included in the study, health was the main consideration to respondents when selecting a plant for purchase. The suitability of a plant for the growing conditions in the respondent's garden ranked second in importance, and was followed by plant shape and bushiness. Price and final height were the fifth and sixth most important factors respectively in determining the attractiveness of plants to respondents. Leaf and flower colours had a statistically significant effect on consumer evaluations, but contributed little to the ability to predict the responses from treatment variables. The effects of price on the perceived attractiveness of a plant depended upon its health status, suitability for the respondent's garden, and on its final height and shape. The effect of the interaction between shape and bushiness was also found to be of statistically significance. Healthy, cheap plants were preferred over highly or averagely priced plants with an average or poor health status. The nature of the interaction between price and health indicated that respondents were more likely to pay the difference between a medium and a high price level for healthy plants than they were for a plant with an average or poor health status. Where cheap plants were concerned, respondents paid more attention to the suitability of such plants for the growing conditions in their garden than they did for more expensive plants. For averagely priced plants, garden centre customers interviewed expressed a preference for plants reaching a final height of 1 - 2 m. At lower or higher price levels they preferred plants growing up to 1 m. Plants with an expected height of over 2 m were the least attractive to respondents. A well-balanced shape was particularly important for cheap and expensive plants and for bushy plants. Based on the findings, recommendations were formulated to facilitate an alignment between the quality of plants offered for sale at garden centres and desires of the customers. Plant evaluations depended upon several respondent characteristics. Judgements of different health levels varied with the age of the respondent's house, and his or her marital status. Attractiveness ratings for plants differing in their suitability for intended growing conditions depended on the respondent's income level. Emphasis placed on the mature height and the shape of plants varied with the size of the respondent's section. Keen gardeners attached greater importance to a symmetrical shape than did others. Regional differences were observed between respondent opinions about price, health, suitability, and shape. Whilst garden centre customers interviewed in Wellington appeared to be mainly concerned with the two most important factors, namely 'plant health', and 'suitability', respondents in Palmerston North and Auckland paid relatively more attention to the remaining factors. Interactions between respondent characteristics and plant factors not only had implications for current production and retail practices, but also gave an insight into potential effects on plant perceptions of a change in consumer market composition. From the synthesis of results and observations, several methodology related issues emerged. Limitations and caveats were addressed for the benefit of future research into consumer perceptions of <b>horticultural</b> products and/or <b>services...</b>|$|R
