5|$|The {{original}} game {{is set in}} July 1998 on {{the outskirts}} of the fictional town of Raccoon City in the United States. Before the game begins, a live-action cutscene shows Valentine's STARS Alpha team searching in Raccoon <b>Forest</b> <b>for</b> the Bravo Team, who went missing while investigating a series of bizarre murders in the Arklay Mountains. Chased by zombie dogs, the Alpha team retreats to the apparent safety of an abandoned mansion. The game begins inside the mansion.|$|E
5|$|A variant, {{in which}} the motif is {{enclosed}} within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake <b>Forest</b> <b>for</b> his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall.|$|E
5|$|After {{conferring with}} Desaix and Saint-Cyr at Renchen, Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796. This {{decision}} preempted Archduke Charles, who {{had planned to}} attack the French on the 10th. The French commander planned to pin the Austrians in the Rhine plain while turning their left flank among the mountains of the Black <b>Forest.</b> <b>For</b> his part, Charles hoped to outflank the French left near the river and recapture Gernsbach. Latour held the Austrian right near the Rhine, Sztáray was posted in the center near Malsch, Kaim defended the left-center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt's Saxons held the far left near Neuenbürg.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> {{five days before}} coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E
5|$|During 1166, Neville was {{in charge}} of Staffordshire for the general eyre {{undertaken}} in that year, and also tried the pleas of the <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> Devonshire and Worcestershire, and perhaps elsewhere. The abbot of Battle Abbey in 1167 sent a monk to plead with Waleran of Meulan to intervene and stop Neville's exactions on the abbot's manors. After the Revolt of 1173–74, Neville {{was in charge}} of a forest eyre held from 1176 to 1178 which resulted in fines totaling 12,000 pounds from breaches of the forest law during the revolt. It appears that the king intended this eyre to be a punishment, and used the forest law because it was solely dependent on the king's will rather than being based in customary law.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, cattle {{were brought}} by George Vancouver {{as a tribute}} to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped {{confinement}} and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended KamehamehaI, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> the construction of sugarcane plantations and houses.|$|E

5|$|Later King Shantanu, {{captivated by}} her {{fragrance}} and beauty, {{fell in love}} with Satyavati. She married Shantanu on condition that their children inherit the throne, denying the birthright of Shantanu's eldest son (and crown prince) Bhishma. Satyavati bore Shantanu two children, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu's death, she and her prince sons with the help of Bhishma ruled the kingdom. Although both her sons died childless, she arranged for her first son, Vyasa, to father the children of the two widows of Vichitravirya through niyoga. The children, (Dhritarashtra and Pandu) became the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas respectively. After Pandu's death, Satyavati went to the <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> penance and breathed her last before witnessing the Kurukshetra War.|$|E
5|$|Shakti on {{a narrow}} path. As a kshatriya (member of the ruler class), Kalmashapada does not make way for Shakti, a brahmin (priestly class). Nevertheless, Shakti refuses to budge. Finally, an enraged Kalmashapada hits Shakti with his whip. In turn, the sage curses the king to wander the <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> 16 years. The sage Vishwamitra, the arch-enemy of Vashishtha who desires to have Kalmashapada as his disciple, sends a rakshasa to possess the king's body. Vishwamitra plots to destroy his enemy's family {{with the help of}} the king. Under the {{influence}} of the rakshasa, the king serves human flesh to a Brahmin, who sets Shakti's curse into effect. The king turns into a cannibalistic rakshasa.|$|E
5|$|The European Cup was {{retained}} in 1980, this time against Kevin Keegan's Hamburger SV at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Clough and Taylor then {{began the process}} of breaking up the championship winning team, selling off Martin O'Neill, Ian Bowyer, Garry Birtles, and Larry Lloyd; as a new team was built based around youngsters such as Gary Mills, Stuart Gray, Colin Walsh, and Bryn Gunn. New signings included striker Ian Wallace and Switzerland international Raimondo Ponte. Taylor retired in May 1982 after Forest finished 12th in the league, with recent signings Justin Fashanu and Raimondo Ponte proving to be unsuccessful. Clough would stay at <b>Forest</b> <b>for</b> another 11 seasons, but without Taylor would only add two League Cups and two Full Members Cups to the club's trophy cabinet, and would struggle against alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing {{that it does not}} appear in all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana narrates: Rama, his consort Sita and {{his brother}} Lakshmana were exiled to the <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> a 14-year period. While in the forest, Sita was kidnapped by the demon-king Ravana. Rama was {{informed}} of Sita's fate by the dying vulture Jatayu, who had been mortally wounded in trying to save her. Searching for Sita, Rama and Lakshmana reached the Krauncha forest, where Kabandha dwelt. The brothers first encountered a demoness, who tempted Lakshmana. Lakshmana cut off her nose, ears, and breasts, and the brothers moved deeper into the forest, where bad omens greeted them.|$|E

They were runners-up in the 1979 European Champions Cup final, which they lost 1–0 to English club Nottingham <b>Forest.</b> <b>For</b> this feat, Malmö FF were awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal.

5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson scored {{just three}} goals {{in his first}} 24 {{appearances}} of the 2001–02 season, he fell out of favour with new manager Paul Hart, and from February to April 2002, {{in order to reduce}} the club's heavy wage bill, he was allowed to go on loan to fellow First Division clubs Sheffield Wednesday (for whom he scored twice in seven appearances) and Burnley (five goals in eight appearances). Burnley had agreed to pay £120,000 to sign Johnson on a permanent basis at the end of the season, but the transfer ultimately fell through. Upon his return to Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>for</b> the 2002–03 season, Johnson appeared to have found his form again that had made him such a success at Ipswich, scoring 29 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions as Nottingham Forest reached the play-offs. In February 2003, it was discovered that Johnson had been playing with a torn posterior cruciate ligament, and it was expected that his recovery would rule him out for up to six weeks; however, he was able to make a speedy return and was back in action against Grimsby two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} for 1996–97, Smith signed striker Nigel Jemson and spent £100,000 on Leyton Orient defender Darren Purse. In order to finance these deals he sold Chris Allen to Nottingham <b>Forest</b> <b>for</b> £450,000. Oxford knocked Premier League team Sheffield Wednesday {{out of the}} League Cup {{en route to a}} fourth round exit. Oxford were fifth in the table in December 1996, but chairman Robin Herd resigned amidst financial problems at the club, and work on the new stadium came to a halt as the club debt reached £13million. Smith raised funds by selling Elliott to Leicester for £1.7million, and signed veteran defender Chris Whyte on a free transfer as a short-term replacement. Oxford finished the season in 17th place, but the club's financial situation became ever bleaker. Numerous players were sold, though Smith was allowed to spend £170,000 on defender Phil Whelan. Smith left the Manor Ground midway through 1997–98 with Oxford 16th in the league, and his assistant Crosby managed to maintain the club's mid-table position {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|In the Matsya Purana, Ila was disinherited after {{becoming}} a female or kimpurusha. Ila's father passed his inheritance directly to Pururavas, ignoring the three sons Ila-Sudyumma bore as a male. Pururavas ruled from Pratishtanapura (present-day Allahabad), where Ila stayed with him. The Ramayana says that having returned to manhood, Ila ruled Pratishtana while his son Shashabindu ruled over Bahlika. The Devi-Bhagavata Purana tells {{that as a}} man Sudyumma governed the kingdom and as a woman remained indoors. His subjects were disturbed by his sex changes and did not respect him as they once had. When Pururavas attained adulthood, Sudyumma left his kingdom to Pururavas {{and went to the}} <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> penance. The sage Narada told Sudyumma a nine-syllable mantra, Navakshara, which would please the Supreme Goddess. Pleased with his austerities, the Goddess emerged before Sudyumma, who was in his female form Ilā. Sudyumma praised the Goddess, who merged the king's soul with herself and thus, Ilā gained salvation.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and economic pressures on availability of resources within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting <b>forest</b> <b>for</b> villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand forest {{relies heavily}} on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand <b>forest.</b> <b>For</b> plants with fruit greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.|$|E
