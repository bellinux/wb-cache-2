60|$|I pass to {{a second}} <b>financial</b> <b>proposal.</b> The {{requirements}} of Europe are immediate. The prospect of being relieved of oppressive interest payments to England and America over the whole life {{of the next two}} generations (and of receiving from Germany some assistance year by year to the costs of restoration) would free the future from excessive anxiety. But it would not meet the ills of the immediate present,--the excess of Europe's imports over her exports, the adverse exchange, and the disorder of the currency. It will be very difficult for European production to get started again without a temporary measure of external assistance. I am therefore a supporter of an international loan in some shape or form, such as has been advocated in many quarters in France, Germany, and England, and also in the United States. In whatever way the ultimate responsibility for repayment is distributed, the burden of finding the immediate resources must inevitably fall in major part upon the United States.|$|E

50|$|The bidders {{return a}} {{proposal}} {{by a set}} date and time. Late proposals {{may or may not}} be considered, depending on the terms of the initial RFP. The proposals are used to evaluate the suitability as a supplier, vendor, or institutional partner. Typically organizations follow a detailed vendor screening process to short list the vendors who should be invited for further rounds of negotiation. This screening process could either be vendor scoring models or internal discussions within the buyer organization. Discussions may be held on the proposals (often to clarify technical capabilities or to note errors in a proposal or in many cases to negotiate on the price). In most instances, only selected bidders may be invited to participate in subsequent bids, or may be asked to submit their best technical and <b>financial</b> <b>proposal,</b> commonly referred to as a Best and Final Offer (BAFO). Subsequent changes can be referred to as the Best and Revised Final Offer (BARFO).|$|E
5000|$|On April 14, 2014, Garcetti {{unveiled}} a [...] "hold-the-line" [...] {{budget for the}} coming fiscal year, which proposed modest increases {{in a number of}} city services and zero reduction in the business tax. Garcetti's <b>financial</b> <b>proposal</b> of $8.1 billion required approval from the City Council and closed the $242 million gap [...] "in part by relying on increased tax revenue projections and reductions in vacant positions." [...] The financial plan assumed the city's workforce, which included police officers and firefighters, would not receive raises in the coming year. A notable proposed change was to merge the city's police and fire dispatch centers in an attempt to streamline and improve response time to 911 calls for emergencies and fires. Mayoral aids said such a change would take multiple years to implement. Garcetti hoped to increase funding for the Los Angeles Police Department, the department making up nearly 44 percent of the fund already and most of the increase would go towards new technology for officers. The plan was scheduled to go into effect on July 1, adding eight hours per week to the city's branch library operations. The number of code enforcement officers assigned to look for unpermitted construction and other neighborhood issues, would jump from 25 to 38. Garcetti also announced other changes, including creation of a $1.4 million innovation fund to transform city services, breaking the command structure at the Fire Department into four geographic regions and the hiring of 140 firefighters to cope with attrition.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{portrays the}} {{development}} of a concession-investment optimization model for optimizing the winning potential of a concession-bid from the prospective promoters' viewpoints by taking into account imprecise investment parameters. A financial performance measure has been developed to quantify bid-winning potential. Fuzzy set theory is embedded into a genetic algorithm to optimize bid-winning prospects of concession schemes under uncertainty. The fuzzy vertex method accomplishes propagation of uncertainty in cash flows arising from imprecision in estimation of investment parameters. Genetic algorithm solves the optimization routine. The developed model yields global near-optimal solution of bid-winning potential with contributing values of concessionary items: concession length, base price, and equity level under uncertain investment environment. A numerical example demonstrates model capabilities. The model results would help promoters devise a profitable, yet competitive, <b>financial</b> <b>proposal.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|E
