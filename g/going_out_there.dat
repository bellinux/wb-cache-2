After undergoing six months of extensive auditions, Pinto won the role of Latika, the love interest of the main character Jamal, played by Dev Patel. During the post-production phase, she attended an acting course at the Barry John Acting Studio in Mumbai. Although the course taught her about the [...] "technical aspects" [...] of acting, she stated that [...] "in terms of the actual experience, there's nothing like <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and actually playing the part... So for me, my favorite acting school was the six months of auditioning with Danny Boyle".

2500|$|Due to Michael Strahan's retirement, Tuck was {{promoted}} to starting defensive end. When asked about the pressure of replacing Strahan, Tuck replied [...] "Pressure? No, I'm smart enough to realize there's only one Strahan and there will always only be one Strahan. I'm not trying to replace Michael Strahan. I'm just trying to fill in and {{do my best to}} help this football team win. I'm not pinning that pressure on my back, as far as <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and getting 22 sacks in a season." [...] But Tuck started his 2008 campaign in Michael Strahan-like fashion by sacking Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell in the first play of the season opener. The Giants went on to defeat their division rivals the Washington Redskins 16–7. Tuck followed his exceptional performance in week one with an outstanding performance against the St. Louis Rams. Tuck finished the game with 2.0 sacks and an interception return for a touchdown in a Giants victory in week two. The interception and touchdown marked the first of Tuck's professional career. The touchdown was his first since his junior season at Notre Dame.|$|E
2500|$|In round four, Ablett {{made his}} 150th senior {{appearance}} {{for the club}} against Adelaide and gained life membership with Geelong in the process. Ablett went on to tie Nathan Buckley's then-record of 46 disposals in a game while also setting a new record for most handpasses in a game (33). Ablett's proficiency in finding the football saw him reach 40 or more disposals in a game a record six times throughout the season, and 30 or more disposals fifteen times. However, Ablett's critics accused him of playing selfishly in pursuit of individual honours ahead of team values. Commentators such as Tim Watson claimed that Ablett had [...] "become obsessed with {{the whole idea of}} <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> and being the best player" [...] in order to win the Brownlow Medal. Despite this, Ablett helped Geelong finish the home-and-away campaign with an 18–4 win-loss record to finish second on the ladder and qualify for the finals series. After wins against the Western Bulldogs and Collingwood, Geelong progressed through to the Grand Final for the third successive season. During the final, Ablett gathered 25 disposals, six tackles, five inside-50s, and kicked one goal to help the Cats defeat St Kilda by 12 points and capture the premiership {{for the second time in}} three years.|$|E
