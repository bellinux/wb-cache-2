40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} study of six batch-pipelined scientificworkloads that are {{candidates}} for execution on computational grids. Whereas other studies focus on the behaviorof single applications, this study characterizes workloads composed of pipelines of sequential processes that use <b>filestorage</b> for communication and also share significant data across a batch. This study includes measurements of thememory, CPU, and I/O requirements of individual components as well as analyses of I/O sharing within completebatches. We conclude {{with a discussion of}} the ramifications of these workloads for end-to-end scalability and overallsystem design...|$|E
40|$|To {{provide the}} file storage space on remote serverand {{to access the}} file from mobile device when ever {{required}} isone of the challenging task. The ability to access remote <b>filestorage</b> from mobile devices enables {{a number of new}} use casesfor storing and sharing data. We describe the design andimplementation of a Remote Storage Client framework onSymbian OS, the leading smart phone OS on the market. Implementation of remote storage from mobile device is inspiredand studied from implantation of this with Coda. As we are notconsidered Coda directly in our target scenarios andenvironments. We know how we adapted the Coda concepts tosuit our needs. The advanced features supported by theframework include disconnected operation with whole- filecaching and immediate file access i. e. adapting whole-filecaching principle to multimedia centric smart phones. Usingthis framework, we have implemented Symbian OS remote filesystems based on WebDAV and FTP...|$|E
