The impedance diagrams were corrected by eliminating from the global microchip response the contribution of the impedance of the PET layer between the two microband electrodes. This operation enables a clear observation of the impedance in the microchannel solution, including the bulk solution contribution and the interfacial capacitance related to the surface roughness of the photoablated microchannel. Models for the impedance of solutions of varying conductivity showed that the capacitance of the polymer-solution interface can be modeled by a constant phase element (CPE) with an exponent of 0. 5.

When a real time impedance assay was used, dose-dependent responses depicting patterns that suggested slower uptake (at a toxic 20 lM) and faster recovery of the cells (at the less toxic 10 lM) of the bimetallic complex (1 a) compared to the monometallic complexes (1 and 2) was observed.

Infectious disease accounts for nearly 50 million illness incidences around the world. Applications of lab on chip devices in conducting biomedical research have been drawn substantial interests from scientists and researchers all over the world. These lab-on-achip systems create clinically useful technologies and {{have a number of}} competitive advantages over the conventional biomedical instruments due to the reduced reagents/samples consumption, decreased analysis times and operational costs. In addition, these systems facilitate the development of the portable devices and the possibility of automatically performing multiple assay processes. Early detection and notification of pathogenic bacteria, is therefore of considerable significance in disease control. DNA-based amplification technique, known as a precise diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens, has presented a distinctive advantages over the conventional microbiological culture-based methods for pathogen detection such as high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity, especially in the detection of bacteria in samples containing low concentrations. over the past decade, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has caught significant attention as it is provides rapid amplification with high sensitivity and specificity of the target gene. In this thesis, various lab on a chip based platforms have been developed combining DNA LAMP amplification for detection and quantification of pathogens. In the first part, a microfluidic device designed for amplification of malB gene of E. coli bacteria followed by electrochemical detection of the amplified product. Through amplification time optimization, microfluidic chip could detect and quantify 48 cfu/ml of bacteria in 35 min employing immobilisation-free electrochemical transduction. In the second part of thesis, we have invented a cassette device for high throughput detection of various bacteria types (gram negative &# 38; gram positive). The cassette consists of two aluminum reels and a plastic ribbon, which has an array of chambers. one reel act as the provider of ribbon whilst the other one act as collector. The collector reel is connected to a heater to provide adequate temperatures for the amplification. LAMP solutions with E. coli (as gram negative model for bacteria) was applied to each reservoir and a plastic tape cover the chambers and rolls into the collector reel. After 1 hour - amplification of E. coli was detected using a colorimetric method employing Hydronaphthol blue (HNB) with a 30 CFU/ml limit of detection. The color of HNB changed from purple to blue in the presence of bacterial amplified product. Through procedure modification we were able to detect as low as 200 CFU/ml of S. aureus as an example gram-positive bacteria using Calcein. In the third part of thesis, the cassette’s ribbon has been modified by using flexible screen-printed electrode attached at the bottom of each chamber. Using Osmium redox and immobilisation-free of electrochemical technique, we could monitor the amplification of DNA of E. coli and S. aureus bacteria in a real-time analysis and quantification.

40|$|Introduction: In the now {{classical}} {{theory of}} sound from turbulent flow by Lighthill boundaries were not considered. Further, {{it was assumed}} that the turbulent flow field was not altered by sound emission. For closed systems, such as cavities and waveguides, discrete modes may be excited. It is possible that the coupling between the flow field and acoustic modes is strong enough to alter the primary flow field. Under such conditions acoustically induced flow instabilities such as whistles occur. The objective of this thesis is to study the turbulent excitation of duct modes and the conditions for possible instabilities. Chapter One reviews the theory of turbulent excitation of sound in free space. The induced acoustic field is calculated in three ways. The sound field is determined by time-domain Green's function technique for both Lighthill's quadrupole source model and Ribner's equivalent distribution of monopoles. The omission of turbulent shear interactions in an isotropic monopole model of the turbulence is demonstrated. The sound field is also determined by a frequency-domain Green's function technique for a monopole distribution. Time and frequency domain calculations yield identical results for the monopole source distribution. However, the frequency domain technique allows the analysis to be extended to Chapter Two examines the excitation of axial pipe modes by turbulent flow theoretically and experimentally. The experiment is performed by drawing air through a cylindrical pipe. The observations demonstrate that mode excitation diminishes as the flow speed increases. This is attributed to end losses which increase with flow speed. A Green's function, based on the measured pressure reflection coefficients, is used to predict the variation in spectra with flow. Chapter Three demonstrates the excitation of transverse modes in pipes experimentally. Air is drawn through a small orifice into a rectangular duct. Pronounced asymmetric peaks are observed at the first few cutoff frequencies. The asymmetric nature of the peaks and relative spectral intensity are again explained by Green's function techniques. For high frequencies, where a large number of modes can propagate, the spectra resembles the free-space jet spectra. In this frequency range, the duct radiation impedance asymptotically approaches the <b>free</b> space <b>impedance,</b> hence the similar response to similar source distributions. Chapter Four examines feedback instabilities, cases where the emitted sound field alters the jet flow itself. The chapter concentrates on screech tones of circular orifices having length to diameter ratios between one half and two. The frequency dependence of the screech on Mach number and length is explained by a kinematic analysis of the feedback loop. It is further demonstrated that the frequency of the feedback instability must be approximately equal to that of an acoustic made for screech to occur. Similar observations are presented with regard to air jets impinging on plates. In conclusion two mechanisms exist whereby the acoustic energy from a turbulent jet can be concentrated at select frequencies. The first is the selective response of a medium with boundaries to a random source. The spectral line shape for such cases is accounted for by Green's function techniques. The second mechanism is the feedback instability which requires coupling of the jet flow to the acoustic field. Here the modification of the jet flow must be considered to determine the excitation frequencies. It is recommended that future work be done on the screech instability. The influence of the acoustic cavity mode on the feedback instability should be examined in greater detail. In particular, the convection speed of jet column disturbances with and without adjacent resonators should be determined experimentally. Furthermore, the mechanism which limits the amplitude of the screech should be determined. June 1977 Originally presented as the author's thesis, Ph. D. in the M. I. T.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{rectenna}} systems {{almost half a}} century ago has enabled numerous applications in a number of areas, with the main goal of recycling the ambient microwave energy. In previously presented rectennas, microstrip antennas were the main energy source used to capture and convert microwaves to AC power. However, the conversion efficiency of antennas have never been examined in terms of their capability of absorbing microwave energy, and hence any enhancements to the overall efficiency of rectenna systems were mainly attributed to the rectification circuitry instead of the antenna. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, a novel electromagnetic energy collector is presented, consisting of an array of Split Ring Resonators (SRRs), used for the first time as the main electromagnetic source of energy in a rectenna system. The SRR array is compared to an array of patch antennas to determine the radiation to AC efficiency when both arrays are placed on the same footprint. Numerical simulations and experimental tests show that the SRRs achieve higher efficiency and wider bandwidth than microstrip antennas. The idea of electromagnetic energy harvesting using metamaterials is further explored by designing a metamaterial slab based on the full absorption concept. The metasurface material parameters are tuned to achieve a surface that is matched to the <b>free</b> space <b>impedance</b> at a certain band of frequencies to minimize any reflections and ensure full absorption within the metasurface. The absorbed energy is then channeled to a resistive load placed within each element of the metasurface. Different from previous metasurface absorber designs, here the power absorbed is mostly dissipated across the load resistance instead of the substrate material. A case study is considered where the metamaterial slab is designed to operate at 3 GHz. The simulation and experimental results show radiation to AC efficiencies of 97 % and 93 %, respectively. A novel method is proposed in the second part of the thesis that significantly increases the conversion efficiency of electromagnetic energy harvesting systems. The method is based on utilizing the available vertical volume above a 2 -D flat panel by vertically stacking panels while maintaining the same 2 -D footprint. The concept is applied to SRRs and folded dipole antennas. In both cases, four vertically stacked arrays are compared to a single array panel, both occupying the same flat 2 -D footprint in terms of power efficiency. The numerical and experimental results for both the SRRs and the antennas show that the stacking concept can increase the conversion efficiency by up to five times when compared to a single 2 -D flat panel. The third part presents the design of a near unity electromagnetic energy harvester that uses a Tightly Coupled Antenna array. Compared to the unit cell of metamaterial surfaces, the dimension of a TCA unit cell is about five times larger, thus providing simplified channeling networks and cost-effective solutions. The TCA surface contains an array of Vivaldi shape unit cells with a diode at each cell to convert the harvested electromagnetic energy to dc power. The dc power from each unit cell is channeled to one single load via series inductors. A sample 4 X 4 TCA array, when simulated, fabricated and tested shows solid agreement between the simulated and measured results. The thesis then discusses the idea and design of a dually polarized metasurface for electromagnetic energy harvesting. A 4 X 4 super cell with alternating vias between adjacent cells is designed to allow for capturing the energy from various incident angles at an operating frequency of 2. 4 GHz. The collected energy is then channeled to a feeding network that collects the AC power and feeds it to rectification circuitry. The simulation results yield a radiation to AC, and AC to DC conversion efficiencies of around 90 % and 80 %, respectively. As a proof of concept, an array consisting of nine super cells is fabricated and measured. The experimental results show that the proposed energy harvester is capable of capturing up to 70 % of the energy from a plane wave with various incident angles and then converting it to usable DC power. As future work, the last part introduces the concept of metasurface energy harvesting in the infrared regime. The metasurface unit cells consist of an H-shaped resonator with the load placed across the gap of the resonator. Different from infrared meta-material absorber designs, the resonator is capable of not only full absorption but also maximum energy channeling across the load resistance. The numerical simulation demonstrates that 96 % of the absorbed energy is dissipated across the load resistance. In addition, a cross-polarized H-resonator design is presented that is capable of harvesting infrared energy using dual polarization within three frequency bands...|$|R
