50|$|Digital textile {{printing}} {{is often referred}} to as direct-to-garment printing, DTG printing, or digital garment printing. It is a process of printing on textiles and garments using specialized or modified <b>inkjet</b> <b>technology.</b> Inkjet printing on fabric is also possible with an inkjet printer by using fabric sheets with a removable paper backing. Today, major <b>inkjet</b> <b>technology</b> manufacturers can offer specialized products designed for direct printing on textiles, not only for sampling but also for bulk production. Since the early 1990s, <b>inkjet</b> <b>technology</b> and specially developed water-based ink (known as dye-sublimation or disperse direct ink) have made it possible to print directly onto polyester fabric. This is mainly related to visual communication in retail and brand promotion (flags, banners and other point of sales applications). Printing onto nylon and silk can be done by using an acid ink. Reactive ink is used for cellulose based fibers such as cotton and linen. <b>Inkjet</b> <b>technology</b> in digital {{textile printing}} allows for single pieces, mid-run production and even long-run alternatives to screen printed fabric.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates inkjet {{printing}} of fully-integrated modules fabricated on organic substrates as a system-level solution for ultra-low-cost and eco-friendly mass production of wireless sensor modules. Prototypes are designed and implemented in both traditional FR- 4 substrate and organic substrate. The prototype on organic substrate {{is referred to}} as a Smart Wireless Integrated Module (SWIM). Parallels are drawn between FR- 4 manufacturing and <b>inkjet</b> printing <b>technology,</b> and recommendations are discussed to enable the potential of <b>inkjet</b> printing <b>technology.</b> Finally, this thesis presents novel applications of SWIM technology in the area of wearable and implantable electronics. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to <b>inkjet</b> printing <b>technology</b> on organic substrates, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the requirements for low-power consumption, low-cost, and eco-friendly technology. Chapter 2 discusses the design of SWIM and its implementation using traditional manufacturing techniques on FR- 4 substrate. Chapter 3 presents a benchmark prototype of SWIM on paper substrate.

40|$|ABSTRACT Microarrays with biomolecules (e. g., DNA and proteins), cells, and tissues {{immobilized on}} solid {{substrates}} are important tools for biological research, including genomics, proteomics, and cell analysis. In this paper, {{the current state}} of microarray fabrication is reviewed. According to spot formation techniques, methods are categorized as “contact printing ” and “non-contact printing. ” Contact printing is a widely used technology, comprising methods such as contact pin printing and microstamping. These methods have many ad-vantages, including reproducibility of printed spots and facile maintenance, as well as drawbacks, including low-throughput fabrication of arrays. Non-contact printing techniques are newer and more varied, comprising photochemistry-based methods, laser writing, electrospray deposition, and <b>inkjet</b> <b>technologies.</b> These technologies emerged from other applications and have the potential to increase microarray fabrication throughput; however, there are several chal-lenges in applying them to microarray fabrication, including interference from satellite drops and biomolecule denaturization...|$|R
50|$|Multi-Jet {{printing}} {{refers to}} the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using <b>inkjet</b> <b>technology.</b> High resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing.

This allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications.|$|E
50|$|The desktop {{impact printer}} was {{gradually}} {{replaced by the}} inkjet printer. When Hewlett-Packard's patents expired on steam-propelled photolithographically produced ink-jet heads, the inkjet mechanism became available to the printer industry. For applications that did not require impact (e.g. carbon-copy printing), the inkjet was superior in nearly all respects: comparatively quiet operation, faster print speed, and output quality {{almost as good as}} a laser printer. By the mid-1990s, <b>inkjet</b> <b>technology</b> had surpassed dot-matrix in the mainstream market.|$|E

Requirements of this application are high speed, a long service life, a relatively large gap between the print head and the substrate, and low operating cost.|$|E
