25|$|There {{are both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages to using bath treatments. Bath treatments are more difficult and need more manpower to administer, requiring skirts or tarpaulins to be placed around the cages to contain the drug. Prevention of reinfection is a challenge since it is practically impossible to treat an entire bay {{in a short time}} period. Since the volume of water is imprecise, the required concentration is not guaranteed. Crowding of fish to reduce the volume of drug can also stress the fish. Recent use of well-boats containing the drugs has reduced both the concentration and environmental concerns, although transferring fish to the well boat and back to the cage can be stressful. The major advantage to bath treatments is that all the fish will be treated equally, in contrast to <b>in-feed</b> treatments where amount of drug ingested can vary due to a number of reasons.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focus on}} how the {{emergence}} of novelties in psychotherapy, which we term Innovative Moments (IMs), progresses {{to the construction of}} a new self-narrative. Novelty’s emergence challenge a person’s dominant self-narrative (i. e., usual way of understanding and experiencing), generating uncertainty. Frequently, clients resolve the uncertainty, by attenuating the novelty’s meaning, making a quick return to the dominant self-narrative. From a dialogical perspective, a dominant voice (which organize clients’ self-narrative) and a non-dominant (or innovative) voice (expressed during IMs) establish a cyclical relation – mutual <b>in-feeding</b> – throughout the therapeutic process, blocking self-development. In this article, we analyze a successful psychotherapeutic case focusing on how the relation between dominant and nondominant voices evolve from mutual <b>in-feeding</b> to other forms of dialogical relation.

25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as <b>in-feed</b> {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To analyze a poor outcome case of {{narrative}} therapy {{with a woman}} victim of intimate violence. Method: The Innovative Moments Coding System: version 1 was applied to all sessions to track the innovative moments (i-moments) in the therapeutic conversation. I–moments are the narrative details that occur in psychotherapeutic conversations that are outside {{the influence of the}} problematic narrative. This research aims to describe the processes involved in meanings’ stability along psychotherapy through a dialogical approach to meaning making. Results: Contrarily to what usually occurs in good outcome cases, re-conceptualization i-moments are absent. Moreover, two specific types of i-moments emerged with higher duration: reflection and protest. Qualitative analysis showed that the potential meanings of these i-moments were surpassed by a return to the problematic narrative. Conclusion: The therapeutic stability seems to be maintained by a systematic return to the problematic narrative after the emergence of novelties, a process that was referred from a dialogical perspective as a mutual <b>in-feeding</b> of voices (Valsiner, 2002), one that emerges in the i-moment and another one that supports the problematic narrative.

In this paper, we discuss different analytical reformulations of the chance constraints, based on a given set of assumptions concerning the forecast error distributions. In particular, we discuss reformulations that do not assume a normal distribution, and admit an analytical reformulation given only a mean vector and covariance matrix. We illustrate our method with {{a case study of}} the IEEE 118 bus system, based on real data from the European system. The different reformulations are compared in terms of both achieved empirical violation probability and operational cost, which allows us to provide a suggestion for the most appropriate reformulation in an optimal power flow setting.

40|$|A Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) system {{consists}} of several Voltage-Source Converters (VSCs) whose dc terminals are connected in shunt across the buses of a dc network. The dc voltages {{are determined by}} the electric charges stored across the dc capacitor of every Voltage-Source Converter (VSC). As dc over-voltage leads to failure in the solid-state switches and dc under-voltage leads to waveform distortion, the target of safe, economic design is a narrow voltage margin of about 5 % around a nominal dc voltage rating. The worst case scenario {{consists of}} an accidental loss of a Voltage-Source Converter because the sudden large change in dc power causes the dc capacitors to charge up or down, exceeding the voltage margin before power balance can be re-established by local feedbacks of the Voltage-Source Converters (VSCs). Part I of the thesis shows how the target can be achieved by: (1) planning the dc voltage reference setting and the power reference settings of the Voltage-Source Converters (VSCs) which satisfy the voltage margins in steady-state for both the pre-fault and post-fault conditions; (2) incorporating an Advanced DC Voltage Control (ADCVC) which enables the dc voltage margins to be satisfied during the transient periods. Part II of the thesis is concerned with finding innovative applications for Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) systems. It shows that the high degree of controllability of the Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) system can be exploited in: (1) optimal acquistion of wind power in offshore wind-farms; (2) providing premium quality power in underground cable <b>in-feeds</b> of city centers; (3) providing simultaneous inter-area decoupling and local area damping in interconnections...|$|R

40|$|The voltage-sourced {{converter}} (VSC) based high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission {{technology is}} one of the most promising technologies for (i) expansion of the power networks for large cities and <b>in-feeding</b> the city centers, (ii) grid integration of renewable energy resources, i. e., hydropower, wind farms, and solar plants, (iii) long-distance bulk-power transmission, (iv) interconnection of asynchronous power grids, and (v) electrification of isolated power loads, islands, and oil and gas stations. Among the existing VSC topologies, a class of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) is the most promising topology due to its modularity and scalability. However, there are a few technical challenges associated with the control of MMCs including (i) balancing the submodule (SM) capacitor voltages at their desired values without creating unnecessary SM switching transitions and sacrificing the efficiency, (ii) reducing the circulating currents flowing through the three phases of the MMC. Although the circulating currents have no effect on the ac side of the MMC, if not properly eliminated/minimized, increase the ripple amplitude of the SM capacitor voltages, rating values of the converter components, and power losses, (iii) reducing the magnitude of the dc-line voltage/current ripple, and (iv) handling the dc-side short circuit faults. In MMC-HVDC systems, in case of a fault occurrence on the dc side, the Integrated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) are blocked. However, the diodes provide a current path for the fault current from the ac side to the dc side until the ac circuit breakers open. Therefore, the MMC by itself does not provide dc-fault-handling capability. This research proposes a model predictive control (MPC) strategy that takes the advantage of a cost function minimization technique to address the above-mentioned challenges associated with the control of the MMCs. A discrete-time mathematical model of the MMC-HVDC system is derived and a predictive model corresponding to the discrete-time model is developed. The predictive model is used to select the best switching states of each MMC unit based on evaluation and minimization of a defined cost function associated with the control objectives of the MMC-HVDC system. Time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment for various operating scenarios have demonstrated/validated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods, as compared to the existing solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|Power {{systems are}} {{nowadays}} {{becoming more and}} more interconnected, and controlled by several TSOs (Transmission System Operators), in order to ensure a reliable and economical supply and distribution of electric power. These (interconnected) electrical power networks are often considered as the most complex man-made dynamical systems ever. For example, according to the dataset provided by the ENTSO-E (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) for static studies (calculation of the AC load flow), the European interconnected power grid consists of approximately 4300 buses, 6300 lines and 1100 transformers together with their loads, distribution systems and generations <b>in-feeds</b> (in different voltage levels of 380 kV, 220 kV and 150 kV). The proper control of such a large-scale interconnected power system is a very challenging problem due to the various continuous and discrete dynamics evolving in the system and their complicated interactions. Each local control agent (CA), corresponding to an area operated by one TSO, tries to achieve local improvement. However, it happens frequently that a local initiating disturbance in one area triggers some local control actions in its own area which in turn triggers further disturbances in the neighboring areas causing some undesirable control actions by their neighbors, and eventually a cascade of possibly wrong control actions lead the overall system to a final collapse. One important class of power system instability is voltage instability, which actually arises from the inability of combined generation-transmission systems to deliver the power requested by (dynamical recovery) voltage-dependent loads. Such a voltage instability, if not corrected properly, due to a cascade of events, can eventually lead to voltage collapse (abnormally low voltages in a major portion of the system) often resulting in blackouts or separation of the system into separate unsynchronized islands. The societal impacts and financial costs/losses caused by blackouts are significantly huge. The voltage in electrical power systems is, in nature, a ``local" variable unlike frequency being a ``global" variable. This means that, in multi-area power systems, only areas that are electrically close together interact with each other for voltage, and {{there is no need to}} involve distant areas with negligible common interest in solving a local optimization problem. The latter promotes the decomposition approaches for voltage control, where the voltage control still remains a prerogative of the local utilities. This thesis focuses on long-term voltage instability - in the order of several minutes after a major disturbance. The driving force of such instability, following a disturbance, is the process of load restoration, where the dynamics of recovering loads directly as well as some control mechanism such as LTCs (Load Tap Changing transformers) indirectly (by restoring the distribution-side voltages of the corresponding voltage-dependent loads), try to locally restore the load powers to the pre-disturbance values. The long-term voltage instability often occurs when LTCs try to restore the distribution side voltages of the connected buses, while the maximum power that the transmission system can provide to loads is reduced by the reactive power capability limits of generators, mainly enforced by OXLs (Over eXcitation Limiters). It seems rather intuitive, then, to seek some way of anticipating what will be the future behavior of a power system, by employing controllers which can look ahead in time. The long-term voltage control becomes even a more complex and harder problem in large-scale multi-area power system, each controlled by an independent TSO. The reason is that, for example, an arbitrary LTC move in one area can trigger undesirable LTC move(s), OXL activations in other areas, and such complicated global interactions may eventually lead to a blackout in the form of a voltage collapse. In order to avoid such a collapse in large-scale multi-area power systems, the local control actions taken by each CA, must be coordinated with those of (adjacent) neighbors. This coordination requires communications between neighboring CAs. This thesis proposes an efficient distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) paradigm which combines two concepts of ``looking-ahead" and ``coordination". The proposed MPC-based control scheme relies on the communication of planned local control actions among neighboring CAs, each possibly operated by an independent TSO. Modelica, a free of charge object-oriented language, is used to develop a much-faster-than-real-time simulator, providing an hybrid framework for effectively modeling and simulating power systems. Modelica facilitates the development of tools to generate very efficient codes for modeling of compositional physical systems such as electrical power networks, by relaxing the causality constraint of components, and focusing only on the topology of the overall system. In this thesis, the dynamic models for anticipation, are derived by considering each area as a hybrid dynamical system, using DAEs to describe piecewise continuous dynamics, and the set of events of hybrid automata representing the discrete logical controllers. This hybrid modeling framework captures the complex interactions between continuous and discrete dynamics. The ``looking-ahead" voltage controller can anticipate, within the prediction horizon window, for example, the activation of OXLs, moving towards reaching the maximum physical tap limits for LTCs, and deviating too much from the prescribed voltage bounds for buses. The controller will then efficiently use these anticipations, by selecting a control sequence that does not cause the above-mentioned constraint violations. The first input of the best control sequence selected by each local MPC, at each discrete time instant, will be applied to the local system until the next time instant, where the local optimization repeats again selecting the new best control action. Each CA, knowing a local model of its own area, as well as a reduced-order Quasi Steady-State (QSS) models of its immediate neighboring areas, and assuming a simpler equivalent PV model for the distant areas, performs a greedy local optimization over a finite window in time, communicating its planned control input sequence to its immediate neighbors only. The ``communicating" voltage controller enables each CA to coordinate its own local action with what its immediate neighbors are planning to do, assuming a QSS model for predicting how control actions of neighbors influence the interacting variables. The good performance of the proposed real-time model-based feedback coordinating controller, following major disturbances, is illustrated using time-domain simulation of the well-known realistic Nordic 32 test system, assuming worst-case conditions. Robustness of the proposed method against measurement inaccuracies, modeling errors as well as the uncertainty of the load behavior has also been illustrated. This thesis considers two cases where, in the first reasonably sized network, a local CA, knows the complete model of the overall system, while, in the second realistic sized system, it employs reduced-order QSS models for immediate neighbors, and assumes a simpler equivalent PV model for the distant areas. Simulation results illustrates the significant achievements obtained when the proposed model-based coordinating control is applied to different systems under some severe disturbances. This thesis compares the above-mentioned simulation results with scenarios where a purely decentralized uncoordinated deadband control, as the current practice for LTCs, is applied, or where a decentralized uncoordinated MPC approach with no communication is applied. In this way it becomes possible to identify the two afore-mentioned distinct contributions of the proposed model-based coordinating approach namely ``looking-ahead" and ``communication", since the decentralized deadband approach lacks both anticipation and coordination, and the decentralized MPC approach ignores the communications with neighbors...|$|R
