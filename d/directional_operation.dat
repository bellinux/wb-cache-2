Following the change in ownership, the station had a hybrid format of oldies, standards and big-band music, which underwent very little change until the early 1990s. During the late 1980s, WMVI had secured a construction permit to switch to 1160 kHz with 50,000 watts daytime power and modest nighttime power. However, ownership could not afford the upgrades the station needed for high-power, <b>directional</b> <b>operation</b> and the permit was left to expire. Later, WMVI did secure another permit to switch to 1160 kHz with 5 kW days/570w nights, non-directional. Coming under Branigan's ownership once again in late 1995, WMVI would return after a brief period, being off the air with an oldies/variety format which featured Branigan himself {{as the centerpiece of}} the station. Though the format proved popular with local listeners, the station had an extremely difficult time retaining advertising accounts due to repeated transmitter & 'telco' STL failures, forcing the station off the air repeatedly, sometimes for days at a time. As station employees moved to more secure jobs and operating funds became scarce, Branigan leased the station in 1998 to a group which aired Black Gospel music. Again, money shortages and aging, unreliable equipment forced Branigan to sell the station outright.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] A fully {{connected}} network of spiking neurons modeling motor cortical <b>directional</b> <b>operations</b> is presented and analyzed. The model allows for the basic biological requirements stemming {{from the results of}} experimental studies. The dynamical evolution of the network's output is interpreted as the sequential generation of neuronal population vectors representing the combined directional tendency of the ensemble. Adding these population vectors tip-to-tail yields the neural-vector trajectory that describes the upcoming movement trajectory. The key point of the model is that the intra-network interactions provide sustained dynamics, whereas external inputs are only required to initiate the population. The network is trained to generate neural-vector trajectories corresponding to basic types of two-dimensional movements (the network with specified connections can store one trajectory). A simple modification of the simulated annealing algorithm enables training of the network in the presence of noise. Training in the presence of noise yields robustness of the learned dynamical behaviors. Another key point of the model is that the directional preference of a single neuron is determined by the synaptic connections. Accordingly, individual preferred directions as well as tuning curves are not assigned, but emerge as the result of interactions inside the population. For trained networks, the spiking behavior of single neurons and correlations between different neurons as well as the global activity of the population are discussed in the light of experimental findings.

Then phase angle difference of fault and prefault positive sequence current is calculated for fault directional estimation. The positive sequence current based methods have although limitation for high resistance far end fault, and load change situation but during such situation CCVT transient is not possible. So, once the CCVT transient {{at the secondary}} side is detected, the proposed method can be applied as a stand-alone protection scheme to avoid any nuisance <b>directional</b> relay <b>operation.</b> The presence of AFSC and PFSC, higher system SIR value, fault type, fault location, fault resistance, and fault inception angle have negligible impact {{on the performance of}} proposed method.

These operations involve continuous monitoring of the azimuth and inclination of the well path to ensure the target is reached and, for safety reasons, to avoid collisions with existing wells. Although the most accurate method of achieving this is through a gyroscopic survey, this can be time consuming and expensive. An alternative method is a magnetic survey, where measurements while drilling (MWD) are made along the well by magnetometers housed in a tool within the drill string. These MWD magnetic surveys require estimates of the Earth's magnetic field at the drilling location to correct the downhole magnetometer readings. The most accurate corrections are obtained if all sources of the Earth's magnetic field are considered. Estimates of the main field generated in the core and the local crustal field can be obtained using mathematical models derived from suitable data sets. In order to quantify the external field, an analysis of UK observatory data from 1983 to 2004 has been carried out. By accounting for the external field, the directional error associated with estimated field values at a mid-latitude oil well (55 ° N) in the North Sea is shown to be reduced by the order of 20 %. This improvement varies with latitude, local time, season and phase of the geomagnetic activity cycle. By accounting for all sources of the field, using a technique called Interpolation In-Field Referencing (IIFR), directional drillers have access to data from a "virtual" magnetic observatory at the drill site. This leads to an error reduction in positional accuracy that is close to matching that of the gyroscopic survey method and provides a valuable independent technique for quality control purposes...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Oil and gas are global fuels {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} drilling wells in underground terrestrial reservoirs. Vertical drilling is preferred {{because of its}} simplicity and therefore low cost, but subsurface targets can often be procured only by directing the wellbore along predefined non-vertical trajectories. For instance, directional drilling must be employed to reach locations inaccessible to the drilling rig, to side track an existing well (multilateral drilling), or to drill multiple wells from the same offshore platform (horizontal drilling). Approach: A complete knowledge of the wellbore direction and orientation during the drilling process is essential to guarantee proper directional drilling procedure. Results: Thus, besides the conventional drilling assembly, <b>directional</b> drilling <b>operations</b> require sensors to provide azimuth, inclination and toolface angles of the drill. These sensors {{are part of the}} Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) tool, which in current technology is installed several feet behind the drill bit. In such systems, values for inclination and toolface angles are determined from accelerometer measurements at predetermined stationary surveying stations; these values are then incorporated with magnetometer measurements to deliver the azimuth angle. Values for inclination and azimuth angles at the current surveying station are combined with those from the previous station to compute the position of the probe. However, there is no accurate information about the wellbore trajectory between survey stations. Additionally, the magnetic field of the magnetometers has deleterious effect on the overall accuracy of surveying measurements. Conclusion: A method to provide continuous information about the wellbore trajectory has been developed in this study. The module developed integrates a Rotary Steerable System (RSS) and MWD tool into one drilling probe utilizing Inertial Navigation System (INS) technology. This is achieved by designing a reliable real-time low cost MWD surveying system based on MEMS inertial sensors miniaturized inside the RSS housing installed directly behind the drill bit.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} overcurrent relays (OCRs) coordination {{in the presence of}} DGs. OCRs are optimally set to work in a coordinated manner to isolate faults with minimal impacts on customers. The penetration of DGs into the power system changes the fault current levels seen by the OCRs. This can deteriorate the coordinated operation of OCRs. Operation time difference between backup and main relays can be below the standard limit or even the backup OCR can incorrectly work before the main OCR. Though resetting of OCRs is tedious especially in large systems, it cannot alone restore the original coordinated operation in the presence of DGs. The paper investigates the optimal utilization of fault current limiters (FCLs) to maintain the <b>directional</b> OCRs coordinated <b>operation</b> without any need to OCRs resetting irrespective of DGs status.

The proposed algorithm is applied to meshed and radial power systems at different DGs arrangements using different types of FCLs. Moreover, the OCRs coordination problem is studied when the system includes both directional and non-directional OCRs. Comparative analysis of results is provided...|$|R

The results from our study of the geomagnetic conditions in the Norwegian Sea clearly indicate that the direction from a monitoring station to a drilling site matters when {{using data from the}} monitoring station to quality control or correct downhole directional measurements affected by geomagnetic disturbances. While the deviations in total field and dip correspond well over large distances along the same geomagnetic latitude in east-west direction, the declination variations correlate better in the north-south direction. When analysing observatory data {{in the vicinity of the}} Barents Sea we discovered that the deviations in declination during disturbed periods can be constantly offset from the quiet level for several hours. Magnetic directional surveys taken during such conditions will result in an unmodeled position-bias, if not corrected for. Based on observatory data from all over the northern auroral zone, and a new application of an external magnetic field model, we show that there can be significant differences in the geomagnetic conditions along concurrent geomagnetic latitudes, in addition to the known latitudinal variations...|$|R
