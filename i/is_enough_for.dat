5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, while {{reviewing the}} station's surveillance tapes, Mulder sees footage of Banton {{staring at the}} floor. After blowing up the frame, Mulder sees the logo for a company called Polarity Magnetics on Banton's jacket. The agents visit Polarity Magnetics, where they meet scientist Christopher Davey (Kevin McNulty). He identifies Banton, a physicist conducting research into dark matter. Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in his laboratory {{in which he was}} locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of subatomic particles. His account <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion, but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory.|$|E
50|$|The relegation battle {{ended in}} {{disappointment}} for Wolves and Peterborough. The late goal for Crystal Palace against Peterborough meant that a 1-1 draw <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Blackburn, a 2-0 win for Sheffield Wednesday over Middlesbrough <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> {{to secure their}} safety, a 1-0 defeat for Millwall against Derby County <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> them and a 2-2 draw between Huddersfield and Barnsley <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> both teams. Wolves lost 2-0 to Brighton, having started {{the day in the}} most difficult situation of the threatened teams.|$|R

5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of determining how much power <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> today and tomorrow, great powers recognize {{that the best way}} to ensure their security is to achieve hegemony now, thus eliminating any possibility of a challenge by another great power. Only a misguided state would pass up an opportunity to be the hegemon in the system because it thought it already had sufficient power to survive.|$|E

25|$|Light {{scattered}} {{in a blue}} sky forms a characteristic pattern of partially polarized light which {{is dependent on the}} position of the sun and invisible to human eyes. With a UV receptor in each of the lens units of a compound eye, and a UV filter oriented differently in each of these units, a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern. A small piece of blue sky <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring {{over the course of a}} day. This provides not only directional but also temporal information.|$|E

It has already become the ideal in respect of development for the hill areas of the country.|$|E

25|$|Cali {{is served}} by over 20 coach {{companies}} which gather in the Central Bus Station. The Station is centrally located near the old (now redundant) railway station, which serves now as Metrocali's headquarters. Depending on {{the company and the}} destination, the vehicles range from minibuses to large coaches. Recently, in their last float renovation wave, Colombian coaches operators have opted for Brazil's Marcopolo buses. Informal stops exist for the short destination rides all along the way from Central Station to the town of destination. In some cases, it <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a passenger to ask to get off the bus for the bus to stop.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the small}} size of Israel, the {{concentration}} of hi-tech firms across much of the country <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> it to be recognised as one large cluster. Most activity is located in the densely populated areas of metropolitan Tel Aviv, Haifa (Matam), and Jerusalem (Technology Park, Malha, Har Hotzvim and JVP Media Quarter in Talpiot), and the Startup Village Ecosystem in the Yokneam area, although some secondary with additional activity include the corridor to Beer Sheba, including Kiryat Gat, and the Western Galilee. In all, this is an area no larger than 6000 square kilometers, half of the extended Silicon Valley's geographical coverage.|$|E
25|$|Again, to the Salon d'Automne of 1913 - a salon {{in which}} Cubism {{was now the}} predominating {{tendency}} - Metzinger sent the great picture called En Bâteau (En Canot, Im Boot), La Fresnaye La Conquête de l'Air, myself Les Bâteaux de Pêche and La Ville et le Fleuve. If the first moment of surprise had passed by, the interest Cubism excited was as great as ever. The anger and the enthusiasm had not changed sides, our enemies held to their guns. It <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> proof to read the diatribes of Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas for that year,1913, and the panegyrics of Guillaume Apollinaire in L'Intransigeant.|$|E

A voiding diary {{in the form of}} frequency volume chart records voided volume along with time of each micturition for at least 24 hours. Frequency volume chart <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> patients with complaint of nocturia and frequency only. If other symptoms are also present then a detailed bladder diary must be maintained. In a bladder diary, times of micturition and voided volume, incontinence episodes, pad usage and other information such as fluid intake, the degree of urgency and the degree of incontinence are recorded.|$|E
25|$|The LALR parser {{was invented}} by Frank DeRemer in his 1969 PhD dissertation, Practical Translators for LR(k) languages, in his {{treatment}} of the practical difficulties {{at that time of}} implementing LR(1) parsers. He showed that the LALR parser has more language recognition power than the LR(0) parser, while requiring the same number of states as the LR(0) parser for a language that can be recognized by both parsers. This makes the LALR parser a memory-efficient alternative to the LR(1) parser for languages that are LALR. It was also proved that there exist LR(1) languages that are not LALR. Despite this weakness, the power of the LALR parser <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> many mainstream computer languages, including Java, though the reference grammars for many languages fail to be LALR due to being ambiguous.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{prevention}} of yellow fever includes vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites {{in areas where}} yellow fever is endemic. Institutional measures for {{prevention of}} yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures of controlling mosquitoes. Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes are providing reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever. Use of EPA-registered insect repellent is recommended when outdoors. Exposure for even a short time <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a potential mosquito bite. Long-sleeved clothing, long pants, and socks are useful for prevention. The awareness of peak mosquito exposure is from dusk to dawn. The application of larvicides to water-storage containers can help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites. Adult mosquitos can be killed through insecticide spray usage, which decreases the transmission of yellow fever.|$|E
