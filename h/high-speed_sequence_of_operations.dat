30|$|Assuming that Rubik’s Cube is {{operated}} by certain number operations and specified operations {{from the original}} state {{back to the original}} state again, this means the Rubik’s Cube achieves a cycle. The circulation period is the number of times the Rubik’s Cube is rotated. If the circulation period is a constant, the cycle is periodic. If the circulation period is variable, the cycle is nonperiodic. The <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> a nonperiodic cycle is based on both the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> periodic cyclic <b>operations</b> and the “constant process” <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> that causes the cube’s pattern to exhibit a nonperiodic change.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the time-resolved analysis <b>of</b> <b>high-speed</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> particle images is presented. The proposed method aims at the minimization of PIV {{errors in the}} lower velocity range by adjusting locally and dynamically the interframe time interval of the PIV pairs in a recorded <b>high-speed</b> <b>sequence.</b> The algorithm performs the operation on a local basis, thus providing {{the same level of}} accuracy across the full velocity dynamic range of the flow. The present results indicate a greater performance than state-of-the-art PIV analysis based on multi-grid offset PIV and is successfully applied to synthetic and real flow cases.

40|$|Simha, R. and A. Majumdar, On Lookahead in the List Update Problem. Information Processing Letters. We study {{a problem}} in the area of {{self-adjusting}} data structures: algorithms for the singly-linked list for the case in which a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> is to be performed on the list and the entire sequence is known beforehand. Whereas past approaches assume that the cost of lookahead is zero, we explicitly take into account this cost and allow for different list access and lookahead costs, parametrically specified by a ratio ff. Our main result is that the well-known Move-to-Front algorithm is 2 ff-competitive with an algorithm that scans the entire <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> Simulation results point to a remarkably counter-intuitive observation: the optimal strategy is to either scan the entire <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> or not scan it at all.
