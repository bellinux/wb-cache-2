5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as <b>foster</b> <b>mother,</b> protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the formal}} {{child welfare system}} in South Africa, foster care is {{considered}} the preferred form of alternative care for children removed from their biological families and who are unavailable for adoption. This reflects {{the belief that the}} family is ideal environment best suited for optimal child survival and development. Although many South African children have benefitted from court-ordered foster care in the last two decades, however ineffective screening, training and preparation of foster carers have posed challenges to meeting the needs of children in need of alternative care. Utilizing general systems and attachment theories, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore perceptions about developing an evidence-based tool for the screening of eligible <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> of children in cluster-foster care in South Africa. The study employed a qualitative research approach to data collection and analysis. A semistructured interview schedule was used to explore the perspectives of 12 social workers and four <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> about context-specific criteria for screening <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> within the clusterfoster care system in South Africa. Results indicate that a reliable and valid tool for screening eligible <b>mothers</b> in cluster <b>foster</b> care settings in South Africa should include a standardized assessment of parenting skills and psychological wellbeing of potential <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> in addition to the normative sociodemographic background assessments. Emotional and financial support were also shown to be crucial in ensuring the retention of <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> within the context of high attrition rates of foster parents in South Africa. The findings of this study underscore the importance of using an evidence-based screening tool to recruit potential <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> in South Africa and the need to assess the psychosocial wellbeing of potential <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> in addition to background checks...|$|R
40|$|Unfavourable {{socio-economic}} {{and psychosocial}} changes, globally and locally, have forced communities {{to place an}} increasing number of adolescents in foster care, or take the necessary steps to accommodate them in orphanages. The drastic interventions had many unsettling consequences. South African orphanages were inundated with orphaned and removed children, and foster care was a constructive alternative. Research results have shown that, for children to develop normally, they have to be cared for in cordial and constructive family structures (Republic of South Africa, Department of Social Development, 2009). The present study was exploratory and aimed to explore the challenges faced by <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> who were <b>fostering</b> the adolescents at the time of interviewing, as well as coping strategies employed by <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> in their task of fostering. The target areas were Mamelodi and Atteridgeville Townships in the Tshwane/Pretoria Region. Twenty <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> were selected from a list of <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> received from social workers and semi-structured interviews were conducted with these 20 respondents.

5|$|Edward's {{name was}} English in origin, linking {{him to the}} Anglo-Saxon saint Edward the Confessor, and was chosen by his father instead of the more {{traditional}} Norman and Castilian names selected for Edward's brothers: Edward had three elder brothers: John and Henry who had died before Edward was born, and Alphonso, who died in August 1284, leaving Edward as {{the heir to the}} throne. Although Edward was a relatively healthy child, there were enduring concerns throughout his early years that he too might die and leave his father without a male heir. After his birth, Edward was looked after by a wet-nurse called Mariota or Mary Maunsel for a few months until she fell ill, when Alice de Leygrave became his <b>foster</b> <b>mother.</b> He would have barely known his natural mother Eleanor, who was in Gascony with his father during his earliest years.

40|$|This {{research}} explores motherhood in late twentieth-century America {{through an}} ethnography of Connecticut <b>foster</b> <b>mothers.</b> Data are contextualized within the gender, social, personal, political, and historical relations that shape and condition women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences. Themes of <b>foster</b> <b>mothering</b> work women identified as important are: (1) {{the construction and}} experience of <b>foster</b> <b>mothering</b> relationships; (2) the construction of kinship relationships through affective claims of belonging; (3) mothering and labor: {{the political economy of}} fostering; (4) foster relationships and the presence of 2 ̆ 2 the state; 2 ̆ 2 (5) <b>foster</b> <b>mothering</b> work, knowledge, and expertise; (6) the social and familial context of fostering; and (7) the experience of loss and bereavement. ^ This research contributes to feminist discourses on the politics of motherhood by examining the tensions that exist between individuals and state institutions around contested definitions of motherhood. On a theoretical level, this tension has implications for changing constructions of gender, gender relations, and kinship. <b>Foster</b> <b>mothers</b> construct an identity of 2 ̆ 2 mother, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 child, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 family 2 ̆ 2 based on affective claims of belonging which do not dichotomize 2 ̆ 2 mothering 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 wage labor. 2 ̆ 2 Kinship networks created by women through their experiences contest the patriarchal, nuclear family ideals on which state-sponsored foster care programs in the U. S. rest, in which families must be constituted solely from legal and biological determinants and foster mothers-foster children must necessarily constitute a commodified relationship. ^ On a practical level, this research has implications for the revision of social and child welfare policy. Nationally, the number of children entering the foster care system is rapidly outpacing the number of available foster parents. This places the foster care system in a state of crisis. Effective child welfare reform requires that the experiences of foster parents be well understood. Prior research has excluded <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> from the 2 ̆ 2 official 2 ̆ 2 discourse on fostering; thus <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> 2 ̆ 7 identities and experiences have been constructed for them and not by them. This research provides the experiences and perspectives of women who provide a critical social service and thereby corrects this lapse. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} made to {{separate}} genetic from postnatal maternal influences on yawning in two strains of Sprague-Dawley rats selected for high- (HY) and low-yawning frequency (LY). <b>Foster</b> <b>mothers</b> of the two strains reared litters of pups in the four possible combinations and yawning was recorded in a novel environment when the adult offspring were 75 -day-old. Yawning frequency {{of males and females}} was affected by pup strain but not by the strain of the <b>foster</b> <b>mothers,</b> when litter size was made constant; HY adult offspring yawned more than LY adult offspring. Yawning frequency was higher in HY male offspring than in HY female offspring. An interaction term between pup sex and the strain of the <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> revealed that while males reared by LY mothers yawned more than males reared by HY mothers, females reared by HY mothers yawned more than females reared by LY mothers. Mean frequency of yawning increased with the sex ratio of HY litters.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} part of a {{prospective}} study of all children entering new planned long-term foster placements in Northern Ireland within a seven month period. This {{part of the study}} charted the competencies and behaviour of the children (N= 19) over time in the home and school environments. This paper aims to specifically examine three questions. First, the extent, if any, of cross-informant agreement in ratings between <b>foster</b> <b>mothers,</b> <b>foster</b> fathers and teachers. Secondly, the stability of rated adjustment over time. Finally, the relationship, if any, between rated adjustment early in placement and placement outcome by the two-year point. <b>Foster</b> <b>mothers</b> and <b>foster</b> fathers completed the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist in relation to the foster children, and teachers completed the companion Teacher's Report Form in relation to both the foster children and their classroom peers.

Findings from this small intensive study indicate strong agreement between <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> and <b>foster</b> fathers but not between foster carers and teachers. Stability of rated adjustment over time was found with all informants. There was some evidence that foster carers' ratings of the children's externalizing behaviour at four months predicted placement outcome at two years.

40|$|Foster care {{parents are}} {{key members of}} the foster care system and have an immense {{responsibility}} to provide a new home, and a healthy, clean and nurturing environment for children who have been removed from their own homes. Several studies have been conducted that discuss the risks and protective factors of foster care children, parenting skills and training, as well as retention strategies. However, only a few studies focus on the experience of foster care parents, specifically mothers, and what prompts them {{to take care of this}} defenseless population. A qualitative phenomenological study of 30 <b>foster</b> care <b>mothers</b> served by Episcopal Social Services of New York City was conducted to attempt to understand the unique experience of this group by identifying sources of support, family environment, experiences, satisfaction and cultural socio-environmental factors that have an impact on their role. This research included a first qualitative phenomenological study interviewing fifteen non-kinship <b>foster</b> <b>mothers</b> and a second qualitative phenomenological study interviewing fifteen kinship <b>foster</b> care <b>mothers</b> about their experiences. The interview questions and themes of these two studies are informed by an ecological systems framework. A caregiver stress and coping model, as well as role theory, were applied to understand foster mothers' and their view of their role versus the reality of what they experience, taking into consideration the influence of their non-kinship or kinship status. Among this group of <b>foster</b> care <b>mothers,</b> 20 <b>foster</b> care <b>mothers</b> identified as Latina encompassing the sub sample that was analyzed for the third study.
