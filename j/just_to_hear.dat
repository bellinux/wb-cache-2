500|$|The legal {{threats against}} the song were {{attacked}} heavily by some writers, including Andrew Stafford of The Bulletin. He {{noted that it}} was highly unlikely [...] "Black Tears" [...] would be released as a single, so potential jurors would need to [...] "buy a copy of Dream Days in the ten days between its release and Hurley's trial <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the song". He also noted that Piticco had stated the lyrics {{could just as easily}} refer to a death in Brisbane, not on Palm Island.|$|E
500|$|It surpassed {{anything}} that I ever thought. [...] I didn't {{ever think that}} I {{should be in the}} cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there. [...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] <b>Just</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me. [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] She smiled at me.|$|E

500|$|Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said {{although}} {{he liked the}} pilot episode, he thought jokes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were [...] "pretty thin on the ground", the supporting cast lacked good material and the Leslie character was less likable than the previous week. Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour my notes to remind myself {{of the stuff that}} was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis. He particularly praised Poehler and Ansari, and said of the episode, [...] "Tune in <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her say to her canvassing companion, who complains it's hot and wants to cool off: 'We could blow in each other's faces.'" ...|$|E
500|$|J. Edward Keyes of eMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars and wrote that the [...] "uber-futurist" [...] {{production}} of the release accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "Robo Dominatrix vocal approach—is a big reason the record works so well. Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded is all blue-light electronics and primal throb, 25th-century pop music in the here and now." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine also gave Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded {{four out of five}} stars, but was skeptical about the choice to re-release the album, writing that [...] "it isn't worth forking out for Good Girl Gone Bad twice <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the new songs". Despite that, he praised the newly added songs especially [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again"; he called the song [...] "superior". Levine further wrote, [...] "if Reloaded encourages a few hesitant pop fans to invest in this album, {{the closest thing to a}} Thriller that 2007/8 is likely to produce, this rather cynical reissue should be let off the hook... just." [...] Among other achieved awards and nominations, [...] "Disturbia" [...] and [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] received nominations for Best Dance Recording and Pop Collaboration with Vocals respectively at the 2009 Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Scuzzlebutt, [...] "Volcano" [...] included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified {{only as the}} South Park geologist, {{and it is only}} in the episode [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker said his father is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano—calmly sipping his coffee—is [...] "about how my dad would react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the University of Colorado. The duo said they would go to the restaurant <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 17 Reinhardt married Florine [...] "Bella" [...] Mayer, a {{girl from}} the same gypsy settlement, {{according}} to gypsy custom (although not an official marriage under French law). The following year he recorded for the first time. On these recordings, made in 1928, Reinhardt plays the [...] "banjo" [...] (actually the banjo-guitar) accompanying the accordionists Maurice Alexander, Jean Vaissade and Victor Marceau, and the singer Maurice Chaumel. His name was now drawing international attention, such as from British bandleader Jack Hylton, who came to France <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> him play. He offered him a job on the spot, and Reinhardt accepted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 24 September 2002 on CD and vinyl formats, the latter containing bonus track [...] "Chloroform" [...] after [...] "The Creator Has a Mastertape." [...] A few weeks prior to the album's release, a sampler containing [...] "Blackest Eyes" [...] and shortened versions of [...] "Trains" [...] and [...] "Strip the Soul" [...] was released. The opening track, [...] "Blackest Eyes", was picked up for airplay by major rock radio stations, but the song was not officially released as a single, nor did it chart. The band toured {{in support of the}} album with the band Yes. This is something Wilson would later regret doing, stating that the audiences of the two bands were too different, stating [...] " [...] the problem was {{that most of the people}} who came to see Yes had stopped caring about new music many years before and were really there <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> their favourite Yes oldies." [...] The band would later do a second tour in support of the album with Opeth as well. [...] During this tour, in July and August 2003, the band released the Futile EP, which included songs recorded during the In Absentia recording sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi {{could not}} speak Manchu; he only knew a single word in the language, yili ("arise"). Despite {{studying}} Manchu for years, he admitted {{that it was his}} [...] "worst" [...] subject among everything he studied. According to the journalist S. M. Ali, Puyi spoke Mandarin when interviewed but Ali believed that he could understand English. Johnston also introduced Puyi to the new technology of cinema, and Puyi was so delighted with the movies, especially Harold Lloyd films, that he had a film projector installed in the Forbidden City, despite the opposition of the eunuchs who disliked foreign technology operating in the Forbidden City. Johnston was also the first to argue that Puyi needed glasses, as he was extremely near-sighted, and after much argument with Prince Chun, who thought it was undignified for an Emperor to wear glasses, finally prevailed. Johnston, who spoke fluent Mandarin, closely followed the intellectual scene in China, and introduced Puyi to the [...] "new style" [...] Chinese books and magazines, which so inspired Puyi, that he wrote several poems that were published anonymously in [...] "New China" [...] publications. In 1922, Johnston had his friend, the writer Hu Shih, visit the Forbidden City to teach Puyi about recent developments in Chinese literature. Under Johnston's influence, Puyi embraced the bicycle as a way to exercise, cut his queue and grew a full head of hair, and wanted to go to study at Oxford, which was Johnston's alma mater. Johnston also introduced Puyi to the telephone, which Puyi soon become addicted to, phoning people in Beijing at random <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> their voices on the other end. Johnston also pressured Puyi {{to cut down on the}} waste and extravagance in the Forbidden City, noting that all of these eunuch slaves had to be fed. Johnston convinced Puyi that he could open doors for himself and did not need eunuchs standing by idly all the time by the main doors of the palaces just to open the door for him if he should happen to come along. Puyi cut off his queue so he would look like a Western gentleman and under Johnston's advice embraced the bicycle as the best way to move about in the Forbidden City, retaining a lifelong enthusiasm for cycling, though it is doubtful that the eunuchs working as gardeners much appreciated Puyi's habit of riding through the flowers.|$|E
