2500|$|Huygens {{found the}} {{brightness}} of the surface of Titan (at time of landing) to be about one thousand times dimmer than full solar illumination on Earth (or 500 times brighter than illumination by full moonlight)—that is, the <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> experienced about ten minutes after sunset on Earth, approximately late civil twilight. The color of the sky and the scene on Titan is mainly orange due to the much greater attenuation of blue light by Titan's haze relative to red light. [...] The Sun (which was comparatively high in the sky when Huygens landed) would be visible as a small, bright spot, one tenth the size of the solar disk seen from Earth, and comparable in size and brightness to a car headlight seen from about 150 meters. It casts sharp shadows, but of low contrast as 90% of the illumination comes from the sky.|$|E

5000|$|Eight red LED {{illuminated}} bars (on {{the north}} and south faces of the white glass tower), the lowest representing 990 hPa, rising in 5 hPa increments to the top bar representing 1025 hPa. This provides real time information on barometric pressure changes. Generally low pressure indicates inclement weather and high pressure with good or clear weather (although this is not always the case). As the pressure rises or falls, the LED bars will appear to ripple in an upward or downward direction respectively. The <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> of the LED bars and tower is controlled by a roof mounted photosensor. The LEDs will be brightest {{in the middle of the}} day, and will start to smoothly dim before dusk, and after darkness will reach a low <b>illumination</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

40|$|Since its {{earliest}} {{times in the}} building sector, glass has performed a shutting function, allowing natural light through and a clear outside view. The evolution of production and assembly techniques has transformed glass from a simple transparent element into a system with high technological potential. Designs for dynamic (user-controlled) systems allow transparency level modulation and indoor light quantity transmission control. These provide greater comfort and also offer economic benefits. The first phase of this research has analysed and verified the performance of some translucid systems that are either currently on the market, or in experimental phase. Apart from guaranteeing the primary shutting function, such systems undertake the task of adapting energy fluxes, thus obtaining controllable <b>illumination</b> <b>levels</b> via the use of special filtering modes. In {{the second phase of}} the research the experimentation of a new system was undertaken. A prototype (patent of invention n. VI 2005 A 00294) for controlling <b>illumination</b> <b>levels</b> was created. Essentially, the system aims to control <b>illumination</b> <b>levels</b> through systems that are less complex than those presently available. While considering the growing demand for lassoed surfaces in modern building construction, the new system bypasses certain problems present in commercial systems, such as high cost/benefit relationship and durability...|$|R

50|$|As a {{color of}} low intensity, brown is a {{tertiary}} color: {{a mix of}} the three subtractive primary colors is brown if the cyan content is low. Brown exists as a color perception only {{in the presence of}} a brighter color contrast. Yellow, orange, red, or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> is low, despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in normal lighting conditions.|$|E
50|$|Light meters {{or light}} {{detectors}} {{are also used}} in illumination. Their purpose is to measure the <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> in the interior and to switch off or reduce the output level of luminaires. This can greatly reduce the energy burden of the building by significantly increasing the efficiency of its lighting system. It is therefore recommended to use light meters in lighting systems, especially in rooms where one cannot expect users {{to pay attention to}} manually switching off the lights. Examples include hallways, stairs, and big halls.|$|E

When displayed on a monitor, the exact chromaticities of the reference white point 1,1,1, the reference black point 0,0,0, and the primaries (1,0,0, 0,1,0, and 0,0,1) are specified. To meet the color appearance requirements of the color space, the luminance of the monitor must be 160.00 cd/m2 at the white point, and 0.5557 cd/m2 at the black point, which implies a contrast ratio of 287.9. Moreover, the black point shall have the same chromaticity as the white point, yet with a luminance equal to 0.34731% of the white point luminance.

50|$|The {{documentation}} {{has been}} created with designers and artists in mind. There is a community where experts, intermediate developers and beginners {{from around the world}} share ideas, knowledge and their collective experience. Wiring allows writing software to control devices attached to the electronics board to create all kinds of interactive objects, spaces or physical experiences feeling and responding in the physical world. The idea is to write a few lines of code, connect a few electronic components to the Wiring hardware and observe how a light turns on when person approaches it, write a few more lines, add another sensor, and see how this light changes when the <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> in a room decreases. This process is called sketching with hardware; explore lots of ideas very quickly, select the more interesting ones, refine and produce prototypes in an iterative process.|$|E
50|$|Specification of {{illumination}} requirements is {{the basic}} concept of deciding how much illumination is required for a given task. Clearly, much less light is required to illuminate a hallway compared to that needed for a word processing work station. Generally speaking, the energy expended {{is proportional to the}} design <b>illumination</b> <b>level.</b> For example, a lighting level of 400 lux might be chosen for a work environment involving meeting rooms and conferences, whereas a level of 80 lux could be selected for building hallways. If the hallway standard simply emulates the conference room needs, then much more energy will be consumed than is needed. Unfortunately, most of the lighting standards even today have been specified by industrial groups who manufacture and sell lighting, so that a historical commercial bias exists in designing most building lighting, especially for office and industrial settings.|$|E

50|$|When using CMOS {{or other}} {{integrating}} detectors or sensors that use visible or near infra-red light (400 nm - 700 nm), {{although most of}} the background light coming from artificial lighting or the sun is suppressed, the pixel still has to provide a high dynamic range. The background light also generates electrons, which have to be stored. For example, the illumination units in many of today's TOF cameras can provide an <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> of about 1 watt. The Sun has an illumination power of about 50 watts per square meter after the optical band-pass filter. Therefore, if the illuminated scene has a size of 1 square meter, the light from the sun is 50 times stronger than the modulated signal. For non-integrating TOF sensors that do not integrate light over time and are using near-infrared detectors (InGaAs) to capture the short laser pulse, direct viewing of the sun is a non-issue because the image is not integrated over time, rather captured within a short acquisition cycle typically less than 1 microsecond. Such TOF sensors are used in space applications and in consideration for automotive applications.|$|E

First, we propose to employ moments of the image histogram that are invariant to scaling and translation of image gray levels. Secondly, we propose to compare the parameters of histograms of the wavelet subbands for indexing. These parameters are modified appropriately to counter the effect of changes in illumination. The proposed techniques can be combined to further improve the indexing efficiency. The techniques are computationally inexpensive and can also be easily integrated within a wavelet-based image coder.

40|$|In this paper, a {{constant}} <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> {{control of a}} reading lamp is considered, with the microcontroller PIC, by continuously adjusting the <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> on a desk from the filament lamp. The illumination, from the filament lamp, is transformed into the voltage by the phototransistor on the desk. From the voltage thus transformed, we can know the <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> on the desk indirectly. For the purpose of constant <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> control, the phase control of the AC voltage, {{in terms of the}} triac, is adopted. Since the transformed voltage through the phototransistor is small, the voltage is amplified by the operational amplifier. The amplified voltage is applied to the microcomputer PIC and A/D converted in the PIC with a resolution of 10 bits. The microcontroller program is implemented as follows. If the A/ D converted value is larger than the reference input value, the phase delay of the AC voltage, applied to the filament lamp, is set to increase. Then the brightness of the filament lamp decreases, and vice versa. According to these adjustments of the <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> on the desk, the feedback control of the constant <b>illumination</b> <b>level</b> from the reading lamp, is carried out...|$|E
