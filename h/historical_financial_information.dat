40|$|This study {{discussed}} {{the impact of}} price level changes on financial accounting numbers. Previous studies on the subject have merely reproduced <b>historical</b> <b>financial</b> statements alongside inflation-adjusted financial statements without any scientific methodology and empirical analyses to allow for reliable conclusions. It is this gap that this study seeks to fill. A sample of ten firms was drawn for period between 2003 and 2012.

5000|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission divides {{reporting}} companies, {{those that}} file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 into different categories based on size, among other factors. [...] Smaller companies have less stringent reporting obligations, provide less <b>historical</b> <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> {{are exempt from}} some provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and have more time within which to file their reports. The smallest category of company {{is known as a}} Smaller Reporting Company. A Smaller Reporting Company will qualify as such if, as of the last business day of its second fiscal quarter, they have a public float of less than $75 million. [...] Public float is defined as the shares of their publicly traded common stock that is not held by management and certain large investors. Not all companies that file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are publicly traded, and so if a company cannot calculate its public float, then an alternative way to be a Smaller Reporting Company is to have annual revenue of $50 million or less. Company’s are required to do the analysis each year following their second fiscal quarter and, after a transition period, will then be required to file accordingly.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} board composition and voluntary disclosure in annual reports. In particular, it addresses the incentives within the agency theory framework for both inside and independent directors to disclosure additional information voluntarily. Further, it provides evidence on {{the relation between the}} overall total voluntary disclosure and the components of voluntary disclosure, such as forward looking, strategic, non-financial and historical financial disclosures and board composition. Our sample is based on 181 Australian companies. We have developed and hand-collected 67 items from annual reports to develop the total voluntary disclosure index and the sub-indices of voluntary disclosure. Using two-stage multivariate analyses, our results provide some important insights. First, we find that there is a positive association between board composition and the voluntary disclosure of information in annual reports. Second, we also find that independent boards provide more voluntary disclosure of forward looking information and strategic information. However, board structure has no bearing on the voluntary disclosure of non-financial and <b>historical</b> <b>financial</b> <b>information.</b> Our findings are enhanced by different empirical specifications and sensitivity tests. ...|$|E

40|$|This report details a {{study of}} capital {{structure}} for JSE listed companies. The study considered <b>historical</b> <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> for JSE listed companies over the period 1987 to 2009 and asked two central questions, {{with the benefit of}} hindsight. Firstly, could JSE listed companies have used more debt to finance their operations during this period? Secondly, how much additional debt could these companies have used and thereby increase shareholder value? An optimal debt ratio maximises shareholder value by optimising tax benefits of debt. This study analysed data for 97 companies that were within the top 160 JSE listed companies. For each year of data, debt was increased while maintaining certain pre-selected debt service ratios, to determine how much additional debt these companies could have had. These ratios were interest coverage, cash coverage and DSCR. The results indicate that in most sectors of the JSE companies could have used significantly more debt to finance their operations over the past 22 years. By so doing these companies would have increased shareholder value over the years. CopyrightDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|This {{research}} extends {{our understanding}} of disclosure on the internet by considering a different research setting, namely Jordon. Two main objectives were addressed in this thesis; (1) to explore online status of listed companies {{and the extent to}} which websites are utilized to disclose IR-related information, and (2) to investigate factors influencing companies to have websites and to disclose IR information. The first objective involved a survey analysis in 2007. This showed that out of the 187 companies included in the survey, only 105 had active websites. A web-based scoring sheet was used to assess the level to which websites are utilized as an investor relations tool. Results revealed that websites are generally used to disseminate <b>historical</b> <b>financial</b> <b>information</b> that usually appears in paper based annual reports. The second objective of the study was approached through a mixed method paradigm, which employed quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative analysis showed that only two variables were found significant in predicting online presence; size and sector. On the other hand, the extent of web-based IR disclosure is positively significant with size, governmental ownership, institutional ownership, number of shareholders, and Banks. In addition it was found that this usage is significant and negative with company age. Semi-structured interviews with companies and market regulators were also carried out to investigate motivations and influences of online reporting. Interviewees explained that the decision to have an online presence was motivated by a desire to enhance company’s image and reputation, although the decision itself was often triggered by the decision to enter new, non-Jordanian markets. Moreover, the existence of international activities with other companies as well as merging with other international companies affected the way a company uses its website or how it updates and restructures the website’s components. In addition, management’s flexibility in facilitating the process of adopting new technologies was also pointed out by some interviewees as a factor affecting the level to which a company uses its website in general as well as for its IR activities in particular.

The increased revenues and profits have come primarily from profitable joint ventures, especially from a very high volume of petroleum sales to non-member patrons. The most critical relationship is member patron-owner relationship with CHS Inc., a large regional cooperative that owns two oil refineries and is the primary supplier of petroleum products to GCC. The profits being made by CHS Inc. 's fuel refineries are distributed to GCC as patronage refunds based on the volume of refined fuels purchased from them. This much larger stream of patronage refunds from CHS and other regional co-op's being distributed to GCC is causing GCC to pause and evaluate how best to move forward. The GCC has the challenge of what to do with increased earnings. Does the GCC return earnings back to its member-owners retain earnings for future investment opportunities, or do they commit them to help finance current investment opportunities? Does GCC grow its most profitable business lines, such as nonmember-nonpatron petroleum sales?

40|$|Financial {{reporting}} and audit activities are the areas {{to ensure the}} legitimacy of the everyday economic activities of the accounting entities. Financial reporting provides information on the past periods of the accounting entities; the audit activity is used to verify the accuracy of the recorded information and an assessment is given to the financial position of the audited entities. Auditing of financial statements prepared on the basis of <b>historical</b> <b>financial</b> <b>information,</b> results in increased reliability of the economic environment and stability of the financial environment of the state. The objective of this research was to assess the suitability of the European Union reporting principles for the auditing activity in Estonia. This objective was achieved with the following research tasks: 1) to provide an overview of the legal framework of the EU financial {{reporting and}} auditing activities; 2) to assess the problems related to the transposition of the legal framework in Estonia. The article consists of two parts, the first part provides an overview of the regulation of financial reporting and auditing activities in the European Union. The second part assess the impact of the European Union legislation on financial reporting and audit activities for the activities of the corresponding areas in Estonia. The research method used was a combined method, in the course of which legal acts were collected and analyzed, analysis of the data obtained from the commercial register was carried out and the impact of the Directive 2013 / 34 / EC to the accounting area of Estonia was assessed. Upon application of the Directive 2013 / 34 /EU to the Estonia's legal framework, one cannot be sure that the desired administrative burden is reduced, rather it could bring along growth of the administrative burden for the accounting entities, which comprises the obligation of submission of additional reporting to various authorities. The reporting process could become more time-consuming. The decline in reporting volume could present a risk to the transparency and sustainability of the economic environment. Rather than reducing administrative burdens that are the goal of Directive 2013 / 34 /EU, in Estonia the effect is just the opposite. The implementation of the Directive will result in an increase of the administrative burden and the obligation of duplication of reporting, which in turn can lead to a lack of transparency in the economic environment. The accounting entities will fail to submit the financial reports to the register on a timely manner, which in turn puts into question the information contained in the reports. Establishment of the audit limits would result in a reduction in the auditing obligation, an estimated 97 - 99 % of entrepreneurs will remain unaudited...|$|E
