5|$|The sea {{appears in}} human culture in {{contradictory}} ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>its</b> place in mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music.

It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Scylla in Greek mythology, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. The sea is especially common in Christian imagery, where several of Jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the Sea of Galilee.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain who the {{causeway}} is named after, but the figure was at the latest pre-Renaissance, {{and the majority of}} sources agree that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>its</b> origins in the medieval period or earlier. The name Wade appears {{as one of the most}} common surnames in a 1381 poll tax register from Suffolk, and philologist P H Reaney reports multiple instances of it from the 11th and 12th centuries. The names Wade or Wada were common in pre-medieval English history and historian William Searle records around a dozen historic Wades in his Onomasticon of early Anglo-Saxon names. The earliest figure from the region identified as Wade in extant writings is Duke Wada, a historical personage of Saxon descent who is recorded in 1083 as having been a prominent figure living in the Yorkshire area around 798. It is possible that this person was either named after—or has been conflated over time with—one of several earlier, mythological figures known as Wade. Chadwick states that it is most probable that the causeway is named directly after a well-known mythological, rather than historical, Wada.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{stand at}} Turf Moor is the James Hargreaves Stand, which was opened in 1996 {{as part of}} a ground {{redevelopment}} project which saw two new stands built to replace the Longside and the Bee Hole End at a total cost of £5.3 million. When built it was named the North Stand, although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>its</b> current name thanks to a six-figure sponsorship deal. The stand can accommodate 8,512 (+192 Corporate seats) spectators and was opened on 23 April 1996, replacing the Longside terrace. It runs parallel to the length of the pitch. The television gantry is located in the James Hargreaves Stand along with the media area, which is situated {{at the rear of the}} upper tier. The stand is the traditional seating area of the Suicide Squad, who had previously stood in the Longside until the terrace was demolished in 1995. In the space between the upper and lower tiers of the James Hargreaves Stand there is a corporate area, which apart from being used for matchday hospitality is used for functions and events. Both the suite and the home dressing room, is licensed to hold civil marriage services.|$|E

5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>its</b> own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
