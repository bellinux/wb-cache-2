Many of the top-level competitions are held at temporary ranges installed in versatile sporting facilities or convention centres.|$|E
5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E

5|$|Halos arsenal {{consists}} of weapons from science fiction. The game has been praised for <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> weapon a unique purpose, thus making each useful in different scenarios. For example, plasma weapons {{need time to}} cool if fired too rapidly, but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries, whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat, but require reloading and ammunition. In contrast to the large weapon inventories of contemporary FPS games, Halo players may carry only two weapons at once, calling for strategy when managing firearms.|$|E
5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are {{assigned}} to processors and are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. One advantage to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors' on-board caches in Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems do not contain duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> processor in the system {{the ability to use}} its own cache to store different things to work on.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and Myst V: End of Ages was {{composed}} by Tim Larkin, {{who had gotten}} involved in the series doing sound design for Riven. Larkin stepped away from his background as a jazz composer and musician to create music with less structure and without a definite beginning and end. Larkin created different music depending on the location, <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> setting and Age a distinctive tone. For End of Ages, Larkin was unable to afford a full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation {{with an array of}} synthesizers.|$|E

5|$|The PC {{version of}} Metal Gear Solid was {{released}} in North America, Europe and Asia in late 2000. This version was published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Digital Dialect. It supports {{the use of a}} keyboard or a USB game controller with at least six buttons (with the manual recommending the Sidewinder Game Pad Pro). It also supports Direct3D-capable video cards, allowing for a high resolution of up to 1024x768. The PC version is simply labelled Metal Gear Solid on the packaging, but the actual game uses the Metal Gear Solid: Integral logo, although it has some differences as well from the PlayStation version of Integral and lacks some of its content. The biggest change was reducing the number of discs from three to two, which was done by <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> disc two separate executable files, one for the main game (mgsi.exe) and the other for the VR training portion (mgsvr.exe), thus eliminating the need for a stand-alone third disc.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{previous}} games, magical abilities are learned with {{the acquisition of}} a new weapon, <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired: the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and the Boots of Hermes. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios {{can be used as a}} lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.|$|E

5|$|Unlike westernized instrumentation, {{there is}} no set tuning for kulintang sets {{throughout}} the Philippines. Great variation exist between each set {{due to differences in}} make, size and shape, alloy used <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> kulintang set a unique pitch level, intervals and timbre. Though the tuning varies greatly, there does exist some uniformity to contour when same melody heard on different kulintang sets. This common counter results in similar interval relationships of more or less equidistant steps between each of the gongs. This tuning system, not based upon equal temperament or upon a system of standard pitches but on a similar/certain pattern of large and small intervals, could also be found among the gamelan orchestras of western Indonesia. In fact, though the Maguindanao, Maranao and Tausug artists technically have no concept of scale (because emphasis placed on the concept of “rhythmic modes”), the Pelog and Slendro scales of Java were found to be most satisfactory to their own varying pentatonic/heptatonic scales.|$|E
5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the Holy War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the previous}} game, Dragon Quest. The game {{is the first in}} the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).|$|E

5|$|In 1800, the Quasi-War {{between the}} United States and France {{was in full}} force. In order to prevent French attacks against American merchantmen in the Caribbean, the United States Navy {{maintained}} four squadrons of vessels in the region. One such squadron was commanded by Commodore Thomas Truxton, and tasked with patrolling the Lesser Antilles. Taking command on 19 January 1800 after arriving at Saint Kitts in his flagship USS Constellation, Truxton's squadron consisted of four frigates, three schooners, and a ship-rigged man of war. Besides the numerous privateers operating in the area, the only French naval forces in Truxton's area of operations were the frigate La Vengeance under François Marie Pitot and the corvette La Berceau under Louis Senes. Both vessels had arrived at Guadeloupe on 10 December 1799 escorting the new administrators of the French colony. Once at Saint Kitts Truxton dispersed his squadron, <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> ship orders to cruise independently. He then set sail for Guadeloupe on 30 January 1800 with his flagship Constellation, intending to challenge the French frigate and corvette there. The same day, Pitot in La Vengeance left Guadaloupe's capital of Basse-Terre for France.|$|E
5|$|The company {{operates}} both regional {{trains to}} Gjøvik, {{as well as}} line 300, the Oslo Commuter Rail, to Hakadal or Jaren. Most north-bound trains originate at Oslo Central Station (OsloS), but some rush-hour services start at Skøyen, and operate through the Oslo Tunnel to OsloS, to serve large working districts of Oslo. NSB Gjøvikbanen has a train leave and depart OsloS every 40minutes; however, the trains have three different stopping patterns and termini, <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> of the three services a two-hour headway. Two services are commuter trains, and stop at all stations. The one operates until Hakadal, while the other operates until Jaren. In addition, there is a regional services that operates to Gjøvik. The regional service only calls at the major stations until Grua, but serves all stations after that. Travel time from OsloS to Hakadal is 40 minutes, to Jaren it is 1 hour 22 minutes, while it is 1 hour 55 minutes to Gjøvik. The Gjøvik Line accounts for six percent of passenger transport on the national rail network.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E

5|$|Creative Assembly's studio director, Tim Heaton, {{explained}} that Halo Wars 2 would not feature gameplay {{similar to their}} Total War series. Instead they wanted to build upon the foundation established with Halo Wars. With Halo Wars 2, the development team hoped to introduce new players to the strategy game genre while appeasing experienced players by including a range of multiplayer modes that {{a wide spectrum of}} players could enjoy. They also wanted to extend the purpose of leader units and their abilities by <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> of them a more defining role in the style of play they represent. Creative Assembly thought that the game needed more units capable of performing long range attacks. They wanted to add more artillery pieces, however they found that there were currently no suitable vehicles in the Halo universe. To remedy this, they created two new vehicles, the Kodiak and the Blisterback, to fit the role. They used reference material supplied by 343 Industries to ensure the new vehicles did not feel out of place. Halo Wars 2s creative director, Alistair Hope, noted that staying true to the source material was important aspect for all of Creative Assembly's games, but stated that the team were given more freedom to explore and expand the Halo universe than they had anticipated. Hope praised the control scheme used in Halo Wars and aimed to enhance the system by ensuring that Halo Wars 2 would be intuitive to play on a console. One common control feature included in many PC RTS games but absent from the original Halo Wars is control groups, which enables sets of units to be manually assigned to a key. As Halo Wars 2 was developed for console and PC, the designers were keen to include the feature for both versions of the game. 343 Industries had initially considered supporting cross-platform play between Windows and Xbox One devices, but the feature was ultimately excluded from the game at launch.|$|E
5|$|John {{was born}} to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166. Henry had {{inherited}} significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard—Anjou, Normandy and England—and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, {{in addition to being}} the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers. The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear {{what would happen to the}} empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, <b>giving</b> <b>each</b> son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to work together as allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.|$|E
