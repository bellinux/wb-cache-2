[EN] This poster try to explore {{the essence of the}} megalithic phenomenon through one of its most significant elements: the construction of burial mounds. This is a complex phenomenon, with a great variability. A detailed analysis of some monuments allows us to note that we are facing a cultural expression that corresponds to a formal pattern repeated throughout all its existence. The argument is shown through a mound from the NW of Iberian Peninsula. The use of a stratigraphical methodology lets us to identify the Constructive processes and the chronological dating of its different phases, which finally allows to study the variability and regularity of the broader phenomenon.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>Archaeologists</b> (EAA) is a membership-based, not-for-profit association, open to {{archaeologists and}} other related or {{interested}} individuals or bodies in Europe and beyond. It was founded in 1994 at an Inaugural Meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia, where its Statutes were formally approved, and recognized by the Council of Europe in 1999. EAA has had over 11,000 members on its database from 60 countries worldwide, working in prehistory, classical, medieval, and historic archaeology. EAA holds an annual conference and publishes the flagship journal of European archaeology, the European Journal of Archaeology. The EAA also publishes an in-house newsletter, The European Archaeologist (TEA). The registered office of the Association is in Prague, Czech Republic.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to other archaeological associations {{such as the}} <b>European</b> <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>Archaeologists</b> (EAA), the EAC does not represent a community of individual archaeologists but rather the national statutory authorities with responsibility {{for the management of}} archaeological heritage. Moreover, the EAC focuses primarily on issues of heritage management. At the Council of Europe, the EAC has held the status of an NGO observer member in the Steering Committee on Culture, Heritage and Landscape (CDCPP) since its establishment in 2012 and held the equivalent status with that committee's predecessors, first with the Steering Committee for Cultural Heritage (CDPAT) [...] and then (from 2007) with the Steering Committee for Cultural Heritage and Landscape (CDPATEP).|$|E
50|$|The {{forerunner of}} the EAC {{was an expert}} {{committee}} charged by the Council of Europe with developing the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (1992). After the convention was ratified, the committee continued its work, e. g. in the Council of Europe's Bronze Age Campaign and in regular meetings at the {{annual conference of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>Archaeologists.</b> The personal network resulting from these years of international cooperation led to the foundation of an association to support further projects such as the European Landscape Convention (or Florence Convention). The inaugural meeting of the EAC took place at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 25 November 1999. The first statutes were published on 24 August 2000 as an annex to the Belgian Official Journal. Since then the statutes have changed several times. The latest changes were adopted at the General Assembly in Paris in 2012 and were published as an annex to the Belgian Official Journal on 13 March 2013. The organization was based first in Brussels but moved to Namur in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Allchins {{were also}} pivotal in {{promoting}} and facilitating {{the study of}} South Asian archaeology in Europe as well as within the Subcontinent. In the 1970s, aware of the fragmented nature of South Asian scholarship across Europe and seeking to broaden the capacity {{that was at the}} time possible and available within Britain, the Allchins, together with colleagues from Europe, created a biannual platform for South Asian archaeologists, numismatists, epigraphers and historians of art and architecture to exchange information from current research. Forming the <b>European</b> <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> South Asian <b>Archaeologists,</b> the Allchins organised the first meeting, which was held at Churchill College in Cambridge in 1971. In reaction to the lack of institutions, teaching posts or funds devoted to the promotion of popular or scholarly interest in South and Central Asia, the Allchins, along with Professor Sir Harold Bailey, Professor Johanna van Lohuizen de Leeuw and Dr Jan van Lohuizen, founded the Ancient and Indian Iran Trust in Cambridge in 1978. The Trust aimed to support and provide a focal point where scholars and members of the public with interests in the cultures of these geographic regions could meet and use its unique library, substantially composed of the collections of its founders. The Trust also organised funds to facilitate Indian and Pakistani visiting fellowships, which included highly distinguished scholars including Dilip Chakrabari, Ravi Korisettar, K. Krishnan, V. N. Misra, Lolita Nehru, K. Paddaya, Gautam Sengupta and Vasant Shinde.|$|R

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>Archaeologists</b> 2015. This paper {{considers}} the early copper and copper-alloy metallurgy {{of the entire}} Alpine region. It introduces {{a new approach to}} the interpretation of chemical composition data sets, which has been applied to a comprehensive regional database for the first time. The Alpine Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age each have distinctive patterns of metal use, which can be interpreted through changes in mining, social choice, and major landscape features such as watersheds and river systems. Interestingly, the Alpine range does not act as a north-south barrier, as major differences in composition tend to appear on an east-west axis. Central among these is the prevalence of tin-bronze in the western Alps compared to the east. This 'tin-line' is discussed in terms of metal flow through the region and evidence for a deeply rooted geographical division that runs through much of Alpine prehistory...|$|E
40|$|This short paper {{serves as}} an {{introduction}} to a special issue of JASRep that brings together some of the papers from a session at the <b>European</b> <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>Archaeologists</b> annual conference held in Istanbul in 2014. The aim of that session, and these papers was to discuss recent developments in Mediterranean palaeoenvironmental research, but more specifically, how this research is integrated with archaeological evidence. The papers in this special issue deal with {{the full range of}} Mediterranean landscape-types and time-periods, encompassing early prehistory to the Medieval period; some engage with broad-scale climatic processes, while others deal with individual landscape or site-based assessments of human-environment interactions. They illustrate how, in very different ways, we can try to integrate environmental and archaeological data to understand the reciprocal links between cultural and environmental change. This introduction thus serves to situate these papers into a methodological and theoretical framework...|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} of papers aims {{to address some}} of the issues outlined in session I. 6 of the 4 th Annual Meeting of the <b>European</b> <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>Archaeologists</b> (EAA) held in Göteborg, Sweden 1998. The session attempted to highlight the need for archaeology to embrace those elements of computing that were, and still are, developing rapidly as a major part of our language and mode of communication. The employment of emerging technologies has major implications toward the direction and form of our discourse and research, but it is perhaps the organic nature of the changing face of archaeological communication that urges us to investigate this phenomenon a little more critically (see Bateman). Huggett and Chen build upon this theme using as a case study the on-going work at Symon's Castle in the Welsh borders, and suggest a more flexible approach to the modelling process. Cummings addresses other aspects by integrating computer visualisation with methodology in the field...|$|E

[...] et al. The {{link between}} {{pathways}} and barrows {{has been a}} common mechanism to elucidate the structure of megalithic landscapes in Iberia. Since the 1970 `s, barrows were presented as the landmarks that ruled the displacement of prehistoric people in their nomadic lifestyle as drovers. Nowadays, the nexus between pathways and barrows {{is far from being}} explained, and the analysis of Iberian megalithic landscapes has evolved to a more thoughtful stage where GIS has become the ideal platform to test such hypothesis. Moreover, the relationship between the pathways and other properties from landscape, as perceptual questions might be, has been reconsidered. In this case, we present our recent works in two main areas from Spain: the Sedano (Burgos province) and Alconétar (Cáceres province) areas, where different approaches for linking displacement with the patterns of location of barrow have been tested. We will also discuss the importance of using different algorithms and analytical categories to enlighten what can be determined as mobility and how to make it quantifiable. We relay also in ethnographic sources to test models against the evidence. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
