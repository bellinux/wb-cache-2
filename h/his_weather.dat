25|$|Shorter's 2003 album Alegría (his first studio album for 10 years, since High Life) {{received}} the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Album; it features the quartet {{with a host}} of other musicians, including pianist Brad Mehldau, drummer Carrington and former Weather Report percussionist Alex Acuña. Shorter's compositions, some new, some reworked from his Davis period, feature the complex Latin rhythms that he specialised in during <b>his</b> <b>Weather</b> Report days.|$|E
25|$|There {{is usually}} a hum of {{expectancy}} when Holmes and Sutcliffe appear, their faces wreathed in smiles, and chatting happily together. They seem to be sharing some all-absorbing joke. Holmes, proudly wearing his Yorkshire cap, walks with quick, short steps, shoulders erect and head in the air, {{doing his best to}} look as tall as (John) Tunnicliffe. Sutcliffe has dark, glossy hair and usually disdains the valued White Rose cap when batting. He strolls casually along by the side of Percy, keeping <b>his</b> <b>weather</b> eye open for the wicket-keeper's end and the honour of taking the first ball.|$|E
25|$|Edward Lorenz was {{an early}} pioneer of the theory. His {{interest}} in chaos came about accidentally through his work on weather prediction in 1961. Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to run <b>his</b> <b>weather</b> simulation. He {{wanted to see a}} sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions {{in the middle of the}} original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome. Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.|$|E

25|$|Thor is {{a superb}} hand-to-hand combatant, and is skilled in armed combat, excelling {{in the use}} of the war hammer, sword, axe and mace. Thor {{possesses}} two items which assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his signature weapon, the mystical hammer Mjolnir. The first item doubles Thor's strength and endurance while the second is used to control <b>his</b> <b>weather</b> abilities; flight; energy projection and absorption; dimensional travel; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast (which taps into Thor's life force, and has even forced Galactus to flee), the Thermo-blast, and the Anti-Force (which counteracts another force). Using Mjolnir by throwing it in the desired direction and then holding on to the handle's leather loop, Thor can fly at supersonic speeds in Earth's atmosphere and travel faster than light in space. He can also use the hammer to create a barrier by letting it spin in a circle, and even managed to contain an explosion powerful enough to destroy a 1/5th of the universe, although at the cost of his own life. He can throw an object out of Earth's atmosphere by using his strength, and throw his hammer to Asgard from which it will return.|$|E
500|$|September 2009: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Jimena moved over Arizona on September 5. Near Walapai, water, rock, and other debris covered many roads. In addition, several power lines were {{down at the}} Bullhead City Airport. Golf ball-sized hail ( [...] in diameter) fell northwest of Golden Valley; a weather spotter's house received $5,000 in damage, {{with all of its}} windows broken and with damage to <b>his</b> <b>weather</b> station and radio equipment. In Riviera, southwest of Bullhead City, seven mobile home trails were blown with many other receiving some damage due to [...] wind gusts. In the same area, four people were hurt and total damage was $500,000. North of Mohave Valley, mudslides caused two homes to be destroyed, with 9 others receiving moderate damage, and 16 other receiving minimal damage. Total damage was estimated to be at $600,000. In Laveen, [...] of precipitation fell in a 90-minute period. Heavy rain was recorded in Sedona, thus blocking traffic on State Route 179. in Prescott, street flooding was reported, closing State Route 69 and the Emerald Trail. In Quartzsite, washes overflowed their banks, causing street flooding, and $30,000 in damage. In Tanca, [...] of precipitation fell within a 30-minute period, thus causing minor flooding with one road being washed out. Damage from that flood totaled $30,000. Yuma also reported [...] of rain from the cyclone. On the afternoon of September 5, a haystack caught fire due to lighting, and was eventually responsible for an additional $20,000 in damage.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{itself was}} coined by Edward Lorenz, and {{is derived from}} the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (exact time of formation, exact path taken) being {{influenced}} by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of <b>his</b> <b>weather</b> model with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate over whether a [...] "metereological machine", invented by Premonstratensian priest Prokop Diviš and erected in Přímětice near Znojmo, Moravia (now Czech Republic) in June 1754, does count as an {{individual}} invention of the lightning rod. Diviš's apparatus was, according to his private theories, aimed towards preventing thunderstorms altogether by constantly depriving the air of its superfluous electricity. The apparatus was, however, mounted on a free-standing pole and probably better grounded than Franklin's lightning rods at that time, so it served {{the purpose of a}} lightning rod. After local protests, Diviš had to cease <b>his</b> <b>weather</b> experiments around 1760.|$|E
