50|$|The State of Victoria {{contains}} approximately 25% of the world's known {{reserves of}} brown coal (lignite). This coal is also amongst the world's 'wettest' coal, with a typical moisture content of 60 per cent water by weight. High moisture content makes Victorian brown coal an inefficient fuel source {{and is the}} primary reason why the Hazelwood power station in the Latrobe Valley {{is regarded as the}} world's dirtiest coal-fired power station. The Coldry Process uses low-pressure mechanical shear to create a natural exothermic reaction within the coal that then naturally expels 80 per cent of the moisture content. <b>Expelled</b> <b>moisture</b> is then captured and recovered as distilled water. Victorian brown coal transformed by the Coldry Process has a raised thermal content of 5874 kcal/kg, which is comparable to most export-grade Australian black coal.|$|E
25|$|Water in wood {{normally}} {{moves from}} zones of higher to zones of lower moisture content (Walker et al., 1993). Drying starts from {{the exterior of}} the wood and moves towards the centre, and drying at the outside is also necessary to <b>expel</b> <b>moisture</b> from the inner zones of the wood. Wood subsequently attains equilibrium with the surrounding air in moisture content.|$|R
50|$|In cooking, {{syneresis}} is {{the sudden}} release of moisture contained within protein molecules, usually caused by excessive heat, which over-hardens the protein shell. Moisture inside expands upon heating. The hard protein shell pops, <b>expelling</b> the <b>moisture.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Ash content may be {{determined}} as air dried basis and on oven dried basis. The main difference [...] {{between the two}} is that the latter is determined after <b>expelling</b> the <b>moisture</b> content in the sample of coal.|$|R
30|$|The second {{influence}} of the HTP on the Asian monsoon is the rain shadow effect of the Himalaya. Because vigorous advection occurs above the TP, strong seasonal airflow occurs from the Indian Ocean toward the TP. This flow crosses the 7000  m high Himalayan mountain chain, which acts as a geomorphological barrier to air advection. Warm and moist air flowing from the Indian Ocean toward the advection center on the TP has to ascend the frontal slopes of the Himalaya and is cooled adiabatically, <b>expelling</b> <b>moisture</b> as precipitation. This process causes high precipitation along the frontal slopes of the Himalaya, releases heat, and enhances the uplift of dry air masses, thereby further strengthening advection.|$|R
2500|$|A mild {{maritime}} climate prevails throughout the range with temperature and precipitation varying due to elevation and {{distance from the}} coastline. Characteristic of the climate include cool dry summers followed by mild and wet winters. The majority of precipitation accumulates {{in the form of}} rain, with snow during the winter months at the higher elevations, but no permanent snow pack. Annual precipitation differs from [...] in some parts to up to , with the higher amounts coming in the higher elevations. The average high temperature in January is 36.3°F (2.4°C), and the average high in July is 61.9°F (16.6°C) with temperatures also varying by elevation. The further inland and the more southerly portions have a more Mediterranean climate that is more similar to the climate of the Willamette Valley. The Coast Range creates a rain shadow effect by forcing moisture laden clouds to rise by <b>expelling</b> <b>moisture.</b> This shields the Willamette Valley and causes a more even climate with mild winters and less precipitation than the Oregon Coast.|$|R
2500|$|The blast {{furnaces}} at Cornwall Furnace needed {{a tremendous amount}} of charcoal in order to keep them fired and thereby create a steady production of iron. The making of the charcoal became an industry in itself. Hardwood trees were chopped down, dried, stacked and fired in [...] pits. A collier carefully stacked the wood around a chimney. The stack of wood was covered with leaves and dirt and was set on fire in the center. The fires were allowed to smolder for ten to fourteen days, under the careful, round the clock, supervision of the collier. The colliers were careful to make sure that enough heat was produced to <b>expel</b> <b>moisture,</b> tar and other substances from the wood without burning the wood up entirely. Wood was not charred until just before it was needed to keep it from getting wet and becoming useless. The demand for charcoal was so tremendous that Cornwall Furnace used an entire acre of wood every day for making charcoal.|$|R

40|$|In situ {{infrared}} (IR) spectroscopy and visible-light (VIS) spectroscopic ellipsometry {{over the}} spectral range from 700 to 2000 cm- 1 and 1. 5 – 3. 5 eV, respectively, {{were used to}} investigate the optical behavior of boron nitride (BN) thin films at temperatures from room temperature (RT) to 600 °C. The polycrystalline hexagonal (h) and mixed-phase h- and cubic (c) -BN thin films were deposited by magnetron sputtering on [001] silicon. We observe a reversible moisture incorporation process in as-grown h-BN samples. When stored in normal ambient, the h-BN thin films absorb water into thin-film micropores. When annealed in ultrahigh vacuum or a dry nitrogen atmosphere, the samples <b>expel</b> <b>moisture</b> but retain their microstructure. This is observable by reduction of the thin-film refractive indices in accordance with changes in the IR lattice resonance behavior. The optical properties of high c-BN content thin films remain unchanged during annealing. And both intrinsic h- and c-BN thin-film VIS refractive indices are nearly temperature independent, at least up to 600 °C. Therefore, RT BN optical constants {{can be used for}} feedback loop control in in situ thin-film growth at temperatures up to 600 °C...|$|R
50|$|Every {{ten minutes}} when the loaves must be turned over, they are stacked. This step uses {{the weight of}} the loaves upon each other to help <b>expel</b> {{additional}} <b>moisture.</b> The first time this occurs, two loaves are stacked together. The next time, the loaves are turned, and two stacks of two are put together. When the stacks get large enough (in general, 4 high), stacking stops but the loaves are still turned every ten minutes. This process is complete when the acidity of the whey is between 5.1 and 5.3, so it is checked constantly.|$|R
50|$|Ash {{content of}} coal is the {{non-combustible}} residue left after coal is burnt. It represents the bulk mineral matter after carbon, oxygen, sulfur and water (including from clays) {{has been driven}} off during combustion. Analysis is fairly straightforward, with the coal thoroughly burnt and the ash material expressed {{as a percentage of}} the original weight. It can also give an indication about the quality of coal.Ash content may be determined as air dried basis and on oven dried basis. The main difference between the two is that the latter is determined after <b>expelling</b> the <b>moisture</b> content in the sample of coal.|$|R
5000|$|A {{desiccant}} {{wheel is}} very similar to a thermal wheel, but with a coating applied {{for the sole purpose of}} dehumidifying, or [...] "drying", the air stream. The desiccant is normally silica gel. As the wheel turns, the desiccant passes alternately through the incoming air, where the moisture is adsorbed, and through a “regenerating” zone, where the desiccant is dried and the <b>moisture</b> <b>expelled.</b> The wheel continues to rotate, and the adsorbent process is repeated. Regeneration is normally carried out by the use of a heating coil, such as a water or steam coil, or a direct-fired gas burner.|$|R
5000|$|By definition, stomatat {{conductance}} or stomatal conductance, usually {{measured in}} mmol m⁻² s⁻¹, {{is the measure}} of the rate of passage of carbon dioxide (CO2) entering, or water vapor exiting through the stomata of a leaf. Stomata are small pores on {{the top and bottom of}} a leaf that are responsible for taking in and <b>expelling</b> CO2 and <b>moisture</b> from and to the outside air. The rate of stomatal conductance, or its inverse, stomatal resistance, is directly related to the boundary layer resistance of the leaf and the absolute concentration gradient of water vapor from the leaf to the atmosphere. It is under direct biological control of the leaf through the use of guard cells, which surround the stomatal pore [...] (Taiz/Zeiger 1991). The turgor pressure and osmotic potential of guard cells is directly related to the stomatal conductance.Stomatal conductance is a function of stomatal density, stomatal aperture, and stomatal size.Stomatal conductance is integral to leaf level calculations of transpiration (E). Multiple studies have shown a direct correlation between the use of herbicides and changes in physiological and biochemical growth processes in plants, particularly non-target plants, resulting in a reduction in stomatal conductance and turgor pressure in leaves.|$|R
40|$|The {{rate and}} extent of {{syneresis}} (whey expulsion) strongly affects cheese composition and quality. During salting, curd syneresis {{is influenced by the}} combined effect of both osmotic pressure and protein hydration. Our objective is to examine how cheese composition and whey expulsion are influenced by dry salting curd at various intervals, levels, applications, and potassium chloride (KCl) substitution, or change in calcium or sodium level in test solution (i. e., whey-brine). Four sets of unsalted fresh Cheddar curds were salted with different methods, with at least 3 replicates of each set on separate days. Set A was salted with 30 g/kg NaCl over 3 applications, either 5 or 10 min apart. Set B was salted with 30, 25, and 20 g/kg NaCl over 3 applications 5 min apart. Set C was salted with 20 g/kg NaCl using 1, 2, or 3 applications. Set D received salt consisting of a 2 : 1 molar ratio of NaCl and KCl over 3 applications 5 min apart. Whey was collected every 5 or 10 min until 30 or 40 min after the start of salting and subsequently pressed for 3 h. Using 10 -min intervals delayed whey syneresis but after pressing there was no significant influence on final cheese composition. Decreasing salt levels significantly reduced the amount of whey expelled prior to pressing and resulted in cheeses with higher moisture and slightly lower pH. Adding salt over different applications did not significantly affect cheese composition. Partial substitution with KCl did not affect the amount of whey <b>expelled</b> or cheese <b>moisture</b> composition. Salted milled Cheddar cheese curd was immersed at 22 °C for 6 or 18 h in test solution, with the addition of 1, 5, 10, or 20 g/L calcium, and 15 g/L salt. After immersion, curd weight change, moisture, pH, sodium, serum calcium and total calcium levels were measured. When calcium levels in solution increased, curd moisture, pH, and weight gain decreased while serum and total calcium levels increased significantly. Similarly, unsalted milled Cheddar cheese curds were immersed at 22 °C for 6 h in test solution with 30, 60, 90, or 120 g/L salt in addition to 6 g/L calcium. The salt level in solution was inversely proportional with weight change, moisture, and salt level of curd...|$|R
