After failing to convince Principal Skinner to give him the oil, Mr. Burns establishes a slant <b>drilling</b> <b>operation</b> and beats the school to tapping the oil well.

5|$|After an oil <b>drilling</b> <b>operation</b> in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, {{produced}} a gas geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took {{them back to the}} University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E

The Silurians cause holes {{to open in the}} earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E

25|$|Robert LeMeur was {{designed}} to support seasonal exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort sea. Her typical annual operational profile would begin in May with a warm-up that would gradually bring the vessel systems online after five months of cold lay-up. After commencing break-out, the Canmar icebreakers would first carry out one or more resupply missions to the drilling islands where exploratory activities have continued through the winter. In June, the icebreakers {{would return to the}} winter base to escort the drillships to predetermined drilling locations. Once the spread-mooring system had been deployed and drilling commenced, the icebreakers would remain on site to carry out ice management by breaking up large floes that could threaten the <b>drilling</b> <b>operation.</b> Once all ice had melted, Robert LeMeur would continue with supply missions to different Beaufort Sea drilling operations.|$|E

25|$|Solid {{modeling}} {{systems for}} {{computer aided design}} {{offer a variety of}} methods for building objects from other objects, combination by Boolean operations being one of them. In this method the space in which objects exist is understood as a set S of voxels (the three-dimensional analogue of pixels in two-dimensional graphics) and shapes are defined as subsets of S, allowing objects to be combined as sets via union, intersection, etc. One obvious use is in building a complex shape from simple shapes simply as the union of the latter. Another use is in sculpting understood as removal of material: any grinding, milling, routing, or <b>drilling</b> <b>operation</b> that can be performed with physical machinery on physical materials can be simulated on the computer with the Boolean operation x∧¬y or x−y, which in set theory is set difference, remove the elements of y from those of x. Thus given two shapes one to be machined and the other the material to be removed, the result of machining the former to remove the latter is described simply as their set difference.|$|E

On 3 May, while Nordica was passing the Swedish island of Öland in the Baltic Sea, six Greenpeace activists boarded the icebreaker, forcing the vessel to stop at Karlskrona where the protesters were arrested by the Swedish police and coast guard. Finally, in the following night 14 activists forced Nordica to carry out evasive manoeuvres in the sea region between Denmark and Germany by stopping boats {{in the middle of}} the shipping lane in front of the icebreaker and even swimming in the sea.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, Amy and Rory land in {{the small}} Welsh village of Cwmtaff in 2020 instead of their {{intended}} destination, Rio de Janeiro.

Nasreen is assisted by a local, Tony Mack, whose daughter and grandson, Ambrose and Elliot, are investigating the disappearance of bodies at the nearby church graveyard. An earth tremor causes the ground to open and sends Tony and Amy falling into it; Tony is rescued but Amy is pulled under by unknown forces.

500|$|Finally, on 10 August 1910, {{the first}} oil <b>drilling</b> <b>operation</b> was started. A 30-metre-high rig (nicknamed the [...] "Grand Old Lady") {{made up of}} wooden {{derricks}} and cable tool drilling {{was used in the}} operation by Royal Dutch Shell. On 22 December 1910, oil was struck after 130 metres of drilling at the well. Royal Dutch Shell also founded a subsidiary company named Sarawak Oil Field Ltd, which now operated as Sarawak Shell Berhad. Since then, another 624 land wells have been drilled around Miri until 1972 which are collectively known as the [...] "Miri field". The Miri field is the only onshore field in Sarawak, because oil production has shifted offshore since the late 1950s. The first oil well on Canada Hill (Miri Well No. 1) produced a total of 0.65 million oil barrels for the next 60 years until its closure on 31 October 1972. The first oil refinery and submarine pipeline was built in Miri in 1914. The oil refinery has since been relocated to Lutong (11km to the north of Miri) in 1916.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pocket holes}} require two {{drilling}} operations to be completed. The {{first is to}} counterbore the pocket hole itself, which houses the screw head within the member.

The second step is to drill a pilot hole concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member. The pilot hole allows the screw to pass through the member and into the adjoining member. This two stage <b>drilling</b> <b>operation</b> may be performed with two different sized drill bits, however there are special stepped bits available to perform the operation in a single pass. The <b>drilling</b> <b>operation</b> is often facilitated by a pocket hole jig which allows the user to drill the pocket hole at the correct angle and to the correct depth.|$|E

30|$|Drilling fluid is an {{important}} element in <b>drilling</b> <b>operations.</b> Improper design of drilling fluids causes significant problems during <b>drilling</b> <b>operations.</b> <b>Drilling</b> fluid properties such as pH, rheology, and filtration control should be properly evaluated to fulfill its substantial functions. The most important functions of drilling fluids are cooling the bottom hole assembly, balancing the formation pressure, transporting and suspending cuttings, and minimizing formation damage (Agin et al. 2018; Moraveji et al. 2017; Dhiman 2016; Kafashi et al. 2017 a, b; Nasiri et al. 2017).|$|R

30|$|Formation pore {{pressure}} {{is the major}} factor affecting <b>drilling</b> <b>operations</b> and well-planning processes.

30|$|Drilling mud plays a {{vital role}} in {{successful}} petroleum <b>drilling</b> <b>operations.</b> Mud must maintain good viscosity to effectively suspend and transport cuttings.
