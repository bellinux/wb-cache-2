5|$|The {{study of}} <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian groups is quite mature, {{including}} the fundamental theorem of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian groups; and reflecting {{this state of}} affairs, many group-related notions, such as center and commutator, describe {{the extent to which}} a given group is not abelian.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the i-th {{homotopy}} group, πi(X) {{begins with}} the pointed i-sphere (S'i,s), and otherwise follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class acts as {{the identity of the}} group addition, and for X equal to S'n (for positive n) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and <b>finitely</b> <b>generated.</b> If for some i all maps are null homotopic, then the group πi consists of one element, and is called the trivial group.|$|E
5|$|Noether's paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains, 1921), is the {{foundation}} of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a commutative ring. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every ideal is <b>finitely</b> <b>generated.</b> In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, Noetherian ring, to describe this property. A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
25|$|If A is finite {{and all the}} vertex groups Av are <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> then G is <b>finitely</b> <b>generated.</b>|$|E
25|$|If A is a unital {{associative}} algebra {{over the}} field k with finite dimension over k, then Homk(−, k) is a duality between <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> left A-modules and <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> right A-modules. Therefore, the <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> injective left A-modules are precisely the modules of the form Homk(P, k) where P is a <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> projective right A-module. For symmetric algebras, the duality is particularly well-behaved and projective modules and injective modules coincide.|$|E
25|$|The {{converse}} {{is true for}} <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> modules over Noetherian rings: a <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> module over a commutative noetherian ring is locally free if {{and only}} if it is projective.|$|E
25|$|Homology and cohomology groups, on {{the other}} hand, are abelian and in many {{important}} cases <b>finitely</b> <b>generated.</b> <b>Finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian groups are completely classified and are particularly easy to work with.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{properties}} that are invariant under quasi-isometry. Examples of such properties of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> groups include: {{the growth rate}} of a <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> group; the isoperimetric function or Dehn function of a finitely presented group; the number of ends of a group; hyperbolicity of a group; the homeomorphism type of the Gromov boundary of a hyperbolic group; asymptotic cones of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> groups (see, e.g.,); amenability of a <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> group; being virtually abelian (that is, having an abelian subgroup of finite index); being virtually nilpotent; being virtually free; being finitely presentable; being a finitely presentable group with solvable Word Problem; and others.|$|E
25|$|Every abelian {{category}} A is {{a module}} over the monoidal category of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian groups; that is, we can form a tensor {{product of a}} <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian group G and any object A of A.|$|E
25|$|Noetherian {{groups are}} {{equivalently}} those such that every subgroup is <b>finitely</b> <b>generated,</b> which {{is stronger than}} the group itself being finitely generated: the free group on 2 or finitely more generators is <b>finitely</b> <b>generated,</b> but contains free groups of infinite rank.|$|E
25|$|Even {{for free}} modules, {{the rank of}} a free module (i.e. the analog of the {{dimension}} of vector spaces) may not be well-defined. Finally, submodules of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> modules need not be <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> (unless R is Noetherian, see below).|$|E
25|$|If R is a left-noetherian ring, {{then the}} {{category}} of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> left modules over R is abelian. In particular, {{the category of}} <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> modules over a noetherian commutative ring is abelian; in this way, abelian categories show up in commutative algebra.|$|E
25|$|As every {{congruence}} of an algebra is the join of the <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> congruences {{below it}} (e.g., every submodule of a module is {{the union of}} all its <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> submodules), we obtain the following result, first published by Birkhoff and Frink in 1948.|$|E
25|$|A <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> {{nilpotent}} {{group has}} a Dehn function equivalent to n'd where d≥1 and all positive integers d are realized in this way. Moreover, every <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> nilpotent group G admits a polynomial isoperimetric inequality of degree c+1, where c is the nilpotency class of G.|$|E
25|$|A <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> torsion-free {{abelian group}} is free.|$|E
25|$|McCammond and Wise {{showed how}} to {{overcome}} difficulties {{posed by the}} Rips construction and produce large classes of small cancellation groups that are coherent (that is where all <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> subgroups are finitely presented) and, moreover, locally quasiconvex (that is where all <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> subgroups are quasiconvex).|$|E

25|$|A locally cyclic {{group is}} a group in which each <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> {{subgroup}} is cyclic.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} k-rational points {{for a global}} field k is <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> by the Mordell-Weil theorem. Hence, by the {{structure}} theorem for <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian groups, it is isomorphic to {{a product of a}} free abelian group Zr and a finite commutative group for some non-negative integer r called the rank of the abelian variety. Similar results hold for some other classes of fields k.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} {{result is that}} all points can be constructed by the method of tangents and secants starting with {{a finite number of}} points. More precisely the Mordell–Weil theorem states that the group E(Q) is a <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> (abelian) group. By the fundamental theorem of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian groups it is therefore a finite direct sum of copies of Z and finite cyclic groups.|$|E
25|$|Theorems about abelian groups (i.e. modules {{over the}} {{principal}} ideal domain Z) {{can often be}} generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian groups which is a specialization of the structure theorem for <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> modules over a principal ideal domain. In the case of <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form Z/pkZ for p prime, and {{the latter is a}} direct sum of finitely many copies of Z.|$|E
25|$|The Mordell–Weil theorem {{implies that}} the divisor class group CH'n-1(X) is <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> for any variety X of {{dimension}} n over a number field. It is an open problem whether all Chow groups are <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> for every variety over a number field. The Bloch–Kato conjecture on values of L-functions predicts that these groups are <b>finitely</b> <b>generated.</b> Moreover, the rank {{of the group of}} cycles modulo homological equivalence, and also of the group of cycles homologically equivalent to zero, should be equal to the order of vanishing of an L-function of the given variety at certain integer points. Finiteness of these ranks would also follow from the Bass conjecture in algebraic K-theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} theorem for <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> modules over {{a principal}} ideal domain usually {{appears in the}} following two forms.|$|E
25|$|The group G is {{subgroup}} separable, that is, every <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> subgroup {{is closed}} in the pro-finite topology on G.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{decomposition}} generalizes to <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> modules over commutative Noetherian rings, {{and this}} result is called the Lasker–Noether theorem.|$|E

25|$|Every <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> module over a PID is also finitely {{presented}} {{because a}} PID is Noetherian, {{an even stronger}} condition than coherence.|$|E
25|$|Thomas and Velickovic used small {{cancellation}} {{theory to}} construct a <b>finitely</b> <b>generated</b> group with two non-homeomorphic asymptotic cones, thus answering a question of Gromov.|$|E
