5|$|The first {{tropical}} storm {{of the season}} formed 75mi (120km) south-southwest of Puerto Vallarta on June 11. Tropical Storm One <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea without intensifying further than 50mph (80km/h). Heading west-northwestward, the storm dissipated on July 12, centered roughly halfway between Socorro Island and Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} storm was observed offshore of Mexico, on September17. Tropical Storm Five had {{no change in}} intensity past a 50mph (85km/h) {{tropical storm}}, similar to Tropical Storms One, Two, and Three. While paralleling the coast of Mexico, Tropical Storm Five passed only 75mi (120km) southwest of Manzanillo. The tropical storm curved northwestward on September18, and <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea. The system dissipated 135mi (215km) west-southwest of Islas Marías on September19.|$|E
5|$|Air America {{helicopters}} {{continued to}} make rooftop pickups until after nightfall by which time navigation became increasingly difficult. Helicopters overflew the designated LZs to check no Americans {{had been left behind}} and then the last helicopters (many low on fuel) <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> TF76, located the USS Midway or the USS Hancock and shut down. All Air America flights had ceased by 21:00. With its available fleet of only 20 Hueys (3 of which were impounded, ditched or damaged at TF76), Air America had moved over 1,000 evacuees to the DAO Compound, the Embassy or out to the ships of TF76.|$|E

Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E

5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Sulfur Springs {{to deny that}} source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 May, U-6 <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> try to {{intercept}} shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona. Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen, U-6s commander since November 1915, attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed {{a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. While submerged, von Falkhausen heard an unexplained noise on the hull of the boat, which was likely the sound of U-6 fouling one of the anti-submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga. The drifter's skipper was alerted to the submarine's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired. Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II. In the meantime, von Falkhausen surfaced U-6 to try to cut loose the buoy being dragged behind his boat. When the hatch was opened, the crew discovered the boat entangled in the net.|$|E

25|$|PA 823 {{began at}} the {{community}} of Big Shanty. The route went northward {{then turned to the}} southeast just north of Big Shanty. The route intersected with Toothman Road, a dead-end highway, beyond which it became known as Big Shanty Road, named after the nearby borough. State Route 823 then curved to the northeast, making a gradual, smooth turn to the north. The route then intersected with Lineman Road, another nearby dead-end highway. From here, a set of railroad tracks parallelled nearby, following PA 823 for most of its length. After that, there was an intersection with Droney Road, which <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the paralleling railroad tracks.|$|E

They {{were followed by}} three groups of 100 men assigned to storm the Union works and stream back into the Union rear area. Brig. Gen. Napoleon B. McLaughlen rode to Fort Haskell, just {{to the south of}} Battery XII, which he found to be ready to defend itself. As he moved north, he ordered Battery XII to open fire on Battery XI and a reserve infantry regiment briefly re-captured Battery XI. Assuming that he had sealed the only breach in the line, McLaughlen rode into Fort Stedman and began giving orders to the men. He suddenly realized that they were Confederates and they realized he was a Union general, capturing him.|$|E
25|$|At about 21:00 on 17 April 1961, a {{night air}} strike by three FAL B-26s on San Antonio de Los Baños {{airfield}} failed, reportedly due to incompetence and bad weather. Two other B-26s had aborted the mission after take-off. Other sources allege that heavy anti-aircraft fire scared the aircrews As night fell, Atlantico and Caribe {{pulled away from}} Cuba, {{to be followed by}} Blagar and Barbara J. The ships were to return to the Bay of Pigs the next day to land more ammunition, but the captains of Atlantico and Caribe decided to abandon the invasion and <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the open sea out of fear of further air attacks by the FAR. Destroyers from the US Navy intercepted Atlantico about 110 miles south of Cuba, and persuaded the captain to return, but Caribe was not intercepted until she was 218 miles away from Cuba, and she was not to return until it was too late.|$|E

25|$|The {{precursor}} of the Folger Coffee Company {{was founded in}} 1850 in San Francisco, California, U.S., as the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. The owner, William H. Bovee, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans, and roast and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired James A. Folger as a carpenter. James had arrived from Nantucket Island {{at the age of}} 15 with his two older brothers during the California Gold Rush. In the 1850s, kerosene began to offer a cheaper alternative to whale oil, which had been Nantucket's life-blood, resulting in the re-purposing of many of its ships to bring coffee from South America to San Francisco. After working at Bovee’s mill for nearly a year, James had saved enough money to stake a claim in the company and <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company to J.A. Folger & Co.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Milwaukee for {{the start}} of a seven-game roadtrip {{beginning}} August 31 and stretching into September having posted their highest win total in a month for the season, despite injuries to key players like Harper, Scherzer, and Madson during August. After losing the last two games in their three-game set in Miami to start the month, they proceeded to win two of three from the Cubs on the road, win three of four from the Marlins and then two of three from the Giants at home, split the two-game interleague series with the visiting Angels, win three of four from the Padres and then two of three from the Astros on the road, split the four-game series with the visiting Mets, and then sweep the Marlins in three games at home. The Milwaukee Brewers ended Washington's four-game winning streak, winning 6–3 in the August 31 series opener despite Turner falling a home run shy of hitting for the cycle. All in all, the Nationals went 18–11 over the month of August and finished the month with a 81–52 record, good for second overall in the National League behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and 15 games up over the second-place Marlins in the National League East.|$|E

Their bases in and around Calais were covered in 8/10ths cloud cover with a base of 6,500 feet which reached to 10,000 feet. As the bombers climbed through the haze the formation soon lost cohesion. Valuable time was lost as they reformed. The Do 17s of I. and III./KG 76 had overtaken the III./KG 76 Ju 88s which should have been ahead of them by five minutes. These delay had serious consequences for 9 Staffel KG 76.|$|E
