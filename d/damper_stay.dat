40|$|Inclined {{stay cables}} on {{cable-stayed}} bridges {{are prone to}} wind-induced vibrations due to their long flexible nature and low structural <b>damping.</b> Severe <b>stay</b> cable vibrations under either the combined effect of rain and wind or wind only have been observed in field and wind tunnel tests which caused great concerns to bridge designers. To suppress these vibrations, fluid dampers are often attached to the stay cables near the anchorages. In order to facilitate effective and economical design of dampers for stay cable vibration mitigation, thorough understanding of both the vibration characteristics and {{the dynamics of the}} cable-damper system is necessary. Nevertheless, existing studies are limited to deterministic-based analysis of which the uncertainties of structural parameters (such as cable tension and damper capacity) and wind parameters (such as speed, direction, etc.) over the service life of a bridge are totally neglected. Thus, to provide complete information regarding the aerodynamic response of a damped cable, the problem should be more rationally studied from a probabilistic-based sense. This would offer bridge engineers a more reliable analytical tool for performance assessment of cable-damper systems. The current study aims at improving the current practice of external damper design by proposing a time-variant reliability-based framework model of a <b>damped</b> <b>stay</b> cable subjected to wind load conditions. Two types of cable vibrations that are more probable, i. e. rain-wind-induced cable vibrations, and/or critical, i. e. dry-inclined cable galloping, than the others are investigated. The research outcomes are drawn to ensure reliability of design and enhance maintainability of external dampers for bridge stay cables.

40|$|Passive fluid damper {{is one of}} {{most widely}} used control devices for <b>damping</b> {{vibration}} of <b>stay</b> cables in a cable-stayed bridge in practice. However, each stay cable features unique dynamic characteristics and requires a specific damper to achieve the best control performance, which engenders many troubles in manufacture, implementation and maintenance of dampers. This paper presents a new approach for <b>damping</b> vibration of <b>stay</b> cables in a cable-stayed bridge by using adjustable fluid dampers. The principle and main features of adjustable fluid dampers with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators are first introduced. The solution of a taut cable with the adjustable fluid damper described by the Maxwell model is provided. A most favorable design principle is then proposed for selecting the least types of adjustable fluid dampers for damping vibration of a few hundreds stay cables in a cable-stayed bridge. A case study of stay cables in a super long span cable-stayed bridge is finally performed, demonstrating that only two types of adjustable fluid dampers are required for damping vibration of all stay cables in the bridge.

40|$|Due {{to their}} long {{flexible}} nature and low inherent <b>damping,</b> <b>stay</b> cables on cable-stayed bridges {{are prone to}} dynamic excitations such as wind. Of specific interest to this research study is the dry inclined cable galloping phenomenon which has been addressed as a potential risk to stay cables. However, due to the complex nature of flow on a bridge site, differentiation between different wind-induced phenomena and their mechanism is very challenging. Several wind tunnel studies have confirmed the occurrence of dry inclined cable galloping under circumstances that could be easily satisfied on site. On the other hand, the transferability of wind tunnel test results on rigid circular cylinders to real cables on cable-stayed bridges might be questionable due to the unsteady nature of the natural wind and flexibility of stay cables which are hardly addressed in wind tunnel studies. The current research is therefore an effort to develop analytical models that could qualitatively investigate the dry inclined cable galloping phenomenon under more realistic conditions. A single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) linearized model is developed to estimate the aerodynamic <b>damping</b> of <b>stay</b> cables {{in the context of}} wind flow past an elastically supported cylinder with arbitrary cross-sectional shape under unsteady wind conditions. The stability of wind-induced cable response could thus be judged based on the aerodynamic damping parameter. Further, in order to account for aerodynamic nonlinearities, a nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) aeroelastic model is proposed in which the nonlinear equations of motion of an elastically supported cylinder having an arbitrary cross-section subjected to the general case of unsteady wind are numerically solved. To assess the impact of aerodynamic nonlinearity, wind-induced response of an elliptical cylinder are computed using the proposed SDOF model and 2 DOF model. Since these two models utilize the aerodynamic force coefficient data as input, a series of wind tunnel tests were conducted on a static elliptical cylinder to measure its aerodynamic drag and lift force coefficients. Results suggested that the nonlinear model was superior to the linearized models in prediction of aerodynamic instabilities. At last, a three-dimensional (3 D) aeroelastic model for galloping of a long stay cable considering its flexural rigidity and sag is proposed, which, similar to the 2 DOF model, numerically solves the equations of motion of a stay cable subjected to general unsteady wind. Results yielded from the current study suggest that the galloping response amplitude of real stay cables may be significantly reduced by several practical factors on site that could not be accounted in the wind tunnel studies such as unsteady/turbulent nature of wind, atmospheric boundary layer type wind velocity profile, and pre-existing small amplitude multi-mode oscillations. Therefore the possibility of the occurrence of dry inclined cable galloping in field may be in fact significantly less than that predicted by a wind tunnel study...|$|R

40|$|The use of NiTi wires, {{one of the}} Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) {{materials}} that permits efficient <b>damping</b> in <b>stayed</b> cables for bridges, requires an appropriate behavior when exposed to the external temperature effects. The Clausius-Clapeyron thermodynamic equation establishes a shift of the hysteretic cycle in the stress-temperature representation of about 6 MPa/K for the used wires of diameter 2. 46 mm. Hence, an adequate experimental study is necessary to characterize the temperature effects in working conditions. The conducted analysis is twofold.

Two types of dampers have been analysed; a near anchorage viscous damper and a tuned mass damper (TMD) mounted near the midspan of the stay cable. For the passive case, both dampers are tuned to the fundamental mode of vibration of the cable. The optimal viscous damping for the near anchorage damper is determined based on well-known equations for a taut string. For the TMD, parametrical studies have been performed to determine the optimal damping ratio as function of the damper mass. The resulting vibration mitigation from the two systems are also studied for higher modes of vibration and the potential increase in performance using an adaptive or semi-active vibration control system is studied.

40|$|Experimental {{study of}} damping in civil {{engineering}} structures was done using smart materials (NiTi SMA). The study {{is focused on}} the stayed cables for bridges. The cable oscillations are induced by wind, rain or traffic. The SMA and their solid-solid phase transformation permits effective damping via the hysteresis cycle and the conversion of mechanical work in heat. The analysis of SMA behavior needs to be strictly coherent with the requirements associated to the application. In particular, the high requirement on working cycles induced by a strong storm of 3 or 4 days, the temperature – stress dependence of the phase transformation (via Clausius-Clapeyron equation), the self-heating effects, the SMA creep and the eventual effects of aging (temperature and time) on the transformation temperatures (i. e., atomic order and/or other effects) were studied. The SMA was applied to mitigate the oscillations induced in realistic cables in ELSA (45 m length) with positive results, and in the LCPC facility (50 m length), always with equivalent simulation tests.

In this paper, thin Ni-Ti (Nickel-Titanium) Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires were used as damping devices. The aim of this work is to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the efficiency of Ni-Ti dampers to reduce the vibration amplitudes of civil engineering cables. For a practical control of the SMA in <b>damping</b> for <b>stayed</b> cables, several measurements were carried out in this work, on a realistic full scale cable sample in Ifsttar (Nantes - France) laboratory facility.

The intrinsic damping coefficient in the free cable was extremely low. The reduction of cable oscillation amplitudes was about 25 % in 1 min.

40|$|The main {{categories}} of wind effects on long span bridge decks are buffeting, flutter, vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) {{which are often}} critical for the safety and serviceability of the structure. With the rapid increase of bridge spans, research on controlling wind-induced vibrations of long span bridges {{has been a problem}} of great concern. The developments of vibration control theories have led to the wide use of tuned mass dampers (TMDs) which has been proven to be effective for suppressing these vibrations both analytically and experimentally. Fire incidents are also of special interest in the stability and safety of long span bridges due to significant role of the complex phenomenon through triple interaction between the deck with the incoming wind flow and the thermal boundary of the surrounding air. This work begins with analyzing the buffeting response and flutter instability of three dimensional computational structural dynamics (CSD) models of a cable stayed bridge due to strong wind excitations using ABAQUS finite element commercial software. Optimization and global sensitivity analysis are utilized to target the vertical and torsional vibrations of the segmental deck through considering three aerodynamic parameters (wind attack angle, deck streamlined length and viscous <b>damping</b> of the <b>stay</b> cables). The numerical simulations results in conjunction with the frequency analysis results emphasized the existence of these vibrations and further theoretical studies are possible {{with a high level of}} accuracy. Model validation is performed by comparing the results of lift and moment coefficients between the created CSD models and two benchmarks from the literature (flat plate theory) and flat plate by (Xavier and co-authors) which resulted in very good agreements between them. Optimum values of the parameters have been identified. Global sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo sampling method was utilized to formulate the surrogate models and calculate the sensitivity indices. The rational effect and the role of each parameter on the aerodynamic stability of the structure were calculated and efficient insight has been constructed for the stability of the long span bridge. 2 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the decks are created with the support of MATLAB codes to simulate and analyze the vortex shedding and VIV of the deck. Three aerodynamic parameters (wind speed, deck streamlined length and dynamic viscosity of the air) are dedicated to study their effects on the kinetic energy of the system and the vortices shapes and patterns. Two benchmarks from the literature (Von Karman) and (Dyrbye and Hansen) are used to validate the numerical simulations of the vortex shedding for the CFD models. A good consent between the results was detected. Latin hypercube experimental method is dedicated to generate the surrogate models for the kinetic energy of the system and the generated lift forces. Variance based sensitivity analysis is utilized to calculate the main sensitivity indices and the interaction orders for each parameter. The kinetic energy approach performed very well in revealing the rational effect and the role of each parameter in the generation of vortex shedding and predicting the early VIV and the critical wind speed. Both one-way fluid-structure interaction (one-way FSI) simulations and two-way fluid-structure interaction (two-way FSI) co-simulations for the 2 D models of the deck are executed to calculate the shedding frequencies for the associated wind speeds in the lock-in region in addition to the lift and drag coefficients. Validation is executed with the results of (Simiu and Scanlan) and the results of flat plate theory compiled by (Munson and co-authors) respectively. High levels of agreements between all the results were detected. A decrease in the critical wind speed and the shedding frequencies considering (two-way FSI) was identified compared to those obtained in the (one-way FSI). The results from the (two-way FSI) approach predicted appreciable decrease in the lift and drag forces as well as prediction of earlier VIV for lower critical wind speeds and lock-in regions which exist at lower natural frequencies of the system. These conclusions help the designers to efficiently plan and consider for the design and safety of the long span bridge before and after construction. Multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) system has been applied in the three dimensional CSD models of the cable stayed bridge to analyze their control efficiency in suppressing both wind -induced vertical and torsional vibrations of the deck by optimizing three design parameters (mass ratio, frequency ratio and damping ratio) for the (TMDs) supporting on actual field data and minimax optimization technique in addition to MATLAB codes and Fast Fourier Transform technique. The optimum values of each parameter were identified and validated with two benchmarks from the literature, first with (Wang and co-authors) and then with (Lin and co-authors). The validation procedure detected a good agreement between the results. Box-Behnken experimental method is dedicated to formulate the surrogate models to represent the control efficiency of the vertical and torsional vibrations. Sobol's sensitivity indices are calculated for the design parameters in addition to their interaction orders. The optimization results revealed better performance of the MTMDs in controlling both the vertical and the torsional vibrations for higher mode shapes. Furthermore, the calculated rational effect of each design parameter facilitates to increase the control efficiency of the MTMDs in conjunction with the support of the surrogate models which simplifies the process of analysis for vibration control to a great extent. A novel structural modification approach has been adopted to eliminate the early coupling between the bending and torsional mode shapes of the cable stayed bridge. Two lateral steel beams are added to the middle span of the structure. Frequency analysis is dedicated to obtain the natural frequencies of the first eight mode shapes of vibrations before and after the structural modification. Numerical simulations of wind excitations are conducted for the 3 D model of the cable stayed bridge. Both vertical and torsional displacements are calculated at the mid span of the deck to analyze the bending and the torsional stiffness of the system before and after the structural modification. The results of the frequency analysis after applying lateral steel beams declared that the coupling between the vertical and torsional mode shapes of vibrations has been removed to larger natural frequencies magnitudes and higher rare critical wind speeds with a high factor of safety. Finally, thermal fluid-structure interaction (TFSI) and coupled thermal-stress analysis are utilized to identify the effects of transient and steady state heat-transfer on the VIV and fatigue of the deck due to fire incidents. Numerical simulations of TFSI models of the deck are dedicated to calculate the lift and drag forces in addition to determining the lock-in regions once using FSI models and another using TFSI models. Vorticity and thermal fields of three fire scenarios are simulated and analyzed. The benchmark of (Simiu and Scanlan) is used to validate the TFSI models, where a good agreement was manifested between the two results. Extended finite element method (XFEM) is adopted to create 3 D models of the cable stayed bridge to simulate the fatigue of the deck considering three fire scenarios. The benchmark of (Choi and Shin) is used to validate the damaged models of the deck in which a good coincide was seen between them. The results revealed that the TFSI models and the coupled thermal-stress models are significant in detecting earlier vortex induced vibration and lock-in regions in addition to predicting damages and fatigue of the deck and identifying the role of wind-induced vibrations in speeding up the damage generation and the collapse of the structure in critical situations...|$|R
