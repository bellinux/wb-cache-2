40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{investigated}} four experimental groups of caprine frozen yoghurt produced {{with the addition}} of fresh and spray dried <b>jambolan</b> fruit pulp (Eugenia jambolana Lam) and the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BI- 07. The physicochemical characteristics, overrun, meltdown test, selected bioactive-related attributes, besides the survival of added probiotic bacteria during the frozen storage and the sensory acceptance of the products were investigated. The probiotic addition decreased the pH of frozen yoghurt samples (P <  0. 05) and low overrun values (14. 2 – 22. 6 %) were observed for all samples. Higher phenolic content for samples with the probiotic strain was observed (P <  0. 05), which suggests a possible biotransformation that would lead to enhanced phytochemical level. The frozen yoghurt samples with probiotic presented high initial cell counts (approx. 9 log CFU/g) and an outstanding probiotic survival rate (97 %) was observed throughout the 90 days of frozen storage. Frozen yoghurt samples with probiotic bacteria received significantly lower flavor scores (P <  0. 05), and similar results were obtained for appearance, aroma and consistency among frozen yoghurt samples. Overall, the caprine frozen yoghurt enriched with <b>jambolan</b> fruit proved to be an efficient carrier for B.  animalis subsp. lactis BI- 07 and presented desirable bioactive and technological attributes...|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{state of}} a fruit {{is closely related}} to ripening and climatic conditions during the growing period when the fruit undergo changes in color, texture, and flavor. The ripening of the fruit can involve a complex series of biochemical reactions with alteration in enzymes activities, phenols, tannins, and ascorbic acid. The activity of enzymes (carboximethylcellulase, polygalacturonase, and pectinlyase), the total concentration of phenolic compounds, condensed tannins, and vitamin C in five stages of maturation were studied. Significant changes were observed between the maturity stages. The phenolic compounds were higher at green stage (705. 01 ± 7. 41); tannins were higher at green/purple stage (699. 45 ± 0. 22). The results showed that the ascorbic acid levels of the pulp varied significantly from 50. 81 ± 1. 43 to 6. 61 ± 1. 04 mg. 100 g- 1 during maturation. The specific activity of pectin lyase was higher at green stage (1531. 90 ± 5. 83). The specific activity of polygalacturonase was higher at mature stage (1. 83 ± 0. 0018). The specific activity of carboximetilcelulose was higher at ripe mature stage (4. 61 ± 0. 0024).

40|$|Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is a {{fruit with}} a long {{medicinal}} history, especially due to its phenolic compounds content, such as the anthocyanins, which are reported {{as one of the}} most important natural antioxidants. The analysis of the anthocyanins by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be considered as an important tool to evaluate the quality of pomegranate juice. For research laboratories the major challenge in using HPLC for quantitative analyses is the acquisition of high purity analytical standards, since these are expensive and in some cases not even commercially available. The aim of this study was to obtain analytical standards for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the anthocyanins from pomegranate. Five vegetable matrices (pomegranate flower, <b>jambolan,</b> jabuticaba, blackberry and strawberry fruits) were used to isolate each of the six anthocyanins present in pomegranate fruit, using an analytical HPLC scale with non-destructive detection, it being possible to subsequently use them as analytical standards. Furthermore, their identities were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry. The proposed procedure showed that it is possible to obtain analytical standards of anthocyanins with a high purity grade (98. 0 to 99. 9 %) from natural sources, which was proved to be an economic strategy for the production of standards by laboratories according to their research requirements...|$|E

Actually, these medicinal seeds were individually incorporated at three percentage levels (1, 3 and 5 %) with basal diet formulated by using fish meal (25 %), soya meal (20 %), groundnut oil cake (15 %), wheat bran (5 %), rice bran (10 %) and sunflower oil (2 %). Tapioca flour (15 %) and egg albumin (7 %) were used as binding agents. Vitamin B-complex with vitamin-C (1 %) was also added. Feed without incorporation of any seed was served as control. These medicinal seeds have acted as appetizer and significantly (P< 0. 05) enhanced the activities of digestive enzymes (protease, amylase and lipase) in S. cumini (5 %) incorporated feed fed prawns followed by P. emblica (5 %), A. indica (1 %) and R. communis (5 %) when compared with control. This led to enhanced food consumption, which in turn significantly increases (P< 0. 05) the concentrations of total protein, amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid. Further, the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants (vitamin-C and E) were also significantly improved (P< 0. 05), which ensures good health of the prawns.

40|$|Abstract The fungus Beauveria bassiana is {{naturally}} found in poultry houses and causes {{high rates of}} mortality in Alphitobius diaperinus. Laboratory and field experiments have shown the potential of this fungus as an insect control agent. However, in poultry houses, bacteria as Salmonella, can be found and have been studied alternative control methods for this pathogen. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of plant extracts and a disinfectant on the fungus Beauveria bassiana (strain Unioeste 4). Conidial viability, colony-forming unit (CFU) counts, vegetative growth, conidia production, insecticidal activity of the fungus and compatibility were used as parameters {{in the evaluation of}} the effect of these products on the fungus. Alcoholic and aqueous extracts of jabuticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora (Mart.), guava (Psidium guajava (L.)), and <b>jambolan</b> (Syzygium cumini (L.), at concentrations of 10 % as well as the commercial disinfectant, Peroxitane® 1512 AL, were evaluated at the recommended concentrations (RC), 1 : 200 (RC), 0. 5 RC and 2 RC. There was a negative influence of alcoholic and aqueous extracts of jabuticaba, guava and three dilutions of Peroxitane on the viability of conidia. The CFUs and vegetative growth of the fungus were affected only by the Peroxitane (all dilutions). For conidial production, the aqueous extract of guava had a positive effect, increasing production, while the Peroxitane at the R and RC concentrations resulted in a negative influence. The mortality of A. diaperinus, caused by the fungus after exposure to these products, was 60 % for the peracetic acid at 0. 5 RC, and above 80 % for the extracts.

Other com-mon names are Jambul, Black Plum, Java Plum, Indian Blackberry, Jamblang, Jamun etc. Today these trees are found growing {{throughout}} the Asian subcontinent, East-ern Africa, South America, Madagascar and have also naturalized to Florida and Hawaii in the United States of America [1]. The tree fruits once in a year and the berries are sweetish sour to taste. The ripe fruits are used for health drinks, making preserves, squashes, jellies and wine [1]. In association to itsdietary use, all parts of the tree and, importantly the seeds are used to treat a range of ailments, the most important being diabetes mellitus [2]. Different parts of the <b>jambolan</b> were also reported for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuropsycho-phar- macological, anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, anti-HIV, an-tileishmanial and antifugal, nitric oxide scavenging, free radical scavenging, anti-diarrheal, antifertility, anorex-igenic, gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic and redio-protective activities [2]. The {{purpose of this study was}} investigating experimentally the possible anti asthma activity of macerated and soxhlet extracts of fruits of this plant on tracheal chains of guinea pigs were evaluated. The relaxant effects of 4 cumulative concentrations of macerated and soxhlet extracts (0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 and 1. 25 W/V) in comparison with saline as negative control and 4 cumulative concentrations of theophylline (0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 and 1. 25 mM) as positive control were examined on precontracted tracheal chains of two groups of 6 guinea pig by 60 mM KCl (group 1, N= 6) and 10 µM methacholine the non-incubated tissues (group 2, N = 6) and tissues incubated with 1 µM propranolol (group 3, N = 4) [18]. Decrease in contractile tone of tracheal chains was considered as relaxant effect. The isolated guinea-pig trachea pre-contracted with KCl, methacholine and tissues incubated with propranolol were used to study the relaxation of macerated and soxhlet extracts of fruits Syzygium cumini. In group 1 experiments only the last two higher concentrations of theophylline and soxhlet extract showed significant relaxant effect compared to that of saline (p< 0. 001 for both concentrations), which were significantly greater than those of macerated extracts (p< 0. 001 for all cases). In group 2 experiments only the last two higher concentrations of theophylline and soxhlet extract showed significant relaxant effect compared to that of saline. The effects of one higher concentrations of theophylline in this group were significantly greater than those of macerated and soxhlet extracts (P < 0. 01). And in group 2 and 3 experiments both macerated and soxhlet extracts showed concentration-dependent relaxant effects compared to that of saline (p< 0. 05 to p< 0. 001 for both extracts). The relaxant effects of macerated and soxhlet extracts in group 1 were significantly lower than those of groups 2 and 3. In group 3 experiment potent relaxant effect was observed.
