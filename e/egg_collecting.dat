5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, <b>egg</b> <b>collecting,</b> and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them by their parents.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} because of habitat destruction. At the Forêt du Day site, 95% of its preferred juniper habitat is dead or dying and {{is unable to}} support this bird. While an overarching reason behind this destruction remains unknown, overgrazing by cattle, camels, and goats {{is believed to have}} been a significant contributor, along with rain, climate change, and a fungal disease. Hunting, the gathering of firewood, <b>egg</b> <b>collecting,</b> and general human disturbance are also believed to be threats. At the Mabla Mountains site, the habitat is also being degraded by the collection of firewood and overgrazing.|$|E

25|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>collecting</b> {{for food}} {{on a massive}} scale was {{frequent}} in the past but is now outlawed. It is to be noted that the sooty terns for example could sustain occasional collection of effectively all of a season's eggs (over 10 million), if given sufficient time to recover and if cats are absent. Even <b>egg</b> <b>collecting</b> on a scale that significantly decreases costly food imports thus in theory could be possible, but not until the cat and rat populations have been brought under control. Poaching remains a concern; with the population rising and spreading out on Kiritimati, formerly remote bird colonies became more accessible and especially the red-tailed tropicbirds and the Sula are strongly affected by hunting and disturbance. Tropicbirds are mainly poached for their feathers which are used in local arts and handicraft; it would certainly be possible to obtain them from living birds as it was routinely done {{at the height of the}} Polynesian civilization.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} terns face serious threats, and the Chinese crested tern is classed as [...] "critically endangered" [...] by BirdLife International. It has a {{population}} of fewer than 50birds and a breeding range of just 9km2 (3.5mi2). It is declining due to egg collection, human disturbance and the loss of coastal wetlands in China. Three other species are categorised as [...] "endangered", with declining populations of less than 10,000 birds. The South Asian black-bellied tern is threatened by habitat loss, <b>egg</b> <b>collecting</b> for food, pollution and predation. In New Zealand, the black-fronted tern is facing a rapid fall in numbers due to predation by introduced mammals and Australian magpies. Disturbance by cattle and sheep and by human activities is also a factor. The Peruvian tern was initially damaged by the collapse of anchoveta stocks in 1972, but breeding colonies have subsequently been lost due to building, disturbance and pollution in their coastal wetlands.|$|E
2500|$|The swan goose was uplisted from Near Threatened to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1992 {{and further}} to Endangered in 2000, as its {{population}} is declining due to habitat loss and excessive hunting and (particularly on the Sanjiang Plain in China) <b>egg</b> <b>collecting.</b> But new {{research has shown}} it to be not as rare as it was believed, and consequently, it was downlisted to Vulnerable status again in 2008. Still, less than 500 pairs might remain in Russia, while in Mongolia numbers are unknown though about 1,000 were seen at Ögii Lake in 1977. Favorite wintering locations in China are Lake Dongting, Lake Poyang, the Yancheng Coastal Wetlands and other locations around the lower Yangtze River, where some 60,000 individuals may be found each year [...] though this may be almost the entire world population. Until the 1950s, the species wintered in small numbers (up to about 100 birds annually) in Japan, but habitat destruction has driven them away. Altogether, between 60,000 and 100,000 adult Swan Geese remain in the wild today.|$|E
40|$|Natural spawnings of captive {{milkfish}} (Chanos chanos Forsskal) held in floating cages {{were observed}} in 1980, 1981, 1983 and 1985. Frequency of spawnings increased from two in 1980 to 41 in 1985. Various collectors and collection methods were tried with only slight improvements in number of <b>eggs</b> <b>collected.</b> Although the number of <b>eggs</b> <b>collected</b> per spawning increased from 900 in 1980 {{to a maximum of}} 769 000 in 1985, the numbers were not sufficient for mass-scale fry production. The most urgent problem was egg predators inside the floating cages during the spawning season. This paper presents an improved method of egg collection using fine-mesh net cages ("hapa" nets, 1 mm mesh) which effectively prevented entry of egg predators. Before "hapa" nets were installed the number of <b>eggs</b> <b>collected</b> ranged from 3300 to 668 000. From 330 000 to 2 942 000 <b>eggs</b> were <b>collected</b> by using "hapa" net cages.

50|$|At {{the time}} of Jessie Mothersole's visit in 1910, {{visitors}} were only allowed one hour {{on the island and}} shooting and <b>egg</b> <b>collecting</b> was forbidden. Despite this, Annet figured highly on the list of places to visit for <b>egg</b> <b>collecting.</b> An examination of the egg collection at the Natural History Museum (NHM) shows 45 eggs taken between 1880 and 1936 by 14 individuals and one group from Holloway College; doubtless there are many more eggs in private collections. Names on the data cards include well known wildlife experts such as Charles Rothschild and F W Frohawk. An indication of how common and acceptable <b>egg</b> <b>collecting</b> was at the time, is the issue of day permits to visit uninhabited islands by the warden A A Dorrien-Smith of Tresco.

Although Lake Garda eggs on average possessed a lower level of p,p'-DDE than Lake Maggiore eggs, they had significantly higher levels of PCBs and could not be used as a reference population for the measurement of eggshell thickness. Nevertheless, a negative linear relationship was found between p,p'-DDE concentration and eggshell thickness for <b>eggs</b> <b>collected</b> from both lakes, indicating a possible Causal relationship. Testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol concentrations were also determined for <b>eggs</b> <b>collected</b> from both lakes in 2004.

The temephos treated ovitraps were placed indoor and outdoor in each selected house. Each ovitrop contained 1 ppm temephos. Larval and adults Ae. aegypri mosquito were collected as ell as health education was conducted during the study. Temephos treated ovitrap were also set at the buffer area but no larval and adult Ae. aegypti collection was done. While in the buffer area no such activities were done.
