2500|$|Most of {{the track}} is on-street using 35G-section grooved tram rail, with BS11-80A [...] <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail</b> elsewhere. The railway track was {{supplied}} by British Steel Corporation Track Products of Workington and laid on sleepers consisting of concrete blocks with steel ties which gives a spring feeling when travelling on these sections.

50|$|Bullhead rail has {{now been}} almost {{completely}} replaced by <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail</b> on British railways, although it survives on the national rail system in some sidings or branch lines. The London Underground continued to use bullhead rail after it had been phased out elsewhere in Britain, {{but in the last}} few years has there been a concerted effort to convert its track to <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> However, the process of replacing track in tunnels is a slow process due to the impossibility of using heavy plant and machinery.|$|E
5000|$|The main viaduct was 65 ft long, {{with four}} 16 ft spans, and the {{embankment}} supporting it was 7 ft high The trackwork consisted of [...] <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail</b> in 16 ft lengths, supported on steel sleepers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{line was}} built to {{standard}} gauge, 4 ft 8½ in (1,435 mm), with Vignoles (<b>flat-bottom)</b> <b>rails</b> spiked to light transverse sleepers, [...] "the whole of the line being ballasted with gravel, and, if I mistake not, a goodly bulk of sea shingle mixed therewith".|$|R
50|$|In September 1930 he {{left the}} NCC to become Chief Stores Superintendent (Euston) on the LMS. In 1934 he became Chief Civil Engineer. Wallace was an {{advocate}} of British Standard track and <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rails</b> and among the works he carried out were extensive trials of flat-bottom track with two types of baseplate on the former Midland and Caledonian mainlines. He also initiated an assessment of continuously welded rail (CWR).|$|R
25|$|Notwithstanding modern {{technical}} developments, the overwhelmingly dominant track form worldwide {{consists of}} <b>flat-bottom</b> steel <b>rails</b> supported on timber or pre-stressed concrete sleepers, which are themselves laid on crushed stone ballast.|$|R
5000|$|The Strub {{rack system}} {{was invented by}} Emil Strub in 1896. It uses a rolled <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail</b> with rack teeth {{machined}} into the head approximately 100 mm apart. Safety jaws fitted to the locomotive engage with {{the underside of the}} head to prevent derailments and serve as a brake. [...] Strub's US Patent, granted in 1898, also includes details of how the rack rail is integrated with the mechanism of a turnout.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} A&BR station, {{which was}} situated {{to the north}} of a level crossing over the East Claydon Road, had a single platform and lightweight flange-bolted <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> A small hut and cottage were provided for the gatekeeper who also served as the station's porter; a small signal box controlled access to a siding. The station was entirely rebuilt by the Metropolitan Railway which doubled the line and provided a Down platform which partially obstructed the line of sight from the signal box.|$|E
50|$|Colonel Rich made a {{visit and}} made recommendations; he {{reported}} that the track was Vignoles (<b>flat-bottom)</b> <b>rail</b> spiked to transverse sleepers; the steepest gradient (he said) was 1 in 40 and the sharpest curve was of 12 chains radius, although a later GWR assessment of the line showed steeper gradients and sharper curves than this. The passenger service consisted of four trains each way every weekday; there was a connecting road service to Cardigan and to Newport. The rails were rather light, at 50 lbs/yard.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} trains ran from Oswestry, southwards over the Cambrian Railways line {{as far as}} Llynclys, then turning west on the Cambrian Railways Porthywaen branch, leaving that at Porthywaen passenger station, a very small building, and now entering on the Tanat Valley line itself. The track was of much lighter construction now, consisting of Vignoles pattern (<b>flat-bottom)</b> <b>rails</b> dogged direct to the sleepers. The Nantmawr branch of the Cambrian Railways converged from the north. The first TVR station was Blodwel Junction, a single platform station. Blodwel station had been opened in 1866, the terminus of the Potteries line, and known then as Llanyblodwel, part of the mineral branch crossing {{the path of the}} TVR. A road crosses the railway by a bridge at Blodwel; this is the only place where there is a bridge crossing of a road.|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, {{the line}} was ceremonially opened amongst great celebration on 17 December 1877, and to {{ordinary}} public operation the following day. There were six mixed (passenger and goods) trains each way, Monday to Saturday. It was a single track of standard gauge, using Vignoles (<b>flat-bottom)</b> <b>rails.</b> The one engine in steam system of operation was to be used {{and there was one}} intermediate station at Somerford (later Great Somerford), which did not have goods facilities at first. The junction with the GWR main line was at Dauntsey, between Swindon and Chippenham, where branch trains had a bay platform. Branch trains did not run beyond Dauntsey; there was a short length of loop siding alongside the branch line at Dauntsey, used for running round passenger trains. The line was 6 miles 4 furlongs and 1½ chains (10.5 km) in length; there was a tunnel at Malmesbury, and the station there was on Gloucester Road just beyond Stanes river bridge. The construction had cost £76,565 so far—the final cost was to be £87,094.|$|R
5000|$|Major Marindin was the Board of Trade {{inspector}} {{and as well}} as {{calling attention}} to the hours of duty, he recommended that the sharpest part of the curve should be eased and relaid [...] "with a chair road", (the existing track was <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail</b> spiked direct to the sleepers); to fit a check-rail and to increase slightly the slackness of gauge; and [...] "to work passenger trains on the branch only with tank engines and as far as possible to avoid running six-wheel coupled engines upon it".|$|E
50|$|Many {{railways}} {{preferred a}} {{flat bottom rail}} section, where the rails could be laid directly on the sleepers, representing a marked cost saving. Indenting of the sleeper was the problem; where the traffic was heavy, it became necessary to provide a sole plate under the rails to spread the load on the tie, partly vitiating the cost saving. However, in main line situations, this form found almost universal adoption in North America and Australia, and in much of continental Europe. The United Kingdom persisted with bullhead rail in main line use, with widespread introduction of <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail</b> only starting in about 1947.|$|E
5000|$|The {{network is}} 29 km long, with 60 km of track. It {{features}} {{two types of}} track; tramway track where either pedestrians or road traffic share {{the right of way}} and ballasted railway track when there are no such requirements.Tramway track consists of a grooved tramway rail set into a concrete base with troughs into which the rails are laid.Most of the track is on-street using 35G-section grooved tram rail, with BS11-80A [...] <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail</b> elsewhere. The railway track was supplied by British Steel Corporation Track Products of Workington and laid on sleepers consisting of concrete blocks with steel ties which gives a spring feeling when travelling on these sections. The track is laid on a bed of ballast which in turn rests on a prepared formation. Street crossings are usually laid with grooved tramway rails.|$|E
5000|$|The Welsh Crown Spelter company still {{retained}} {{a few men}} on its books, to safeguard its assets, and a catalogue of these assets was prepared. In June 1907 an auction advertisement (see bottom picture) subsequently appeared in the Mining Journal, selling many of the mechanical assets of the Welsh Crown Spelter Co., and divided into 'Electrical Mining Plant', mostly from Pandora mine and 'Dressing Plant', from Klondyke mill. Pertinent to the Klondyke operation, this sale included the like of 100 tons of 18 lb <b>flat-bottom</b> <b>rail,</b> a petrol locomotive of 22.5" [...] gauge, 25 side-tip wagons, and 800' of Henderson cableway. The dressing plant on offer included a stone breaker and several jiggers, pulleys and belts, the contents of smiths' and carpenters' shops, telephone installations, drawing instruments, office and household furniture, and a pony and trap. It {{is clear from the}} full list of auction items that the mill was very dependent on electricity for its operation. This may also have contributed to the decline, for pumping equipment in particular was prone to failure.|$|E
