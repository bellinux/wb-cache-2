5|$|At {{the start}} of Part One, Ko Kitamura, son of the owner of Kitamura Sports, lives in the same {{neighborhood}} as the batting center run by the Tsukishima family. Due to their proximity and the relationship between their businesses, the Kitamura and Tsukishima families have been close for many years, and their children <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between the two homes. Because Ko and Wakaba are the same age and always together, Aoba is jealous of all the time Ko spends with her older sister. Aoba is a natural pitcher with excellent form, and Ko secretly trains to become as good as she is, even while publicly showing little interest in baseball. Then Wakaba dies in a swimming accident at a summer camp during fifth grade.|$|E
5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In order to do so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are able to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a {{piece of evidence that}} contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of exclamation marks are shown; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of the exclamation marks disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E
5|$|Many of the pre-game and in-game {{strategic}} {{decisions in}} baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters {{tend to be}} more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters {{tend to be more}} successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting {{one or more of the}} right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder. Furthermore, unlike players in most team sports, baseball players can not return to a game after being replaced; this creates a greater risk when making lineup changes, especially as a team's pitching staff may be increasingly depleted in the late innings of a game, particularly one which goes into multiple extra innings.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} {{of two major}} parallel dimensions, like time periods in Chrono Trigger, {{plays a significant role}} in the game. Players must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between the worlds to recruit party members, obtain items, and advance the plot. Much of the population of either world have counterparts in the other; some party members can even visit their other versions. The player must often search for items or places found exclusively in one world. Events in one dimension sometimes have an impact in another—for instance, cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation to grow in the other world. This system assists the presentation of certain themes, including the questioning of the importance of one's past decisions and humanity's role in destroying the environment. Rounding out the notable facets of Chrono Crosss gameplay are the New Game+ option and multiple endings. As in Chrono Trigger, players who have completed the game may choose to start the game over using data from the previous session. Character levels, learned techniques, equipment, and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. On a New Game+, players can access twelve endings. Scenes viewed depend on players' progress in the game before the final battle, which can be fought at any time in a New Game+ file.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
25|$|In theory, real-mode {{applications}} {{could be}} directly executed in 16-bit protected mode if certain rules (newly proposed {{with the introduction}} of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to those rules, protected mode was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the 32-bit Intel 80386, which was designed to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within protected mode. When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.|$|E

500|$|Production on {{the episode}} officially began in October 2011 at Los Angeles, California, {{after several months}} of {{research}} and development. The animators worked closely with executive producer Paul Tibbitt, creator Stephen Hillenburg, and creative director Vincent Waller to ensure the cartoon characters were properly translated into three-dimensional puppets. Hillenburg and Tibbitt provided hands-on feedback on the production on a weekly basis. [...] "They'd check out the weeklies and <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{with us on the}} various gags [...] It was really a pleasurable experience when they came to visit, because we come from the same planet. It all felt very easy and natural," [...] Walsh said.|$|E
500|$|Chaitanya {{is seen as}} {{the father}} of a six-year-old in 1980s and a happy-go-lucky college student in 2013. He {{described}} the former role as a challenging one. He also said that both the roles would have multiple layers and added, [...] "The film as you all would know by now, is spread across three generations, and all the characters <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> in time. I play a happy-go-lucky college guy in the present era. It's a typically fun character and has nothing in common with my character from the flashback. So acting wise, it was a big challenge". He described the drunk scenes shared with Nagarjuna, Nageswara Rao and his confrontation scene with Samantha {{towards the end of the}} film as the toughest scenes to act.|$|E
500|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to get their}} client declared [...] "not guilty". To do so, they cross-examine witnesses, and aim to find lies and inconsistencies in the testimonies. They are able to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a {{piece of evidence that}} contradicts the statement. The player is penalized if they present incorrect evidence: in the first game, a number of exclamation marks is shown, with one disappearing after each mistake the player makes; in later games, a health bar that represents the judge's patience is used instead. If all exclamation marks are lost, or the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty.|$|E

500|$|When the game's {{text was}} {{translated}} from Japanese to English, the game {{needed to be}} reprogrammed {{in order to accomplish}} this; different companies handled this process in different ways. Tecmo's Japanese writers wrote rough translations in English, and they would then fax them to the American division. According to Criona, the American division would [...] "edit it and put it back together, telling the story in a context that an American English speaker would understand. This would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> several times." [...] Moreover, the game's text was stored in picture files instead of raw computer text, and because of the NES' hardware limitations, the English text need to be very clear and concise to fall within those limitations; many times, different words with the same meaning but with fewer characters had to be used. All symbols and objects were scrutinized by Nintendo of America, who had specific rules on what could be included for North American releases; for instance, any Satanic, Christian, or any other religious, sexual, or drug-related references were not allowed.|$|E

2500|$|Dragon Age: Inquisition {{is set in}} the {{continent}} of Thedas, the fantasy world in which the two previous games are set.

2500|$|Whilst on tour, {{the band}} became reacquainted with Claritys {{producer}} Mark Trombino, {{and decided to}} work with him once again for their forthcoming album. Trombino also produced the band's second studio album, Static Prevails (1996), and their commercial breakthrough, Bleed American (2001). Jimmy Eat World subsequently began recording tracks at their home studio and rehearsal space, Unit 2 in Tempe, Arizona. After [...] "taking [...] songs as far as [...] could," [...] the band emailed them to Trombino, who was based in Los Angeles. Jim Adkins remarked, [...] " [...] would do a mix of it and add production ideas and we would just kind of <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> like that.

[...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard working method in the future for a lot of people. It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|E
