40|$|The {{quality of}} a mosaic depends on the {{projective}} alignment of the images involved. After point-correspondences between the images have been established, bundle adjustment finds an alignment considered optimal under certain hypotheses. This procedure minimizes a nonlinear cost {{and has to be}} initialized with care. It is very common to compose inter-frame <b>homographies</b> which have been computed with standard methods in order to get an initial global alignment. This technique is suboptimal if there is noise or missing <b>homographies</b> as it typically uses {{a small part of the}} available data. We propose four new closed-form solutions. They all provide non-heuristic initial alignments using all the known inter-frame <b>homographies.</b> Our methods are tested with synthetic and real data and are compared to the standard method. These experiments reveal that our methods are more accurate, taking advantage of the redundant information available in the set of inter-frame <b>homographies.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} video mosaicing scheme which {{exploits}} the motion information, implicitly {{available in the}} video.

We present a technique which exploits this useful cue for refining <b>homographies.</b> Moreover, a generic framework which exploits the camera motion model, to relate <b>homographies</b> in a video, is also proposed. The analysis and results of the proposed algorithms demonstrate significant promise, in terms of accuracy and robustness. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of multiple <b>homographies</b> between two piecewise planar {{views of a}} rigid scene is often {{assumed to be a}} solved problem. We show that contrary to popular opinion various crucial aspects of the task have not been adequately emphasised. We are motivated by a growing body of literature in robust multi-structure estimation that purports to solve the multi-homography estimation prob- lem but in fact does not. We demonstrate that the estima- tion of multiple <b>homographies</b> is an ill-solved problem by deriving new constraints that a set of mutually compatible <b>homographies</b> must satisfy, and by showing that homogra- phies estimated with prevailing methods fail to satisfy the requisite constraints on real-world data. We also explain why incompatible <b>homographies</b> imply inconsistent epipo- lar geometries. The arguments and experiments presented in this paper signal the need {{for a new generation of}} robust multi-structure estimation methods that have the capacity to enforce constraints on projective entities such as homog- raphy matrices.

2500|$|Although {{normally}} the grave accent serves {{the purpose of}} differentiating homographs in French (là ~ la, où ~ ou, çà ~ ça, à ~ a, etc.), the circumflex, for historical reasons, has come to serve a similar role. In fact, almost all the cases where the circumflex is used to distinguish homographs {{can be explained by}} the reasons above: it would therefore be false to declare that it is in certain words a sign placed solely to distinguish homographs, as with the grave accent.

We recover the mapping between the projector and each surface in three stages. In the first stage, we recover planar <b>homographies</b> between the projector and the camera through each surface using an uncalibrated variant of structured light. In the second stage, we express the <b>homographies</b> from the camera to each display surface as the composition of a metric rectification and a similarity transform. Our metric rectification algorithm uses several images of a rectangular object. In the third stage, we obtain the <b>homographies</b> between the projector and each surface by combining {{the results of the}} previous two stages.

40|$|Robust feature {{tracking}} is {{a requirement}} for many computer vision tasks such as indoor robot navigation. However, indoor scenes are characterized by poorly localizable features.

We experimentally show the need for multiple <b>homographies</b> and propose an illumination-invariant local-optimization scheme for motion refinement. The use of a large number of nondistinctive features within the constraints imposed by planar <b>homographies</b> allows us to gain robustness. Also, the lesser computation cost in estimating these nondistinctive features helps to maintain the efficiency of the proposed method.
