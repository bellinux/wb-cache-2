500|$|... "Ride Me to Hell" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Rowe and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick and series creator Devin Clark. Screenwriter and executive producer Daniel Powell said that the episode explores [...] "a little bit more" [...] about Mark's background, particularly that his father left {{him when he was}} younger, and that it [...] "sort of informs why he became a social worker". Unlike the series' first season, which paid homage mainly to horror films, season two referenced a variety of genres. In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Clark used [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] as an example that the season [...] "taps <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit beyond the horror culture". He referred it to as [...] "one of our big episodes" [...] and stated that it references contemporary shows with [...] "unsatisfied endings", such as Monk and Lost. In the episode, Grimes unleashes memories of being a cop in the 1970s, which Clark saw as an opportunity to make fun of 1970s cop shows, such as CHiPs and Starsky and Hutch. He said, [...] "It's always a fun opportunity to see what other worlds I can pull from, even beyond horror. We had some really fun opportunities this season to pull from old '70s cop shows. ... So, it's fun for me just to step out and try lots of different styles and looks. I'm excited for whatever the writers throw at me, thematically. It's just a new opportunity to try something different." [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] was the fifth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman.|$|E

2500|$|The {{symbolism}} of the scallop shell is multiple. Saint Augustine {{is said to have}} been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the Holy Trinity.

Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church, and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Streator is {{the protagonist}} of Lullaby. Over {{the course of the}} novel, a few {{important}} aspects of his character are revealed that play a part in his narration style and his character. Firstly, he imparts to us at the beginning of Chapter 2 that he is a journalist. Because the novel is set up as a frame story, the majority of Lullaby is written as a retelling by Streator himself. [...] This is apparent throughout the novel as he describes the people and events around him. He will often recount a person’s appearance in terms of 'the details': [...] "The details of Nash are, he’s a big guy in a white uniform. He wears high-top white track shoes and gathers his hair <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> palm tree at the crown of his head" [...] (p.25).|$|E

2500|$|The scallop {{shell is}} a {{traditional}} reference to pilgrimage. For Pope Benedict XVI, it also reminded [...] him of the legend according to which one day St. Augustine, pondering {{the mystery of the}} Trinity, saw a child at the seashore playing with a shell, trying to put the water of the ocean <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hole. Then he heard the words: This hole can no more contain the waters of the ocean than your intellect can comprehend the mystery of God. The crowned Moor is a regional motif in heraldry often seen in Bavaria, Benedict's German homeland. [...] Benedict has been quoted saying that, in addition to the obvious reference back to Saint Corbinian, the founder of the diocese where Benedict would become bishop in 1977, the bear represents Benedict himself being [...] "tamed by God" [...] to bear the spiritual burdens of Benedict's own ministries first as bishop, then as cardinal, and now as pope.|$|E

As with Piro and Kimiko, Largo and Erika meet by coincidence early in the story. Later, it is revealed that Erika is a former pop idol, who caused a big scene then disappeared from the public eye after her fiancé left her. When she is rediscovered by her fans, Largo helps thwart a fanboy horde, but not well enough to escape being dismissed by the TPCD for it. [...] He then offers to help Erika {{to deal with her}} [...] "vulnerabilities in the digital plane". [...] Erika insists on protecting herself, so Largo instructs her in computer-building. This leads <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more relationship than Largo can handle, partly because he insists all computer building be done in the nude or as close to it as possible, to avoid static electrical discharge ruining components, and partly because his behavior, crude though it may appear, impresses Erika in many ways.|$|E
2500|$|William {{appears in}} Scottish {{records for the}} first time in the 1180s, {{appearing}} as a royal clerk. In 1193, the royal patronage he had earned brought him his first known ecclesiastical post, as Archdeacon of Lothian. He was made the king's Chancellor probably on 8 September 1199, and was elected to the Bishopric of Glasgow in October the same year. He was consecrated at Lyon by Reginald de Forez, Archbishop of Lyon, in September 1200. [...] However, two years later in the same month, he was translated to the higher ranking Bishopric of St. Andrews. William got <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> trouble for exercising his episcopal powers before his episcopate had been confirmed by the Pope, then Innocent III; a charge was brought against him by one of his canons, a man named Eustace. The charge was heard by the Papal legate, John of Salerno, who held a council at Perth in December 1201, before leaving for business in Ireland. Legate John once again visited Scotland on his way back from Ireland, staying for more than fifty days at Melrose. However, nothing came of the charge.|$|E

2500|$|Viktoras Gidžiūnas was {{the first}} to note that De Conformitate Vitae B. P. Francisco, {{finished}} in 1390 by Bartholomew Rinonico and published in 1513 in Milan, contains a story of five Franciscans murdered in Vilnius. The laconic description notes that four monks were cut with swords while the guardian (head of the monastery) had his hands, feet, and head partially cut off. Still alive, he was then put <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boat; he drifted via the Neris and Neman to the territory of the Teutonic Knights. The same note mentioned two friars killed by the [...] "same idolaters" [...] in Siret, Moldavia, in 1378. English historian S. C. Rowell noted that the story in De Conformitate Vitae would fit {{in the context of a}} Lithuanian raid, possibly to avenge the murder of Yuri Koriatovich, into Moldavia in 1377. Additionally, Franciscan Andrzej Jastrzębiec {{was the first}} bishop of both Siret and Vilnius and thus could have provided his first-hand knowledge of both events. Therefore, Rowell concluded that De Conformitate Vitae proved that the event in the Bychowiec Chronicle did occur. The martyrdom in Vilnius is not dated in De Conformitate Vitae, but Marianus of Florence provided the date of 1369, which would fit perfectly with Bychowiec's note that the martyrs were murdered while Algirdas was at war with Moscow.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{journalists and}} video game {{designers}} have questioned this cultural classification, {{arguing that the}} differences between Eastern and Western games have been exaggerated. In an interview held at the American Electronic Entertainment Expo, Japanese video game developer Tetsuya Nomura (who worked on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts) emphasized that RPGs should not be classified by country-of-origin, but rather described simply for what they are: role-playing games. Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of Final Fantasy and The Last Story, noted that, while [...] "users like to categorise" [...] Japanese RPGs as [...] "turn-based, traditional styles" [...] and Western RPGs as [...] "born from first-person shooters," [...] there [...] "are titles that don't fit the category," [...] pointing to Chrono Trigger (which he also worked on) and the Mana games. He further noted {{that there have been}} [...] "other games similar to the style of Chrono Trigger," [...] but that [...] "it's probably because the games weren't localised and didn't reach the Western audience." [...] series director Tetsuya Takahashi, in reference to Xenoblade Chronicles, stated that [...] "I don’t know when exactly people started using the term 'JRPG,' but if this game makes people rethink the meaning of this term, I’ll be satisfied." [...] The writer Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com states that [...] "Xenoblade throws into high relief the sheer artificiality of the gaming community's obsession over the differences between" [...] Western and Japanese RPGs, pointing out that it [...] "does things that don't really fit into either genre. Gamers do love their boundaries and barriers and neat little rules, I know, but just because you cram something <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> box doesn't mean it belongs there." [...] Nick Doerr of Joystiq criticizes the claim that Japanese RPGs are [...] "too linear," [...] pointing out that non-linear Japanese RPGs are not uncommonfor instance, the Romancing SaGa series. Likewise, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq points out that linear Western RPGs were common in the 1990s, and argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally [...] "not true" [...] and [...] "never was", pointing to classic examples like Lands of Lore and Betrayal at Krondor that were more narrative-focused than the typical Western-style RPGs of the time. In 2015, IGN noted in an interview with Xenoblade Chronicles Xs development team that the label [...] "JRPG" [...] is most commonly used to refer to RPGs [...] "whose presentation mimics the design sensibilities" [...] of anime and manga, that it's [...] "typically the presentation and character archetypes" [...] that signal [...] "this is a JRPG." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Richie's death, Fusion is at {{a height}} of excellence. During this time, Babe and Amanda, who have renewed their friendship, develop a [...] "secret project" [...] which they think Kendall and Greenlee will approve, since Fusion is doing so well. The project {{turns out to be}} a {{fragrance}} designed for working women. Kendall refuses to support it, but Amanda offers to use part of her fortune to finance the fragrance. Kendall insults Babe for the working girl perfume being modeled after her, and this is when Amanda decides to call the perfume [...] "Bella." [...] Kendall and Greenlee let Amanda and Babe do the project on their own, and the perfume has high buzz. Amanda and Babe get <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> argument about which woman should be the promotional figure for Bella, in which Babe and Amanda want themselves on it. They ask Kendall, who could not care less, who then chooses Amanda. Amanda takes it as a compliment before Kendall says how the [...] "slutty" [...] look should appeal. Amanda organizes a launch party which goes well, except for Taylor Thompson killing Randi Morgan's pimp in the bathroom hallway. Things are working wonderfully, and JR and Babe decide to use Bella to launch her career, and they decide they should take over the company. They also begin to plan their next wedding and decide to have a second child. However, Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume. Greenlee later gets sick, but calls it the flu. When a wedding party arrives at P.V. Hospital, Angie Hubbard says that it is a toxin in Bella that is causing the sickness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration then shuts Fusion Cosmetics temporarily down. While Adam is encouraging lawsuits against Fusion, Babe resigns and tells the company to blame the Bella scandal on her. She also admits that she and JR were planning to take over. She had an ulterior motive, as she and JR are planning to move to San Diego anyway. However, they have to come back when Adam has the subpoenaed to the Bella trial. JR and Babe do not make it to the trial, as they are caught up in a series of tornadoes that strike Pine Valley. Babe sacrifices herself to keep Little Adam from dying, making her internal and external bleeding worse. While in the hospital, she asks JR to marry her. They cannot find a minister as Babe is running out of time before she loses her life, but they exchange vows, regardless, alone in the hospital's chapel. They kiss and declare that they made each other better people and that they love each other from the deepest parts of their souls; that their love will never stop, no matter what. After a light hug, Babe dies in JR's arms.|$|E
