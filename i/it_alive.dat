5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want to hear about this kind of history.

It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray fights strongly on hook-and-line {{and is thus}} {{popular with}} recreational anglers, who usually release <b>it</b> <b>alive.</b> This species is caught by intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries operating in Southeast Asia {{and parts of the}} Indian Ocean, using bottom trawls, gillnets and tangle nets, beach seines, and longlines. In particular, it is caught in substantial numbers by an Indonesian trawl fishery targeting wedgefishes in the Arafura Sea. The meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized, though this species is not a highly valued food fish. It also has applications in Chinese medicine, and its tail may be sold as a curio.|$|E
5|$|From around 1840, architects {{started to}} design wooden {{buildings}} {{in a new}} style, the so-called Swiss chalet style. The style and its name originated in Germany, where Swiss popular culture was much admired by the romanticists. Elements such as projecting roofs, verandas and emphasis on gables were inspired from Alpine vernacular buildings. But the style may more correctly be termed historicism in wood, a term introduced by Jens Christian Eldal. A number of residential, institutional, and commercial buildings were built in this style, characterized by ornate, projecting details. Railway stations and churches, designed by trained architects, were distributed all in rural districts and helped to make this style popular and to keep <b>it</b> <b>alive</b> in the vernacular tradition long after it went out of fashion among architects.|$|E
50|$|Cohen {{created the}} <b>It's</b> <b>Alive</b> series in 1974 {{when he made}} the film <b>It's</b> <b>Alive.</b> The film was {{eventually}} a moderate success - after a re-vamped advertising campaign - and went on to spawn two sequels, <b>It's</b> <b>Alive</b> II: <b>It</b> Lives Again (1978) and <b>It's</b> <b>Alive</b> III: Island of the Alive (1987).|$|R

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research {{the ecology of the}} surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions. Using Kalacoon as his base of operations, Beebe performed a novel type of study: methodically dissecting a small area of jungle, and all of the animals which inhabit it, {{from the top of the}} canopy to below the ground. In a second study, Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately a quarter mile (0.4km) square. During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a hoatzin, the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep <b>it</b> <b>alive</b> for the zoo during the trip back to New York.|$|E
5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support before the show was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back. He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked the fans for putting up a great fight to keep <b>it</b> <b>alive.</b> On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E
5|$|Tarnovo was {{captured}} by the Ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393. After the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 brought about {{the fall of the}} Vidin Tsardom, the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube. The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries. Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an inferior class of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and {{a small portion of the}} Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete Islamisation, and their culture was suppressed. Ottoman authorities established the Rum Millet, a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians. However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept <b>it</b> <b>alive,</b> and that helped it to survive as in some rural, remote areas, as well as in the militant Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country.|$|E

25|$|By {{taking part}} in the 1995 {{ceremony}} to commemorate the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the President of the ICRC, Cornelio Sommaruga, sought to show that the organization was fully aware of the gravity of The Holocaust and the need to keep the memory of <b>it</b> <b>alive,</b> so as to prevent any repetition of it. He paid tribute to all those who had suffered or lost their lives during the war and publicly regretted the past mistakes and shortcomings of the Red Cross with regard to the victims of the concentration camps.|$|E
25|$|Deer {{were the}} only animals held sacred to Artemis herself. On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, {{she fell in love}} with these creatures and held them sacred. Deer were also the first animals she captured. She caught five golden horned deer called Elaphoi Khrysokeroi and {{harnessed}} them to her chariot. The third labour of Heracles, commanded by Eurystheus, consisted of catching the Cerynitian Hind alive. Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return <b>it</b> <b>alive.</b> Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath.|$|E

Finally, Kau's fellow Taoist priest, Four Eyes, shows up by coincidence, and they manage to destroy the vampire by burning <b>it</b> <b>alive.</b> The film ends with Four Eyes realising that the vampires he is escorting have accidentally been destroyed in the fire as well.|$|E

25|$|All {{members of}} the family Sarcophagidae are larviparous or ovoviviparous. Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) gives live birth to larvae with the female {{retaining}} the egg case in her abdomen. Flesh flies are strongly attracted to carrion or dry flesh. The female has a strong desire to lay larvae on the flesh and have even been noted to larviposit on the sleeve of a garment that has been previously soiled with blood. Oldroyd states that the larvae of Sarcophaga spp are voracious and will take anything of animal origin be <b>it</b> <b>alive</b> or dead. A larva is forced out of the larvipositor usually head first and soon disappears into the food material. Once larvae are deposited as 1st stage instars, rapid development follows with 3rd instars usually being achieved by three to four days. Larviposition to adulthood generally takes around two weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{tarantula}} hawk’s namesake {{comes from}} its predation of tarantulas {{to raise their}} young. After mating, the female wasp will seek out a tarantula, either free ranging or in its burrow. After grappling with the tarantula, the wasp will deliver a powerful sting that essentially paralyzes the tarantula permanently, but keeps <b>it</b> <b>alive.</b> This allows the wasp to lay an egg that adheres to the spider’s abdomen. One tarantula is provisioned per egg. The egg is about 5 millimeters long, gently curved, and creamy white in color. The wasp will then drag the paralyzed tarantula along with the egg, sometimes up to 100 meters, to a cavity or burrow to be sealed. This dugout can be either dug by the wasp or be the burrow of the paralyzed spider. When the larva hatches, it will feed on the spider’s guts to completion, keeping the spider alive {{for as long as}} possible for freshness.|$|E
25|$|The Big Show wasn't quite {{big enough}} to put {{television}} in its place and keep it there. NBC cancelled the show after two seasons and a reported loss of $1 million, a major figure in those years. In fact, it was primarily because the program was unable to attract more advertisers than those who sustained the second half-hour segment (6:30-7:00pm) during the first season: RCA Victor, American Home Products/Whitehall Pharmacal's Anacin, and Liggett & Myers' Chesterfield cigarettes. The show's failure to pull the audience needed to keep <b>it</b> <b>alive</b> longer than two years might also {{have been due to}} the former NBC hits now nestling on rival CBS, including The Jack Benny Program (directly opposite The Big Show), Amos 'n' Andy and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. But The Big Show is remembered {{as one of the great}} final stands, at its best, of classic American old-time radio and---for its wit, colorful music and dramatics---as good as broadcast variety programming got on either medium.|$|E

25|$|It is both biochemically and {{medically}} {{interesting how}} tarantula hawk venom works. How can an essentially non-toxic venom that causes so much pain, described as blinding, debilitating, and shockingly electric by Schmidt, subside in only three minutes in humans? Only the bullet ant is ranked {{higher than the}} tarantula hawk’s sting on Schmidt’s Sting Pain Index. How does it permanently paralyze a tarantula, yet keep <b>it</b> <b>alive?</b> It is also evolutionarily interesting and significant how such a toxin evolved. Selection pressure by potential vertebrate predators would have favored individuals with painful venom components, but not vertebrate-lethal components. At the same time, selection pressure against venom lethality towards prey and subsequent loss of prey to spoilage would be very strong. The tarantula hawk’s venom is a specific, evolutionarily tailored cocktail of compounds best suited to the wasps’ needs. Studying tarantula hawk venom may help us gain insight into treating human problems like chronic pain from injury or disease.|$|E
25|$|The wolf plays a {{prominent}} role in the Serer religion's creation myth, where it is viewed as the first living creature created by Roog, the Supreme God and Creator. In one aspect, it can be viewed as an Earth-diver sent to Earth by Roog, in another, as a fallen prophet for disobeying the laws of the divine. The wolf was the first intelligent creature on earth, and it is believed that it will remain on earth after human beings have returned to the divine. The Serers believe that, not only does it know in advance who will die, but it traces the tracks in advance of those who will go to funerals. The movements of the wolf are carefully observed, because the animal is viewed as a seer who came from the transcendence and maintains links with it. Although believed to be rejected in the bush by other animals and deprived of its original intelligence, it is still respected because it dared to resist the supreme being who still keeps <b>it</b> <b>alive.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Apocalypse Wars, the Extraordinary X-Men {{are forced}} to travel to {{thousand}} of years into Earth's future in order to rescue Colossus {{and his team of}} young mutants after they were investigating the sudden appearance of six hundred new mutant signatures in Tokyo. Arriving into Earth's future, the X-Men found themselves in a destroyed New York City and soon discovered that at some point Apocalypse had risen and what remained of Earth after his ascension became the Omega World, a huge structure composed of bubble worlds. The ones who survived the Great Trials lived on Omega World under Apocalypse's rule as he functioned as the Omega World's heart, keeping <b>it</b> <b>alive,</b> while his Horsemen functioned as its antibodies, cleansing the structure of anything that could harm their master. Omega World crumbled as the result of Apocalypse being fatally wounded by Nightcrawler. Storm was forced to take Apocalypse back to the present with them so they could undone the transformation of Colossus, who was turned into a Horseman, however, before he could restore Colossus back to normal, Apocalypse instead teleported him away, sending him to Clan Akkaba. Its left unknown if this Apocalypse was actually a future version Evan or Apocalypse himself using a new host body.|$|E

500|$|Another {{interesting}} {{recovery method}} conservationists and biologists are using is called Fish Transportation.

This method raises controversy to the effectiveness and costs, since this method is extremely expensive, almost costing $15million.
