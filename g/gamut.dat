5|$|The {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and its completion in 1977 had an immense effect on Alaska, the United States, {{and the rest of}} the world. Its impact has included economic, physical, and social repercussions running the <b>gamut</b> from life in small towns to the global oil market.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens {{flew the}} entire <b>gamut</b> of U.S. {{observation}} aircraft, from O-1 Bird Dogs, and U-17s, to T-28s and, eventually more modern O-2 Skymasters and OV-10 Broncos. Each Raven carried aloft a Laotian observer, who could provide almost immediate clearance for air strikes. On the ground, Laotian Forward Air Guides (FAGs) also called in for air support missions.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the <b>Gamut</b> Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The <b>Gamut</b> Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
40|$|Software {{has been}} {{developed}} to help engineers visualize the <b>gamuts</b> of color hardcopy devices. Software modules have been written so that color <b>gamuts</b> and color space transformations can be explored using a scientific visualization program. Tools have been created that allow the user to accentuate the differences between <b>gamuts</b> and {{to interact with the}} displayed data. The data flow architecture of the program makes it easy to add more color <b>gamuts</b> and to investigate additional color transformations...|$|R
40|$|The {{metameric}} mismatch {{limits for}} two industrial colorant sets, a set for Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene polymers {{and a set}} for an acrylic enamel paint system, were determined for a reference illuminant, D 65 and test illuminants of FS 42, FN 40, and Illuminant A. An overlap in color <b>gamuts</b> was found in all cases of similar test conditions between the two sets. Trends in the size, shape, and location of the <b>gamuts</b> were illustrated in 1976 CIE u 2 ̆ 7 v 2 ̆ 7 color space. The results show vastly dissimilar <b>gamuts</b> for {{all three of the}} test illuminants...|$|R
5000|$|Although the Adobe RGB (1998) {{working space}} clearly {{provides}} more colors to utilize, another factor {{to consider when}} choosing between color spaces is how each space influences {{the distribution of the}} image's bit depth. Color spaces with larger <b>gamuts</b> [...] "stretch" [...] the bits over a broader region of colors, whereas smaller <b>gamuts</b> concentrate these bits within a narrow region.|$|R
5|$|Research at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson {{into contact}} with medical {{researchers}} investigating the <b>gamut</b> of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance {{was the work of}} National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium 2 {{processor}} {{was released}} in 2002, and was marketed for enterprise servers rather than for the whole <b>gamut</b> of high-end computing. The first Itanium2, code-named McKinley, was jointly developed by HP and Intel. It relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem. McKinley contains 221 million transistors (of which 25 million are for logic), measured 19.5mm by 21.6mm (421mm2) and was fabricated in a 180nm, bulk CMOS process with six layers of aluminium metallization.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010–2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. Among {{the groups}} are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations run the <b>gamut</b> from sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple method to compare the colour <b>gamuts</b> of different industries (printing, textiles, plastics, etc.) based on representing the reproduced colours in constant lightness L* and hue hab* planes. This method allows the analysis of those aspects related to the comparison between the colour <b>gamuts</b> of different industries and the MacAdam limits and also of those aspects related to how the colour solid is filled, whether homogeneously or leaving certain unfilled regions for commercial or design reasons. In particular, we have compared the colour <b>gamuts</b> of three printing technologies (laser, inkjet and offset) with the same class of paper and characterization chart. In this comparison the laser printer {{has proved to be}} the best of three printing devices...|$|R

5|$|HDMI 1.3 was {{released}} on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340MHz (10.2Gbit/s). Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16Gbit/s (1920×1080 at 120Hz or 2560×1440 at 60Hz). It added support for 10bpc, 12bpc, and 16bpc color depth (30, 36, and 48bit/px), called deep color. It also added support for the xvYCC color space, {{in addition to the}} Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining color <b>gamut</b> boundaries. It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers. It incorporates automatic audio syncing (audio video sync) capability. It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74.25 MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340 MHz. It also added the new type C Mini connector for portable devices.|$|E
5|$|The diverse {{linguistic}} and religious ethnicities that are native to Karnataka, combined with their long histories, have contributed immensely to the varied cultural {{heritage of the}} state. Apart from Kannadigas, Karnataka is home to Tuluvas, Kodavas and Konkanis. Minor populations of Tibetan Buddhists and tribes like the Soligas, Yeravas, Todas and Siddhis also live in Karnataka. The traditional folk arts cover the entire <b>gamut</b> of music, dance, drama, storytelling by itinerant troupes, etc. Yakshagana of Malnad and coastal Karnataka, a classical dance drama, {{is one of the}} major theatrical forms of Karnataka. Contemporary theatre culture in Karnataka remains vibrant with organisations like Ninasam, Ranga Shankara, Rangayana and Prabhat Kalavidaru continuing to build on the foundations laid by Gubbi Veeranna, T. P. Kailasam, B. V. Karanth, K V Subbanna, Prasanna and others. Veeragase, Kamsale, Kolata and Dollu Kunitha are popular dance forms. The Mysore style of Bharatanatya, nurtured and popularised by the likes of the legendary Jatti Tayamma, continues to hold sway in Karnataka, and Bangalore also enjoys an eminent place as one of the foremost centres of Bharatanatya.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of Terminator 2 spanned 171 days between October 9, 1990, and March 28, 1991, {{during which}} the crew filmed at the Mojave Desert before visiting 20 different sites throughout California and New Mexico. These locations ran the <b>gamut</b> from the crowded Santa Monica Place shopping mall, where the two Terminators converged on John, with brief shots coming from the Westfield MainPlace and Los Cerritos Center, to flood control channels in the San Fernando Valley, which played host to the chase between the Terminators and John; a river had to be redirected to allow filming on the otherwise wet channels. Cameron and his crew also filmed Terminator 2 at The Corral Bar and the Lake View Medical Center (known as Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in the film), both located in Lake View Terrace. The external shots of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation were filmed on location at an office building {{on the corner of}} Gateway Boulevard and Bayside Parkway in Fremont, California. Working with up to 1,000 crew members, the production team oversaw numerous stunts and chase sequences, the most notable of which took place on the Los Angeles–Long Beach Terminal Island Freeway, prior to Terminator 2s climax. Tenmiles (16km) of electric cables were laid to illuminate the night-time chase, which saw a full-scale helicopter crash, a sliding tanker, and other elaborate paraphernalia.|$|E

25|$|It {{can be seen}} that, given three real sources, {{these sources}} cannot cover the <b>gamut</b> of human vision. Geometrically stated, there are no three points within the <b>gamut</b> that form a {{triangle}} that includes the entire gamut; or more simply, the <b>gamut</b> of human vision is not a triangle.|$|E
25|$|The diagram {{represents}} {{all of the}} chromaticities {{visible to}} the average person. These are shown in color and this region is called the <b>gamut</b> of human vision. The <b>gamut</b> of all visible chromaticities on the CIE plot is the tongue-shaped or horseshoe-shaped figure shown in color. The curved edge of the <b>gamut</b> is called the spectral locus and corresponds to monochromatic light (each point representing a pure hue of a single wavelength), with wavelengths listed in nanometers. The straight edge on {{the lower part of}} the <b>gamut</b> is called the line of purples. These colors, although they are on the border of the <b>gamut,</b> have no counterpart in monochromatic light. Less saturated colors appear in the interior of the figure with white at the center.|$|E
25|$|CRI merely {{measures}} the faithfulness of any illuminant to an ideal source {{with the same}} CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, {{due to a lack}} of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of the <b>gamut</b> area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500nbsp&K to the <b>gamut</b> area for the test source. 6500nbsp&K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even distribution of energy over the visible spectrum and hence high <b>gamut</b> area. This normalizes the multiplication factor.|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} a simple method to compare the colour <b>gamuts</b> of different industries (printing, textiles, plastics, etc.) based on representing the reproduced colours in constant lightness L* and hue hab* planes. This method allows the analysis of those aspects related to the comparison between the colour <b>gamuts</b> of different industries and the MacAdam and Pointer limits and also of those aspects related to how the colour solid is filled, whether homogeneously or leaving certain unfilled regions for commercial or design reasons. In particular, the authors have compared the colour <b>gamuts</b> of three printing technologies (electrophotography or laser, inkjet and offset) with the same class of paper and characterisation chart, and in this comparison the laser printer {{has proved to be}} the best of three printing devices. On the other hand, the authors have checked that gravure technology is better than the other ones due to the substrate nature used at gravure technology.

25|$|A {{chromaticity}} diagram can illustrate the <b>gamut</b> of different choices of primaries, for example showing which colors are lost (and gained) {{if you use}} RGB for subtractive color mixing (instead of CMY).|$|E
25|$|The precise set {{of primary}} colors {{to be used}} in a {{specific}} color application depends on <b>gamut</b> requirements as well as on application-specific constraints such as cost, power consumption, lightfastness, mixing behavior, etc.|$|E
25|$|Red, green, {{and blue}} light are the ideal {{primaries}} for additive color mixing since primary lights with those hues provide the largest triangular chromaticity <b>gamuts.</b> Small red, green, and blue elements in electronic displays mix additively {{in the eye}} at an appropriate viewing distance to synthesize compelling colored images.|$|R
50|$|Since RGB and CMYK {{spaces are}} both device-dependent spaces, {{there is no}} simple or general {{conversion}} formula that converts between them. Conversions are generally done through color management systems, using color profiles that describe the spaces being converted. Nevertheless, the conversions cannot be exact, particularly where these spaces have different <b>gamuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The color carmine is a {{saturated}} red. In its pigment form {{it mostly}} contains {{the red light}} with wavelengths longer than 600 nm, i.e. it {{is close to the}} extreme spectral red. This places it far beyond standard <b>gamuts</b> (both RGB and CMYK), and given RGB value is a poor approximation only.|$|R
25|$|The exact colors {{chosen for}} {{additive}} primaries are a technological compromise between the available phosphors (including considerations such as cost and power usage) {{and the need}} for large chromaticity <b>gamut.</b> The ITU-R BT.709-5/sRGB primaries are typical.|$|E
