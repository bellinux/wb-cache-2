40|$|Electro-osmotic {{dewatering}} (EOD) of 9. 1 wt % bentonite slurry {{was investigated}} using a stationary and rotating anode. The rotational speed varied from 0 to 300 rpm. Excessive slurry {{is necessary to}} load beyond the anode initially to maintain good contact between the anode and the <b>dewatered</b> <b>slurry.</b> The water removed from the slurry increased significantly with the rotational speed initially and reached a plateau at 240 rpm. This increase {{is found to be}} due to the "falling off" of the dry cake from the rotating anode. The average solid content of the cake in the chamber after EOD can be 24. 6 wt % with the anode rotating at 240 rpm and 3 times excessive initial loading of slurry. This solid content is 70. 8 % higher than that obtained using a stationary stainless steel anode. When a pin was inserted beneath the rotating anode, an optimal cake thickness of 5 mm was found in terms of water removal. The energy consumption for the process is < 20 % of the latent heat of water evaporation...|$|E
50|$|Washing {{is largely}} {{restricted}} to the upper portions where the cake surface is nearly horizontal in orientation, which occurs at {{the temperature of the}} feed. The ceramic filter uses a sintered alumina disc to <b>dewater</b> <b>slurry</b> under low vacuum. The dewatering occurs by drawing water from the slurry by capillary action. This ensures that no air or particles are drawn into the filter medium to cause blockage. However, if too much wash water is applied then it can cascade down the cake and into the feed trough, where it merely dilutes the slurry.|$|R
40|$|High {{sedimentation}} rates, good supernatant {{clarity and}} compact consolidation of valuable mineral slurries and waste tailings {{are the main}} requirements for effective dewatering. The current conventional flocculant-mediated and gravity-assisted thickening processes used in industry are far from being efficient in terms of maximising pulp water recovery. The present work investigates an unconventional approach using anionic, highly cross-linked polyacrylate, superabsorbent polymer to <b>dewater</b> <b>slurries</b> of three, unflocculated and flocculated, low-grade nickel (Ni) laterites ores (goethitic, siliceous goethite and saprolitic). The superabsorbent (SAB) sealed in a water permeable polyester bag was applied over 24 h contact time at 1 – 5 wt. ...|$|R
50|$|Solid-bowl {{centrifuge}} is {{used for}} dewatering the coal waste slurry along with plate-and-frame filter press in coal manufacturing to <b>dewater</b> the <b>slurry</b> before being disposed of. The slurry feed was attained from the underflow of a functioning bituminous coal-cleaning thickener device. As for the waste stream, it is usually disposed of into slurry cells or deserted underground mine site if available, or more commonly in slurry impoundments.|$|R
50|$|Filter presses are {{commonly}} used to <b>dewater</b> high-solids <b>slurries</b> in metal processing plants, one of the press filter technology that could deliver the job is the Rotary Pressure Filter method, which provides continuous production in a single unit, where filtration is directed via pressure. However, in cases where solids concentration in high-solids slurries is too high (50%+), {{it is better to}} handle these slurries using vacuum filtration, such as a continuous Indexing Vacuum Belt Filter, since high concentration of solids in slurries will increase pressure and if pressure is too high, the equipment might be damaged and/or less efficient operation.|$|R
50|$|Following treatment, {{a portion}} of the carbon and biomass slurry is wasted to solids handling. These solids can be wasted and {{disposed}} of as a <b>slurry,</b> <b>dewatered</b> to a compact, stable cake, or pumped as a slurry to a wet air oxidation unit for further processing to regenerate the carbon and destroy the biological solids.|$|R
50|$|An Ultrasonic foil {{is part of}} the {{drainage}} table section of paper machines. A series of hydrofoil blades (called foils) create pressure/vacuum pulses that <b>dewater</b> the fibre/water <b>slurry</b> (called stock) on a moving conveyor belt (the wire). Flexible ceramic foils have been used for years, but ultrasonic foils produce paper of higher quality. High power ultrasonics create millions of pressure pulses from imploding cavitation bubbles which keep the fibres apart, giving them a more uniform distribution. This ends up in better fibre formation, stronger paper and smoother paper surfaces.|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of cerium (and possibly other rare earth elements) from the spent glass-polishing slurries is rather {{difficult because of}} a high resistance of polishing-grade cerium oxide toward common digestion agents. It was shown that cerium may be extracted from the spent polishing slurries by leaching with strong mineral acids {{in the presence of}} reducing agents; the solution may be used directly for the preparation of a ceria-based reactive sorbent. A mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide was effective in the digestion of partially <b>dewatered</b> glass-polishing <b>slurry.</b> After the removal of undissolved particles, cerous carbonate was precipitated by gaseous NH 3 and CO 2. Cerium oxide was prepared by a thermal decomposition of the carbonate precursor in an open crucible and tested as reactive sorbent for the degradation of highly toxic organophosphate compounds. The samples annealed at the optimal temperature of approximately 400 °C exhibited a good degradation efficiency toward the organophosphate pesticide fenchlorphos and the nerve agents soman and VX. The extraction/precipitation procedure recovers approximately 70 % of cerium oxide from the spent polishing slurry. The presence of minor amounts of lanthanum does not disturb the degradation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines is {{investigating}} {{a method of}} dewatering flocculated fine-particle waste that involves treating the waste with a high molecular-weight polymer such as polyethylene oxide (PED) followed by dewatering on a static screen and/or in a trommel. Dilution of the polymer solution used for dewatering {{and use of the}} ion-exchanged form of the montmorillonite clay were found to be major factors determining the amount of polymer required to <b>dewater</b> clay-containing <b>slurries.</b> The amount of polymer, A, required to dewater ion-exchanged montmorillonite can be described by the equation, An = kC + b where n, k, and b are empirical constants and C is the concentration of the polymer solution used for dewatering. Clays that require large amounts of polymer for dewatering also dewater to a lower solids content. The concentration of the polymer solution is important because it affects the radius of the polymer coil in solution and hence its ease of transfer to a bridging configuration by shear. The constant, n, a function of the charge to hydrated radius of the exchange ion, relates to the strength of the bond between the polymer and the surface of the clay through a water bridge. The constant k is related to the hydrated radi-us for sodium or to the unhydrated radius for the other exchange ions...|$|R
5000|$|In non-recirculating systems, the {{discharged}} hot liquid (usually water) {{is treated}} as a waste stream. In this case fresh cool water is used {{to make up the}} loss. Environmental considerations are making such [...] "once-through" [...] systems increasingly rare.These simple, but highly reliable pumps have a variety of industrial applications. They are used to maintain condenser vacuum on large steam-turbine generator sets by removing incondensable gasses, where vacuum levels are typically 30-50 mbar. They are used on paper machines to <b>dewater</b> the pulp <b>slurry</b> and to extract water from press felts. Another application is the vacuum forming of molded paper-pulp products (egg cartons and other packaging). Other applications include soil remediation, where contaminated ground water is drawn from wells by vacuum. In petroleum refining, vacuum distillation also makes use of liquid-ring vacuum pumps to provide the process vacuum. Liquid-ring compressors are often used in vapor recovery systems.|$|R
40|$|Woven monofilament, multifilament, {{and spun}} yarn filter media {{have long been}} the {{standard}} media in liquid filtration equipment. While the energy for a solid-liquid separation process {{is determined by the}} engineering work, it is the interface between the slurry and the equipment - the filter media - that greatly affects the performance characteristics of the unit operation. Those skilled in the art are well aware that a poorly designed filter medium may endanger the whole operation, whereas well-performing filter media can make the operation smooth and economical. As the mineral and pulp producers seek to produce ever finer and more refined fractions of their products, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to <b>dewater</b> <b>slurries</b> with average particle sizes around 1 ¿m using conventional, high-capacity filtration equipment. Furthermore, the surface properties of the media must not allow sticky and adhesive particles to adhere to the media. The aim of this thesis was to test how the dirt-repellency, electrical resistance and highpressure filtration performance of selected woven filter media can be improved by modifying the fabric or yarn with coating, chemical treatment and calendering. The results achieved by chemical surface treatments clearly show that the woven media surface properties can be modified to achieve lower electrical resistance and improved dirt-repellency. The main challenge with the chemical treatments is the abrasion resistance and, while the experimental results indicate that the treatment is sufficiently permanent to resist standard weathering conditions, they may still prove to be inadequately strong in terms of actual use. From the pressure filtration studies in this work, it seems obvious that the conventional woven multifilament fabrics still perform surprisingly well against the coated media in terms of filtrate clarity and cake build-up. Especially in cases where the feed slurry concentration was low and the pressures moderate, the conventional media seemed to outperform the coated media. In the cases where thefeed slurry concentration was high, the tightly woven media performed well against the monofilament reference fabrics, but seemed to do worse than some of the coated media. This result is somewhat surprising in that the high initial specific resistance of the coated media would suggest that the media will blind more easily than the plain woven media. The results indicate, however, that it is actually the woven media that gradually clogs during the coarse of filtration. In conclusion, it seems obvious that there is a pressure limit above which the woven media looses its capacity to keep the solid particles from penetrating the structure. This finding suggests that for extreme pressures the only foreseeable solution is the coated fabrics supported by a strong enough woven fabric to hold thestructure together. Having said that, the high pressure filtration process seems to follow somewhat different laws than the more conventional processes. Based on the results, {{it may well be that}} the role of the cloth is most of all to support the cake, and the main performance-determining factor is a long life time. Measuring the pore size distribution with a commercially available porometer gives a fairly accurate picture of the pore size distribution of a fabric, but failsto give insight into which of the pore sizes is the most important in determining the flow through the fabric. Historically air, and sometimes water, permeability measures have been the standard in evaluating media filtration performance including particle retention. Permeability, however, is a function of a multitudeof variables and does not directly allow the estimation of the effective pore size. In this study a new method for estimating the effective pore size and open pore area in a densely woven multifilament fabric was developed. The method combines a simplified equation of the electrical resistance of fabric with the Hagen-Poiseuille flow equation to estimate the effective pore size of a fabric and the total open area of pores. The results are validated by comparison to the measured values of the largest pore size (Bubble point) and the average pore size. The results show good correlation with measured values. However, the measured and estimated values tend to diverge in high weft density fabrics. This phenomenon is thought to be a result of a more tortuous flow path of denser fabrics, and could most probably be cured by using another value for the tortuosity factor...|$|R
