40|$|In {{the last}} few decades {{experimental}} aesthetics studies mainly focused on objective features <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> in attempts to identify determinants of aesthetic preference. However, recent research has addressed the role of evaluative or affective meaning in aesthetic preference <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Here we examined underlying structure of evaluative meaning for three types <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> and the relations between obtained dimensions and aesthetic preference <b>of</b> <b>stimuli</b> from different <b>sensory</b> modalities. In three experiments participants assessed visual, auditory and gustatory stimuli on the aesthetic preference scale and on three instruments involving evaluative attributes people usually use to describe their subjective experience of visual, auditory and gustatory domains. The results of principal component analysis showed the same triple factorial structure for different sensory modalities: affective evaluation (pleasant, positive, relaxing), arousal (impressive, powerful, interesting), and cognitive evaluation (familiar, meaningful, regular). Obtained evaluative dimensions explained most of the variance in aesthetic preference for all three types <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In particular, there was strong relation of affective and cognitive evaluation with aesthetic preference, while arousal demonstrated weaker relation. Finally, we proposed the view of aesthetic preference <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> based on three underlying dimensions of affective meaning...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} activity underlying cognition {{that plays}} an important role in creativity and discovery is the integration <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli,</b> such as visual or acoustic stimuli, into a system <b>of</b> concepts. A <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulus,</b> for example a picture, is often considered as a model such that reasoning with these <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> is thought to be a kind of model-based reasoning [Johnson-Laird, 1983]. We claim, however, that <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> such as visual patterns can only be considered as models when we take the principle of perception into account. In fact, we believe that any <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> can theoretically be interpreted in various ways resulting in dierent models and that the perceived model <b>of</b> a <b>sensory</b> <b>stimulus</b> is the one which satis es the principles of human perception. The interesting point is that analogical reasoning, a certain kind of model-based reasoning, is itself thought to play an important role in human perception and thus in determining the perceived models <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> that are reason with. In particular, we will show that the perceived model <b>of</b> a <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> is partly determined on the basis of analogical reasoning. This implies that the resemblance <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> which is the basis of an argument by analogy is not a simple subtraction of the models of those stimuli in separation, but created hand in hand with the process of analogical reasoning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{cells in}} the body possess a single primary cilium. These cilia are key {{transducers}} <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and defects in cilia {{have been linked to}} several diseases. Evidence suggests that some transduction <b>of</b> <b>sensory</b> <b>stimuli</b> by the primary cilium depends on ion-conducting channels. However, the tiny size of the cilium has been a critical barrier to understanding its electrical properties. We report a novel method that allows sensitive, repeatable electrical recordings from primary cilia. Adherent cells were grown on small, spherical beads that could be easily moved within the recording chamber. In this configuration, an entire cilium could be pulled into a recording microelectrode. Results In 47 % of attempts, suction resulted in a seal with high input resistance. Single channels could be recorded while the cilium remained attached to the cell. When the pipette was raised into the air, the cell body was pulled off at the air-bath interface. The pipette retained the cilium and could then be immersed in various solutions that bathed the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. In excised cilia, ionic currents through ciliary channels were modulated by cytoplasmic Ca 2 + and transmembrane voltage. Conclusions Ciliary recording is a direct way to learn the effects of second messengers and voltage changes on ciliary transduction channels. </p...|$|R
