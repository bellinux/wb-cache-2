500|$|Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, {{discusses}} {{some economic}} {{issues in this}} episode. Just before Jerry's dare about the egg roll, Elaine says, [...] "You know, it's not fair people are seated first come first served. It {{should be based on}} who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate." [...] Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>dinner?</b> Plan Nine from Outer Space – one night only, the big screen! My hands are tied!" ...|$|E
