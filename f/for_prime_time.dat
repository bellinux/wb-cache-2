25|$|CBS {{announced}} in early 1967 {{that a number}} of game shows, including What's My Line?, were to be canceled {{at the end of the}} season. Bennett Cerf wrote that the network had decided that game shows were no longer suitable <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time,</b> and that the news was broken by The New York Times on February 14 before anyone involved with the show was notified.|$|E
25|$|CBS' {{first year}} of Major League Baseball postseason {{coverage}} in general, proved to be problematic for the network. First and foremost, none of the teams involved in the ALCS (Boston and Oakland), NLCS (Cincinnati and Pittsburgh), and World Series (Cincinnati and Oakland) involved teams from baseball's largest media markets. This more than likely, helped reduce playoff ratings by 9.4% <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time</b> games and 3.4% for weekend daytime games. This was below the levels of the playoffs the year before, when they aired on NBC.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand to}} {{broadcast}} Monday Night Football games live across the United States over ABC {{was difficult to}} reconcile with other prime time programming, which is usually set to begin at a certain local time regardless of time zone. On the East Coast, with MNF beginning at 9:00p.m. Eastern Time, there was an hour of primetime in which to schedule regular programming. However, on the West Coast, the games lasted from 6:00 to 9:30p.m. Pacific Time (or {{in the case of}} Seattle and Portland from 1970 to 1995, 7:00 to 10:30p.m.), leaving little or no time for additional network programming on Monday. As a result, network programs scheduled <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time</b> on the East Coast were broadcast at various hours on the West Coast. Most affiliates pushed the network shows to immediately after the game; however, Los Angeles owned-and-operated station KABC-TV postponed them until 10:00p.m. from at least the mid-1990s until 2005 to show trivia contests and other sports shows produced locally (the longest-tenured such show was Monday Night Live, hosted by sports anchor Todd Donoho). Meanwhile, KOMO, one of the stations that tape-delayed MNF in most cases, broadcast new episodes of the sitcom Coach on Saturday afternoons (usually reserved, coincidentally enough, for college football telecasts; much of the series took place on a fictional college campus). Except for Seattle and Portland from 1970 to 1995, ABC World News Tonight was routinely preempted on most West Coast affiliates, though the ABC network-owned stations (e.g. Los Angeles) aired the program earlier in the afternoon.|$|E

[...] It was Arizona State's first Thanksgiving Day game and USC's 20th, though its first since 1938. [...] The game attracted a number of celebrities, including former USC Heisman-winners Marcus Allen and Matt Leinart, who was joined by Arizona Cardinals teammate Larry Fitzgerald, Heisman-winner Gino Torretta, Bob Davie and Charles Barkley; it also included a halftime performance by singer Little Richard. In honor of the holiday, the Sun Devils added a turkey leg to the end of Sparty's pitchfork painted {{at the center of the}} field.|$|E
500|$|Following Mean Girls, Lohan {{spent several}} years living out of hotels in Los Angeles, of which two years were spent at the infamous Chateau Marmont, where comedy actor John Belushi, himself a former [...] "Not Ready <b>For</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Time</b> Actor," [...] had died. In late 2007, after {{settling}} down in a more permanent residence, she explained that she [...] "didn't want to be alone" [...] but that [...] "it wasn't {{a way of life}} ... not very consistent." [...] She had a series of car accidents that were widely reported, in August 2004, October 2005, and November 2006, when she suffered minor injuries because a paparazzo who was following her for a photograph hit her car.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{controversial}} when broadcast because NBC thought that masturbation {{was not a}} topic suitable <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time</b> television. As a result, the word [...] "masturbation" [...] is never used in the episode. Instead, the subject is described using a series of euphemisms, while {{the meaning of the}} subject is still made clear to the audience. The writer of the episode, Larry David, won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Comedy Series for his work on the episode. One of the euphemisms used in the episode is [...] "master of my domain," [...] said by a character when still in the contest. It has since become a catchphrase in popular culture, although it is not always used in reference to masturbation.|$|E

50|$|Project <b>PRIME</b> <b>TIME</b> was {{proposed}} in 1981 by former Indiana Governor Robert D. Orr. The {{intent was to}} upgrade the quality of early school experiences by reducing class sizes. The Indiana General Assembly appropriated $300,000 for the 1981-82 and 1982-82 school years to pilot <b>PRIME</b> <b>TIME</b> in nine schools, grades K-3, across Indiana. In 1983, the General Assembly increased <b>PRIME</b> <b>TIME's</b> funding <b>for</b> 1983-84 and 1984-85 to $2 million. This increased funding allowed <b>for</b> <b>PRIME</b> <b>TIME's</b> expansion in first grade. The program was expanded to second grade in 1985 and {{by the fall of}} 1987, it covered kindergarten through third grade.|$|R

Premier events, including ice hockey and figure skating, were scheduled <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time</b> and the Games were lengthened to 16 days from the previous 12 to ensure three weekends of coverage. [...] However, a significant downturn in advertising revenue for sporting events resulted in ABC forecasting significant financial losses on the Games. [...] Calgary organizers appreciated their fortunate timing in signing the deal. King described {{the timing of the}} contract with ABC as [...] "the passing of the sun and the moon at the right time for Calgary." [...] ABC lost an estimated $60 million, and broadcast rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics were later sold to the CBS network for $243 million, a 20% reduction compared to Calgary.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Lohan had two lead roles. The first film, Disney's teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, {{earned a}} {{domestic}} box office total of $29million, with Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo commenting {{that it was}} [...] "well above expectations as it was strictly for young girls." [...] But the film did not meet with critical acclaim. Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "though still a promising star, Lohan {{will have to do}} a little penance before she's forgiven for Confessions." [...] Her second lead role that year, in the teen comedy Mean Girls, marked Lohan's first movie independent of Disney. Based in part on the non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes, the film stars Lohan as a previously homeschooled 16-year-old learning to navigate the social cliques of a public high school. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $129million worldwide and, according to Brandon Gray, [...] "cementing her status as the new teen movie queen." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "Lohan is sensitive and appealing, a solid locus for audience sympathy." [...] David Rooney from Variety said that [...] "Lohan displays plenty of charm, verve and deft comic timing." [...] Lohan received four awards at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards for Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, including Breakout Movie Star. Mean Girls also earned her two awards at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. With Mean Girls, Lohan's public profile was raised significantly. Vanity Fair described how she became a household name. Paparazzi began following her and her love life and partying became frequent targets of gossip sites and the tabloid media. Following Mean Girls, which was scripted by former [...] "Not Ready <b>For</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Time</b> Actress" [...] Tina Fey and featured several other veterans of Saturday Night Live's [...] "Not Ready <b>For</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Time</b> Company," [...] Lohan hosted the show three times between 2004 and 2006. In 2004, when Lohan was 17, she became the youngest host of the MTV Movie Awards and in 2006 she hosted the 2006 World Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News, who did {{not like}} [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", felt [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] proved the series could be funny. He {{specifically}} complimented the episode's commentary on American consumerism. Simon wrote, [...] "It's all very bitter social satire, and if it weren't on Comedy Central, believe me, no one in networkland would think it ready <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time.</b> And you know what else? It's funny." [...] Likewise, The Washington Post critic Tom Shales strongly criticized [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", but said the second episode was funny and included [...] "cleverly intertwined" [...] plot-lines. Shales said, [...] " [...] suggests the show may be an attempt at satire and not just poopy humor ... Yes, it's still sick and still twisted, but somehow this episode at least appears to have some comic ingenuity behind it, whereas the first was just a smutfest." [...] In 2006, [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was identified by Winnipeg Free Press {{as one of the}} ten most memorable South Park episodes, and ranked twelfth in a list of the top 25 greatest Cartman moments, as determined by voters on the Comedy Central website. The Daily Record in Scotland listed the episode's ending, and the [...] "Beefcake!" [...] line, as one of the six most memorable moments in the series.|$|E

2500|$|Radner gained name {{recognition}} {{as one of}} the original [...] "Not Ready <b>for</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Time</b> Players", the freshman group on the first season of Saturday Night Live. She was the first performer cast for the show, co-wrote much of the material that she performed, and collaborated with Alan Zweibel (of the show's writing staff) on sketches that highlighted her recurring characters. Between 1975 and 1980, she created characters such as obnoxious personal advice expert Roseanne Roseannadanna and [...] "Baba Wawa", a parody of Barbara Walters. After Radner's death, Walters stated in an interview that Radner was the [...] "first person to make fun of news anchors, now it's done all the time." [...] Radner's lampooning of news anchors did owe something to Monty Python, however, which started doing that several years before Saturday Night Live.|$|E

2500|$|Much {{publicity}} {{followed the}} controversial episode, [...] "The Contest", an Emmy Award-winning episode written by co-creator Larry David, whose subject matter was considered inappropriate <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time</b> network TV. To circumvent this taboo, the word [...] "masturbation" [...] was never {{used in the}} script, instead substituted for {{by a variety of}} oblique references. Midway through that season, Seinfeld was moved from its original 9:00p.m. time slot on Wednesdays to 9:30p.m. on Thursdays, following Cheers again, which gave the show even more popularity. Ratings also sparked the move, as Tim Allen's sitcom Home Improvement on ABC had aired {{at the same time and}} Improvement kept beating Seinfeld in the ratings. NBC moved the series after Ted Danson announced the end of Cheers and Seinfeld quickly surpassed the ratings of the 9:00p.m. Cheers reruns that spring. The show won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993, beating out its family-oriented, time-slot competitor Home Improvement, which was only in its second season on fellow network ABC.|$|E

[...] The network also said, [...] "Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident". A statement from CBS read, [...] "We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended." [...] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands [...] "what a difference one percent can make". NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the [...] "tasteful, first-class entertainment" [...] the league expected. FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident [...] "a new low <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>time</b> television". Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, [...] "We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime."
