50|$|Parity's {{first major}} success began in 1993 under its {{original}} name, when CESPA member Cyril Richardson, an asthmatic, took {{the government to}} court over sex discrimination in entitlement <b>for</b> free <b>prescriptions.</b> Eventually, in 1995 the European Court ruled that it was unlawful to charge men aged 60-65 <b>for</b> <b>prescriptions</b> when they were free to women. As a result, men now receive benefits {{in the order of}} an estimated £30 million per annum. Additionally, £10 million in charges was refunded to those who had wrongly paid <b>for</b> <b>prescriptions</b> in the previous 3 months before the ruling.|$|R

He was fitted <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> goggles, which he continued to wear throughout his career. Angels' MLB players of the time did not remember working with Ramírez; catcher José Molina suggested that Ramírez must not have been in the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons <b>for</b> <b>prescription,</b> lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E

25|$|The CCSPS {{heart attack}} and {{cardiovascular}} death outcomes appear {{to be better than}} what has been reported <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> statin drugs.

25|$|Currently, {{people with}} Medicare can get {{prescription}} drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or through the standalone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices it pays to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system of paying <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs undermines the government’s bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage.|$|E
25|$|Joseph {{provided}} {{well for}} their family, {{but he was}} unfaithful. His affairs included one with Gloria Swanson.

In turning a blind eye to her husband's affairs, Rose depended heavily on medication. Ronald Kessler found records <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> tranquilizers Seconal, Placidyl, Librium, and Dalmane to relieve Rose's nervousness and stress, and Lomotil, Bentyl, Librax, and Tagamet for her stomach.|$|E

25|$|Telepharmacy is the {{delivery}} of pharmaceutical care via telecommunications to patients in locations where {{they may not have}} direct contact with a pharmacist. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of telemedicine, as implemented in the field of pharmacy. Telepharmacy services include drug therapy monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs, and monitoring of formulary compliance with the aid of teleconferencing or videoconferencing. Remote dispensing of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{are usually}} given {{a course of}} {{antibiotic}} and anti-inflammatory eye drops. These are continued in the weeks following surgery. Patients are told to rest and are given dark eyeglasses to protect their eyes from bright lights and occasionally protective goggles to prevent rubbing of the eyes when asleep and to reduce dry eyes. They also are required to moisturize the eyes with preservative-free tears and follow directions <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> drops. Occasionally after the procedure a bandage contact lens is placed to aid the healing, and typically removed after 3–4 days. Patients should be adequately informed by their surgeons {{of the importance of}} proper post-operative care to minimize the risk of complications.|$|E
25|$|Of the Medicare {{beneficiaries}} {{who are not}} dual {{eligible for}} both Medicare (around 20%) and Medicaid or that do not receive supplemental insurance via a former employer (40%) or a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan (about 30%), almost all elect to purchase a type of private supplemental insurance coverage, called a Medigap plan (20%), to help fill in the financial holes in Original Medicare (Part A and B). Note that the percentages add up to over 100% because many beneficiaries {{have more than one}} type of supplement. These Medigap insurance policies are standardized by CMS, but are sold and administered by private companies. Some Medigap policies sold before 2006 may include coverage <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs. Medigap policies sold after the introduction of Medicare Part D on January 1, 2006 are prohibited from covering drugs. Medicare regulations prohibit a Medicare beneficiary from being sold both a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan and a private Medigap Policy. As with public Part C health plans, private Medigap policies are only available to beneficiaries who are already signed up for benefits from Original Medicare Part A and Part B. These policies are regulated by state insurance departments rather than the federal government though CMS outlines what the various Medigap plans must cover at a minimum. Therefore, the types and prices of Medigap policies vary widely from state to state and the degree of underwriting, open enrollment and guaranteed issue also varies widely from state to state.|$|E
