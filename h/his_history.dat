5|$|Bede's scriptural commentaries {{employed}} the allegorical {{method of interpretation}} and <b>his</b> <b>history</b> includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the materials in <b>his</b> <b>history.</b> Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of Early Medieval scholars.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of what {{is known}} of Caligula comes from Suetonius and Cassius Dio. Suetonius wrote <b>his</b> <b>history</b> on Caligula 80 years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote <b>his</b> <b>history</b> over 180 years after Caligula's death. Cassius Dio's work is {{invaluable}} because it alone gives a loose chronology of Caligula's reign.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made <b>his</b> <b>History</b> of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike <b>his</b> <b>History</b> of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the Optics convinced Priestley to abandon <b>his</b> <b>history</b> of experimental philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hutchinson (Massachusetts royal {{governor}} in the early 1770s), in <b>his</b> <b>history</b> of Massachusetts, described Shute's tenure as governor as the most contentious since the Antinomian Controversy of the 1630s.|$|E
5|$|After {{a mental}} evaluation, a {{psychologist}} concluded Clemmons was competent {{to stand trial}} on the charges, which eliminated him {{as a candidate for}} involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on <b>his</b> <b>history</b> of failing to appear in court.|$|E

5|$|Also {{dating from}} this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183. Samuel Pegge in <b>his</b> <b>History</b> of Beauchief Abbey notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, {{who was one of the}} witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of <b>his</b> <b>history</b> for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, the Anti-Slavery Society {{was founded}} in Britain, {{dedicated}} to abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire; the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 represented the achievement of their goal.

5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in <b>his</b> <b>History</b> of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E
5|$|The {{grave in}} Abney Park was {{eventually}} surmounted by a memorial stone for Reed's {{family in the}} style of a Celtic cross, reflecting their connections to Ireland.

5|$|The late 5th-century Byzantine chronicler Zosimus's Nova Historia {{deals with}} the battle, and Julian's Gallic {{campaign}} in a summary fashion and adds little to Ammianus' account.

5|$|Alpha Flight's Northstar was {{the first}} major gay {{character}} in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics.
