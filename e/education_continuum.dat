40|$|Introduction: Lifelong {{learning}} {{is an integral}} part of health professionals’ maintenance of competence. Several studies have examined the orientation toward lifelong learning at various stages of the education and career continuum; however, none has looked at changes throughout training and practice. The objective of the present study was to determine if there are differences between groups defined by their places on the <b>education</b> and career <b>continuum.</b> Methods: The authors performed a group-level meta-analysis on studies that used the 14 -item Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning or its variants. Eleven published articles, which reported on studies with post-secondary health professions students, residents, and practicing health professionals met the inclusion criteria. In total, there were 12 independent data sets, with four data sets per group. Results: In total, over seven thousand students, residents, and practicing health professionals responded to the Jefferson Scale (N= 7. 269). Individual study means tendency to be high, suggesting a high orientation toward lifelong learning among the trainees (students and residents) and practicing health professionals. Metaanalysis results indicated that the orientation toward lifelong learning tended to increase gradually along the <b>education</b> and career <b>continuum.</b> Significant differences in the group means were found between the trainees and practicing health professionals. Conclusions: In the reviewed studies, the orientation toward lifelong learning among students, residents, and practicing professionals was high. Nonetheless, although based on separate cohorts, it appears that the orientation toward lifelong learning continues to develop even after the completion of formal training...|$|R

It is argued that the functions - pedagogical and other - of the observed materialized, local identities may not correlate with the institutional business traditionally expected of an allegedly institutional context such as that of the L 2 classroom - e. g., to facilitate L 2 learning (Richards, ibid.). The observations suggest that by virtue of their orientations, teachers may at times interrupt their "doing being teachers" within the L 2 classroom context, and momentarily "doing being" someone else instead (Mondada, 1999).

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} several problems associated with assessing students with emotional or behavioral disorders (EBD) for eligibility. Major issues include underidentification {{of students in the}} cat-egory of EBD and the continuing overrepresentation of students of minority ethnicity. Movement away from the traditional norm-referenced approach to assessment toward a more functional approach seems to offer the most promise for addressing these concerns. A white paper published by the Executive Committee of the Council for Children with Behavioral Disorders (CCBD) in 1989 began with the ominous understatement, &dquo;the assessment of school-aged children and youth for behavioral disorders is a complex subject&dquo; (p. 263). The problems associated with assess-ing children and youth with emotional or behavioral disorders (EBD) are indeed com-plex, but perhaps more importantly, these problems reflect ambiguity at such a funda-mental level that many of our discussions about appropriate treatments and educational interventions for students with EBD carry a measure of futility for a simple, yet disquieting reason: We have yet to adequately define the population of students with whom we are working. Debate continues about assessment of students with EBD at all points in the spe-cial <b>education</b> service <b>continuum,</b> from prere-ferral and screening to evaluation for instruc-tion (see other papers in this special issue). To add meaning to these discussions, however, and to provide some framework for discourse about any of the myriad issues that confront our field, we must first address a basic ques-tion: Who is it that we identify as having an emotional or behavioral disorder? The problems associated with defining emotional and behavioral disorders, and then using that definition to appropriately deter-mine who should be eligible for services unde...|$|R

In the 1990s he was actively involved in humanist-focused issues, especially campaigns for free speech. Furedi's academic work was initially devoted to a study of imperialism and race relations. His books on the subject include The Mau-Mau War in Perspective, The New Ideology of Imperialism and The Silent War: Imperialism and the Changing Perception of Race. In recent years his work has been oriented towards exploring the sociology of risk and low expectations. Furedi is author of several books on this topic, most recently Wasted: Why <b>Education</b> Isn't Educating (<b>Continuum</b> 2009) and Invitation to Terror: The Expanding Empire of the Unknown (Continuum 2007), an analysis of the impact of terrorism post 9/11. His more recent publications, On Tolerance: A Defence of Moral Independence (Continuum 2011) and Authority: A Sociological Introduction (Cambridge University Press) deal with the inter-related problem of freedom and authority.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{teachers}} in higher education is subject of increasing attention, as exemplified by {{the development and implementation}} of guidelines for teacher qualifications at Universities in The Netherlands. Because medical education takes a special position in higher education the Council of Deans of Medical Schools in The Netherlands installed a national task force to explore a method to weigh criteria for teacher qualifications of medical teachers.

The framework distinguishes 3 dimensions: (a) six domains of teaching (development - organization - execution - coaching - assessment - evaluation); (b) three levels in the organization at which teachers perform (micro, meso and macro level) and (c) competencies as integration of knowledge, skills and attitude and described as behaviour in specific context. The current framework is the result of several cycles of descriptions, feedback from the field and adaptations. It is meant as a guideline, leaving room for local detailing.

40|$|International Baccalaureate (IB) {{schools have}} {{experienced}} dramatic growth worldwide {{over the past}} decade in response to burgeoning demand for high-quality education with an international orientation. One increasingly common trend has found international schools adopting two or more of the three programs offered by the IB: the Diploma, Middle Years and Primary Years programs. While the IB’s three academic programs cover the full K- 12 <b>education</b> <b>continuum,</b> they were developed in an evolutionary rather than a strategic fashion and operate with very different curricular assumptions. Thus schools adopting multiple IB programs have reported a variety of ‘transition problems ’ as students move from one program to the next. In light of these reports, the IB undertook a global survey of IB Program Coordinators in 2008 with the goal of better understanding the extent and nature of this problem. In this study we analyze those data in an effort to understand the challenges that schools are experiencing as they seek to support students in making a successful transition from the Middle Years Program to the Diploma Program. We also highlight differences in the challenges faced by partial continuum and full continuum IB schools and offer recommendations for addressing the ‘transition problems ’ identified in the study...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a critical review}} of literature on interprofessional <b>education</b> in the <b>continuum</b> of professional development in health and social care. In particular it explores the range and variety of theoretical frameworks underpinning interprofessional education initiatives across the United Kingdom. In doing so this paper highlights the limited application of educational theory within the broader literature, particularly {{in the description of}} the methods employed and in the choices of processes or outcome measures selected. Despite these drawbacks, a focus on the learning and teaching methods used within each interprofessional education programme enabled an explicit categorization of the educational theories being applied (albeit implicitly). The educational theories identified predominantly linked to adult learning theory and reflective practitioner theory. It is, however, acknowledged that such theories alone are not enough to underpin interprofessional education. Theories were therefore also derived from social psychological studies of group behaviour and teamwork approaches; group development and team learning theories focusing on intragroup collaboration; and bio-psychological theories to inform interprofessional education. The paper concludes that (a) more explicit consideration of theory is required in the development of new interventions; (b) reference to educational theory in evaluation should be encouraged and facilitated; (c) evaluation of different models of interprofessional educational interventions is required if interprofessional education in health and social care is to develop as an informed practice rather than become a transient educational fashio...|$|R
40|$|Cancer patient {{navigation}} (PN) {{programs have}} been shown to increase access to and utilization of cancer care for poor and underserved individuals.

We describe five PN programs and the range of tasks their navigators provide across the cancer care <b>continuum</b> (<b>education</b> and outreach, screening, diagnosis and staging, treatment, survivorship, and end-of-life). Tasks are organized by their potential to make cancer services understandable, available, accessible, affordable, appropriate, and accountable. Although navigators perform similar tasks across the five programs, their specific approaches reflect differences in community culture, context, program setting, and funding. Task lists can inform the development of programs, job descriptions, training, and evaluation. They also may be useful in the move to certify navigators and establish mechanisms for reimbursement for navigation services. 5 U 58 DP 001006 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesR 24 MD 002811 /MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United StatesU 01 CA 114609 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesU 01 CA 114630 - 05 S 1 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesU 01 CA 114657 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesU 01 CA 114629 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesU 01 CA 114630 - 05 S 1 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesU 54 CA 153459 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesU 54 MD 007584 /MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United StatesU 54 CA 153499 /CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States 2012 - 03 - 13 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 22423178 PMC 330235...|$|R
