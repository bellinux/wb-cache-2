He was restrained by handcuffs which made the matters worse and he wasn't released because police lost the keys. After 15 minutes, an ambulance was called but never arrived. Finally, a volunteer took Baharuddin to a nearby hospital but it was already too late. Police said he died of heart complications.|$|E

25|$|In Peru and Chile, sloths of {{the genus}} Thalassocnus adapted to a coastal marine {{lifestyle}} {{beginning in the late}} Miocene. Initially they <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> in the water, but over a span of 4 million years they eventually evolved into swimming creatures. It is thought that when the Isthmus of Panama closed about 3 million years ago the water grew colder, perhaps contributing to their extinction by the late Pliocene. The plants these sloths fed on may have grown sparse, or they may have been unable to adapt to the lower water temperatures.|$|E
25|$|This {{rejected}} the Aguilar–Spinelli test {{and put in}} place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized that there was more evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter standing alone. The court agreed that if the letter had <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> alone it would not be probable cause to get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it would be very hard for the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E

After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that [...] "e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They {{must have been in}} shock and awe.

500|$|Over the years, Harvey Pollack, who at {{the time}} was in charge of {{publicity}} and statistics for the Warriors, has given conflicting statements on the question. In a 1992 book, he was twice quoted as saying that the game ended with 46 seconds remaining. But in a 2002 interview quoted by Chamberlain biographer Robert Cherry, Pollack said that the last 46 seconds were played, and that Chamberlain <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> in the middle circle, waiting for the game to end and not wanting to touch the ball, as [...] "100 sounded better than 102". The game's official box score notes that Warrior Joe Ruklick missed two free throws after the break. Ruklick said he planned to miss the second free throw in hopes that Chamberlain might rebound it and get 102points.|$|E
500|$|However, Avex {{refused to}} promote Koda's work equally {{due to her}} {{excessive}} weight gain, and claims of her being [...] "ugly". Matsuura was also unimpressed by Koda's image, declaring that they had tried to look for [...] "the best one" [...] for their label. Later on the stages, Avex executives threatened to fire Koda if no improvements were put into place, which she eventually did but wasn't notified until her single [...] "Real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba". In mid 2000, Kumi was asked by Avex to make her promotional debut through a photo shoot with photographer Toku, {{which led to the}} shooting of the cover sleeve for [...] "Take Back".

500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing room and he was so... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [...] we got him out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".|$|E
500|$|Onstage tension {{began to}} grow between Kiedis and Frusciante. Kiedis {{recalled}} an argument after a show in New Orleans: [...] "We had a sold-out house and John <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> in the corner, barely playing his guitar. We came offstage and John and I got into it." [...] With the Peppers now playing shows at arenas rather than theaters, the promoters of the tour decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act. Kiedis contacted Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, {{and asked him if}} Nirvana would replace Pearl Jam on the tour—an offer Grohl accepted. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, however, refused to play with Nirvana as he once dated frontman Kurt Cobain's wife Courtney Love. The Pumpkins were, therefore, taken off the concert bill and replaced with Pearl Jam. Their first show with Nirvana was at the L.A Sports Arena. Kiedis considered their act to be [...] "raw energy; their musicality, their song selection, they were like a chain saw cutting through the night." [...] When the Red Hot Chili Peppers finished touring with Nirvana, they traveled to Europe, where Frusciante, in need of someone to connect to, brought along his girlfriend Toni Oswald. Kiedis said that [...] "John had broken our unwritten rule of no spouses or girlfriends on the road." [...] Briefly interrupting the European-tour, the Chili Peppers flew to New York City and performed on an episode of Saturday Night Live. The band played [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as the second number; a performance that Kiedis felt was sabotaged by Frusciante: ...|$|E

500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> there and went, [...] "This is so cool.

Instead, it eventually curled back on target, much to the surprise of goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, who <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> in place.
