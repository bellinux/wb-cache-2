25|$|Debit {{cards and}} credit cards are {{creative}} terms used by the banking industry to market and identify each card. From the cardholder's point of view, a credit card account normally contains a credit balance, a debit card account normally contains a <b>debit</b> <b>balance.</b> A debit card is {{used to make a}} purchase with one's own money. A credit card is used to make a purchase by borrowing money.|$|E
25|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (asset) {{account in}} his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> on the bank statement.|$|E
6000|$|Wrayson seated {{himself before}} the desk, {{and began a}} careful search. There were {{restaurant}} bills without number, {{and a variety of}} ladies' cards, more or less soiled. There were Empire and Alhambra programmes, a bundle of racing wires, and an account from a bookmaker showing a small <b>debit</b> <b>balance.</b> There were other miscellaneous bills, a plaintive epistle from a lady signing herself Flora, and begging for the loan of a fiver for a week, and an invitation to tea from a spinster who called herself Poppy. Amongst all this mass of miscellaneous documents there were only three which Wrayson laid on one side for further consideration. One of these was a note, dated from the Adelphi {{a few days before the}} tragedy, and written in a stiff, legal hand. It contained only a few lines: ...|$|E
50|$|Assets and {{expenses}} have normal <b>debit</b> <b>balances,</b> i.e., <b>debiting</b> {{these types of}} accounts increases them.|$|R
5000|$|Debit {{accounts}} are asset and expense accounts that usually have <b>debit</b> <b>balances,</b> i.e. the total debits usually exceeds the total credits in each debit account.|$|R
50|$|Broadly, {{accounts}} {{opened with}} the purpose of holding credit balances are referred to as deposit accounts; whilst accounts opened {{with the purpose}} of holding debt balances are referred to as loan accounts. Some accounts can switch between credit and <b>debit</b> <b>balances.</b>|$|R
50|$|A bank counts a {{nostro account}} with a <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> as a cash asset in its balance sheet. Conversely, a vostro account {{with a credit}} balance (i.e. a deposit) is a liability, and a vostro with a <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> (a loan) is an asset. Thus in many banks a credit entry on an account ("CR") is {{regarded}} as negative movement, and a debit ("DR") is positive - the reverse of usual commercial accounting conventions.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally in accounting, contra amounts {{are placed}} in parentheses. A <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> account {{in a series of}} credit {{balances}} will have brackets and vice versa.|$|E
5000|$|Bank {{accounts}} {{may have}} a positive, or credit balance, where the financial institution owes or a negative, or <b>debit</b> <b>balance,</b> where the customer owes the financial institution money.|$|E
50|$|Other lenders have {{multiple}} accounts. As a minimum {{there is a}} mortgage account and a deposit account. Often the lender allows multiple accounts for credit balances and sometimes for <b>debit</b> <b>balances.</b> These different accounts allow the borrowers to notionally split their money according to purpose whilst all accounts are offset each day against the mortgage debt.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} between the total debits and total credits in a single account is the account's <b>balance.</b> If <b>debits</b> exceed credits, the account has a debit balance; if credits exceed debits, the account has a credit balance. For the company as a whole, the totals of <b>debit</b> <b>balances</b> and credit balances must be equal {{as shown in the}} trial balance report, otherwise an error has occurred.|$|R
50|$|The double entry {{system uses}} nominal ledger {{accounts}}. From these nominal ledger accounts a trial balance can be created. The trial balance lists all the nominal ledger account balances. The list is {{split into two}} columns, with <b>debit</b> <b>balances</b> placed in the left hand column and credit balances placed in the right hand column. Another column will contain {{the name of the}} nominal ledger account describing what each value is for. The total of the debit column must equal the total of the credit column.|$|R
50|$|A {{trial balance}} {{is a list}} of all the general ledger {{accounts}} (both revenue and capital) contained in the ledger of a business. This list will contain the name of each nominal ledger account and the value of that nominal ledger balance. Each nominal ledger account will hold either a <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> or a credit balance. The <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> values will be listed in the debit column of the trial balance and the credit value balance will be listed in the credit column. The trading profit and loss statement and balance sheet and other financial reports can then be produced using the ledger accounts listed on the trial balance.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the result}} of the sale is a credit balance on the account, this amount must be repaid to the consumer. If there is a <b>debit</b> <b>balance,</b> the credit {{provider}} may demand and, if necessary, sue the consumer for the outstanding balance.|$|E
50|$|In February 1980, {{respondents}} Schor and Mortgage Services of America, Inc. filed complaints {{with the}} CFTC against brokerage firm ContiCommodity Services, Inc. (Conti) and Richard L. Sandor, {{one of the}} firm’s employees, alleging violations of the CEA. Meanwhile, Conti filed an action under diversity jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to recover the <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> in Schor’s account. Schor filed a counterclaim in the federal suit, asserting the same charges against Conti it had made in its complaint to the CFTC. Schor moved to dismiss the district court action, but the judge declined. Conti then voluntarily dismissed the suit, in order to present its counterclaim against Schor for the <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> as a defense in the CFTC action.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the {{purchase}} ledger was maintained in book form, hence the term ledger, but in modern practice {{it is much}} more likely to be held on computer using accountancy software or a spreadsheet. The concept of Double-entry Bookkeeping is that <b>debits</b> <b>balance</b> the credits at all times. For convenience the main Trial Balance lists some accounts containing many entries as simply a single control figure. There is then a separate physical Ledger for the summarised area, which could conveniently be managed on its own, often at physically separate locations from the main ledger book. The Purchase Ledger is a common example of this.|$|R
50|$|Prime brokers do {{not charge}} a fee for the bundled package of {{services}} they provide to hedge funds. Rather, revenues are typically derived from three sources: spreads on financing (including stock loan), trading commissions and fees for the settlement of transactions done away from the prime broker. The financing and lending spreads, which are charged in basis points {{on the value of}} client loans (<b>debit</b> <b>balances),</b> client deposits (credit balances), client short sales (short balances), and synthetic financing products such as swaps and CFDs (Contract for difference), make up the vast majority of prime brokerage revenue.|$|R
5000|$|Debits are {{recorded}} {{on the left}} side of a T account in a ledger. <b>Debits</b> increase <b>balances</b> in asset accounts and expense accounts and decrease balances in liability accounts, revenue accounts, and capital accounts.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{there is}} no limit {{on the amount of}} a clients assets that can be rehypothecated, except if the client has {{negotiated}} an agreement with their broker that includes a limit or prohibition. In the US, re-hypothecation is capped at 140% of a client's <b>debit</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Debit {{cards and}} credit cards are {{creative}} terms used by the banking industry to market and identify each card. From the cardholder's point of view, a credit card account normally contains a credit balance, a debit card account normally contains a <b>debit</b> <b>balance.</b> A debit card is {{used to make a}} purchase with one's own money. A credit card is used to make a purchase by borrowing money.|$|E
50|$|The film {{then opened}} in Sydney in May. Its {{commercial}} reception was solid rather than sensational: Charles Chauvel Productions Ltd received £17,915 {{from the film}} in May and June 1955. The company's name was changed to Jedda Ltd to help exploit the film. In December 1956 Jedda Ltd reported a profit of £50,454 for the year to 30 June, reducing the <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> in the production account to £69,697. The film had been successful in Australia but performed disappointingly overseas.|$|E
2500|$|Brokerage {{firms can}} also borrow stocks from the {{accounts}} of their own customers. [...] Typical margin account agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer. [...] In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have <b>debit</b> <b>balances,</b> meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.) ...|$|R
5000|$|IF {{was set up}} at a {{time when}} many banks were {{exploring}} opportunities to utilise new technology to reduce the costs of providing financial services. IF established what it marketed as [...] "intelligent" [...] products whereby customer pick a combination of all or some of a range of bank accounts including current account, savings account, mortgage and credit card. The credit balance in a person's current account and saving accounts would [...] "offset" [...] any <b>debit</b> <b>balances</b> in the person's mortgage and credit card accounts. The customer would then pay interest on the net balance, potentially allowing savings to be made on borrowings. However, in June 2005 IF withdrew its offset credit card, citing high running costs.|$|R
50|$|The {{trial balance}} {{is a list}} of the active general ledger {{accounts}} with their respective <b>debit</b> and credit <b>balances.</b> A balanced trial balance does not guarantee that there are no errors in the individual ledger entries.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes in IFRS, {{but not in}} GAAP, {{the term}} reserve is used instead of provision. Such a use is, however, {{inconsistent}} with the terminology suggested by International Accounting Standards Board. The term [...] "reserve" [...] can be a confusing accounting term. In accounting, a reserve is always an account with a credit balance in the entity's Equity on the Balance Sheet, while to non-professionals it has the connotation of a pool of cash set aside to meet a future liability (a <b>debit</b> <b>balance).</b>|$|E
50|$|A balance {{transfer}} from {{a credit card}} with no (or smaller) <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> to create an intentional credit balance on the account which the borrower can seek to recover either gradually (e.g. day to day purchases) or instantly (e.g. cheques issued by the secondary card to the borrower). Although some card issuers may balk at issuing a check for a $50,000 credit balance, in the United States, they legally have no more than 7 business days to issue the check from the date the request is received.|$|E
50|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (asset) {{account in}} his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a <b>debit</b> <b>balance</b> on the bank statement.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a trial balance is {{to prove that the}} value of all the <b>debit</b> value <b>balances</b> equal the total of all the credit value balances. If the total of the debit column does not equal the total value of the credit column then this would show that there is an error in the nominal ledger accounts. This error must be found before a profit and loss {{statement}} and balance sheet can be produced.|$|R
5|$|An {{appropriation}} {{was approved}} by the city council, authorizing the city to spend $34 million from the general fund. The appropriation was recorded in fund's general ledger with a <b>debit</b> to Fund <b>Balance</b> and a credit to Appropriations.|$|R
5000|$|In the double-entry {{accounting}} system, {{at least two}} accounting entries are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts. Recording of a debit amount {{to one or more}} accounts and an equal credit amount to one or more accounts results in total debits being equal to total credits for all accounts in the general ledger. If the accounting entries are recorded without error, the aggregate balance of all accounts having <b>Debit</b> <b>balances</b> will be equal to the aggregate balance of all accounts having Credit balances. Accounting entries that debit and credit related accounts typically include the same date and identifying code in both accounts, so that in case of error, each debit and credit {{can be traced back to}} a journal and transaction source document, thus preserving an audit trail. The rules for formulating accounting entries are known as [...] "Golden Rules of Accounting". The accounting entries are recorded in the [...] "Books of Accounts". Regardless of which accounts and how many are impacted by a given transaction, the fundamental accounting equation of assets equal liabilities plus capital will hold.|$|R
50|$|The {{rule has}} special {{application}} {{in relation to}} partnerships upon {{the death of a}} partner. In most jurisdictions, the death of a partner ordinarily has the legal effect of 1890. The partners' personal representatives have no right to step into the partner's shoes; they cannot take part in its management; they can only claim the deceased partner's share in the assets of the firm. The banker, who provides financial accommodation to the firm, can have no objection in continuing the account; the bank can presume that the surviving partners will account to the representatives of the deceased for his share in the assets. Where the firm has a <b>debit</b> <b>balance,</b> the account should be stopped to fix the liability of the estate of the deceased partner and to avoid the operation of the rule in Clayton's case.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{financial}} transaction is recorded {{in at least}} two different nominal ledger accounts within the financial accounting system, so that the total debits equals the total credits in the General Ledger, i.e. the accounts balance. This is a partial check that each and every transaction has been correctly recorded. The transaction is recorded as a [...] "debit entry" [...] (Dr) in one account, and a [...] "credit entry" [...] (Cr) in a second account. The debit entry will be recorded on the debit side (left-hand side) of a General ledger account, and the credit entry will be recorded on the credit side (right-hand side) of a General ledger account. If the total of the entries on the debit side of one account is greater than the total on the credit side of the same nominal account, that account is said to have a <b>debit</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In accounting, {{the concept}} of a freight expense or freight spend account can be {{generalized}} as a payment for sending out a product to a customer. It falls under the umbrella category of expenses and is treated like other expense accounts in relation to the accounting equation, however, under generally accepted accounting rules, if the freight is considered part of the cost of an asset it is recorded as part {{of the value of the}} asset on the balance sheet as laid down cost. Freight expense has a normal <b>debit</b> <b>balance.</b> Increases are recorded as debits while decreases are recorded as credits. In relation to other accounts, the Freight Expense account is similar to the [...] "Cost of Sales-Freight" [...] account, but are two totally different entities. While the Freight Expense account is increased for payments towards outgoing goods, the Cost of Sales-Freight account is increased for payments towards incoming goods.|$|E
5000|$|The SEC {{expected}} this change to significantly {{increase the amount}} of net capital computed by those broker-dealers. This would permit the parent holding companies of the broker-dealers to redeploy the resulting [...] "excess" [...] net capital in other lines of business. To lessen this effect, the SEC adopted a new $500 million minimum net capital (and $1 billion [...] "tentative net capital") requirement for such brokers and, more important, required each to provide the SEC an [...] "early warning" [...] if its [...] "tentative net capital" [...] fell below $5 billion. Previously, their minimum net capital requirement was only $250,000 with an early warning requirement of $300,000, although the relevant minimums for such large broker-dealers were the much larger amounts resulting from the requirement to maintain net capital of 2% of aggregate debit items with an early warning requirement at 5% of aggregate <b>debit</b> <b>balances.</b> [...] The SEC also permitted CSE Brokers to calculate [...] "tentative net capital" [...] by including [...] "assets {{for which there is no}} ready market" [...] to the extent the SEC approved the CSE Broker's use of mathematical models to determine haircuts for those positions.|$|R
5000|$|School districts pay Newton Learning to run Summer Adventure {{and boost}} summer {{attendance}} rates, {{which in turn}} generate state aid and a profit for the districts. In order to encourage enrollment and attendance, Newton offers Visa debit cards to students with good attendance during the summer school session. The <b>debit</b> card <b>balances</b> range from $100 for perfect attendance to $50 for 14 hours missed. In Columbia, Missouri, 3,637 students received debit cards in the 2005 summer session.http://digmo.org/news/story.php?ID=15347 Depending on the district, Summer Adventure also holds drawings for daily incentives and gift cards, as well as bigger prizes like the Xbox 360.http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/neighborhoods/stories.nsf/wentzvillewarrenton/news/story/B6633347F77AF6AC862571930077A061?OpenDocument ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 2008 when a new system by iNit was introduced, which used an {{electronic}} card to validate and purchase tickets. The Greencard system allows for passengers to deposit a desired amount onto their cards, with the <b>balance</b> <b>debited</b> upon each trip. The new system also requires validation on each boarding, and has a fare expiration of 90 minutes from the initial boarding.|$|R
