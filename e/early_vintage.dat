And he told them all about his several dignities, and how he had held this and that and the other place of honor or profit, and had once been to the legislature, and was now president of the Society of Freethinkers. He said the society had been in existence four years, and already had two members, and was firmly established. He would call for the brothers in the evening, if they would like to attend a meeting of it.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his teens}} Temianka played a Laurentius Storioni of 1780. While {{traveling}} {{under the aegis}} of the Curtis Institute, he briefly played a loaned Stradivarius, which was exchanged for a Januarius Gagliano. In 1929 Temianka owned the violin made in 1752 by Joannes Baptista Guadagnini. In the 1930s he played a Silvestre violin, with which he made his <b>early</b> <b>Vintage</b> recordings, and subsequently a Januarius Gagliano and a Carlo Bergonzi.The Stradivarius he played during the years of the Paganini Quartet was the [...] "Comte Cozio di Salabue" [...] of 1727, which was Paganini's own concert violin. [...] It was later played by Martin Beaver, first violinist of the Tokyo String Quartet, which played since 1995 on the same quartet of Stradivarius instruments once owned by Paganini, until the Tokyo String Quartet retired in July 2013. These remarkable instruments—the viola had inspired Paganini to commission Hector Berlioz's Harold en Italie—were also played by the Cleveland Quartet for almost 15 years, beginning in 1982, and are presently owned by Nippon Music Foundation of Japan, after deacquisition by the Corcoran Gallery in the mid-1990s for $15 million. They are now in the hands of the Hagen Quartet.When the years of the Paganini Quartet came to an end, Temianka played a Michelangelo Bergonzi of 1759. His recordings of the Handel Sonatas were made on an Andrea Guarneri of 1687.|$|E

40|$|High {{interest}} rates are considered an effective tool for stopping high inflation. The case for a policy of high {{interest rates}} is developed {{in terms of a}} conventional 1 S-LM model. However, among other things, the model ignores some central aspects of modern credit markets. In particular high interest rates may give rise to nonp erf arming bank loans, thus seriously jeopardizing the effectiveness of the policy. Examples are developed in which it would be optimal to aim for equilibriums of low, rather than high, interest rates. One of these examples hinges on the existence of nonindexed domestic debt. This article looks at the effectiveness and desirability of relatively high interest rates in stabilization programs. High interest rates refer to nominal interest rates that would result in unsustainable, high real interest rates—that is, real rates of interest that would cause a state of generalized bankruptcy if maintained for a few months or a year—if the program's inflation target were to be achieved. The article evolves through a series of examples, beginning with the IS-LM model described in section I. Despite its simplicity (and <b>early</b> <b>vintage),</b> the model is still important in discussions of policy. The conventional IS-LM approach...|$|E
