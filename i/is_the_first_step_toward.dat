25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{considered}} that holding {{the rank of}} makushita <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> becoming a professional (sekitori ranked) sumo wrestler. Furthermore, it {{can be regarded as}} the most heavily contested division, with younger sumo wrestlers on their way up competing with those older sumo wrestlers who have dropped from jūryō and are determined to regain the higher rank. A key incentive is the difference between being ranked in the topmost makushita slot versus the lowest jūryō rank, which has been likened to being that between heaven and hell: A wrestler ranked at makushita or lower is expected to carry out chores for the stable and any sekitori within it, whereas the jūryō wrestler will be served upon. Similarly the jūryō wrestler receives a comfortable monthly salary, whereas a wrestler below makushita still only receives a small living allowance.|$|E

Completing kōan training <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> becoming a JDPSN, followed by a nomination to receive inka by the individual's senior Dharma teacher. The individual is then assessed by five Dharma teachers, one being the nominating party, and the other four being independent Dharma teachers. The nominee must demonstrate an aptitude for the task of teaching, showing the breadth of their understanding in their daily conduct. Should the nominee be approved to be granted the title of JDPSN, a ceremony is held thereafter and the student engages in public Dharma combat {{with a number of}} students and teachers. Provided that the individual demonstrates a superior understanding to that of these students, they then receive the title. They are then given a kasa and keisaku and undergo a period of teacher training.|$|E
