5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Some {{computers}} {{play better}} overall if their memory is devoted {{instead to the}} ordinary search and evaluation function. Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e. without suffering from the horizon effect). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity {{from the site of}} the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

50|$|After the war, the Port {{was mostly}} {{used as a}} naval base by the PLAN. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> 1984 that <b>it</b> started by shared for {{civilian}} use again, and in 1997 that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fully reopened for internal trade. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> 2007 that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> reopened for foreign trade. Current plans hope to make the port into a 100 million ton throughput port by 2016.|$|R
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|The series {{introduced}} Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, here {{depicted as}} a famous Hollywood film director. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the successor volume, The Blue Lotus, that he is also revealed {{as the head of}} an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East, Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham's Treasure.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{important}} prehistoric structures, {{many of which}} pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. In the historic period the earliest known settlers were Picts {{to the north and}} Gaels in the southern kingdom of Dál Riada prior to the islands becoming part of the Suðreyjar kingdom of the Norse, who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by various clan chiefs, principally the MacLeans, MacLeods and MacDonalds. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> recent years that population levels have ceased to decline.|$|E

Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs, principal of whom were the MacLeods, MacDonalds, Mackenzies and MacNeils. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> recent years that population levels have ceased to decline. Much of the land is now under local control and commercial activity is based on tourism, crofting, fishing, and weaving.|$|E

25|$|The Secular Franciscan charism is {{not given}} to an {{individual}} person but {{to a group of}} brothers and sisters. As times change, it has to adapt to the needs and expectations of the Holy Church. Thus from the outset, it is a group that is shaped by the Holy Church, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> this context that the charism can thrive.|$|E

25|$|It {{is in this}} temple {{that one}} notices {{for the first time}} two gopuras (towers {{oriented}} in the same direction. They are architecturally coeval with the main vimana and are referred to in inscriptions as Rajarajan tiruvasal and Keralantakan tiruvasal. In spite of the massive size of the gopuras, the vimana, rising majestically to a height of 190 feet, continues to dominate and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the subsequent period that a change in the gradation of magnitude takes place.|$|E
25|$|Belfast West has {{historically}} been the most nationalist of Belfast's four constituencies, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> {{the last few decades}} that the votes for unionist parties have plunged to tiny levels. The constituency is largely made of a long, slender, belt along the Falls Road and its suburban extensions, with three of the five wards from the staunchly unionist Shankill area now something of a bolt-on, with a several kilometre long peace line dividing them {{from the rest of the}} constituency. There is also a smaller Protestant enclave at Suffolk.|$|E
25|$|Included in {{his design}} was a frieze sculpted by Caspar Buberl. Because a {{sculpture}} {{of that size}} was well out of Meigs's budget, he had Buberl create 28 different scenes, totaling 69 feet (21 m) in length, which were then mixed and slightly modified to create the continuous 1,200-foot (365-m) parade of over 1,300 figures. Because of the 28 sections' modification and mixture, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> careful examination that the frieze is seen {{to be the same}} figures repeated several times. The sculpture includes infantry, navy, artillery, cavalry, and medical components, as well as {{a good deal of the}} supply and quartermaster functions, for it was in that capacity that Meigs had served during the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Some sources {{claim that}} the stained glass was {{designed}} and manufactured by Louis Comfort Tiffany and his firm in New York City. Historians Sharon Gregor and G. E. Kidder Smith, however, say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the style of Tiffany. Sandvick Architects, consultant to the Geis Cos. on the renovation, said in 2013 {{that there was no}} documentary evidence to attribute the dome to Tiffany. In 2016, historic preservationist Karl Brunjes discovered extensive evidence that the designer was Nicola D'Ascenzo, a Philadelphia-based artist whose works include stained glass at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine and Riverside Church in New York City and Folger Shakespeare Library and Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|To Freud {{sexuality}} {{is composed of}} partial drives (i.e. the oral or the anal drives) each specified by a different erotogenic zone. At first these partial drives function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> puberty that they become organized {{under the aegis of}} the genital organs. Lacan accepts the partial nature of drives, but 1) rejects the notion that partial drives can ever attain any complete organization: the primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and 2) he argues that drives are partial in that they only represent sexuality partially not in the sense that they are a part of the whole. Drives do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of jouissance.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Legend of Gunung Ledang, Sultan Mahmud of Malacca sends his emissary, Hang Tuah, to Gunung Ledang {{to present his}} royal proposal of marriage to the mystical Princess of Mount Ledang. The Princess and Hang Tuah are independently famous figures of Malayan history-mythology, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> this specific story that the two briefly cross paths, though in some versions of the tale it is Tun Mamat, not Tuah, who presents the proposal to the Princess as Tuah was too old and weak to reach the mountain peak. The original concept of the Puteri Gunung Ledang, as pitched by Mamat Khalid, was to pose {{the question of what}} would happen if these two characters had met and fallen in love.|$|E
