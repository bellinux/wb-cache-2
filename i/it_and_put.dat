5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated ivory, a government {{could choose to}} sell <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life for human citizens.|$|E
5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E
5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, the Conservation Commission, {{which the}} FFGC had become, {{found that there}} was still a large area of the {{southern}} Catskills, in Sullivan and Ulster counties, poorly served by the existing towers. Red Hill was chosen as the site for a new tower (supposedly after political pressure forced the state to reconsider Sullivan County's Denman Mountain to the south), and early in 1920 a forest ranger brought the disassembled tower up to the summit via horse-drawn wagon. A state crew cut a road through the Dibble farm up from nearby Red Hill Road, strung the telephone line along <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> up the tower and cabin later that year.|$|E
25|$|Since Thutmose III had devoted so {{much energy}} to {{expanding}} Karnak, Amenhotep's building projects were largely focused on enlarging smaller temples all over Egypt. In the Delta, his father's Overseer of Works, Minmose, is attested from an inscription at Tura as overseeing construction of more temples. In upper Egypt, small shrines are attested at Medamud, el-Tod, and Armant. Karnak, despite not receiving the attention given it by his father, also was not totally neglected. He commissioned a column {{to stand in the}} courtyard between the fourth and fifth pylons commemorating the reception of tribute from Mitanni. In Nubia, Amenhotep built at Qasr Ibrim and Semna, and ordered the decoration of the Temple at Kalabsha. However, his most famous Nubian temple was at Amada. Thutmose III had begun constructing a temple which, technically, was dedicated to Horus there, although the presence of Re-Harakhti and Amun-Re is easily observed. Amenhotep completed <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> in it the record of his year 3 campaign on a stele, which was until 1942 the source of most information about Amenhotep's wars.|$|E

500|$|Canadian Pacific Railway Locomotive No. 2816 was {{acquired}} by Blount in January 1964. [...] It was built by Montreal Locomotive Works in 1930. The 4-6-4 Hudson, H1b class locomotive had logged over [...] in 30 years of service pulling passenger trains between Winnipeg and Calgary, and Winnipeg and Fort William, Ontario. Later, 2816 served on the Windsor-to-Quebec City corridor. [...] The locomotive's final run was on May 26, 1960, pulling a Montreal–Rigaud commuter train. [...] The Steamtown Special History Study recommended that the locomotive be kept in the collection, {{as it was the}} only 4-6-4 in the group, but the National Park Service sold it back to Canadian Pacific Railway, who restored <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> it back into service.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, film {{director}} Steven Spielberg bought a [...] "Rosebud" [...] sled for $60,500; {{it was one}} of three balsa sleds used in the closing scenes and the only one that was not burned. After the Spielberg purchase, it was reported that retiree Arthur Bauer claimed to own another [...] "Rosebud" [...] sled. In early 1942 when Bauer was 12 he won an RKO publicity contest and selected the hardwood sled as his prize. In 1996, Bauer's estate offered the painted pine sled at auction through Christie's. Bauer's son told CBS News that his mother had once wanted to paint the sled {{and use it as a}} plant stand, but Bauer told her to [...] "just save <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> it in the closet."

[...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and {{that we could do}} our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo.

500|$|... "Death" [...] also touches {{upon the}} issue of euthanasia, and whether it is morally or {{ethically}} wrong to commit suicide. The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience {{it would be for}} Stan. This is most strongly illustrated {{at the end of the}} episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of [...] "natural causes", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, [...] "Basically, it is OK to kill yourself, but you shouldn't ask someone else to do <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> someone else through the trip." ...|$|E
500|$|When the game's {{text was}} {{translated}} from Japanese to English, the game {{needed to be}} reprogrammed {{in order to accomplish}} this; different companies handled this process in different ways. Tecmo's Japanese writers wrote rough translations in English, and they would then fax them to the American division. According to Criona, the American division would [...] "edit <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> it back together, telling the story in a context that an American English speaker would understand. This would go back and forth several times." [...] Moreover, the game's text was stored in picture files instead of raw computer text, and because of the NES' hardware limitations, the English text need to be very clear and concise to fall within those limitations; many times, different words with the same meaning but with fewer characters had to be used. All symbols and objects were scrutinized by Nintendo of America, who had specific rules on what could be included for North American releases; for instance, any Satanic, Christian, or any other religious, sexual, or drug-related references were not allowed.|$|E
500|$|If all the {{obstacles}} of the Duat could be negotiated, the deceased would be judged in the [...] "Weighing of the Heart" [...] ritual, depicted in Spell 125. The deceased {{was led by}} the god Anubis into the presence of Osiris. There, the dead person swore {{that he had not}} committed any sin from a list of 42 sins, reciting a text known as the [...] "Negative Confession". Then the dead person's heart was weighed on a pair of scales, against the goddess Maat, who embodied truth and justice. Maat was often represented by an ostrich feather, the hieroglyphic sign for her name. At this point, there was a risk that the deceased's heart would bear witness, owning up to sins committed in life; Spell 30B guarded against this eventuality. If the scales balanced, this meant the deceased had led a good life. Anubis would take them to Osiris and they would find their place in the afterlife, becoming maa-kheru, meaning [...] "vindicated" [...] or [...] "true of voice". If the heart was out of balance with Maat, then another fearsome beast called Ammit, the Devourer, stood ready to eat <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> the dead person's afterlife to an early and unpleasant end.|$|E
