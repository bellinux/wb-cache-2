The subdivision is located at the intersections of Interstate 84, Idaho 21, and Federal Way (former U.S. Highway), which are all major arteries to <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> in Boise. The subdivision, a baseball complex, and swimming pools were developed around the Simplot Sports complex. The fields are built over an old landfill and dump, and the fields and gravel parking lot allow radon gases to escape through the ground.|$|E

So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> near the ball.

25|$|However, the English obstructionism, also in {{the matter}} of the peace with Portugal (which Downing helped to {{frustrate}} for a long time) actually helped in the end to unify the Dutch politicians behind De Witt. The Amsterdam regents, seeing that they did not <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> with Charles, lost interest in the cause of the Prince. Holland therefore reunited, and the recalcitrant provinces had no chance against a united Holland. Zeeland was brought back in the fold by the aggressive behavior of the new Royal African Company (RAC) against the WIC (in which Zeeland traditionally had an important interest) in West Africa. This threat to its own interests by the English (and especially William's royal uncles) helped cool Zeeland's fervor for the Orangist cause in 1661.|$|E

Other reviewers too did not hesitate to mention the novel's stunted character development and anti-climactic ending.

500|$|The {{first of}} the [...] "little ships" [...] arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May. The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not <b>get</b> <b>anywhere</b> near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about [...] from the {{waterline}} {{and wait for the}} soldiers to wade out. In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them. In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn. In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at De Panne and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.|$|E

The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating [...] "Words [...] strain,/Crack and sometimes break, under the burden , under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [...] will not stay in place, /Will not stay still." [...] By comparison, the narrator concludes that [...] "Love is itself unmoving,/Only the cause and end of movement,/Timeless, and undesiring."

She splits the map in two, giving one piece to Homer and Bart and keeping one piece for her and Marge. Homer and Bart first search through Copacabana Beach and then a market, where they are robbed by children, while Marge and Lisa visit a samba school. However, both duos are unsuccessful in finding Ronaldo so far. To get to their last location, Homer and Bart take a taxi and are kidnapped at gunpoint by the taxi driver. However, Bart is able to get away and tell the rest of the family.|$|E
500|$|Both {{necklaces}} {{consist of}} a single row of large graduated [...] pearls with pearl clasps. The Queen Anne necklace {{is said to have}} belonged to Queen Anne, the last British monarch of the Stuart dynasty. Horace Walpole, the English art historian, wrote in his diary, [...] "Queen Anne had but few jewels and those indifferent, except one pearl necklace given to her by Prince George". Queen Caroline, on the other hand, {{had a great deal of}} valuable jewellery, including no fewer than four pearl necklaces. She wore all the pearl necklaces to her coronation in 1727, but afterwards had the 50 best pearls selected to make one large necklace. In 1947, both necklaces were given to Elizabeth by her father as a wedding present. On her wedding day, Elizabeth realised that she had left her pearls at St James's Palace. Her private secretary, Jock Colville, was asked to go and retrieve them. He commandeered the limousine of King Haakon VII of Norway, but traffic that morning had stopped, so even the king's car with its royal flag flying could not <b>get</b> <b>anywhere.</b> Colville completed his journey on foot, and when he arrived at St James's Palace, he had to explain the odd story to the guards who were protecting Elizabeth's 2,660 wedding presents.

As of October 2017, the film holds a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews with the consensus stating: [...] "Featuring a patchwork script and a dialogue-heavy storyline whose biggest villain is a cloud, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a less-than-auspicious debut for the franchise." [...] Gary Arnold and Judith Martin of The Washington Post felt that the plot was too thin to support {{the length of the}} film, although Martin felt that compared to such science-fiction films as , Star Wars and Alien, The Motion Pictures pretense was [...] "slightly cleverer". Times Harold Livingston wrote that the film consisted of spaceships that [...] "take an unconscionable amount of time to <b>get</b> <b>anywhere,</b> and nothing of dramatic or human interest happens along the way". Livingston also lamented the lack of [...] "boldly characterized" [...] antagonists and battle scenes that made Star Wars fun; instead, viewers were presented with lots of talk, [...] "much of it in impenetrable spaceflight jargon". David Denby said that the slow movement of ships through space was [...] "no longer surprising and elegant" [...] after films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, and that much of the action consisted of the crew's reacting to things occurring on the viewscreen, which the New York Magazine critic considered to be [...] "like watching someone else watch television". Variety disagreed, calling the film [...] "a search-and-destroy thriller that includes all of the ingredients the TV show's fans thrive on: the philosophical dilemma wrapped in a scenario of mind control, troubles with the space ship, the dependable and understanding Kirk, the ever-logical Spock, and suspenseful take with twist ending". Scott Bukatman reviewed Star Trek - The Motion Picture in Ares Magazine #1. [...] Bukatman commented that [...] "With Star Trek, Roddenberry's trick has been to wear the mask of the humanist as he plays with his Erector set. The scale of the television series arrested his vision at a comfortable and still interesting level, but the new film has finally removed the mask." ...|$|E
