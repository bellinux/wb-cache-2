What is the {{probability}} that exactly 4 of the 10 are green? Note that although we are looking at success/failure, the data are not accurately modeled by the binomial distribution, because the probability of success on <b>each</b> <b>trial</b> is not the same, as the size of the remaining population changes as we remove each marble.|$|E

25|$|A {{controlled}} size comparison task can {{be employed}} to evaluate objectively whether a person is experiencing hemimicropsia. For <b>each</b> <b>trial,</b> a pair of horizontally aligned circles is presented on a computer screen, and the person being tested is asked to decide which circle is larger. After a set of trials, the overall pattern of responses should display a normal distance effect where the more similar the two circles, the higher the number of errors. This test is able to effectively diagnose micropsia and confirm which hemisphere is being distorted.|$|E
25|$|Although Burbank may {{not have}} been a {{scientist}} by modern standards, his lack of record keeping reflects the era in which he lived. His innovations were revolutionary, and in a time when {{there was no way to}} legally protect one's inventions, Burbank may have been cautious with the successes he decided to document. Additionally, his records {{may not have}} been coherent (to the chagrin of modern scholars) because he felt his time was better valued in the garden, not writing <b>each</b> <b>trial</b> and error down in his record book.|$|E
25|$|Tensor LEED is {{an attempt}} to reduce the {{computational}} effort needed by avoiding full LEED calculations for <b>each</b> <b>trial</b> structure. The scheme is as follows: One first defines a reference surface structure for which the I-V spectrum is calculated. Next a trial structure is created by displacing some of the atoms. If the displacements are small the trial structure can be considered as a small perturbation of the reference structure and first-order perturbation theory can be used to determine the I-V curves of a large set of trial structures.|$|E

40|$|Hedonic {{escalation}} is {{an increasing}} appreciation for each additional bite of a palatable food. Hedonic escalation {{is more likely to}} occur when (1) a palatable food consists of a complex combination of flavors and (2) a person has the ability to identify the flavors. Consequently, hedonic escalation is more prevalent when people can identify more flavors (pilot study), attend to additional flavors on <b>each</b> taste <b>trial</b> (study 1), have an opportunity to identify an additional flavor on <b>each</b> taste <b>trial</b> (study 2), and isolate distinct flavors on <b>each</b> taste <b>trial</b> (study 3). Changes in hedonic escalation can be attributed to increased sensitization to flavors as opposed to changes in the rate of habituation (study 4). Hedonic escalation can also increase consumption (study 5) and influence food choices (study 6). Collectively, these studies show that hedonic escalation is enabled by the opportunity to identify an additional source of hedonic experience on each successive taste of a food...|$|R

25|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities, Trueswell et al. {{conducted a series of}} experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on <b>each</b> <b>trial,</b> and only a single object name was presented on <b>each</b> <b>trial</b> (with varying numbers of objects). Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.|$|E
25|$|In LEED {{the exact}} atomic {{configuration}} of a surface {{is determined by}} a trial and error process where measured I-V curves are compared to computer-calculated spectra under the assumption of a model structure. From an initial reference structure a set of trial structures is created by varying the model parameters. The parameters are changed until an optimal agreement between theory and experiment is achieved. However, for <b>each</b> <b>trial</b> structure a full LEED calculation with multiple scattering corrections must be conducted. For systems with a large parameter space the need for computational time might become significant. This {{is the case for}} complex surfaces structures or when considering large molecules as adsorbates.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Corsi Span Test, this {{psychological}} test is commonly {{used to determine the}} visual-spatial memory span and the implicit visual-spatial learning abilities of an individual. Participants sit with nine wooden 3x3-cm blocks fastened before them on a 25- x 30-cm baseboard in a standard random order. The experiment taps onto the blocks a sequence pattern which participants must then replicate. The blocks are numbered on the experimenters' side to allow for efficient pattern demonstration. The sequence length increases <b>each</b> <b>trial</b> until the participant is no longer able to replicate the pattern correctly. The test can be used to measure both short-term and long-term spatial memory, depending on the length of time between test and recall.|$|E

25|$|For {{the special}} case where r is an integer, the {{negative}} binomial distribution {{is known as the}} Pascal distribution. It is the probability distribution of a certain number of failures and successes in a series of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials. For knbsp&+nbsp&r Bernoulli trials with success probability p, the negative binomial gives the probability of k successes and r failures, with a failure on the last trial. In other words, the {{negative binomial distribution}} is the probability distribution of the number of successes before the rth failure in a Bernoulli process, with probability p of successes on <b>each</b> <b>trial.</b> A Bernoulli process is a discrete time process, and so the number of trials, failures, and successes are integers.|$|E
25|$|Knox set out {{to address}} the first problem, in his article {{published}} in the November issue of the New York Medical Journal in 1913. In this paper, he put forth two new performance tests, that were not based on verbal or cultural knowledge. The Cube Imitation Test, also known as Knox Cubes, consisted of four large black cubes and one small black cube. The examiner moves the small cube slowly and deliberately in various patterns {{in relation to the}} larger four cubes. The examinee is asked to imitate the movements conducted by the examiner. <b>Each</b> <b>trial</b> increases in difficulty and complexity. He also introduced a form board test (called the Geographical Puzzle, or “G” Test), which involved fitting pieces into proper places on a board, requiring both motor coordination as well as decision making. He believed that together these two tests could determine with increased accuracy whether an emigrant was mentally deficient, as neither required specific cultural knowledge for successful performance.|$|E
25|$|Gems {{are rewarded}} after {{completion}} of each arena trial. They {{can be used to}} enhance the weapons by unlocking more ability slots and new abilities at regular intervals. <b>Each</b> <b>trial</b> contains three gems as a reward. The first requires completion, the second is a specific challenge and the third is a time trial. If the arena boss is too difficult, it is possible to complete all these challenges to earn extra gems. Forced has a Mark Combat System, where weapons cause marks on the enemies. Greater number of marks cause certain abilities to have better effects, thus making it more effective to hit a group of enemies a few times before using an ability, rather than using it at the start. Though the difficulty increases in proportion to the number of players and sharing Balfus needs communication between them, multiplayer is easier and lets the player focus on specific abilities and tactical roles instead of being forced to cover every possibility in single player; also, if a player dies, the trial can be completed as long as another survives till the end.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his research, Bateman {{conducted}} experiments using {{fruit flies}} {{in order to}} observe their copulation and sexual behavior. A total of six series of experiments were conducted with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, using three to five individuals of each sex. <b>Each</b> <b>trial</b> ran {{for three or four}} days. Some ran to completion without the transfer of the Drosophila from one environment (bottle) to another. In the others, Bateman transferred the flies and their eggs to a new bottle every day. Bateman also varied the age of the flies depending on the experiment, with an age gap between one and six days total. He never watched the flies' copulations. The flies used were from several inbred strains, which meant they could be identified by their specific inbred strain. Therefore, he inferred the number of involved mates {{based on the number of}} offspring that were later found to have mutations from both a male and a female. The difficulty that arose was that if a female Drosophila had copulated with five males and only one larva survived, Bateman would not be able to account for the other four copulations.|$|E
25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located {{on either side of the}} infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During <b>each</b> <b>trial,</b> one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.|$|E
