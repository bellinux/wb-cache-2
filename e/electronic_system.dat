25|$|A {{narrow band}} or {{strongly}} correlated <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> and degenerated ground states are important points to understand in explaining superconductivity in fullerene solids. When the inter-electron repulsion U {{is greater than}} the bandwidth, an insulating localized electron ground state is produced in the simple Mott–Hubbard model. This explains the absence of superconductivity at ambient pressure in caesium-doped C60 solids. Electron-correlation-driven localization of the t1u electrons exceeds the critical value, leading to the Mott insulator. The application of high pressure decreases the interfullerene spacing, therefore caesium-doped C60 solids turn to metallic and superconducting.|$|E
25|$|The new series, Supercar, (1960–61) {{was created}} by Anderson and Reg Hill and marked several {{important}} advances for APF. Sylvia Anderson took on a larger role and became {{a partner in the}} company. The series was also the official debut of Supermarionation, the <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> that made the marionettes more lifelike and convincing on screen. The system used the audio signal from pre-recorded tapes of the actors' voices to trigger solenoids installed in the heads of the puppets, making their lips move in synchronisation with the voices of the actors, and actresses.|$|E
25|$|Any device {{designed}} to represent data and perform computation, {{regardless of the}} physics principles it exploits and materials used to build it, must have two fundamental properties: distinguishability and conditional change of state, the latter implying the former. This means that such a device must have barriers that {{make it possible to}} distinguish between states, and that it must have the ability to control these barriers to perform conditional change of state. For example, in a digital <b>electronic</b> <b>system,</b> transistors play the role of such controllable energy barriers, making it extremely practical to perform computing with them.|$|E

During this time the playing field is set onto foam strips and a bed of nails. The nails are then pressed in the playing board as the bed raises and compresses them against the header. Afterward anchors come and are hammered into place. The anchors help secure a metal railing that keeps the balls from exiting the playing field.|$|E
25|$|Batches 4 and 5 {{were better}} built, {{eliminating}} the recurrent {{problems in the}} powerplant, and are still in service, after having been refitted {{at the end of}} the 1990s.

Batch 7 introduced a transmission system to the command vehicle, and a data system giving instantaneous vision of the state of all battle tanks and acquired targets. It also incorporated minor improvements in the visor. Batch 8 was a modernisation of the <b>electronic</b> <b>system,</b> and Batch 9 replaced the thermal imaging ATHOS by a SAGEM Iris with better resolution.|$|E

25|$|Some {{flushometer}} models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a flush valve allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly into the toilet bowl or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the <b>electronic</b> <b>system.</b> In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|E
25|$|At the season-opening , Räikkönen {{qualified}} 15th in {{the spare}} car. In the race {{he took the}} lead before being caught speeding in the pitlane, caused by a software glitch in the car's <b>electronic</b> <b>system.</b> Räikkönen held off Michael Schumacher to finish 3rd. In Malaysia, Räikkönen won his first race after starting from 7th on the grid. During the next round in Brazil, Räikkönen was declared the winner after the race was stopped on lap 55. According to the rules the winner is decided by the race order as of two laps before the race stopped, i.e. lap 53. However a week later, evidence emerged that Giancarlo Fisichella was on lap 56 when the race stopped, therefore the winner was decided by the order at lap 54. This granted the win to Fisichella, with Räikkönen 2nd.|$|E
25|$|The latest {{development}} and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is the Electronic Timing System. The bird's arrival is recorded automatically. When using an <b>electronic</b> <b>system,</b> the pigeon fancier {{does not even}} have to be at the loft to clock the birds as they return. Birds are fitted with a band that has a tiny RFID chip in it which can be read when the bird comes home. At the home loft the electronic scanning records the pigeons arrival. The pad or antenna is placed at the entry point to the loft entrance and as the pigeon crosses it the electronic band is scanned. The clock is attached to the antennas. The serial number of the transponder ring is recorded along with the time of arrival. This is very similar to transponder timing systems used in human races.|$|E
