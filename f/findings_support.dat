25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal. The high porosity of the interior of Phobos (based on the density of 1.88 g/cm3, voids are estimated to comprise 25 to 35 percent of Phobos's volume) is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin. Observations of Phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates, which are well known {{from the surface of}} Mars. The spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites, again pointing away from an asteroidal origin. Both sets of <b>findings</b> <b>support</b> an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} whether {{certain types of}} sexual sensations should be {{accurately}} classified as orgasms, including female orgasms caused by G-spot stimulation alone, and the demonstration of extended or continuous orgasms lasting several minutes or even an hour. The question centers around the clinical definition of orgasm, but this way of viewing orgasm is merely physiological, while there are also psychological, endocrinological, and neurological definitions of orgasm. In these and similar cases, the sensations experienced are subjective {{and do not necessarily}} involve the involuntary contractions characteristic of orgasm. However, the sensations in both sexes are extremely pleasurable and are often felt throughout the body, causing a mental state that is often described as transcendental, and with vasocongestion and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For example, modern <b>findings</b> <b>support</b> distinction between ejaculation and male orgasm. For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms.|$|E

40|$|Background: Computed {{tomography}} {{pulmonary angiography}} (CTPA) {{is commonly used}} as the first-line imaging test in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Other CTPA findings may provide an alternative explanation for the signs and symptoms in this group of patients; however, the clinical impact of these findings is not clear. Aims: To assess the clinical impact of <b>findings</b> <b>supporting</b> alternative <b>findings</b> on CTPA ordered in the diagnostic work-up for PE, in terms of diagnostic or therapeutic consequences. Besides, we investigated whether <b>findings</b> <b>supporting</b> alternative diagnoses were already established or highly suspected before CT-scanning. Methods: In 203 consecutive patients with suspected PE, the clinical implication of abnormalities on CTPA was prospectively evaluated. Alternative diagnoses were defined on clinical grounds prior to performing CTPA; afterwards, all findings were systematically registered. Diagnostic and therapeutic consequences were assessed using a priori defined criteria. Results: A total of 39 (19 %) patients were diagnosed with PE and 61 (30 %) had no abnormality on CTPA. Before CTPA, alternative diagnoses were suspected in 97 (48 %) patients. <b>Findings</b> <b>supporting</b> an alternative diagnosis were detected in 88 (43 %) patients. In 28 patients {{this was a new}} finding, in 18 patients, a conclusive alternative diagnosis for the complaints was made based on the outcome of the CTPA. Overall, <b>findings</b> <b>supporting</b> alternative diagnoses had therapeutic consequences in 10 (4. 9 %) patients. Incidental findings (nodules/lymph nodes) requiring diagnostic procedures were present in 17 (8. 4 %) patients, of which one (0. 5 %) had a therapeutic consequence. Conclusion: In patients undergoing CTPA for suspected PE, <b>findings</b> <b>supporting</b> alternative diagnoses were found in almost half of the patients. However, in only few patients this had therapeutic consequences. Hence, CTPA should principally be used to find or exclude PE in high probability patients but not to establish an alternative diagnosis...|$|R
