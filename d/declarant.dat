5|$|If the Community Committee {{accepts a}} {{community}} declaration, it must then refer the declaration {{to the appropriate}} Community Sub-Committee for consideration. If the Community Sub-Committee concludes that the <b>declarant</b> belongs to that community, it must issue a community certificate to the applicant. Otherwise, it must inform the <b>declarant</b> in writing that the application has been rejected. The decision must be communicated to the <b>declarant</b> no later than the eve of nomination day. All decisions of the Community Committee and its Sub-Committees are final, and a community certificate is conclusive of the matters it certifies– they {{are not subject to}} appeal or review in any court.|$|E
5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the <b>declarant</b> did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the <b>declarant</b> does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself {{to be a member of}} the community to which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a <b>declarant</b> who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a <b>declarant</b> who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E

This is the exception that may apply to the 'police officer' scenario listed above. The victim's cries of help were made under the stress of a startling event, and the victim is still under {{the stress of the}} event, as is evidenced by the victim's crying and visible shaking. An excited utterance {{does not have to be}} made at the same time of the startling event. A statement made minutes, hours or even days after the startling event can be excited utterances, so long as the <b>declarant</b> is still under the stress of the startling event. However, the more time that elapses between a startling event and the declarant's statement, the more the statements will be looked upon with disfavor.|$|E
25|$|Declaration against interest: A {{statement}} that would incriminate or expose the <b>declarant</b> to liability {{to such an}} extent that it can be assumed he would only make such a statement if it were true. It would be assumed that one would lie to further one's interests, so a statement against his interests (such as exposing oneself to criminal or civil liability) likely would not be made unless it were true.|$|E

40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{decision}} in Ohio v. Clark, provides an occasion {{to take stock}} of the Sixth Amendment Right to Confrontation since the court’s landmark 2004 {{decision in}} Crawford v. Washington. Crawford strengthened a defendant’s right to confront his accusers face-to-face, underscoring that cross-examination is the constitutionally preferred method for testing the reliability of accusatory statements. Clark could eliminate that right {{in a wide range of}} cases where, although the reliability of a <b>declarant’s</b> out-of-court statements is critically important, a defendant has no right to confrontation...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Rules of Evidence (or “the Rules”) {{identify}} hearsay that is admissible, {{notwithstanding the}} classic hearsay prohibition, by delineating categories of hearsay statements {{that may be}} admitted into evidence. For example, “dying declarations” of now-unavailable <b>declarants</b> may be admitted in homicide prosecutions or civil cases. “Excited utterances” relating to a startling event also may be admitted for their truth. The purported justification for admitting certain categories of hearsay rests upon the inherent reliability of human statements uttered in certain contexts, as well as litigants’ need for crucial evidence to build cases...|$|R
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), reformulated {{the standard}} for determining when the admission of hearsay statements in criminal cases is permitted under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Crawford gives enhanced protection to defendants when the hearsay offered against them is testimonial in nature. When a statement is deliberately accusatory, or when the <b>declarant</b> knows that the statement {{is likely to be}} used in the prosecution of the defendant for a crime, the need for face-to-face confrontation is at its highest. When statements are directly accusatory, the defense needs an opportunity to explore the accuser's motives. Where statements are the product of police interrogation, there is a need to ensure that the testimony is not the product of improper coercion or intimidation.|$|E
500|$|In Crawford v. Washington (2004), the Supreme Court {{held that}} the Confrontation Clause bars the [...] "admission of {{testimonial}} statements of a witness who did not appear at trial" [...] unless pursuant {{to one of the}} [...] "exceptions established {{at the time of the}} founding." [...] "hen the <b>declarant</b> appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements [...] [...] [...] so long as the <b>declarant</b> is present at trial to defend or explain it."

50|$|The {{statement}} must {{relate to}} the circumstances or {{the cause of the}} <b>declarant's</b> own impending death. For example, in the dying declaration of Clifton Chambers in 1988, he stated that ten years earlier, he had helped his son bury a man whom the son had killed by accident. The statement was sufficient cause to justify a warrant for a search on the son's property, and the man's body was indeed found. However, there was no physical evidence of a crime, and since Chambers was not the victim, his dying declaration was not admissible as evidence, and the son was never brought to trial.|$|R

[...] The advisory committee comments make clear that the Hillmon {{is the source of the}} exception.|$|R
40|$|European Customs {{officials}} have used fictive patent rights {{to justify the}} seizure of lawful generic medicines produced in India and destined for non- European markets. Following a public outcry and initiation of two WTO complaints, the EU has proposed amendments to Border Regulations Measure 1383 / 2003. The Proposed Border Regulation {{in its current form}} will not adequately resolve the risk of interception in Europe of medicines lawfully manufactured and exported from India and destined for lawful import and consumption in a non-EU country. This analysis concludes that multiple weaknesses remain in the Border Regulations, including: (1) continued coverage of alleged patent and supplemental protection certificate infringement claims that can be based on fictional patent status under national law; the addition of utility models; and continued coverage of design rights and civil trademark infringement matters that are more appropriately addressed in ordinary court proceedings; (2) inappropriate application of the law of the in-transit country instead of the law of the importing country when assessing an IP infringement claim; (3) unclear directives to 2 ̆ 2 consider 2 ̆ 2 the risk of diversion to EU markets with no explicit prohibition against seizing in-transit medicines in the absence of such a showing and without requirement of clear and convincing evidence of an imminent diversion by an identified party; (4) insufficient opportunities to be heard for <b>declarants</b> and holders of goods; and (5) insufficient remedies for <b>declarants</b> and holders of goods and for purchasers and consumers who are proximately harmed by unsuccessful border applications...|$|R

2500|$|In {{order for}} the {{statement}} to satisfy the [...] "out-of-court declarant" [...] element of hearsay, very simply stated, the statement must have been made outside of the courtroom that the present proceeding is taking place in—meaning that if the statement was made in another courtroom, it is still made by an [...] "out-of-court" [...] <b>declarant.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Declarations {{of present}} state of mind: Much like a present-sense {{impression}} describes the outside world, declarant's statement {{to the effect of}} [...] "I am angry!" [...] or [...] "I am Napoleon!" [...] will be admissible to prove that the <b>declarant</b> was indeed angry, or did indeed believe himself to be Napoleon at that time. Used in cases where the declarant's mental state is at issue. Present-state-of-mind statements are also used as circumstantial evidence of subsequent acts committed by the <b>declarant,</b> like his saying, [...] "I'm gonna go buy some groceries and get the oil changed in my car on my way home from work." [...] Another exception is statements made in the course of medical treatment, i.e., statements made by a patient to a medical professional to help in diagnosis and treatment. Any statements contained therein that attribute fault or causation to an individual will generally not be admissible under this exception.|$|E
5000|$|The 2001 Census of India [...] counted only 177 Brahmos in India, but {{the number}} of {{followers}} (Brahmo Samajists) who constitute the wider community of Brahmo Samaj (assembly for Brahmo worship) is significantly higher, and reliably estimated at about 20, 000 Sadharan Brahmo Samajists, 10, 000 other Brahmo denominations and 8, 000,000 declared Adi Dharmists. Since the Brahmo Samaj does not sanction caste, many low caste Brahmo converts in Upper India, benefiting under India's social development policies, prefer to declare themselves as followers of Adi Dharm, a practice fostered by the Brahmo Samaj of North India since the 1931 census. A state-wise study by the Brahmo Conference Organisation has tabulated 7. 83 million Adi Dharm <b>declarants</b> in the 2001 Census.|$|R
40|$|In Michigan v. Bryant, a dying victim {{lying in}} a parking lot {{provided}} responding officers with the identity of the man who shot him. In determining whether the subsequent use of the deceased <b>declarant’s</b> statement at trial violated the Confrontation Clause, the Bryant Court applied the testimonial versus nontestimonial analysis established in the Court’s previous decision, Crawford v. Washington. Holding that testimonial hearsay covered statements involving past events, while nontestimonial statements were directed at an “ongoing emergency,” the Bryant Court applied a multi-factor, totality of the circumstances analysis and found that the deceased <b>declarant’s</b> identification had been directed at the ongoing emergency. As such, the hearsay statement was nontestimonial and, accordingly, outside the protection of the Confrontation Clause. Bryant, was roundly (and deservedly) criticized by all commentators, who unanimously accused the Court of making a shambles of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence. To an extent, Crawford also shared the commentator’s blame. But for the authors of this article, it is the Court’s Confrontation Clause analysis in Davis v. Washington, a case involving a 911 call, which is truly to blame for the debacle that is Bryant; for Davis carelessly equated “nontestimonial” with a decontextualized, commonplace notion of an “ongoing emergency. ” That was the mistake that led to Bryant. As this article will demonstrate, the issue for purposes of Confrontation Clause analysis in cases like Davis and Bryant is not whether or not there exists an ongoing emergency in some general sense; but rather whose emergency it is. If the emergency is the government’s, then any statements made by citizens to help the government address that emergency are testimonial. If the emergency is one in which a citizen is seeking the government’s help (regardless of whether or not it’s also the government’s emergency), any statements by the citizen are nontestimonial...|$|R
