500|$|Founded in 1997 by since-then retired teacher Sigurður Hjartarson and now run {{by his son}} Hjörtur Gísli Sigurðsson, {{the museum}} grew out of an {{interest}} in penises that began during Sigurður's childhood when {{he was given a}} cattle whip made from a bull's penis. He obtained the organs of Icelandic animals from sources around the country, with acquisitions ranging from the [...] <b>front</b> <b>tip</b> of a blue whale penis to the [...] baculum of a hamster, which can only be seen with a magnifying glass. The museum claims that its collection includes the penises of elves and trolls, though, as Icelandic folklore portrays such creatures as being invisible, they cannot be seen. The collection also features phallic art and crafts such as lampshades made from the scrotums of bulls.|$|E

[...] The TIP sent the Turkistan Brigade (...) to {{participate}} in the Syrian Civil War, notably in the 2015 Jisr al-Shughur offensive. The TIP leader in Syria was Abu Rida al-Turkestani (أبو رضا التركستاني). Al-Turkestani gave a speech during the Jisr al-Shughur offensive, inviting [...] "Muslims" [...] from [...] "East Turkestan" [...] to come to Sham to [...] "kill" [...] "Nusayris" [...] (Alawites). Denouncing the U.S., he said that Muslims are oppressed [...] "in the land of Afghanistan, and in Turkestan, and in Waziristan, and in Burma, and in Bilad ash-Sham". In May 2015, al-Turkestani was killed by the Syrian army in Jisr al-Shugour. TIP members in Syria fight with the al-Nusra Front, since it is allied with al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan and conducted suicide bombings for the <b>front.</b> <b>TIP</b> members have been killed in battle in Syria, and the party eulogized members who participated in suicide bombings and were killed in action in Jisr al Shughur. [...] A Jabhat Al Nusra Jihadist called Abu Mohamed Al-Ansari, an al-Nusra Front member, said: [...] "The battle was good, praise be to God. The brothers from all the groups started working together and coordinating. Each faction is responsible for a side. The majority were immigrant brothers from Turkestan. They are the ones who attacked the important points." [...] Front spokesman Abu Maria al-Qahtani said that Muslims were [...] "oppressed" [...] in [...] "Turkestan" [...] and Nusra needs to [...] "defend" [...] them. The TIP joined the offensive on the Al-Ghab plain with al-Qaeda-affiliated Jund al-Aqsa against the Syrian army, calling the Syrian army (disparagingly) [...] "Nusayri". The Turkistan Islamic Party and the al-Nusra Front launched a joint operation which overran the Syrian military's Abu Dhuhur airbase. The Turkistan Islamic Party's Islam Awazi released photos of its fighters in Syria. The Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party, the Taliban-allied Uzbek Imam Bukhari Jamaat, the al-Qaeda-allied Uzbek Katibat al Tawhid wal Jihad and the Jund al-Aqsa cooperated on the Al Ghab plain to conquer crucial villages, with the TIP conducting suicide bombings in Jisr al Shughur and overrunning Abu Dhuhur with Jund al-Aqsa and al-Nusrah. The Turkistan Islamic Party released photos of their Uyghur fighters at Abu Dhuhur. A mass execution of 56 captured Syrian soldiers was carried out by the Turkestan Islamic Party in Syria with Jabhat al-Nusra at Abu al-Duhur. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that Chechens who defected to ISIS were replaced with the Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party, allied with Al-Qaeda.|$|E

50|$|Protome {{was named}} {{on the basis}} of several unique characteristics, or autapomorphies. The first autapomorphy is the flat shape of the basitubera, an area {{at the base of the}} skull in front of its {{attachment}} point with the neck. Another is that bony projections called exoccipital prongs at the back of the skull make up the top margin of the foramen magnum, the hole through which the spinal cord enters the skull. A third autapomorphy is a small depression or fossa surrounding the <b>front</b> <b>tip</b> of a hole in the lower jaw called the mandibular fenestra. These features were used to distinguish PEFO 34034 as a new genus and species, distinct from Leptosuchus adamanensis. Protome and Leptosuchus are similar in that both have broad squamosals and holes called supratemporal fenestrae that are located on top of the skull.|$|E
5000|$|Until the 1990s, {{the genus}} had been ignored {{as a species}} of Megalosaurus. However, with growing concern over what exactly is {{constituted}} by Megalosaurus, Magnosaurus has been generally separated as its own genus. Also, there are morphological differences: for example, possible Megalosaurus tibiae are compressed at the far end, unlike those of Magnosaurus. [...] Rauhut (2003) considered it and Eustreptospondylus {{to be the same}} genus, because the two share a similarly expanded <b>front</b> <b>tip</b> of the dentary and enlarged third dentary tooth. He therefore renamed Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis a Magnosaurus oxoniensis but this has not been generally followed. [...] Reviews have found it to most likely be a basal tetanuran, probably a megalosaurid. A detailed redescription by Roger Benson in 2010 concluded Magnosaurus was valid taxon, a megalosaurid megalosauroid, and at about 175 million years old the oldest certain known member of the Tetanurae.|$|E
50|$|Dufour wears acrylic {{artificial}} fingernails on each {{finger of}} his right hand, aside from his thumb. The nails help to create a crisp, clean sound. Regarding these nails, he buys commonly available acrylic nails from a store, and then cuts them down to size. After gluing the nails on, he cuts and files the nails to his preferred length. These fake nails are not worn/glued over the entire fingernail, rather, they are worn on {{approximately half of the}} <b>front</b> <b>tip</b> of the nail. Commonly, he uses a Dunlop thumbpick which he files down so that the tip of the pick is shorter and at a more comfortable angle for his playing style. As is commonly seen, Dufour has two rings on his right index and ring finger. These are his wedding and engagement rings. The reason he wears them on his right hand is so that they do not hit the neck of the guitar while he plays. The rings serve no purpose in his playing.|$|E
40|$|The {{rising cost}} of jet fuel has renewed {{interest}} in contrarotating open rotor propulsion systems. Contemporary design methods offer the potential to maintain the inherently high aerodynamic efficiency of open rotors while greatly reducing their noise output, something that was not feasible in the 1980 's designs. The primary source mechanisms of open rotor noise generation {{are thought to be}} the front rotor wake and tip vortex interacting with the aft rotor. In this paper, advanced measurement techniques and high-fidelity prediction tools are used to gain insight into the relative importance of the contributions to the open rotor noise signature of the front rotor wake and rotor tip vortex. The measurements include three-dimensional particle image velocimetry of the intra-rotor flowfield and the acoustic field of a model-scale open rotor. The predictions provide the unsteady flowfield and the associated acoustic field. The results suggest that while the <b>front</b> rotor <b>tip</b> vortex can have a significant influence on the blade passing tone noise produced by the aft rotor, the front rotor wake plays the decisive role in the generation of the interaction noise produced {{as a result of the}} unsteady aerodynamic interaction of the two rotors. At operating conditions typical of takeoff and landing operations, the interaction noise level is easily on par with that generated by the individual rotors, and in some cases is even higher. This suggests that a comprehensive approach to reducing open rotor noise should include techniques for mitigating the wake of the front rotor as well as eliminating the interaction of the <b>front</b> rotor <b>tip</b> vortex with the aft rotor blade tip...|$|R
