5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> soldering, malleability, and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> installation.|$|E
5|$|From its {{discovery}} in 1875 until {{the era of}} semiconductors, the primary uses of gallium were high-temperature thermometrics and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> melting (some such being liquid at room temperature).
