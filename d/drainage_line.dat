25|$|Following {{the failure}} of his first steam-driven plough, Fowler reverted to the design used for his second horse-driven plough. His new design {{consisted}} of a steam engine placed {{in a corner of}} the field driving a winch. A rope led from the winch along the side of the field, around a securely anchored pulley and across the field to the mole plough. As the winch drew in the rope the mole plough was drawn across the field digging a drainage channel as it went. The engine also had a second winch with a rope passing round the same anchored pulley and then passing across the field and around a second pulley and back to the plough. This second rope would be used to drag the plough back to its starting point after completing a <b>drainage</b> <b>line.</b> Both pulleys would then be re-anchored at both ends of the next channel to be dug and the ploughing process would be repeated. The steam plough was demonstrated at the Royal Agricultural Society of England meeting at Lincoln in 1854.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Corn Belt is {{underlain}} by extensive <b>drainage</b> tile <b>lines</b> {{to support}} agricultural production, which significantly altered regional hydrology and nutrient transport processes. In, many cases, {{records of the}} precise location of main <b>drainage</b> tile <b>lines</b> are unavailable and can only be approximated using geospatial analyses. Using high-resolution topographic data, we estimated locations of drainage tile systems and compared the estimates to locations based on digitized tile maps {{for a set of}} drainage districts in Boone County, Iowa. We estimated spatial correspondence by percent error between generated <b>drainage</b> tile <b>lines</b> and actual locations of <b>drainage</b> <b>lines.</b> Our analysis suggest that the estimated drainage tile systems are reasonable representations of recorded main <b>drainage</b> <b>lines</b> for the set of drainage districts. This method of approximating <b>drainage</b> tile <b>line</b> locations can assist in estimating <b>drainage</b> tile <b>line</b> systems that do not belong to drainage districts and contain no records...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying {{functional}} connectivity {{is essential}} for understanding factors that limit or promote animal dispersal in fragmented landscapes. Topography {{is a major factor}} influencing the movement behavior of many animal species, and therefore the extent of functional connectivity between habitat patches. For pond-breeding frogs, areas of low topographic relief (such as streams or <b>drainage</b> <b>lines)</b> offer damp microhabitats that can facilitate movement through otherwise dry landscapes. However, the extent of topographic bias of frog movements has rarely been quantified. We used a replicated study to compare captures in high- and low-relief transects, for three species from a pond-breeding frog community in southeastern Australia. We captured frogs significantly more often on low-relief transects. However, capture rates decreased with increasing distance from water at similar rates on both high-relief and low-relief transects, and we observed few differences between adult and juvenile movements. Our results suggest that although low-relief <b>drainage</b> <b>lines</b> are important for the pond-breeding frogs in question, ecologists and landscape managers should not discount the role of high-relief locations. Because low-relief <b>drainage</b> <b>lines</b> represent a low proportion of the pond margin, > 90 % of movements are likely to occur across high-relief locations. Therefore, for the species that we studied, buffer zones designed to conserve only hydrological networks would provide insufficient protection of frequently used pond margins, while <b>drainage</b> <b>lines</b> are unlikely to act as vital networks facilitating connectivity between breeding ponds. Our study suggests that movement across slopes may be most important for facilitating functional connectivity...|$|R
