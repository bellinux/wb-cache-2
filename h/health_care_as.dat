25|$|While {{there are}} {{certainly}} programs available {{for use by the}} elderly in Thailand, questions of equity have risen since their introduction.

However, over 96% of the nation has health insurance with varying degrees of care available.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{problem with the}} quality of American medicine is that we’ve failed to view delivery of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>as</b> a science. The tasks of medical science fall into three buckets. One is understanding disease biology. One is finding effective therapies. And one is ensuring those therapies are delivered effectively. That third bucket has been almost totally ignored by research funders, government, and academia. It’s viewed as the art of medicine. That’s a mistake, a huge mistake. And from a taxpayer’s perspective it’s outrageous.|$|E

25|$|One such {{position}} is Obama's stance on health care. Obama has repeatedly {{said that he}} wants to see that every American has the option of having affordable <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>as</b> good as every U. S. Senator has. He has proposed a major overhaul of the nation’s health care system, aimed at covering the nearly 45 million uninsured Americans, reducing premium costs for everyone else, and breaking what he asserted was “the stranglehold” that the biggest drug and insurance companies have on the health care market.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} The Great Bird Flu Hoax, Mercola appears {{to take a}} {{stronger}} anti-pharmaceutical industry stance by accusing them of a fear-mongering marketing campaign against the public. In supporting this stance, Mercola often has wholly critical views of those working in governmental <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>as</b> well as towards international health organizations. He argues at length that concern over swine flu and the resulting immunizations were actually false alarms put forth to terrify the public. The World Health Organization reports that by August 1, 2010, about 18,500 deaths {{have been caused by}} the H1N1 pandemic influenza.|$|E
25|$|While Martin's {{record as}} finance {{minister}} was lauded {{in business and}} financial circles, there were undeniable costs. Some of these costs {{took the form of}} reduced government services, affecting the operations and achievement of the mandate of federal and provincial departments. This was probably most noticeable in <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>as</b> major reductions in federal funding to the provinces meant significant cuts in service delivery. Martin's tactics, including those of using contributor's funds from RCMP, Military and Civil Service pension plans and Employment Insurance, created further controversy. CAW economist Jim Stanford said that a combination of a spending freeze at 1994 levels and lower interest rates would have eliminated the deficit in two years through economic growth alone, without the reduction in services.|$|E

25|$|The {{needs of}} mothers during {{pregnancy}} and childbirth often {{conflict with the}} demands of the prison system. “In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics stated that, on average, 5% of women who enter into state prisons are pregnant and in jails 6% of women are pregnant”. Very few of these women receive prenatal care, which can be very detrimental to both the mother and child, especially when coupled with inmates’ histories of inadequate <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>as</b> well as sexual, physical and substance abuse. Most of these pregnancies are deemed as high risk. Additionally, a lack of maternity clothes and resources to deal with premature births, false labors, and miscarriages pose serious challenges to prisoners. Furthermore, incarcerated women are a source of free labor for private companies. It is recorded that if women decline to work, then their medicinal needs are not fulfilled. This becomes a major issue for pregnant women who may not physically be able to work but are in dire need of medical care. Most pregnant women are shackled on grounds of security in labor and delivery. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals established that is unconstitutional in 2009, and prohibited restraint of women during labor.|$|E
25|$|Bedouin {{women face}} {{many of the}} same {{problems}} in terms of accessing <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>as</b> do Bedouin men in the Negev. To begin with, infrastructure in Bedouin towns is often underdeveloped or non-existent. In addition to restricting access to health care, this has the potential to create its own health problems, especially in the unrecognized villages. For example, in many unrecognized townships, the absence of a waste disposal system means that trash is deposited into a large, open-air pit. This can cause a myriad of health problems stemming from improper sanitation. Moreover, Bedouins often face both a cultural and a language barrier when seeking medical attention. A relative dearth of Arabic-speaking doctors (and even fewer Arabic-speaking specialists) means that medical attention is often given in Hebrew. Not all Negev Bedouin speak Hebrew, and those that do speak it as a second language. This is especially problematic for those requiring more specialized or intensive care, which often requires strict adherence to certain guidelines. When those guidelines are not fully understood, further health complications can arise. Finally, there are simply not enough doctors to fully serve the needs of the Bedouin population. In the seven recognized Bedouin towns in the Negev, there are a total of seven private pharmacies and 27 family health clinics operated by the Ministry of Health. In 2009, the total population of these towns was near 120,000.|$|E

500|$|As a candidate, Carter had {{proposed}} {{health care reform}} that included key features of Kennedy's national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must be changed to preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in so as to not interfere with Carter's paramount domestic policy objective—balancing the federal budget. Kennedy and labor compromised and made the requested changes, but broke with Carter in July 1978 when he would not commit to pursuing a single bill with a fixed schedule for phasing-in comprehensive coverage. Frustrated by Carter's budgetary concerns and political caution, in a December 1978 speech on national health insurance at the Democratic midterm convention, Kennedy said regarding liberal goals overall that [...] "sometimes a party must sail against the wind" [...] and in particular should provide <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a basic right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few." ...|$|E
