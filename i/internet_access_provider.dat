Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in New York, London, Vienna, Toronto, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago and Pittsburgh. The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench. Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like Ricochet, various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as smartphones in general come with Internet access through the phone network.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of employee perceptions of strategy implementation obstacles on organisation performance. Research on literature review indicated scarce or paucity studies on perceptions of employees on strategy implementation obstacles and their influence on organisation performance, hence, the need for this study to fill that gap. Employees within the <b>Internet</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Providers</b> companies of Zimbabwe participated in the study and 133 responses were received from the questionnaire that was distributed. Questionnaires were distributed through multiple channels that includes electronic emails, electronic survey and physical copies. The results showed that employee perceptions of strategy implementation obstacles positively influences organisation performance. A significant relationship was found between perceptions of communication, performance management and organisation variables as predicting organisation performance. Prevalent indications from the results showed that resources and environment were perceived negatively and were not statistically significant in determining organisational performance among the <b>Internet</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Providers</b> indiscriminately impeding organisation performance. In addition, leadership and strategy formulation were not statistically significant in predicting organisational performance. The results on leadership and resources were unique as they contradicted most previous research.
