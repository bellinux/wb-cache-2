40|$|We {{have used}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics to study changes in lift generation and vortex dynamics for Reynolds numbers (Re) between 8 and 128. The immersed boundary method was used to model a two-dimensional wing through one stroke cycle. We calculated lift and drag coefficients {{as a function of}} time and related changes in lift to the shedding or attachment of the leading and trailing edge vortices. We find that the fluid dynamics around the wing fall into two distinct patterns. For Re� 64, leading and trailing edge vortices are alternately shed behind the wing, forming the von Karman vortex street. For Re� 32, the leading and trailing edge vortices remain attached to the Summary wing during each ‘half stroke’. In three-dimensional studies, large lift forces are produced by ‘vortical asymmetry ’ when the leading edge vortex remains attached to the wing for the duration of each <b>half</b> <b>stroke</b> and the trailing edge vortex is shed. Our two-dimensional study suggests that this asymmetry is lost for Re below some critical value (between 32 and 64), resulting in lower lift forces.

40|$|Hummingbirds {{have the}} {{smallest}} body size and highest wingbeat frequencies of all flying vertebrates, so they represent one endpoint {{for evaluating the}} effects of body size on sustained muscle function and flight performance. Other bird species vary neuromuscular recruitment and contractile behavior to accomplish flight {{over a wide range}} of speeds, typically exhibiting a Ushaped curve with maxima at the slowest and fastest flight speeds. To test whether the high wingbeat frequencies and aerodynamically active upstroke of hummingbirds lead to different patterns, we flew rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus, 3 g body mass, 42 Hz wingbeat frequency) in a variable-speed wind tunnel (0 – 10 ms– 1). We measured neuromuscular activity in the pectoralis (PECT) and supracoracoideus (SUPRA) muscles using electromyography (EMG, N 4 birds), and we measured changes in PECT length using sonomicrometry (N 1). Differing markedly from the pattern in other birds, PECT deactivation occurred before the start of downstroke and the SUPRA was deactivated before the start of upstroke. The relative amplitude of EMG signal in the PECT and SUPRA varied according to a U-shaped curve with flight speed; additionally, the onset of SUPRA activity became relatively later in the wingbeat at intermediate flight speeds (4 and 6 ms– 1). Variation in the relative amplitude of EMG was comparable with that observed in other birds but the timing of muscle activity was different. These data indicate the high wingbeat frequency of hummingbirds limits the time available for flight muscle relaxation before the next <b>half</b> <b>stroke</b> of a wingbeat. Unlike in a previous study that reported single-twitch EMG signals in the PECT of hovering hummingbirds, across all flight speeds we observed 2. 9 ± 0. 8 spikes per contraction in the PECT and 3. 8 ± 0. 8 spikes per contraction in the SUPRA. Muscle strain in the PECT was 10. 8 ± 0. 5 %, the lowest reported for a flying bird, and average strain rate was 7. 4 ± 0. 2 muscle lengthss– 1. Among species of birds, PECT strain scales proportional to body mass to the 0. 2 power (!Mb 0. 2) using species data and !Mb 0. 3 using independent contrasts.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in developing micro air vehicles (MAVs) {{for a variety of}} both civil and military uses has driven significant research into the aerodynamics of natural flyers, such as insects, birds and bats. Insects, in particular, exhibit desirable flight characteristics that MAV designers wish to incorporate into their designs, however our understanding of how these animals fly is still limited. Research into insect flight has shown that they employ a number of unsteady mechanisms, the most prevalent of these being the formation of a leading-edge vortex (LEV) which provides the wing with enhanced lift. While this research has greatly improved our understanding of insect flight, the effect of the wing's shape on these unsteady mechanisms is not well understood. This thesis describes an investigation into the effect of two wing morphological parameters, aspect ratio and camber, on the flow structures around flapping and rotating wings in an insect-like flight regime. The effect of wing aspect ratio is first explored at different Reynolds numbers using a numerical model of an altered fruit fly wing revolving at a constant angular velocity. Increasing the Reynolds number for an aspect ratio of 2. 91 resulted {{in the development of a}} dual LEV structure, however increasing aspect ratio at a fixed Reynolds number generated the same flow structures. This result shows that the effects of Reynolds number and aspect ratio are linked. An alternate flow scaling method, using the wing span as the characteristic length, is presented to decouple the effects of Reynolds number from those of aspect ratio. This resulted in a span-based Reynolds number, which can be used to independently describe the development of the LEV. Indeed, universal behaviour was found for various parameters using this scaling. The effect of aspect ratio on the vortex structures was then assessed at different span-based Reynolds numbers and it was found the wing aspect ratio had the effect of shortening the wing's chord length relative to a fixed LEV size. Scaling the flow using the wing span was found to apply for revolving wings at large angles of attack, such that the flow separates from the leading-edge and a strong spanwise velocity is generated on the leeward side of the wing. These conditions are typical of those seen in nature, and hence this scaling could be applied to similar investigations involving insects and birds as well as nature-mimicking MAVs. The effect of wing aspect ratio was then explored at different advance ratios using a numerical model that mimicked a flapping insect wing. It was demonstrated that increasing the advance ratio enhances vorticity production at the leading-edge during the downstroke, and this results in more rapid growth of the LEV for non-zero advance ratios. This effect, combined with that of aspect ratio, determines whether the LEV remains stably attached to the wing or if it is shed. For high advance ratios and large aspect ratios the LEV was observed to quickly grow to envelop the entire wing during the early stages of the downstroke. Continued rotation of the wing resulted in the LEV being eventually shed as part of a vortex loop that peels away from the wing's tip. It is shown that the shedding of the LEV for high aspect ratio wings at non-zero advance ratios leads to reduced aerodynamic performance of these wings. This helps to explain why a number of insect species have evolved to have low aspect ratio wings, as they outperform high aspect ratios across a wide range of flight speeds. Finally, wing deformation is observed during the flight of some insect species, which results in the wing becoming cambered throughout each <b>half</b> <b>stroke.</b> In this study, the effect of wing camber on the flow structures and aerodynamic forces for insect-like wings is investigated using the rotating-wing numerical model. Both positive and negative camber was investigated at Reynolds numbers of 120 and 1500, along with the chordwise location of maximum camber. It was found that negatively cambered wings produce similar LEV structures to non-cambered wings at both Reynolds numbers, but high positive camber resulted in the formation of multiple streamwise vortices at the higher Reynolds number, which disrupt the development of the main LEV. Despite this, positively cambered wings were found to produce higher lift on drag ratios than flat or negatively cambered wings. It was determined that a region of low pressure near the wing's leading edge, combined with the curvature of the wing's upper surface in this region, resulted in a vertical tilting of the net force vector for positively cambered wings, which explains how insects can benefit from wing camber...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} mechanisms employed durng {{the flight}} of the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, have been investigated through smoke visualization studies with tethered moths. Details of the flow around the wings and of the overall wake structure were recorded as stereophotographs and high-speed video sequences. The changes in flow which accompanied increases in flight speed from 0. 4 to 5. 7 m s- 1 were analysed. The wake consists of an alternating series of horizontal and vertical vortex rings which are generated by successive down- and upstrokes, respectively. The downstroke produces significantly more lift than the upstroke due to a leading-edge vortex which is stabilized by a radia flow moving out towards the wingtip. The leading-edge vortex grew in size with increasing forward flight velocity. Such a phenomenon is proposed as a likely mechanism for lift enhancement in many insect groups. During supination, vorticity is shed from the leading edge as postulated in the 'flex' mechanism. This vorticity would enhance upstroke lift if it was recaptured diring subsequent translation, but it is not. Instead, the vorticity is left behind and the upstroke circulation builds up slowly. A small jet provides additional thrust as the trailing edges approach {{at the end of}} the upstroke. The stereophotographs also suggest that the bound circulation may not be reversed between <b>half</b> <b>strokes</b> at the fastest flight speeds...|$|R

Its fur is extremely fine and dense, insulating {{the body and}} providing buoyancy in water (Grant and Dawson, 1978). Broad webbed feet are used for swimming and maneuvering in the water. A visual examination showed that the platypus swims by alternate rowing motions of its forelimbs (Howell, 1937; Grant, 1989), which are oriented in the horizontal plane. During swimming, the hindfeet are held immobile against {{the sides of the}} body and together with the broad, compressed tail are used solely for maneuvering (Howell, 1937).

40|$|The {{emission}} of VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) {{has been identified}} as a significant source of hydrocarbon pollution. It is many sources of VOC emission. A major one in Norway is caused by the offshore oil industry. In the Norwegian part of the North Sea, the contribution from shuttle tankers loading crude oil at the oil fields is about 215000 tons a year (1997). This emission represents both an energy loss and an environmental problem. Gas tankers have used boil-off gas from the cargo tanks as fuel for some time. However, for the current VOC project a new fuel injection concept is designed for tankers {{to take advantage of the}} energy present in the VOC evaporated from crude oil. The VOC is mixed with inert gas in these tankers, and thus the utilisation of this gas represents new challenges. The VOC project uses the concept of «Condensate Diesel Process» with pilot ignition. An experimental study of ignition and combustion of VOC Fuels reported here was initiated by the time it was decided to start a pilot project converting propulsion engines in shuttle tankers to use VOC Fuel. It is an experimental study carried out at the Marine Technology Centre (MTS). The objective was to study ignition and combustion of the chosen process in comparison with an ordinary diesel process. The experimental results have been discussed and are compared with theoretical considerations of injection, ignition and combustion. For experiments on combustion, a rapid compression machine "DyFo", which was developed during the years from 1992 to 1997, was redesigned to use VOC Fuel. The DyFo test rig was initially designed to study ignition and early combustion of spark ignited homogeneous gas/air charges. To study the ignition and early combustion of VOC Fuel injected at high pressure and ignited by pilot diesel fuel, a redesign was necessary. An important feature of the DyFo, is the visualisation of the combustion. The advantage of the DyFo test rig, compared to an engine, is its simplicity and controllability. All test parameters and variables are better controlled and this makes comparable tests easier to perform. In an engine the visualisation would suffer from combustion deposits disturbing the view through the quartz glasses, making the images more difficult to interpret. The simplicity is on the other side a drawback. Correct thermal conditions inside the cylinder is hard to obtain as the piston only is moved one <b>half</b> <b>stroke</b> (from BDC to TDC) for each test. External heating of the test rig is necessary, and this makes it difficult to obtain correct thermal conditions for other than low load conditions. An injector of a new, common rail type design is developed for injection of the VOC Fuel. The design, based on a conventional, redesigned diesel fuel nozzle involved a lot of practical problems. Leakages of gas into the combustion chamber have led to some accidents resulting in too high cylinder pressures. However, broken quartz glasses have been the most serious result of the malfunctions. The main purpose of this investigation has been to study the combustion of alkanes present in the VOC evaporated from crude oil. The primary objective was to verify whether or not the concept of the «Condensate Diesel Process» with pilot ignition can be used to utilise these hydrocarbons as fuel in Diesel engines. VOC Fuels of different composition have been tested. The experiments carried out have not revealed any problems concerning combustion when using pilot ignited VOC Fuel. Both ignition and combustion seem to follow the traditional diesel scheme. The composition of the VOC Fuel seems not to affect the ignition delay. A study of varying the value of different parameters has not unveiled any surprises regarding the ignition or early combustion. Separate tests with pure VOC Fuel components, however, show great differences in the ignition delay (both regarding mean value and variance) for different components. The component being most unwillingly and most unstable to ignite is propane. If, for some reason, the pilot ignition should fail, a VOC Fuel with mainly n-butane and higher alkanes will probably give no great operating problems, at least not at medium to high engine load. These conclusions are mainly based on the analysis of the dynamic signals from the pressure sensor giving the cylinder pressure curves. Where found appropriate, Schlieren images have been included in the discussion. However, the use of Schlieren images has been found to be less valuable for the Diesel process than for the Otto process. The reason for this is mainly that the radiation of visible light from the diffusion combustion of diesel oil and VOC Fuel (i. e. propane, iso-butane and n-butane) are quite different. First, this radiation disturbs the Schlieren image and second, the radiation from the combustion of diesel oil is far more intense than that of the VOC Fuel. The light VOC fraction of the vent gas – methane and ethane – is not utilised in the concept of «Condensate Diesel Process». This fraction represents about 15 % of the total energy in the VOC release when loading crude oil at the Statfjord field. At other fields as Gullfaks, this fraction can represent up to 50 % or more of the total energy. After the VOC Fuel is produced, a residual VOC consisting of methane, ethane, some propane and inert gas is lost. A useful and simple way of utilising even this fraction is to mix it with the charge air at low pressure and feed the mixture into the cylinder where a pilot fuel spray ignites the charge. The method is found to have potential of being a suitable way, at least theoretically, to utilise the light VOC fraction. Some practical difficulties, however, may restrict the use of this fraction to medium and high engine loads. At lower loads the ignition delay increases due to the dilution with great quantities of inert gas. Another option to utilise the light VOC fraction is by capturing the gas in hydrates. No real study of this concept has been carried out, but an initial survey of possible solutions is described. A final conclusion of the potential of this concept cannot be drawn until more detailed work has been carried out. However, simply using the light VOC fraction extracted by melting the hydrate will be the most likely way. As a main conclusion it can be stated that the use of VOC Fuel in a «Condensate Diesel Process» is a feasible way of utilising energy otherwise lost. Venting the VOC to the atmosphere when loading crude oil into shuttle tankers represents both an energy loss and an environmental problem. By reducing both, the idea of using VOC as an engine fuel seems to be a good one. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
