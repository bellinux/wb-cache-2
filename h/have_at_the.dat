5|$|Mirroring {{the role}} that track and field events <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is {{featured}} within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among {{some of the first}} of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.|$|E

25|$|In Alone Together, Turkle explores where {{technology}} is taking us and how society adapts to answer new questions {{brought on by}} the rise of mobile technologies, robots, computers, and other electronic gadgets. In particular, Turkle raises concerns about the way in which genuine, organic social interactions become degraded through constant exposure to illusory meaningful exchanges with artificial intelligence. Underlying Turkle's central argument {{is the fact that the}} technological developments which have most contributed to the rise of inter-connectivity <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time bolstered a sense of alienation between people. The alienation involves links between social networks favouring those of proper conversations.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{or not a}} {{radio source}} is {{expanding}} supersonically, it must do work against the external medium in expanding, and so it puts energy into heating and lifting the external plasma. The minimum energy stored in the lobes of a powerful radio source might be 1053 J. The lower limit on the work done on the external medium by such a source is several times this. A {{good deal of the}} current interest in radio sources focuses on the effect they must <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> centres of clusters at the present day. Equally interesting is their likely effect on structure formation over cosmological time: it is thought that they may provide a feedback mechanism to slow the formation of the most massive objects.|$|E

Later, Alan comforts Charlie by saying that Charlie's mother understood why he chose to work on P vs. NP instead of spending his final three months with her. Charlie then resumes work on the case and realizes that he failed to consider that the bank robbers spent a much longer time outside the bank after the robberies than most bank robbers would <b>have.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> office, Charlie tells the team that the robbers were using Federal Reserve routing numbers stored on each bank's computers to locate a shipment of cash going to an undisclosed Federal Reserve location to be destroyed. The team assumes that the bank robbers need the computer programmer's knowledge to access the data. The team also learns that one shipment is scheduled to leave for the location in a few hours.|$|E

500|$|With a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced So Far, So Good... So What! {{took over}} five months to record. The album was plagued with {{problems}} during production, partially due to Mustaine's struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: [...] "The production of So Far, So Good... So What! was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time." [...] Mustaine clashed with Lani on several occasions, beginning with Lani's {{insistence that the}} drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers. Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the album's mixing, and Lani was replaced by Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.|$|E

500|$|Filming for Crossroads {{initiated}} in March 2001 in Baton Rouge and Hammond, Louisiana, near Spears' hometown. Due {{to the fact}} that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film's production, filming only wrapped up after six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Crossroads had a total budget of $10 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back. Friends are all you <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day. When your boyfriend breaks up with you, who do you call? Your girlfriend. I just love that message." ...|$|E

Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy.

500|$|McNair {{was held}} in high regard by his contemporaries, as {{evidenced}} by performance appraisals that routinely gave him the highest possible ratings. Marshall also held McNair in high esteem, {{as demonstrated by the}} fact that McNair was a top stateside commander during World War II, was considered for a top command in Europe, and was ultimately selected to command the First United States Army Group as part of a deception plan that required a general with a good reputation and high name recognition for successful execution. [...] In addition, soon after McNair was assigned to serve as commandant of the Command and General Staff School, Marshall learned that he would become the Chief of Staff of the Army. [...] In a letter to McNair, Marshall wrote: [...] "You at the head of Leavenworth are one of the great satisfactions I <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment in visualizing the responsibilities of the next couple of years." [...] Mark W. Clark served under McNair as operations officer (G-3) at AGF Headquarters before ascending to the general officer ranks.

[...] The song focuses on two characters; Reynolds' vocals supply a revolutionary perspective, and Rory Clewlow's are those of a person in power. [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] has unconventional lyrics for its characters; [...] "Yabba Dabba do one, son" [...] was described by Reynolds as the product of a drunken MC battle, and during the song the other band members pause and urge Reynolds to calm down. Reynolds described [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] as a [...] "lively electro influenced dubstep" [...] and a [...] "rap rock pileup" [...] textured over [...] "wobbly dubstep bass".|$|E

500|$|Michigan {{entered the}} game as the No. 5-ranked team in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. Media outlets {{projected}} the team as favorites to win the Big Ten conference, and as contenders for a national championship. Michigan featured a strong senior class of offensive tackle Jake Long, tailback Mike Hart, and quarterback Chad Henne, each of whom had decided {{to stay in school}} rather than declare eligibility for the NFL Draft. The players attributed their decision to several factors, such as Michigan having lost their last three games to rival Ohio State and the Wolverines' streak of three consecutive bowl losses. The three also desired to finish their college careers on a high note. Mark Schlabach of ESPN.com stated that [...] ", along with receivers Mario Manningham and Adrian Arrington, gives Michigan what could potentially {{be one of the most}} explosive offenses in college football". Prior to the season, the team named Hart and Long as captains, along with linebacker Shawn Crable, a fifth-year senior. [...] Michigan aimed to open the game in a three-receiver formation, which has the potential to spread the opposing defense out; Michigan coach Lloyd Carr noted that [...] "when you have some of the skill that we <b>have</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wide receiver positions and can spread a defense out, that's [...] positive." [...] At the same time, Michigan was anticipated to run only a limited selection of plays from this set, to limit the ability of their upcoming opponents to develop an effective game plan against them. Michigan's defense, which led the FBS in run defense in 2006, lost seven starters from the previous season, including four All-Americans (cornerback Leon Hall and defensive linemen Alan Branch, David Harris, and LaMarr Woodley), each of whom were drafted in the first two rounds of the 2007 NFL Draft. Wolverines linebacker Chris Graham, a senior, expected the defense to be defined by speed, noting that each position on the defense was [...] "loaded in speed".|$|E
