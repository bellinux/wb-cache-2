5|$|Beside the baths, a temple, in {{classical}} style with four large, <b>fluted</b> Corinthian columns and dedicated to Minerva The temple remained in use for worship until around the 4th century, but {{the site is}} now occupied by the Grand Pump Room.|$|E
5|$|Lysurus cruciatus {{is similar}} is {{appearance}} to L.mokusin, {{but has a}} cylindrical stem without any flutings at the tip. Lysurus borealis is also similar, but its stipe is not <b>fluted,</b> and without the angles present in L.mokusin.|$|E
5|$|In the argonaut (paper nautilus), {{the female}} secretes a fine, <b>fluted,</b> papery shell {{in which the}} eggs are {{deposited}} and in which she also resides while floating in mid-ocean. In this she broods the young, and it {{also serves as a}} buoyancy aid allowing her to adjust her depth. The male argonaut is minute by comparison and has no shell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, {{even before the}} {{accession}} of Louis XVI, whose name {{is attached to the}} first phases of the style. Straight tapering <b>fluted</b> legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Shrine is the Sanctuary, a high vaulted space {{entered by}} four tall portals of Classical design. A simple entabulature {{is carried on}} sixteen tall <b>fluted</b> Ionic columns and {{supports}} a frieze with twelve relief panels sculptured by Lyndon Dadswell, depicting the armed services at work and in action during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Made of {{red brick}} with a stucco trim, {{the house has}} five-bays, two-storeys, sash windows, and a central Doric porch with <b>fluted</b> columns and entablature with triglyphs. There is a later {{extension}} and a detached housekeeper's cottage, Gladsmuir Cottage. The panelled double doors lead to two internal staircases and over 20 rooms, including eight bedrooms, three reception rooms and a large kitchen. One room contains late-18th-century medallions.|$|E
5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or <b>fluted</b> form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} two demonstrators in {{what would}} become its signature semi-streamlined, <b>fluted</b> stainless-steel style, the Budd Company built four production rubber-tired rail cars for American railroads: one for the Reading Company, two for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Silver Slipper for the Texas and Pacific Railway. All were plagued by problems, chief among them their tendency to derail. By 1935, the Silver Slipper had been scrapped, and the Pennsylvania's two cars, the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin collaborations, met the same fate in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has a {{wrinkled}} surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua {{is very similar}} in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, <b>fluted</b> stipes.|$|E
5|$|Karan Mahal (Public Audience Hall) {{was built}} by Karan Singh in c.1680 to mark his victory over the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most exquisite palaces built with gardens, which displays the aesthetic sensibilities of the royalty of Rajasthan. It has stained glass windows and intricately carved balconies built in stone and wood <b>fluted</b> columns. Later Rajas, Anup Singh and Surat Singh, also added lot of glitter to this palace with inlaid polychrome glass, intricate mirror patterns, and red and gold paint. In the coronation chamber, there is a shored up alcove, which was used as a throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{forms of}} the glyphs are {{standardized}} contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, <b>fluted</b> (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running {{the length of the}} tablets, {{as can be seen in}} the image of tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity of wood on the island.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied {{structure}} is rectangular in plan. The portico has four Ionic columns with <b>fluted</b> stems and cabbage leaf capitals. The front gables {{of the building}} have Renaissance style plaster moulding. The {{lower part of the}} exterior walls are made of plastered brick. The upper windows have semi-circular French windows, with pilasters on both sides. In 1902 a new royal mint department was constructed outside the palace's walls and the old mint building was left vacant. The building was then first converted for use as a royal guards barracks and later as a royal guards officer's club.|$|E
5|$|This is {{a variant}} of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the barrel {{changing}} handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle mounting lugs have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the collapsible buttstock used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, <b>fluted</b> barrel of the same length.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by <b>fluted</b> Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Excepting some domesticated forms, {{all male}} bovids have horns, {{and in many}} species, females, too, possess horns. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic {{structure}} is a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or <b>fluted</b> form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there are exceptions such as the four-horned antelope and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved horns are used in ramming. Males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Shrine {{is based on the}} ancient Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and the Parthenon in Athens. It is a {{structure}} of square plan roofed by a stepped pyramid and entered on the north and south through classical porticos, each of eight <b>fluted</b> Doric columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrine sits. The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford, representing Peace, Justice, Patriotism and Sacrifice. The Art Deco style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is Neo-Classical.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} Pennsylvania arrived from Asia between 12000BCE and 8000BCE, when the glaciers of the Pleistocene Ice Age were receding. <b>Fluted</b> point spearheads from this era, {{known as the}} Paleo-Indian Period, {{have been found in}} most parts of the state. Archeological discoveries at the Memorial Park Site 36Cn164 near the confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River and Bald Eagle Creek collectively span about 8,000years and represent every major prehistoric period from the Middle Archaic to the Late Woodland period. Prehistoric cultural periods over that span included the Middle Archaic starting at 6500 BCE; the Late Archaic starting at 3000 BCE; the Early Woodland starting at 1000 BCE; the Middle Woodland starting at 0 CE; and the Late Woodland starting at 900 CE. First contact with Europeans occurred in Pennsylvania between 1500 and 1600 CE.|$|E
5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by <b>fluted</b> Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the parapet is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of this face are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the hotel's {{first floor}} held its {{reception}} rooms, parlors, dining rooms, library, and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen. The library was adjacent to {{and north of}} the large dining room. The ballroom had classical <b>fluted</b> Ionic columns and Italian marble walls. Thomas Edison was honored there in 1909. The Dutch kitchen had decorations and furnishings from Holland and {{was based on a}} restaurant in Edam. It had rough adze-hewn timbers, a hipped ceiling, etchings from England, and European and American oil paintings. Much of the furniture was purchased from Law's former employer, home furnishings pioneer W. & J. Sloane. Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets in Europe and Asia, and included expensive paintings, bronzes, marble sculptures, rare books, and carved antique furniture. The hotel also had a Chinese tea room and a dark room for amateur photographers. The kitchen was kept clean (such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen). It was reported to be of elegant design, utilizing white tile and marble. The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum, and included numerous glass-lined refrigerators. It sourced its milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms. The kitchen's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal; the lodge also had an ice-producing plant that used sterilized well water.|$|E
5|$|The monuments {{within the}} cathedral include {{recumbent}} figures and memorials of several abbots and bishops: Abbot Walter Newbery {{who died in}} 1473 and Abbot William Hunt (died 1481) are within 14th-century recesses {{on the north side}} of the Lady Chapel, while the recumbent effigy of Abbot John Newland (died 1515) is in a similar recess on the southern side. The coffin lid of Abbot David (died 1234) is in the north transept. In the north choir aisle is a chest tomb to Bishop Bush (died 1558) which includes six <b>fluted</b> Ionic columns with an entablature canopy. Also honoured are: Thomas Westfield, Bishop of Bristol (1642–44), Thomas Howell (Bishop of Bristol) (1644–45), Gilbert Ironside the elder, Bishop of Bristol (1661–71), William Bradshaw (bishop), Bishop of Bristol (1724–32), Joseph Butler, Bishop of Bristol (1738–1750), John Conybeare, Bishop of Bristol (1750–55) and Robert Gray (bishop of Bristol) (1827–34), who is buried in graveyard attached to the cathedral. The Berkeley family as early benefactors are represented by Maurice de Berkeley (died 1281), *Thomas de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (died 1321), Lord Berkeley (died 1326) and Thomas Berkeley (died 1243) who are depicted in military effigies on the south side of the choir aisle, along with the chest tomb of Maurice Berkeley (died 1368).|$|E
5|$|The old {{heritage}} monuments, {{which are}} palaces and temples {{are located in}} the old town (east of the Chaugans), on the lower slopes of Shah Madar hill. They were built in the lower valley where the two rivers and steep thickly forested hillsides provided a strong defense. Located here is the 10th century Champavati Temple, said to have marked the birth of the town, the Lakshmi Narayan group of temples (built from 10th-19th century), the 10th century Sita Ram Temple, Bansi Gopal temple, Kharura Mohalla and Hari Rai temple, the 11th century Sui Mata Temple and Chamunda Devi Temple, and the Akhand Chandi palace, overlooking the Chaugan, which has since been converted into a college. Additions were made to the palace {{in the form of the}} Zenana Mahal and the Rang Mahal in the 18th century. The temples built in Chamba demonstrate a strong Kashmiri influence with their stone temple architecture and temple iconography. Given their age however, only their unicellular layout with <b>fluted</b> pillars has been retained.|$|E
5|$|Within {{its native}} Northern Hemisphere range, the first-year male common {{blackbird}} of the nominate race may start singing {{as early as}} late January in fine weather {{in order to establish}} a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched <b>fluted</b> warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive seee, a pook-pook-pook alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various chink and chook, chook vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives chink-chink calls in the evening in an (usually unsuccessful) attempt to deter other blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight. During the northern winter, blackbirds can be heard quietly singing to themselves, so much so that September and October are the only months in which the song cannot be heard. Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high seee alarm call for threats from birds of prey since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the teeth}} found with the holotype {{specimen}} were not {{attached to the}} skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles {{on the front and}} back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039in), more than in most theropods. Some of the teeth were <b>fluted,</b> with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, and the difference between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.|$|E

25|$|A deep <b>fluted</b> {{bowl with}} two small swing handles (which were {{detached}} {{at the time}} of discovery, because solder tends to loosen during burial) is of a type found in several late Roman silver hoards, such as those in the Esquiline Treasure from Rome, and from Traprain Law in Scotland. The type is thought to have developed from earlier shell-shaped bowls, and to have been used to contain water at the dining table, intended for rinsing diners' hands. The chased geometric design in the centre of the Mildenhall <b>fluted</b> bowl depicts a six-pointed star, a device that had no specific symbolic meaning in the Roman period, but was simply one of many popular geometric figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{as a whole}} as well as various elements point to Hellenistic and other foreign influence, such as the <b>fluted</b> bell, addorsed capital of the Persepolitan order, and the abundant use of the Hellenistic flame palmette or honeysuckle motif.|$|E
25|$|Located in room 204, the walnut-paneled Mulert Memorial {{classroom}} {{was designed}} by Philadelphia architect Gustav Ketterer and university architect Albert Klimcheck. The room features wood floors, <b>fluted</b> ionic columns, red velvet draperies, and student chairs with leather seats. The room's doors have <b>fluted</b> jams and panelings of Greek rosettes. A Mulert family coat-of-arms and memorial inscription {{is located on the}} rear wall of the room. The room was provided for in the will of the late Mt.
