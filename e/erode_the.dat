5|$|In 2009, it {{was shown}} that the {{presence}} of a smaller planet at Jupiter's position in the Solar System might increase the impact rate of comets on the Earth significantly. A planet of Jupiter's mass still seems to provide increased protection against asteroids, but the total effect on all orbital bodies within the Solar System is unclear. Computer simulations in 2016 have continued to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> theory.|$|E
5|$|In the winter, melting snow seeps into {{cracks and}} joints and freezes at night. The {{force of the}} {{expanding}} ice helps to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> rock of the Claron Formation. Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.|$|E

5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|Although 85% {{of world}} crude {{production}} was still coming from Pennsylvania wells in the 1880s, drilling in Russia and Asia began {{to reach the}} world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper Russian oil fields, including the region's first pipeline and the world's first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, {{the invention of the}} light bulb gradually began to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> dominance of kerosene for illumination. But Standard Oil adapted, developing a European presence, expanding into natural gas production in the U.S. then into gasoline for automobiles, which until then had been considered a waste product.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|At 12:00UTC on September4, the NHC {{downgraded}} Fred to {{a tropical}} depression as its wind circulation waned; though its winds briefly picked {{back up to}} tropical storm force the next day, Fred continued as a depression with minimal convection throughout the remainder of its existence. Concurrently, a deep-altitude disturbance {{a few hundred miles}} east of Bermuda began to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> southern edge of the high-pressure ridge that Fred had circumnavigated for most of its journey. This changed the steering pattern in the region, turning the depression abruptly to the north on September6. Over the next hours, Fred became increasingly diffuse because of its progressively worsening surroundings. It officially lost its status as a tropical cyclone at 18:00UTC, degenerating into a trough 1,210mi (1,945km) southwest of the Azores and later merging with a frontal boundary nearby.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Vince's {{impressive}} {{organization was}} very short lived as westerly wind shear began to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> eye within hours. In response, the storm weakened to {{a tropical storm}} shortly thereafter. A broad low-level trough approached the storm from the northwest, pulling the convection northward as the storm's low-level center accelerated eastward. On 10 October, two brief bursts of convection surprised forecasters, but with the sea surface temperature as low as 22°C (72°F), the flares were not sustained. Vince continued to weaken as it approached the Iberian Peninsula and became a tropical depression on 11 October, shortly before it made landfall near Huelva, Spain. The fast-moving tropical depression quickly dissipated over land. Its remnants moved across southern Spain, dumping rain on the drought-ridden region, and moved into the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante {{in the early hours}} of 12 October.|$|E

5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the beds are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{began the}} {{campaign}} period with a policy-per-day strategy, {{contrary to the}} Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began to rise. In response, the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close {{what had been a}} ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E

5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E
5|$|In 1794, after a {{successful}} {{campaign in the}} Nha Trang region, Nguyễn Ánh ordered de Puymanel to build a citadel at Duyen Khanh, near the city, instead of retreating south with the seasonal northeasterly breeze. A Nguyen garrison was established there {{under the command of}} Nguyễn Ánh's eldest son and heir, Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh, assisted by Pigneau and de Puymanel. The Tây Sơn laid siege to Duyen Khanh in May 1794, but Nguyen forces were able to keep them out. Shortly after the siege ended, reinforcements arrived from Saigon and offensive operations against the Tây Sơn duly resumed. The campaign {{was the first time that}} the Nguyễn were able to operate in Tây Sơn heartland during an unfavorable season. The defensive success of the citadel was a powerful psychological victory for the Nguyễn, demonstrating their ability to penetrate Tây Sơn territory at all times of year. The Nguyễn then proceeded to slowly <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> Tây Sơn heartland.|$|E
5|$|PBHistory {{documents}} {{were used by}} the officials of various governments. US ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge made use of 21 documents in a speech he made at the United Nations. Information was also funneled to US ambassadors and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the few Republican controlled Congresses in many years. Republicans thus sought to use an anti-communist push to generate support for themselves and to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> voting base of the Democratic party. Anti-Communist members of the US Congress, such as Charles J. Kersten and Patrick J. Hillings of the Kersten Committee, enthusiastically involved themselves with PBHistory. By August 1954, Kersten was receiving PBHistory documents from Dulles so he could use them in speeches to Congress about the Soviet Union's influence in Guatemala. In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held a number of hearings, purportedly investigating the penetration of communist influence. PBHistory {{documents were}} used in this process, and Carlos Castillo Armas became the first head of state to testify before a US Congress committee (although he did so {{through the use of}} a tape recording of his testimony). Although the hearings did little to unearth information about communist presence in Guatemala, they did provide Operation PBHistory with huge publicity within the US.|$|E

Minfilia and Alphinaud reluctantly pledge {{the support of}} the Scions and Crystal Braves, though the other Grand Company leaders decline to provide assistance, citing {{domestic}} troubles and remembering Ishgard's reticence during the three Garlean invasions. The adventurer leads a band of volunteers at the Steps of Faith, Ishgard's main bridge. They manage to repel the attack and a victory celebration is held at Ul'dah with the hopes of pressuring Ishgard to rejoin the Alliance. At the banquet, Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo privately discloses to the Warrior of Light that she plans to dissolve the monarchy in order to <b>erode</b> <b>the</b> power of the Syndicate which is the source of much of Ul'dah's corruption. However, the sultana's wine is poisoned and Teledji Adeledji bursts in to accuse the player of regicide just as Nanamo takes her last breath.
