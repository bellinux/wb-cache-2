5|$|Jayakumar {{said that}} while the Government {{recognized}} that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA, the best safeguard against such abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of the courts to impair this judicial check. Instead, the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> incorruptible government into power.|$|E

5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends.

He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but <b>honest,</b> <b>and</b> had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|The folly and {{absurdity of}} the Queen in {{allowing}} this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may {{occur on the}} occasion.

5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E

5|$|The Yomesh cult is the {{official}} religion of Orgoreyn, and worships light. Critics such as David Lake have found parallels between the Yomesh cult and Christianity, such {{as the presence of}} saints and angels, and the use of a dating system based on the death of the prophet. Le Guin portrays the Yomesh religion as influencing the Orgota society, which Lake interprets as a critique of the influence of Christianity upon Western society. In comparison to the religion of Karhide, the Yomesh religion focuses more on enlightenment and positive, obvious statements. The novel suggests that this focus on positives leads to the Orgota being not entirely <b>honest,</b> <b>and</b> that a balance between enlightenment and darkness is necessary for truth.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was {{physically}} unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy {{and only about}} five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity during {{the first years of}} her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date. The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired. They, and others, conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional, obstinate, <b>honest,</b> <b>and</b> straight-talking.|$|E
5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E

5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E
5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very <b>honest</b> <b>and</b> sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|When God Writes Your Love Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, <b>honest,</b> <b>and</b> candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story {{in his book}} If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.|$|E
