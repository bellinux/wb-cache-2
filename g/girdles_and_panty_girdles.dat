The differential response of RS to <b>girdling</b> <b>and</b> defoliation {{was a result of}} the over-compensation for RS after <b>girdling</b> <b>and</b> redistribution of stored carbon after defoliation. No significant effect on RS was observed between <b>girdling</b> <b>and</b> defoliation treatment, while the soluble sugar content in fine roots was higher in defoliation than in girdling treatment, indicating that defoliation had less compensation effect for RS after interrupting photosynthates supply. We confirm the close coupling of RS with photosynthesis and recommend defoliation for further studies to estimate the effect of photosynthesis on RS...|$|R
