500|$|For {{the first}} Bond girl Honey Ryder, Julie Christie was considered, but {{discarded}} as the producers {{felt she was}} not voluptuous <b>enough.</b> <b>Just</b> two weeks before filming began, Ursula Andress was chosen to play Honey after the producers saw {{a picture of her}} taken by Andress' then-husband John Derek. To appear more convincing as a Jamaican, Andress had a tan painted on her and ultimately had her lines redubbed by voice actress Nikki van der Zyl due to Andress' heavy Swiss German accent. For Bond's antagonist Dr. No, Ian Fleming wanted his friend Noël Coward, and Coward answered the invitation with [...] "No! No! No!" [...] Fleming considered that his step-cousin, Christopher Lee, {{would be good for the}} role of Dr. No, although by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the part. Harry Saltzman picked Wiseman because of his performance in the 1951 film Detective Story, and the actor had special make-up applied to evoke No's Chinese heritage.|$|E
500|$|At 05:00 on 5 April, the Japanese {{launched}} an {{attack from the}} north. This was followed almost simultaneously by a stronger attack from the south-west. For the next 80 minutes, 900–1,100 Japanese from the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments attacked the small Australian force in waves. They overwhelmed the Australian forward positions, but finding their way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking any equipment {{to deal with them}} the Japanese attack stalled. Quickly, the situation was turned back in favour of the Australians, and the Japanese were cut down by heavy defensive artillery fire and by well-sited machine guns. A further attack was launched by a smaller force along the Buin Road and aimed at two of the forward companies positioned there. This attack was beaten back also. After regrouping, the surviving members of the 13th Infantry Regiment began preparing for a final charge, determined to fight to the last man. Their commander, Muta, in a final act of defiance wrapped his unit's banner around his waist and armed himself with a grenade with which to blow himself up during the assault. Elsewhere, the remaining officers of the 23rd Infantry made a pact to hurl themselves against the Australians one last time in a suicidal charge. Nevertheless, Akinaga, realising that further assaults were futile finally dispatched the order to cancel the attack. [...] At around 08:30, the Australians realised that the Japanese had decided that they had had <b>enough.</b> <b>Just</b> after midday, two tanks were dispatched from the 'B' Echelon perimeter, escorted by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion, arriving on the knoll by 13:45 where they were used as fire support as the Australians began to carry out mopping up operations, flushing out small groups of survivors all around the position.|$|E

Yet it is also weightless and lacks a center." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "Better, or at least sweeter, than the first, with Wiig adding some much-needed romantic charm to the toddler-level humor." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of five, saying [...] "If you're looking for quality prepackaged, predigested Hollywood family fun this summer, you could do a lot worse than Despicable Me 2." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "A fleeter film than its predecessor, Despicable Me 2 delights more often than it disappoints." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "The minions are still wacky scene-stealers– and once again, we don't get nearly enough of them– but Gru and his daughters have been blanded down to bad-sitcom level." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "With its predecessor having made a whopping $540 million globally, it's no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But it's not <b>enough</b> <b>just</b> to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that Despicable Me 2 betrays the original film's devotion to bad-guy gaiety." ...|$|E

2500|$|The third {{minimum limit}} listed above (MTOea/erm2/fc), mean that EU member states having {{ratified}} the Fiscal Compact and being bound by its fiscal provisions, {{are obliged to}} select a MTO which does not exceed a structural deficit of 1.0% of GDP at maximum {{if they have a}} debt-to-GDP ratio significantly below 60%, and of 0.5% of GDP maximum if they have a debt-to-GDP ratio above 60%. As of January 2015, the following six states are not bound by the fiscal provisions of the Fiscal Compact (note that for non-Eurozone states to be bound by the fiscal provisions, it is not <b>enough</b> <b>just</b> to ratify the Fiscal Compact, they also need to attach a declaration of intent to be bound by the fiscal provisions, before this is the case): UK, Czech Republic, Croatia, Poland, Sweden, Hungary. Those of the non-eurozone states neither being ERM-2 members nor having committed to respect the fiscal provisions of the Fiscal Compact, will still be required to set a national MTO respecting the calculated [...] "minimum MTO" [...] being equal to the strictest of requirement (1)+(2). The only EU member state being exempted to comply with this MTO procedure is the UK, as it per a protocol to the EU treaty is exempted from complying with the SGP. In other words, while all other member states are obliged nationally to select at MTO respecting their calculated Minimum MTO, the calculated Minimum MTO for the UK is only presented for advice, with no obligation for it to set a compliant national MTO in structural terms.|$|E
