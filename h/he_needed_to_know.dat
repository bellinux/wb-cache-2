By the time he realized that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it.

500|$|Morrell {{was born}} at Rye, in Westchester County, New York, on July 5, 1795. He grew up in Stonington, Connecticut, where his father, also named Benjamin, was {{employed}} as a shipbuilder. Morrell, after minimal schooling, ran away to sea {{at the age of}} 17 [...] "without taking leave of any member of my family, or intimating my purpose to a single soul". During the War of 1812, which broke out while he was at sea, he was twice captured by the British; on his first voyage his ship, carrying a cargo of flour, was intercepted off St John's, Newfoundland, and Morrell was detained for eight months. His second voyage landed him in Dartmoor prison, England, for two years. After his release Morrell continued his seafaring career, sailing before the mast as an ordinary seaman since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank. A sympathetic captain, Josiah Macy, taught him what <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> to qualify as an officer, [...] and in 1821 he was appointed chief mate on the sealer Wasp, under Captain Robert Johnson.|$|E

The deployment could be on either the westernmost or the easternmost column, and had to be carried out before the Germans arrived; but early deployment could mean losing any chance of a decisive encounter. Deploying to the west would bring his fleet closer to Scheer, gaining valuable time as dusk approached, but the Germans might arrive before the manoeuvre was complete. Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe's ships might be able to cross the [...] "T", and visibility would strongly favour British gunnery – Scheer's forces would be silhouetted against the setting sun to the west, while the Grand Fleet would be indistinct against the dark skies to the north and east, and would be hidden by reflection of the low sunlight off intervening haze and smoke. Deployment would take twenty irreplaceable minutes, and the fleets were closing at full speed. In {{one of the most critical}} and difficult tactical command decisions of the entire war, Jellicoe ordered deployment to the east at 18:15.|$|E

2500|$|On November 13, after Nixon's {{landslide}} re-election, Nixon told Kissinger [...] " [...] to {{ruin the}} Foreign Service.

On February 2, Nixon broke that promise, carrying through with his intention to [...] "remove the deadwood" [...] from the CIA. [...] "Get rid of the clowns" [...] was his order to the incoming CI. Kissinger had been running the CIA since the beginning of Nixon's presidency, but Nixon impressed on Schlesinger that he must appear to congress to be in charge, averting their suspicion of Kissinger's involvement. Nixon also hoped that Schlesinger could push through broader changes in the intelligence community that he had been working towards for years, the creation of a Director of National Intelligence, and spinning off the covert action part of the CIA into a separate organ. Before Helms would leave office, he would destroy every tape he had secretly made of meetings in his office, and many of the papers on Project MKUltra. In Schlesinger's 17-week tenure, he would fire more than 1,500 employees. As Watergate threw the spotlight on the CIA, Schlesinger, who had been kept in the dark about the CIA's involvement, decided <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what skeletons were in the closet.

6000|$|Yes, doubtless. <b>He</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his {{kinds of}} men; to regard {{intensely}} the chemic affinities and natural properties, {{to keep his}} phosphorescents his nitres and charcoals well apart; {{to get out of}} these English what they were capable of giving him, namely, heavy strokes,--and never ask them for what they had not: them or the others; but treat each according to his kind. Just, candid, consummately polite: an excellent manager of men, as well as of war-movements, though Voltaire found him shockingly defective in ESPRIT. The English, I think, he generally quartered by themselves; employed them oftenest under the Hereditary Prince,--a man of swift execution and prone to strokes like themselves. [...] "Oftenest under the Erbprinz," [...] says Mauvillon: [...] "till, after the Fight of Kloster Kampen, it began to be noticed that there was a change in that respect; and the mess-rooms whispered, 'By accident or not?'"--which shall remain mysterious to me.

6000|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, {{could the}} company's actuary know that the man's house would last until he had paid in more than its insured value in premiums--more, that is to say, than the company {{would have to pay}} back? He could not, but from his {{statistics}} he could know how many houses in ten thousand of that kind burned in their first year, how many in their second, their third, and so on. That was all that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> the house-owners knowing nothing about it. He fixed his rates according to the facts, and the occasional loss of a bet in an individual instance did not affect the certainty of a general winning. Like other professional gamblers, the company expected to lose sometimes, yet knew {{that in the long run}} it must win; which meant that in any special case it would probably win. With a thousand gambling games open to him in which the chances were equal, the infatuated dupe chose to [...] "sit into" [...] one where they were against him! Deceived by the cappers' fairy tales, dazed by the complex and incomprehensible [...] "calculations" [...] put forth for his undoing, and having ever in the ear of his imagination the crackle and roar of the impoverishing flames, he grasped at the hope of beating--in an unwelcome way, it is true--"the man that kept the table." [...] He must have known for a certainty that if the company could afford to insure him he could not afford to let it. He must have known that the whole body of the insured paid to the insurers more than the insurers paid to them; otherwise the business could not have been conducted. This they cheerfully admitted; indeed, they proudly affirmed it. In fact, insurance companies were the only professional gamblers that had the incredible hardihood to parade their enormous winnings as an inducement to play against their game. These winnings ("assets," [...] they called them) proved their ability, they said, to pay when they lost; and that was indubitably true. What they did not prove, unfortunately, was the will to pay, which from the imperfect court records of the period that have come down to us, appears frequently to have been lacking. Gakler relates that in the instance of the city of San Francisco (somewhat doubtfully identified by Macronus as the modern fishing-village of Gharoo) the disinclination of the insurance companies to pay their bets had the most momentous consequences.|$|E
