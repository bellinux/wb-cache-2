5|$|Built {{around long}} narrow yards, {{as well as}} serving food and drink and {{providing}} lodgings, these coaching inns also served as temporary warehouses, auction rooms and gambling halls for travellers {{doing business in the}} market.

As well as providing the other functions of the Norwich inns, its yard also served as a popular theatre and venue for other performers. (Despite its significance as a city, Norwich did not have a dedicated theatre until 1758.) However, in 1699 part of the building collapsed during a performance by Thomas Doggett's troupe of players, killing a woman and injuring many of the audience.

5|$|It {{was planned}} to launch four {{satellites}} in December 1962. However, before the launches could take place, then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara cancelled the program, due to concerns {{that it would}} not be able to operate if a <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> nuclear war broke out, and that only a small number of SAINTs could be launched at a time. The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet satellites was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their satellites, that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, or if it sensed that it was being scanned. The standard American military reconnaissance satellite was capable of scanning other satellites long range, along with ground based detection of satellites.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the British Royal Navy {{was charged}} with {{limiting}} the passage and operations of the French Navy, French merchant ships and French privateers. To achieve this objective, the Royal Navy imposed a system of blockades on French ports, especially the major naval bases at Toulon and Brest. This stranglehold on French movement off their own coastline seriously affected the French colonies, including those in the West Indies, as their produce could not reach France and supplies and reinforcements could not reach them without the risk of British interception and seizure. These islands provided excellent bases for French ships to raid the British trade routes through the Caribbean Sea: in previous conflicts, the British had countered {{the threat posed by}} French West Indian colonies by seizing them through force, such as Martinique, which had been previously captured by armed invasion in 1762 and 1794. An attempt in 1780 was defeated by a French battle squadron at the Battle of Martinique. By 1808 there were no French squadrons at sea: any that left port were eliminated or driven back in a series of battles, culminating at the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the case for}} predicting unstable ductile tearing by the energy dissipation rate approach.

Das Kohlegas steht fuer den Probebetrieb in den benoetigten Mengen nicht zur Verfuegung, so dass die Brennkammer ausschliesslich basierend auf Modellversuchen und auf numerischen Rechnungen konstruiert werden muss. Arbeitsprogramm: (1) Numerische Modellierung der Kohlegasverbrennung in einem Stroemungsfeldprogramm. (2) Verbrennungs- und Stroemungsfeldrechnung in der realen Brennkammer mit Hilfe eines dreidimensionalen Stroemungsfeld-Rechenprogramms.

(4) An einer Original-Brennkammer werden die Temperatur- und Konzentrationsfelder in der Flamme beim Betrieb mit Erdgas und Heizoel gemessen. Ergebnisse: Die Erweiterung des zweidimensionalen Stroemungsfeldrechenprogramm auf die Kohlegasverbrennung konnte durch Messwerte verifiziert werden. Die Modifikation eines dreidimensionalen Stroemungsfeldrechenprogramms fuer eine exzentrische Brennanordnung lieferte sowohl fuer die isotherme Stroemung als auch fuer Methanverbrennung nicht zufriedenstellende Ergebnisse im Vergleich zu den Messungen. Aus den Messungen in der Original-Brennkammer resultierte, dass die Brennkammer einfacher konstruiert werden kann. (orig.) Objective: Optimization {{and testing}} of a high {{temperature}} combustion chamber for burning coal gas and conventional fuels natural gas or fuel oil. Coal gas is not available in such quantity for testing a <b>full</b> <b>scaled</b> combustion chamber. Therefore {{the design of the}} combustion chamber is based of experimental results from model tests and numerical solution procedures. Working program: (1) Analytical model for burning coal gas implemented in an existing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. (2) Three-dimensional calculations of a <b>full</b> <b>scaled</b> combustion chamber with a CFD code for flows accompanied by combustion and chemical reaction. (3) Improvement of measuring method for determination of flame temperature and concentration. (4) Temperature and concentration profil measuring in a <b>full</b> <b>scaled</b> combustion chamber by operating with natural gas or fuel oil. Results: An analytical model for burning coal gas was implemented in an existing two-dimensional CFD code. The model gave acceptable results. A three-dimensional CFD was modified to calculate a multi burner arrangement. The larger discrepancies were found between measurements and predictions both for isothermal flow field and for flows with methan combustion.

5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> RMS Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. For {{the safety of the}} stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented {{them with an}} opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a <b>full</b> <b>scale</b> engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment.
