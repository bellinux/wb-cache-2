40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{constructing}} equations with fractionary, unitary and ten magnitude power, {{in an attempt}} of representing the top, medium and basis portion of the stem; at constructing polynomial equations compatible with volume equations; at evaluating the accuracy of three non-segmented polynomial taper models for estimating <b>diameters</b> <b>and</b> volumes along the stem of Pinus taeda; and at verifying if the more accurated model for diameters estimates is also the more accurated for estimating partial and total volumes. The database used was composed of 58 trees of Pinus taeda cubed by the Smalians method, in the farms of PISA Papel de Imprensa S/A enterprise, located in Jaguariaíva county (PR). The 58 trees were separated in 8 diameter classes. The models were fitted for each <b>diameter</b> class <b>and</b> for the total group of data. Three non-segmented polynomial models were tested: Schöepfer (1966); Hradetzky (1976); and Goulding and Murray (1976). The accuracy of the models in estimating <b>diameters</b> <b>and</b> volumes along the stem of Pinus taeda was evaluated through the following statistics: coefficient of determination; residual standard error; graphic analysis of the medium profile of the stem; mean deviation of the <b>diameters</b> <b>and</b> volumes for each position along the stem; standard deviation of the differences of the <b>diameters</b> <b>and</b> volumes; sum of square of the relative residue; and percentage of the residues of the <b>diameters</b> <b>and</b> volumes. Starting from the last four statistics, it was elaborated a ranking to detect the more accurated model for each position along the stem. It can {{be pointed out that}} among the non-segmented models tested, the model of Hradetzky (1976) is more stable than the others in the estimates of the two studied variables. Goulding and Murray (1976) model presented accurated estimates of <b>diameters</b> <b>and</b> volumes along the whole stem profile only when fitted by diameter classes. The model proposed by Schöepfer (1965) showed biased estimates along the whole stem profile, in all diameter classes...|$|R
40|$|The Near-Earth Object Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) mission {{continues}} to detect, track, and characterize minor planets.

Comparison of sizes and albedos calculated from NEOWISE measurements with those measured by occultations, spacecraft, and radar-derived shapes shows accuracy consistent with previous NEOWISE publications. <b>Diameters</b> <b>and</b> albedos fall within ±~ 20 % and ±~ 40 %, 1 -sigma, respectively, of those measured by these alternate techniques.
