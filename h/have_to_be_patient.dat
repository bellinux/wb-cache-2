500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with an A-; he praised the [...] "fine job" [...] of director/writer Akiva Goldsman, and thought the climax was [...] "extraordinarily well-shot and performed". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, writing that it [...] "is {{a classic example}} of a story you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>patient</b> with. This was an episode with a compelling, {{shocking}} start that kept us hooked well enough to deal with some slow points {{in the rest of the}} first half-hour. But we were rewarded for our patience with one heck of a climax and epilogue. This was well-executed TV". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought that while the first half wasn't very exciting, the second half had [...] "plenty to keep up interest" [...] as more was revealed about Olivia and Walter's backgrounds.|$|E

However, after {{averaging}} only six points on 36% shooting after his return, Yi {{was removed from the}} team's starting lineup. His final averages for the season were 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, as well as a 38% shooting percentage from the field and 34% on three-point field goals. After New Jersey finished the season outside of the playoffs, Yi's agent Dan Fegan suggested New Jersey played better when Yi played more minutes and took more shots, and said it [...] "begs the question...who's accountable?" [...] New Jersey's head coach Lawrence Frank said that [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>patient.</b> He's only 21", and Yi assessed his season by saying he was [...] "still too much up and down." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ramsey Isler of IGN {{was more}} {{critical}} of the episode and rated it 7.7 out of 10. Due to the season's shortened length, {{he said he was}} a [...] "tiny bit concerned that this season premiere wasn't as powerful as I hoped." [...] Isler added that while the episode [...] "does a good job of filling in the informational gaps... there's still something missing. There's still no link between where we were for 4 seasons, and where we are now." [...] He was unsure about Henrietta's addition, writing that because she was [...] "thrust into the mix and viewers were just expected to accept her as is," [...] she did not yet feel a part of the series. Isler did however praise the final sequence with Walter, writing that it [...] "is a great scene; artfully directed and made even more special by the fact that Fringe rarely uses pop music to set the mood. This scene is simple, but impressive enough to stand out as the best part of this episode and {{set the tone for the}} rest of the season. There's still hope for this story and this world, and as usual Fringe viewers will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>patient</b> to see that hope spring forth." ...|$|E

Prussia, it seems, cannot be conquered by the whole world trying to do it; Prussia has gone through its Fire-Baptism, to the satisfaction of gods and men; and is a Nation henceforth. In and of poor dislocated Teutschland, there is one of the Great Powers of the World henceforth; an actual Nation.

To be a Nation; and to believe as you are convinced, instead of pretending to believe as you are bribed or bullied by the devils about you; what an advantage to parties concerned!

For the sake of Germany, one hopes always Prussia will; and that it may get through its various Child-Diseases, without death: though it has had sad plunges and crises,--and is perhaps just now in one of its worst Influenzas, the Parliamentary-Eloquence or Ballot-Box Influenza!
