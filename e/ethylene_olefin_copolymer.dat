40|$|This thesis {{paper will}} provide data {{to show that}} cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> blister film {{can be used as}} a {{beneficial}} alternative to polyvinyl chloride film which is more commonly used in the pharmaceutical market today. Polyvinyl chloride continues to be a highly controversial packaging material due to potential environmental concerns. Cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> is shown to have properties which result in fewer environmental concerns and also can provide the added benefit of an improved barrier to moisture permeation when compared to polyvinyl chloride film. This paper documents a summary of the data on both sides of the polyvinyl chloride environmental debate. It also documents cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical properties, small and large scale manufacturing data, and potential future developments which will improve the manufacturing of many new film opportunities for cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> as well as reduce the manufacturing costs. To date, very little public information could be found documenting data on cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> for use as a replacement for polyvinyl chloride, currently used for blister packaging. Most of the data available today has been provided by cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> manufacturers instead of industry and/or institutions. The null hypothesis for this thesis is as follows: Cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> will not be a beneficial alternative blister film to polyvinyl chloride. It will not address environmental concerns, it will not be able to be formed on small scale equipment without significant modifications, and it will not provide an improved moisture barrier compared to polyvinyl chloride...|$|R

5000|$|In 2005 {{there were}} [...] "several types of {{commercial}} cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymers</b> based on {{different types of}} cyclic monomers and polymerization methods. Cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymers</b> are produced by chain copolymerization of cyclic monomers such as 8,9,10-trinorborn-2-ene (norbornene) or 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a-octahydro-1,4:5,8-dimethanonaphthalene (tetracyclododecene) with ethene (such as TOPAS Advanced Polymer's TOPAS, Mitsui Chemical’s APEL), or by ring-opening metathesis polymerization of various cyclic monomers followed by hydrogenation (Japan Synthetic Rubber’s ARTON, Zeon Chemical’s Zeonex and Zeonor)."

40|$|Microstructural {{properties}} of <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymers</b> (i. e., copolymer composition,sequence distribution, and molecular weight and its dispersity) are key factors,which affect the behaviour of <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymers</b> as viscosity modifiers in engine oil. In this article, the variation procedure and control methods of these specifications are described for {{the synthesis of}} <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymers</b> using soluble Ziegler-Natta catalyst in a semibatch reactor. Solution copolymerization of ethylene/propylene was performed using VOCl 3 -Al 2 Et 3 Cl 3 systems. Finally, the synthesized viscosity modifier was characterized by IR, GPC, 13 C NMR, DSC, and XRD techniques and elemental analysis method. Molecular weight was controlled by continuous feed of hydrogen during the reaction and its narrow dispersity was maintained by catalyst specifications and initial saturation of sol-vent by monomers. Although catalyst activity varies with time, 13 C NMR and IR results demonstrated steady copolymer composition. This was achieved by using a catalyst sys-tem with mostly single active site in a semi-batch polymerization by feeding monomers continuously. Also, {{it was found that}} randomness in the microstructure of the copolymer was induced at a specific monomer ratio...|$|R

Biopharmaceuticals present challenges {{because of their}} unique nature and difficulty in delivery through conventional routes. These challenges inspire for the invention of new medical grade polymers for novel drug delivery systems. Polymeric drug delivery systems bring a true benefit over glass. Polymer provide improved robustness against breakability and better ergonomy, while delivering for many product an adequate stability performance level regarding water/gas permeability as well as extractible/leachable.

However, it is difficult for existing manufacturing methods such as lithography, laser etching, and chemical reaction to fabricate one-step bare hydrophobic micro-patterned surfaces with good sliding performance for mass production. In the present research, one-step fabrication of bare hydrophobic micro-grooved and micro-pillar cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> surfaces with high precision in geometries has been achieved by ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM). According to the comparison of the static contact angle with theoretical models, droplet anisotropy, droplet contact line, contact angle hysteresis, and sliding angle measurement from the experiment, it is found that the droplet under the Cassie and Baxter regime gives a good sliding performance on bare micro-directional grooved cyclic <b>olefin</b> <b>copolymer</b> surfaces due to the shape edges induced by the numerically-controlled tool path of the material removal process in mechanical machining.
