40|$|Abstract Background Cigarette {{taxation}} {{has been}} perceived by academics and policy-makers {{as one of}} the most effective ways of reducing the use of cigarettes. On January 1 2002, the Taiwan government imposed a New Taiwan (NT) $ 5 per pack <b>tax</b> <b>earmarked</b> for the purpose of tobacco control. This study uses a survey collected prior to taxation to assess public attitudes toward cigarette taxation, public beliefs about the effectiveness of cigarette taxation at reducing cigarette use and public opinions about the allocation of this tax revenue. Methods Data were drawn from a national face-to-face interview on cigarette consumption in 2000. A total of 3, 279 adults were aged 18 to 64 years; 49. 9 % of whom were male and 50. 1 % female, and with a smoking prevalence of 49. 1 % and 4. 1 %, respectively. The attitudes toward cigarette tax were analysed using multi-logit regressions. We analysed by logistic regression the potential changes in smoking behaviour that smokers might make in response to the five NT (New Taiwan) dollar <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> on cigarettes per pack. We summarized public opinions about the allocation of <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> revenue using descriptive statistics. Results Current smokers (OR = 0. 34) and former smokers (OR = 0. 68) were less likely to support the cigarette tax than non-smokers. A favourable attitude toward the tax was positively associated with personal monthly income, especially among females. Among male smokers, the possibility of reducing/quitting smoking in response to the five-NT-dollar tax was negatively associated with the monthly expense for smoking. The two most frequently-suggested areas to receive money from the revenue collected from the <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> were health education and cancer subsidy. Conclusions Smoking status and economic factors determine the attitude and potential responses of people toward the cigarette tax. Taiwan's five NT-dollar <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> for cigarettes may have only a limited effect upon the reduction in cigarette use. </p...|$|R

The paper studies the implications of desirability of earmarked and general fund based upon economic stabilization in a two-sector growth model. Regardless of the nature of public goods, earmarked tax contributes to aggregate stabilization, while general fund may be destabilizing and cause fluctuations. The underlying mechanism in favor of <b>earmarked</b> <b>taxes</b> against general fund is that general fund creates intersectoral externalities and strategic complementarities that is sufficiently large to exert endogenously persistent and recurring fluctuations in aggregate activities in the absence of shocks to fundamentals. Earmarked taxing generates only sector-specific externalities that are too small to exert local indeterminacy. In a calibrated version, we compute the level of long-run welfare and the results reflect favorably upon the use of earmarked taxing. ...|$|E

40|$|Fiscal {{illusion}} is {{the political}} art of crafting tax and expenditure policies to make taxpayers think that taxes are not as onerous as they appear. Sinclair Davidson argues that big government distorts its citizens 2 ̆ 7 fiscal consciousness {{to allow it to}} raise more tax revenue and spend more than it otherwise could. Fiscal illusion gives governments the opportunity to distort their citizens’ fiscal consciousness; in particular, it allows them to create the impression that taxes are not as onerous as they appear. In this way, big government can raise more tax revenue than it otherwise could. There are a number of different techniques government can employ to create fiscal illusion. For example, greater complexity within the tax system generates uncertainty about the true tax burden. The extensive use of hypothecated or <b>earmarked</b> <b>taxes</b> also adds to fiscal illusion.

40|$|Tax earmarking, or hypothecation, {{refers to}} the {{assigning}} of receipts either from a single tax base, or as a proportion from a wider pool of revenue, to a specific end use; it contrasts with general fund financing of expenditure from consolidated receipts. The idea has been seized on both by {{those who want to}} defend the public sector who think it would make taxation popular and by those who want to cut public spending who expect the opposite effect. Earmarking may be applied in a strong or substantive sense, or in a weak or nominal sense. In the strong case, revenue determines expenditure, or at least revenue must match expenditure, and there may be associated referendums on the amount of spending and the tax rate. In the weak case, earmarking is purely formal — undertaken to make the system more transparent and to inform the taxpayer of the cost of a service. Earmarking may also be wide, covering a whole spending programme, or narrow, for a specific project within a programme. The principal example of earmarking (nominal) in the UK today is National Insurance contributions (NICs) which go to the National Insurance Fund out of which contributory benefits are paid.

40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} review {{studies of}} tobacco industry efforts to influence tobacco tax policies. Methods: Searches were conducted between 1 October 2009 and 31 March 2010 in 14 databases/websites, in relevant bibliographies and via experts. Studies were included if {{they focused on}} industry efforts to influence tobacco tax policies, drew on empirical evidence, were in English and concerned the period 1985 – 2010. In total, 36 studies met these criteria. Two reviewers undertook data extraction and critical appraisal. A random selection of 15 studies (42 %) was subject to second review. Evidence was assessed thematically to identify distinct tobacco industry aims, arguments and tactics. Results: A total of 34 studies examined industry efforts to influence tax levels. They suggest the tobacco industry works hard to prevent significant increases and particularly dislikes taxes ‘earmarked’ for tobacco control. Key arguments to counter increases are that tobacco taxes are socially regressive, unfair and lead to increased levels of illicit trade and negative economic impacts. For <b>earmarked</b> <b>taxes,</b> the industry also frequently tries to raise concerns about revenue allocation. Assessing industry arguments against established evidence demonstrates most are unsupported. Key industry tactics include: establishing ‘front groups’, securing credible allies, direct lobbying and publicity campaigns. Only seven studies examined efforts to influence tax structures.

40|$|The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) {{profiles}} are country-based {{reports that}} provide {{a detailed description of}} a health system and of policy initiatives in progress or under development. HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services {{and the role of the}} main actors in health systems; describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health and health care policies; and highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. The French health care system is a mix of public and private providers and insurers. Public insurance, financed by both employees and employer contributions and <b>earmarked</b> <b>taxes,</b> is compulsory and covers almost the whole population, while private insurance is of a complementary type and voluntary. Providers of outpatient care are largely private. Hospital beds are predominantly public or private non-profit-making. The French population enjoys good health and a high level of choice of providers. It is relatively satisfied with the health care system. However, as in many other countries, the rising cost of health care is of concern with regards to the objectives of the health care system. Many measures were or are being implemented in order to contain costs and increase efficiency. These include, for example, developing pay-for-performance for both hospitals and self-employed providers and increasing quality of professional practice; refining patient pathways; raising additional revenue for statutory health insurance (SHI); and increasing the role of voluntary health insurance (VHI). Meanwhile, socioeconomic disparities and geographic inequality in the density of health care professionals remain considerable challenges to providing a good level of equity in access to health care. Organizational changes at the regional level are important in attempting to tackle both equity and efficiency-related challenges. While the organizational structure of the system remained very stable until the mid 1990 s, in the following decade many changes occurred and several new institutions were created. Concurrently, the respective power and involvement of the parliament, government, local authorities and SHI in the policy-making process have evolved. However, the Ministry of Health has retained substantial control over the health system, although ongoing reforms at both the regional and the national levels may challenge its traditional role. This edition of the French HiT was written concurrently with the vote and implementation of the 2009 Hospital, Patients, Health and Territories Act, which dramatically changed again the organizational structure and management of the health care system at the regional and local level. In order to ensure a comprehensive description and understanding of the system, the HiT, therefore, describes both the previous organization and the reorganization following the Act. However, the implementation process of the Act and its formal application was still a work in progress at the time of completing the French HiT...|$|E
40|$|An Essential Health Benefit (EHB) is {{a policy}} {{intervention}} designed to direct resources to priority areas of health service delivery to reduce disease burdens and ensure equity in health. Many east and southern Africa (ESA) countries have introduced or updated EHBs in the 2000 s. Recognising this, the Regional Network for Equity in Health in East and Southern Africa (EQUINET), through Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) and Training and Research Support Centre (TARSC), is implementing research to understand the role of facilitators and the barriers to nationwide application of the EHB in resourcing, organising and in accountability on integrated health services. This literature review provides background evidence to inform the case study work and regional dialogue. It compiles evidence from published and public domain literature on EHBs in sixteen ESA countries, including information on the motivations for developing the EHBs; the methods used to develop, define and cost them; how they are being disseminated and communicated within countries; how they are being used in budgeting, resourcing and purchasing health services and in monitoring health system performance for accountability; and the facilitators and barriers to their development, uptake or use. The literature review indicated that EHBs are widespread across the region, with thirteen of the sixteen ESA countries having them, albeit with different names applied to them and {{at different stages of}} implementation. All thirteen countries have designed an EHB or {{are in the process of}} updating it, ten have included them explicitly in policies; nine have implemented them and five have evaluated them. The majority apply them in the public sector at national scale. The development of an EHB was motivated by efforts to clarify health entitlements, to identify prioritised health interventions with cost benefit to meet priority population health burdens and to align resources to implement these services universally to all. EHBs are largely initiated and designed by central ministries of health, with involvement of external funders in some countries, and limited consultation with other stakeholders or communities. Most applied analysis of health burdens and cost-benefit interventions to identify services for inclusion, and some included a focus on specific areas of policy commitment, such as maternal and child health, where there was also sector-wide funding from external partners. It was not always apparent that those developing the EHB had adequate, quality population health information and costing data for this. In general, the methods and assumptions used for both prioritisation of services or their costing do not appear to be comparable across the region. The EHBs in ESA countries generally apply to all social groups and cover services from community to primary care to hospital level. The different EHBs in ESA countries cover specific communicable and noncommunicable disease programmes, maternal and child health and public health interventions, although with less common inclusion of laboratory, paramedical and allied services. Primary health care was a focus in all. EHB costs were differentiated by level of care, type of service provided and whether in the public or private sector. The estimated cost for public sector provision of the EHB of approximately $ 14 -$ 25 * per capita at primary care level and $ 40 -$ 74 per capita, including referral hospital services, compares well with the $ 60 per capita estimated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2008 for health system costs, if this is adjusted for inflation. (* all dollar figures refer to US dollars) While the EHBs are largely tax funded from government budgets, in most countries in the region the amount allocated from ministries of finance is insufficient to cover the benefit. If the cost of the EHB is estimated at about $ 70 per capita, then only seven of the sixteen countries had a total health expenditure post- 2010 that covers this, and far fewer if only government expenditure/capita is used. In part, therefore, the costing of the EHB provides an estimate for ministries of finance on what budget would be needed to deliver what is regarded as an ‘essential benefit’ and the size of the public sector funding gap. The funding gap means that in most ESA countries out-of-pocket spending (OOP) and external funding in sector-wide approach (SWAp) type arrangements have been used to support delivery of the EHB. Such OOP spending, however, is often being collected through fee charges that contradict policy and raise barriers to care for poorest groups. External funding makes countries dependent on unpredictable sources for core services. The demand to raise additional domestic revenue has led ESA countries to explore other <b>earmarked</b> <b>taxes</b> and mandatory national insurance. Some countries have focused on delivery of specific priorities within the overall benefit package in the EHB, intending to roll out others as resources increase. Others have proposed to use fee charges for non-EHB services to fund those in the EHB. The EHB can play a key role in active and strategic purchasing of health services, widening performance funding from a narrow range of disease-specific outputs to a wider service package. This would be important also in decentralisation approaches being applied. However, the literature provided limited evidence of this use of the EHB, including with local government, private, mission sectors, and other nonstate providers, to align their services to priority benefits and monitor performance. The role of the EHB in purchasing (contracting and performance and equity monitoring) strategies would appear to be an area that needs further review within the region. From the five countries where evaluations have been implemented on their EHBs, there was some evidence of an implementation gap. The evaluations suggest that improvements in health and healthcare may arise from the use of EHBs, but that this depends on lower income groups accessing the services covered and on benefit packages being funded, available and effectively provided at primary care level and in district hospitals, with additional measures to ensure uptake in lower income groups and to control cost escalation. Designing and implementing an EHB was enabled by having access to capacities, methods and adequate quality data for the design, by collaboration across state and non-state actors, by having personnel and resources to implement it and by having the information and expenditure tracking systems to primary level to monitor it. The evaluations pointed to barriers within all these areas. These facilitators and barriers can be located within a wider demand for strengthening the health system. The limitations of this review are noted in Section 2, some of which can only be addressed through countrylevel assessment. Following the production of this review, the EQUINET programme on this area will be working with country teams led by ministries of health in four ESA countries to carry out more detailed case studies to assess the motivations for and methods used in developing and costing EHBs; the manner in which EHBs have been disseminated and used; promising practice, learning and the key issues for follow up, including bringing back wider regional exchange. The issues raised in the discussion point to areas for inclusion in the protocols for the more detailed assessment within countries, particularly since some work on EHBs is in progress or not documented in published literature. The follow-up could thus give attention to: a. The method used to assess and prioritise the benefits in the EHB, paying attention to programme areas and health system elements; b. The method used for prioritising services and costing of the EHBs and its alignment to ministry of finance, external and other funders; c. The methods of and challenges in blending funds from different sources for the EHB, how funding shortfalls are addressed and how new funding sources proposed or under policy dialogue will be pooled to provide the EHB for all; d. The factors enabling/disabling implementation, from design to monitoring and review, noting inclusiveness of participation in the design; collaboration between state and non-state/private actors; quality of information and expenditure on tracking systems; e. The use of the EHB in purchasing strategies with providers and the factors affecting this; f. The measures for governance, management of and accountability for the EHB and for managing the role of other sectors in the delivery of the EHB; and g.

As reference for the individual behavior we use the model of a rational utility maximizer described by the economic theory. We determine a significant influence of the labeling and the <b>earmarking</b> of <b>taxes.</b> We can show that the labeling and earmarking effect can decrease the perceived tax burden for the test persons which results in a deviation from a (rational) consumption maximizing behavior. These results give important implications for tax policy regarding further reforms of the tax and contribution system.

The purpose of the paper is to evaluate one form of environmental taxation, the French tax on air pollution from 1990 - 99. While starting out in 1985 as a tax levied only on sulphur emissions, the tax base was subsequently extended to encompass also emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). The revenues of the French tax on air pollution were earmarked for abatement subsidies and the …nancing of air quality surveillance systems. We use a plant-level database on emissions, …rm characteristics, taxes paid and subsidies received to evaluate the abatement elasticity {{with regard to the}} tax and the subsidies. Our ex post analysis also allows for an evaluation of the distributional impact of the <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> on di¤erent industry sectors. ...|$|R
40|$|A “good ” {{tax system}} for {{developing}} countries was once considered one based on progressive income taxes. More recently, emphasis has been placed securing revenues from broader bases at lower rates from consumption as well as income taxes. A framework for evaluating public finance structures and institutions in terms of revenue and spending {{as well as the}} fiscal balance is set out, and some key areas such as VAT, <b>earmarking,</b> <b>tax</b> evasion and administration, and non-tax revenues are discussed. Increased globalization challenges national tax bases and make it even more important to improve local fiscal expertise and institutions in developing countries. Finally, if local governments are sufficiently reliant on own revenue to promote fiscal discipline, decentralization may produce gains in both Richard M.

Furthermore tax rates are generally too low to significantly influence polluters' behavior. The paper develops a political economy model to explain these design parameters: the <b>tax</b> rate, <b>earmarking</b> pattern and whether the tax is combined with a regulation. An incumbent government selects these parameters under the influence of a green and a polluters' lobby groups. An <b>earmarked</b> <b>tax</b> is introduced in equilibrium which rate is lower than the regulatory shadow price when the status quo regulation is imperfectly enforced and if the green lobby is sufficiently wea...|$|R
