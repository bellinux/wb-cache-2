40|$|Hashing or scatter table storage [3] {{is a very}} {{efficient}} data structure for the dictionary (<b>insert,</b> delete, <b>member)</b> problem. The load factor ff of a table {{is defined as the}} ratio of the number n of records or elements in the table divided by the number m of records the table can hold. The advantage of hashing schemes is that if ff ! 1, the cost of performing any of the dictionary operations can be bounded by a function of ff, the load factor, independent of the values of n and m. This compares favorably with tree-like structures and other key comparison based schemes where the cost of the dictionary operations is ΩΓ/ 17 n).

40|$|The long {{interspersed}} repeated DNA {{family of}} rats (LINE or L 1 Rn family) contains about 40, 000 6. 7 -kilobase (kb) long members (1). LINE members may be currently mobile since their {{presence or absence}} causes allelic variation at three single copy loci (2, 3) : insulin 1, Moloney leukemia virus integration 2 (Mlvi- 2) (4), and immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh). To characterize target sites for LINE insertion, we compared the DNA sequences of the unoccupied Mlvi- 2 target site, its LINE-containing allele, and several other LINE-containing sites. Although not homologous overall, the target sites share three characteristics: First, depending on the site, they are from 68 % to 86 % (A+T) compared to 58 % (A+T) for total rat DNA (5).

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of prokaryotes possess DNA {{modifications}} consisting of sequence-specific phosphorothioates (PT) <b>inserted</b> by <b>members</b> of a five-gene cluster. Recent genome mapping studies revealed two unusual features of PT modifications: short consensus sequences and partial modification of a specific genomic site in a population of bacteria. To better understand the mechanism of target selection of PT modifications that underlies these features, we characterized the substrate recognition of the PT-modifying enzymes termed DptC, D and E in a cell extract system from Salmonella. The results revealed that double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides underwent de novo PT modification in vitro, with the same modification pattern as in vivo, i. e., GpsAAC/GpsTTC motif. Unexpectedly, in these in vitro analyses we observed no significant effect on PT modification by sequences flanking GAAC/GTTC motif, while PT also occurred in the GAAC/GTTC motif {{that could not be}} modified in vivo. Hemi-PT DNA also served as substrate of the PT-modifying enzymes, but not single-stranded DNA. The PT-modifying enzymes were then found to function as a large protein complex, with all of three subunits in tetrameric conformations. This study provided the first demonstration of in vitro DNA PT modification by PT-modifying enzymes that function as a large protein complex.

Work presented here reflects our studies towards synthesis {{of a variety of}} five, six and seven membered heterocycles fused with a benzene ring. Due to their well established biological activity profile, special emphasis has been placed on the synthesis of indoles, benzoxazepines and benzodiazepines. The asymmetric synthesis of benzodiazepines (308 - 310) & novel (3 R) - 4, 1 -benzoxazepines 2, 5 -diones (336 - 339) has been achieved employing chiral pool methodology that involved coupling of readily available amino acids / ?-haloacid halides (285, 325 - 327) (that served as asymmetric precursors) with substituted anthranilic acid as symmetric precursors. We have reported the use of (S) - 2 -bromopropanoic acid that favours a single step synthesis of 4, 1 benzoxazepines- 2, 5 -diones with low ee whilst, the use of (S) - 2 -chloroacids (322 - 324) yielded novel (S) -N-acylanthranilic acids (328 - 334) exclusively. Conversion of these acids (328 - 334) to the corresponding chiral 4, 1 -benzoxazepines- 2, 5 -diones (336 - 339) was achieved in a subsequent cyclization step in high ee along with the formation of a side-product 335 a-b (3, 1 -benzoxazine- 4 -one). The condensation of formylated indoles (364 - 365) with a variety of anilines bestowed a series of novel indole imines (383 - 404), which upon reduction rendered a series of novel indole amines (405 - 413).
