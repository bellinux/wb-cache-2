5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>after</b> a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>after</b> everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lansman {{was brought}} up in an Orthodox Jewish family in Southgate, north London. He was a pupil at the {{independent}} Highgate School from 1970 to 1975. [...] He first visited Israel when he was 16: [...] "I worked on a kibbutz in the Negev and my aunt lived in Beersheba. [...] It was actually a very politicising experience. When I did my bar mitzvah I saw myself as a Zionist and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>after</b> I went there I felt it less. [...] I was more interested in the kibbutz and what I liked about it was the pioneering spirit, the sense of community and radicalism of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so, too," [...] Harris agreed. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can. <b>After</b> all, it's just a {{question}} of increasing their self-awareness. When they have that the Pipers will vanish." ...|$|R

60|$|No, {{you wanted}} to dun me. I'm {{disappointed}} in you. <b>I</b> did <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> all the things I've had from you, you wouldn't treat me like that.|$|R

In the following January he was equally successful and, to fulfill his obligations to write music for Catania—a condition of his scholarship—he sent a Messa di gloria which was performed the following October. His involvement in Zingarelli's class took place over the 1822/23 school year. By January 1824, after passing examinations where he did very well, resulted in his being given the title of primo maestrino, a post which required him to tutor younger students, allowed him to have a room of his own in the Collegio, and also allowed him visits to the opera on Thursdays and Sundays, where he saw his first opera by Rossini, Semiramide. While Weinstock gives an account of how he was [...] "clearly captivated by the music of Rossini... he put Rossini on a pedestal", he relates that, returning from the performance Bellini was unusually quiet and then [...] "suddenly exclaimed to his companions, 'Do you know what <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>After</b> Semiramide, it's futile for us to try and achieve anything' [...] " ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I shall hear it with pleasure, cousin. You say {{he holds}} only {{temporary}} rank. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>after</b> the signal service he has rendered, {{it should be}} made substantial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{answered}} it. It {{was very}} bad, my letter. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>after</b> {{that he will}} never {{want to have anything}} more to say to me. I tried for two days, but I could not write a nice letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I promise that, father. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> what we {{have had}} to put up with here, during the past two or three months especially, I can bear {{anything}} for these last few days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really. It is odd, but, I too, {{have had}} a letter from Madame Riennes, also unsigned, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> reading it, that you may safely show me yours, and then {{tell me the truth}} of all these accusations she makes {{concerning}} you and Juliette." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{horse of}} my own!' said she. 'Oh, stop one moment, {{and let me}} see which I will choose. The white one? No. The chestnut? No. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> all, I like the coal-black one best, with the little white star on his forehead. Oh, do stop, just for a minute.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so. <b>After</b> {{the lesson}} {{you have given}} Berruyer of the {{fighting}} qualities of the peasants, it is pretty certain {{that he will not}} venture to attack us after a hard day's march, and a fight that must have sorely discouraged his men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dora Bannister," [...] {{interrupted}} Miss Panney, [...] "it may be {{a little}} early to make bridal presents, but I want to give you this corkscrew. It is a very good one, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>after</b> a while you will have need of it. Good morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay; she's fonder o' {{you than}} o' the other aunts, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> She takes <b>after</b> our family: {{not a bit}} of her mother's in her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will write}} to you often," [...] she said; [...] "but I beg you, for my sake, not to {{accompany}} us to France." [...] Her look and tone reduced me to obedience. Stupid as I am <b>I</b> <b>think</b> (<b>after</b> what passed {{between me and}} her mother) I can guess what she meant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh, that wasn't so bad!" [...] replied Tom. [...] "But {{it would}} be, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> a heavy storm, when {{the river was}} swollen. It must be getting late," [...] he added. [...] "Better speed her up a little, or we'll get to Hope {{just in time to}} say 'good-night,'" [...] and he smiled grimly.|$|E
6000|$|... "How's this, Watson?" [...] he cried, {{picking up}} the paper from the table. [...] "'High red house with white stone facings. Third floor. Second window left. After dusk. G.' That is {{definite}} enough. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>after</b> breakfast {{we must make a}} little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren's neighbourhood. Ah, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{enjoy it}} very much," [...] said Prothero {{in a small}} voice after an {{interval}} for reflection. [...] "I wonder where we shall fly. It will do us both a lot of good. And I shall insure my life for a small amount in my mother's interest.... Benham, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> will, <b>after</b> all, take a whiskey.... Life is short...." ...|$|R

6000|$|Courtland looked up, {{recovering}} {{his usual}} cheerful calm. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>after</b> luncheon I'll pay my respects to her family. From {{what you have}} just told me the farm is certainly an experiment worth seeing. I suppose your father will {{have no objection to}} give me a letter to Miss Dows?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, you see, Gerald, if I had {{not made}} up my mind to stick to uncle's business, I might have been on board the Brilliant now, with Jim Sankey; and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> my giving up that chance, it would be only fair that I should be allowed to have a cruise, now {{that there is such a}} splendid opportunity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{knew that}} before, Harry," [...] Mrs. Holl said severely, [...] "for I told you {{over and over}} again that your mother was a lady, though she was in bad circumstances, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> {{charring}} in respectable houses for the last twenty years, I ought to know a lady when I sees one. Well, there's nothing as you think I could do about it?" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is apt to}} be {{a certain}} leisureliness about the methods of country telephone-operators, and the fact that a voice did not {{immediately}} ask me what number I wanted did not at first disturb me. Suspicion of the truth came to me, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> my third shout into the receiver had remained unanswered. I had suffered from delay before, but never such delay as this.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> now <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> many doubts, {{that the}} passage, [...] "I {{know that my}} Redeemer liveth," [...] &c. may fairly {{be taken as a}} burst of determination, a quasi prophecy. [1] [...] "I know not how this can be; but in spite of all my difficulties, this I do know, that I shall be recompensed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Mr. Hayes, no harm meant," [...] said Holmes. [...] "We {{have been}} having {{a look at your}} horses, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'll walk, <b>after</b> all. It's not far, I believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose she}} {{was fond of}} that fellow, Crosbie. She can't be very fond of him now, <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> {{the way he has}} treated her; but she'll find a {{difficulty}} in making her confession that she really likes you better than she ever liked him. Of course that's what you'll want her to say." ...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes, {{before going}} to the balls, we went to the opera, which, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> a time I liked more than the parties. Percy always {{accompanied}} us there, but he did not often go the balls, which I was sorry for; I liked him so much as a partner, and I could talk with him, so much more naturally and freely about every one there, than I could with my other partners.|$|E
6000|$|... "So Mr. Davenant told me," [...] she said. [...] "I can't quite forgive you, Mr. Cuthbert, {{for letting}} me grow up and be so shamefully imposed upon, but of course I don't blame you as I do the others. I am only thankful that I have made myself {{independent}} of my relations. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>after</b> the letters which I wrote to them last night, they will be quite content to let me remain where they put my father--outside their lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{say that}} nobody will answer our inquiries, my dear--I only say the {{peasantry}} won't answer them, if your friend has trusted herself to their protection. The {{way to find}} her is to look on, beyond what Miss Silvester may be doing at the present moment, to what Miss Silvester contemplates doing--let us say, before the day is out. We may assume, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> (<b>after</b> what has happened), that, {{as soon as she}} can leave this neighborhood, she assuredly will leave it. Do you agree, so far?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{take this}} packet to Lord Chelsford," [...] I said. [...] "I am down {{here as a}} spy--a spy upon spies. He is {{up at the house}} now, and to-morrow this packet will be in his hands. I shall tell him how I secured it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>after</b> that you will not have many {{opportunities}} for plying your cursed trade." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{tried to}} kill {{yourself}} four times for me," [...] she said, unsteadily, [...] "and I have been chained up as a madwoman for you. <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> that <b>after</b> that----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if you DO such a thing, Silas, I'll {{never speak}} to you again! It's no USE!
