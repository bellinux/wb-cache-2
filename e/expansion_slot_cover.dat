NOTE: It is very {{important}} that you have your serial number and model number written down for future reference. If you ever need to call our Technical Support department, you will need these numbers to receive assistance. Make sure that your computer is shut down. Turn off your computer and all peripheral devices. Unplug your computer and remove the computer’s cover. If you currently have an internal modem in your computer, remove the telephone cord before removing your computer’s cover. 2 Remove the <b>expansion</b> <b>slot</b> <b>cover.</b> CAUTION: To avoid the risk of electrical shock, make sure your computer and all peripheral devices are turned off and unplugged. Disconnect all telephone cables from the modem before opening the PC cover. Unscrew and remove the <b>expansion</b> <b>slot</b> <b>cover</b> at the back of an empty PCI expansion slot. The slot cover is {{on the back of your}} computer and covers an opening on your computer’s case. The opening lines up with the expansion slot inside the computer, which is 3. 5 inches long and usually white plastic lined with metal. 3 Insert the modem into the empty PCI expansion slot. Insert the modem, gold edge first, into the PCI slot. The modem will fit snugly. You may need to rock the modem back and forth firmly to properly seat it in the slot. NOTE: Properly seating this modem in the slot can be difficult, because it requires more force than some other internal modems. Use firm downward pressure. When the modem is properly installed, you will no longer see any part of the gold edge. The modem’s metal bracket will cover the opening on the back of the computer. Secure the modem with the screw you removed in step two. Replace the computer’s cover...|$|E
