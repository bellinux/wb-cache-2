500|$|Many in the German navy {{were furious}} over Ingenohl's timidity, and his {{reputation}} suffered greatly. Großadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz remarked that [...] "On 16 December, Ingenohl had {{the fate of}} Germany <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand. I boil with inward emotion whenever I think of it." [...] The captain of the battlecruiser [...] was even more scathing; he stated that Ingenohl had turned away [...] "because {{he was afraid of}} eleven British destroyers which could have been easily eliminated ... Under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryan's opening claimed no {{personal}} prestige for himself—but nevertheless placed {{him as the}} spokesman for silver. According to Bensel, the self-deprecation helped disarm the delegates. As Bryan was not deemed a major contender for the nomination, even delegates committed to a candidate could cheer him without seeming to betray their allegiance. Bryan then recounted {{the history of the}} silver movement; the audience, which had loudly demonstrated its approval of his opening statements, quieted. Throughout the speech, Bryan had the delegates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand; they cheered on cue. The Nebraskan later described the audience as like a trained choir. As he concluded his historical recitation, he reminded the silver delegates that they had come to crown their victory, [...] "not to discuss, not to debate, but to enter up the judgment already rendered by the plain people of this country".|$|E
500|$|... "Up in the Air" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} at special concerts, dubbed as Church of Mars, in May 2013, {{shortly before the}} release of the album. It later became a signature part of the opening stages of the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour which followed, usually appearing as the ultimate song or during the encore. Throughout the tour, Jared Leto chose audience members to join Thirty Seconds to Mars on stage for [...] "Up in the Air". The song was later moved {{to the beginning of the}} setlist as a set opener along with [...] "O Fortuna", a movement from Carl Orff's scenic cantata Carmina Burana. Fans and critics responded favorably to the song in a live setting. Danny Crandall of The Sun Chronicle commended the theatrics of the performance, while Grace Carroll from Gigwise noted that until the last note of the song, Leto had the audience [...] "completely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand".|$|E

500|$|Mercury {{was noted}} for his live performances, which were often {{delivered}} to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked {{a great deal}} of participation from the crowd. A writer for The Spectator described him as [...] "a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself." [...] David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song [...] "Under Pressure" [...] with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: [...] "Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make [...] "the last person {{at the back of the}} furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected". Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand, which after accidentally snapping off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised could be used in endless ways.|$|E
500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{intended}} [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] – a song {{he later}} characterised as a [...] "kid's story" [...] – {{as a vehicle}} for Starr's limited vocal range. The lyrics were written by McCartney and Lennon, with assistance from Scottish singer Donovan, and tell of life on a sea voyage accompanied by friends. Gould considers the song's childlike qualities to be [...] "deceptive" [...] and that, once in the studio, it became [...] "a sophisticated sonic pastiche". On 1 June, the Beatles and a group of their friends created a nautical atmosphere over the pre-recorded basic track, by mixing sounds such as gongs, whistles and bells with an assortment of Studio 2's sound effects. To fill the portion after the lyrics refer to a brass band playing, Martin and Emerick used a Sousa march recording, sourced from EMI's library, splicing up the taped copy and rearranging the melody. Lennon recorded the track's superimposed voices in an echo chamber, supporting Starr's lead vocal in a manner that Gould likens to [...] "an old vaudevillian with the crowd <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand". Riley recognises the song's mix of comedy as reminiscent of The Goon Show with satire inspired by Spike Jones. Donovan later said that [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] represented the Beatles' predicament as prisoners of their international fame, to which they reacted by singing an uplifting, communal song.|$|E

Within the first eight bars he had them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand."

2500|$|Mountbatten {{was fond}} of Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru and his liberal outlook for the country.

[...] During his meeting with Jinnah on 5 April 1947, Mountbatten tried to persuade Jinnah of a united India, citing the difficult task of dividing the mixed states of Punjab and Bengal, but the Muslim leader was unyielding in his goal of establishing a separate Muslim state called Pakistan.|$|E
