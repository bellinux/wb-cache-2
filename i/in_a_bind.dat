5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bind.</b> The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E
25|$|Nanda was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bind.</b> His ministers {{warned that}} {{a failure to}} {{recapture}} Siam would trigger domino-like rebellions elsewhere in the empire. The problem was that he still did not have complete control over his vassals to raise a large enough force that had a reasonable shot at reconquering Siam. He tried to replace the vassals with his loyalists at every opportunity. In May 1584, he appointed Min Letya, son of King Tabinshwehti, as governor of Ava in place of Thado Minsaw. The office was strictly a non-hereditary governorship, not the viceroyship Thado Minsaw enjoyed. But Nanda could not replace hereditary rulers without cause. When Viceroy Minkhaung II of Toungoo died in June/July 1584, he had to accept the late viceroy's eldest son Minye Thihathu II as the rightful successor. Minye Thihathu II for his part pledged loyalty to his cousin.|$|E

25|$|The 90-minute {{pilot film}} {{initially}} aired on March 21, 1976. The story focuses heavily on Kelly Garrett (a role intended for Jackson before she and Smith swapped) who poses as an heiress who returns home to gain her father's successful winery. In {{the end of}} the film the three women are caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bind</b> and Scott attempts to save them, but to no avail, leaving them to solve the dilemma on their own (and with the help of allies made during the story). ABC executives were somewhat disappointed in this initial project, fearing there was more emphasis on light-weight fluff than serious drama. After viewing the pilot, Spelling encouraged executives to delete Scott Woodville from the series; according to The Charlie's Angels Casebook, audiences also reacted negatively to the character. Bosley was kept, made slightly less inept than depicted in the pilot, and was given many of Woodville's attributes and responsibilities. The series formally premiered on Wednesday, September 22, 1976 at 10:00pm.|$|E
500|$|Christine Love is a Canadian {{independent}} visual novel writer {{best known}} for her original works Don't Take It Personally, Babe, It Just Ain't Your Story; and Ladykiller <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bind.</b> Love began creating visual novels while in university, making a few small games, visual novels, and pieces of written fiction before coming into prominence with the release of Digital in 2010. She went on to work on Love and Order, a dating simulation by video game designer Riva Celso, as well as Don't take it personally, both released in 2011. Her first commercial project on which she was the primary developer is Analogue, released in February 2012; Love dropped out of her English degree during its development, and is currently a full-time game developer. She released an expansion to the game, titled Hate Plus in 2013. Her latest project, Ladykiller <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bind,</b> was released in October 2016.|$|E
500|$|That summer, Love {{began working}} on a larger, {{commercial}} game. She was beginning to believe that her games could be successful commercially, a belief supported by messages to that effect by fans of her previous works. The game, , was released in February 2012. Love dropped out of university during the game's development in her fourth year of an English undergraduate degree. She {{felt that she was}} [...] "not really learning a whole lot" [...] and was unable to balance school and work on the game. Set centuries after Digital: A Love Story, the plot of Analogue revolves around an unnamed investigator, who is tasked with discovering the reason for an interstellar ship's disappearance once it reappears 600 years after [...] "going dark". The game's themes focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues; but focus primarily on [...] "transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness and cosplay." [...] The release of Analogue, Love's first commercial game as main developer, currently fully supports her financially. Although Analogue is a sequel [...] "of sorts" [...] to Digital, the time difference between the two games means that they are connected more in spirit than directly, similar to the connections between Digital and Don't take it personally. Analogue sold over 30,000 copies by August 2012, and has inspired the release of a soundtrack album by the game's composer, Isaac Schankler, as well as a commercial expansion to the game, titled Hate Plus, which is intended to further develop the backstory of *Mute and the ship. In 2016, Love released a new visual novel, Ladykiller <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bind.</b> She described the game as [...] "an erotic visual novel about social manipulation and girls tying up other girls".|$|E

Davout had lost 10,000 men marching to Minsk and would not attack Bagration without Jerome joining him. [...] Two French Cavalry defeats by Platov kept the French in the dark and Bagration was no better informed with both overestimating the other's strength, Davout thought Bagration had some 60,000 men and Bagration thought Davout had 70,000. [...] Bagration was getting orders from both Alexander's staff and Barclay (which Barclay didn't know) and left Bagration without a clear picture of what was expected of him and the general situation.

Once he had decided upon making deeper cuts than he promised, Chrétien proved to be firm supporter of the new course, and supported Martin's cuts to other departments despite the complaints of the other ministers. Chrétien's advisor Eddie Goldenberg later recalled that Chrétien was unyielding {{in the face of}} efforts by other ministers to [...] "spare" [...] their departments, and that Chrétien kept on saying [...] "If I change anything, everything will unravel". In a 2011 interview, Chrétien recalled about the 1995 budget that: [...] "There would have been a day when we would have been the Greece of today. I knew we were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bind</b> and we had to do something." [...] In order to silence objections from left-wing Liberal backbenchers and Cabinet ministers, Chrétien ensured that the Program Review Committee chaired by Marcel Massé that would decide what programs to end and which to cut had a majority comprising the leftist MPs Brian Tobin, Sheila Copps, Sergio Marchi and Herb Gray, people who would not normally supporting cutting programs, and thereby underlined the seriousness of the crisis. It was only with the budget that Martin introduced on February 27, 1995, that the Chrétien government began a policy of cuts designed to eliminate the deficit in order to reassure the markets.|$|E

2500|$|The 1985 Wimbledon Championships final saw Evert play Navratilova for the fifth-time at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC). [...] In {{the first}} set, Evert broke Navratilova {{in the third}} game of the set, which allowed her to go up on serve. [...] This {{would not be an}} {{uncomplicated}} set though for Evert because at five game to four with her serving for the match she had many complications. [...] Evert took the first point of the game on a volley that her opponent hit into the net. [...] Evert would find herself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bind</b> on break point in the first set, which Navratilova hit a backhand volley, but Evert reached it with a forehand shot. [...] Then she had to stave off another break point with a speedy forehand. [...] On the first set point, Evert misplayed a forehand to deep, and lost the point. [...] The second set point was played out by a weakly lobbed shot by Evert was tracked down by Navratilova, and her opponent played another lob back, which Evert played horridly overhead smash shot. [...] This was still barely strong enough to force a measger return by Navratilova, which Evert volley the ball into the corner to take the opening set six games to four. [...] In the second set, Evert could not get her playing level back from the first set. [...] Evert was at one-all love-30 on Navratilova's serve, but was unable to get a break point off of her, which in the subsequent game her opponent would break her serve and the score line was one game to three instead of the other way around. [...] Evert now found herself at two games to four and love-30 down, and got lambasted by four Navratilova winners. [...] At five games to three, Evert had two break points, but could not convert, which Evert lost the second set three games to six. [...] In the decider set, Evert was quickly put on the defensive by Navratilova in the first game, which she was down 15 points to love. [...] At this juncture, Evert saved those two break point opportunities, but on deuce came to net and got passed, which set up a three-times-a-charm break point and her opponent capitalized on the opening. [...] Evert could not get back on track because of the relentless nature to Navratilova's game, which in the last game was plagued by bad line calls and lost the set two games to six. [...] In the end, Evert never won a final appearance at Wimbledon against her arch-enemy Navratilova in all five-time they pair played in them together.|$|E
