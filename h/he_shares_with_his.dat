5|$|From the {{apartment}} <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hypochondriac mother Winifred, Seymour fetches his odd-looking, potted plant, but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly, drooping look. However, when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract {{people from all}} over the world to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant's leaves open up. When Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant, Audrey Jr. opens wider, eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood. After that, each night Seymour nurses his creation with blood from his fingers. Although he feels increasingly listless, Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured in to see the plant.|$|E

5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Walker's Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), whom Frank {{recommended}} for the job. She reveals {{that she and}} Walker have decided to rescind their promise to nominate him as Secretary of State because {{they want him to}} remain in Congress and use his political expertise to get the President-elect’s education reform agenda passed. Frank is initially incensed, but when Linda asks if he will continue to be an ally to the future President he says that he will. Linda reveals that Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) has been chosen for the position instead. Despite his statement to the contrary, Frank feels personally betrayed and, with Claire’s encouragement, begins to formulate a plot for revenge, which <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Mrs. Underwood, meanwhile, is forced to downsize the non-profit organization she manages, the Clean Water Initiative, which had been promised a large donation upon her husband’s confirmation as Secretary, without which the organization is forced to substantially curtail its budget.|$|E

2500|$|A central idea in Poythress' thought has {{concerned}} {{the validity of}} multiple perspectives, or multiperspectivalism, a project that <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> teacher and collaborator John Frame. In Poythress's work Philosophy, Science, and the Sovereignty of God, he explored how the scientific concepts of wave, particle and field can be used analogically to demonstrate different {{ways of looking at}} things. He argued that such a triadic structure is [...] "a means of avoiding unhealthy dualism", and he continued on this line of thought in Symphonic Theology, where he applied multiperspectivalism to theology.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the traits <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fellow vampires, Edward has certain abilities that are his alone. He possesses superior superhuman speed {{compared to that of}} other vampires and is the fastest of the Cullens, able to outrun any of them. Edward is also telepathic, able to read the mind of anyone within a few miles of himself; Bella is the sole exception to this rule, which Meyer has stated is due to Bella having a very private mind. [...] Edward also retains some of the traditional mindset and dated patterns of speech from his early-20th century human life.|$|E
2500|$|The action {{takes place}} {{ten years after}} the end of World War I in a small town in France. The protagonist, Julien Davenne, is a war veteran who works as an editor at the newspaper, [...] "The Globe". He specializes in funeral {{announcements}} ("a virtuoso of the obituary", as defined by its editor-in-chief) and the thought of death haunts him. Davenne has reserved a room for the worship of his wife, Julie, on the upper floor of the house <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> elderly housekeeper, Mrs. Rambaud, and Georges, a deaf-mute boy. His wife had died eleven years prior, at the height of her beauty.|$|E
2500|$|Subtitled [...] "A legendary {{problem and}} the battle over who solved it", the article {{concentrates}} on the human drama of the story, especially the discussion on who contributed how much to the proof of the Poincaré conjecture. Interwoven with the article is {{an interview with the}} reclusive mathematician Grigori Perelman, whom the authors tracked down to the St. Petersburg apartment <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> mother, as well as interviews with many mathematicians. The article describes Perelman's disillusionment with and withdrawal from the mathematical community and paints an unflattering portrait of the 1982 Fields Medalist, Shing-Tung Yau. Yau has disputed the accuracy of the article and threatened legal action against the New Yorker. The New Yorker stood by its story and no lawsuit was filed.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart {{returns to}} the office and chats to his co-worker, Charlotte, with whom they share a very fond friendship, albeit a totally platonic one. Charlotte, openly a devout Christian {{frequently}} reading her Bible, lends Stewart a video of a programme she recorded, Songs That Changed My Life. Stewart agrees to please Charlotte, and returns home to the flat <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sister, Imogen. After Imogen goes out for the evening, Stewart puts the video on. The programme is a religious one consisting exclusively of Christian songs that various obscure Christian figures find uplifting, and Stewart is barely interested – until the programme ends. Then the video returns to what was partly recorded over – a pornographic video – [...] and Stewart watches in amazement. Imogen, in the meantime, spends the whole evening waiting for a date from a dating agency who fails to turn up. When Imogen returns home, both she and Stewart lie about what they have been doing that evening.|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that the TARDIS's telepathic field is what gives Rose the ability to understand and be understood by the aliens. This concept was first introduced in the Fourth Doctor serial The Masque of Mandragora, described by the Doctor as a [...] "Time Lord gift" [...] <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> companions. In [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", the Doctor tells Donna that translation is a [...] "gift of the TARDIS". In [...] "The Christmas Invasion", it is shown that the translation field {{is connected to the}} Doctor and stops working when he is unconscious, recovering from regeneration. Rose says this is because he is [...] "part of the circuit and he is broken". In [...] "A Good Man Goes To War", River Song implies this translation ability lingers in the mind even when people have left the TARDIS and are no longer near it. The concept of a Doctor-supercharged communications device first appeared in The Three Doctors (1972–73), where the Second Doctor modifies the Brigadier's radio telephone to allow him to contact his men through interference generated by antimatter.|$|E

6000|$|What distinguishes Goethe for French and English readers, is a {{property}} which <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> nation,--a habitual reference to interior truth. In England and in America {{there is a}} respect for talent; and, if it is exerted in support of any ascertained or intelligible interest or party, or in regular opposition to any, the public is satisfied. In France, {{there is even a}} greater delight in intellectual brilliancy, for its own sake. And, in all these countries, men of talent write from talent. It is enough if the understanding is occupied, the taste propitiated,--so many columns so many hours, filled in a lively and creditable way. The German intellect wants the French sprightliness, the fine practical understanding of the English, and the American adventure; but it has a certain probity, which never rests in a superficial performance, but asks steadily, To what end? A German public asks for a controlling sincerity. Here is activity of thought; but what is it for? What does the man mean? Whence, whence, all these thoughts? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have? Then {{suppose that}} I went on, and saw {{in my dream}} how this same {{academic}} and unbeliever, being himself also a Hebrew of the Hebrews, snatched the roll out of the rabbis' hands, {{and told them that}} they were a party of fools for trying to set forth what the book might possibly mean, before they had found out what it really did mean; and that they could only find out that by looking honestly at the plain words to see what Solomon meant by it. And then, suppose that this same apostate Jew, this member of the synagogue of Satan, in his carnal and lawless imaginations, had waxed eloquent with the eloquence of devils, and told them that the book set forth, to those who had eyes to see, how Solomon the great king, with his threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number, forgets all his seraglio and his luxury in pure and noble love for the undefiled, who is but one; and how as his eyes are opened to see that God made the one man for the one woman, and the one woman to the one man, even {{as it was in the}} garden of Eden, so all his heart and thoughts become pure, and gentle, and simple; how the song of the birds, and the scent of the grapes, and the spicy southern gales, and all the simple country pleasures of the glens of Lebanon, which <b>he</b> <b>shares</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> own vine-dressers and slaves, become more precious in his eyes than all his palaces and artificial pomp; and the man feels that he is in harmony, for the first time in his life, with the universe of God, and with the mystery of the seasons; that within him, as well as without him, the winter is past, and the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth, and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land.... And suppose I saw in my dream how the rabbis, when they heard those wicked words, stopped their ears with one accord, and ran upon that son of Belial and cast him out, because he blasphemed their sacred books by his carnal interpretations. And suppose--I only say suppose--that I saw in my dream how the poor man said in his heart, [...] "I will go to the Christians; they acknowledge the sacredness of this same book; and they say that their God taught them that 'in the beginning God made man, male and female.' Perhaps they will tell me whether this Song of Songs does not, as it seems to me to do, show the passage upwards from brutal polygamy to that monogamy which they so solemnly command, and agree with me, that it is because the song preaches this that it has a right to take its place among the holy writings? You, as a Christian bishop, should know what answer such a man would receive.... You are silent? Then I will tell you what answer he seemed to receive in my dream. [...] "O blasphemous and carnal man, who pervertest Holy Scripture into a cloak for thine own licentiousness, as if it spoke of man's base and sensual affections, know that this book is to be spiritually interpreted of the marriage between the soul and its Creator, and that it is from this very book that the Catholic Church derives her strongest arguments in favour of holy virginity, and the glories of a celibate life."' ...|$|E
