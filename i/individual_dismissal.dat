30|$|This {{index is}} {{calculated}} by scoring different basic items concerning employment protection of regular workers against <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal</b> and, then, converting these scores into a cardinal index from 0 to 6, {{with a higher}} index representing a stricter regulation (see OECD, Employment Outlook 1999, Chap.  2, Appendix  2.B). Therefore, a higher index implies more protection for regular workers against <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{procedure}} {{to compute the}} index for temporary workers is fairly the same described in footnote  1. However, the EPL index for TE does not measure the degree of protection of temporary workers against <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal,</b> rather it measures the restrictions {{on the use of}} temporary forms of employment (see OECD 2004). Therefore, a higher index does not imply more protection against <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal,</b> rather it implies stricter conditions for using temporary employment.|$|E

30|$|In the end, all {{partners}} and parties seemed very dissatisfied. Employers were unhappy {{with what they}} considered excessive regulation of temporary jobs, insufficient freedom to proceed with <b>individual</b> <b>dismissals</b> and inappropriate changes in social protection schemes 17. Precisely the opposite criticism came from the trade union side, which branded the reform as too timid in fighting precarious job conditions, too harsh in reducing guarantees against firing and untimely in modifying social protection schemes during a recession. A sense of responsibility, however, prevailed and despite resentful and rhetorical opposition (with declarations of a “never ending battle”), CGIL refrained from calling massive general strikes against the change.|$|R

30|$|While {{high levels}} of {{employment}} protection decrease labour demand, employment protection cushions {{the negative effects of}} an economic slump on the labour market. On the other hand, low levels of employment protection lead to generally higher labour demand yet relatively high unemployment rates during an economic downturn. Young people are predominantly hired under low protection contracts (Boeri 2011). Nevertheless, the Spanish example shows that high employment losses can occur despite high employment protection (Balakrishnan and Berger 2009). The Spanish reform of the labour market carried out in 2010 and 2011 contained changes regarding <b>individual</b> <b>dismissals.</b> Today dismissals for economic reasons, triggered by current and expected losses or reductions in revenues, are considered a cause of fair dismissal. In this context, the advance notice was shortened from 30 to 15 days. Moreover, the Spanish government decided to create a new permanent contract including an express dismissal procedure with a maximum severance pay of 33 days’ wages and no advance notice. For employees and workers with temporary contracts, severance pay was increased from 8 to 12 days’ wages (Bentolila et al. 2012).|$|R

3000|$|... 13 Our {{results are}} not qualitatively {{affected}} by the exclusion of Switzerland from the sample. The OECD indicator of employment protection refers {{to the protection of}} regular employment and the regulation of temporary work and is intended to measure the strictness of EPL. More precisely, since most of the literature on employment protection emphasises the analogy of EPL to an employer-borne tax on employment adjustment, the overall intent is to reflect the cost implications of various regulatory provisions for employers (i.e. stricter is interpreted as more costly). The overall summary measure of EPL strictness relies on three main components related to protection of regular workers against (<b>individual)</b> <b>dismissal,</b> specific requirements for collective dismissals and regulation of temporary forms of employment. See OECD, 2004.|$|E
30|$|A second option {{could have}} been {{represented}} by a sweeping deregulation of the labor market, through additional deregulation of both temporary and independent work and a more drastic cutback of restrictions on <b>individual</b> <b>dismissals</b> (De Nicola 2012). However sensible this could appear from an economic point of view (and I have doubts that a labor market freed from binding norms would be a rational choice, {{not to mention the}} social costs), {{it would not have been}} viable politically, given the opposition by at least one of the trade unions (CGIL, the most representative one) and by the party closest to it (the Democratic Party). In any case, it would not have been the choice of this Minister, convinced as I am that encouraging a reduction of labor costs through a progressive impoverishment of labor relationships would have resulted mainly, if not solely, in an increase in casual and precarious jobs. It could have saved some jobs in the short run, but it would have resulted in further productivity decline. Indeed, it is exactly by improving the quality of labor and by investing in human (as well as in physical capital) that productivity and competitiveness can be increased.|$|R

30|$|The {{counterpart}} {{of the effort}} to make the entry into the labor market less haphazard is provided by the endeavor to reduce exit rigidities. The reform reaffirmed the open-ended contract as the “dominant one” and made it less rigid. By modifying long standing and highly symbolic aspects of <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal</b> rules and procedures, established in the “Statute of Workers’ Rights”, the reform aligned Italy to European legal standards. More specifically, the provisions of article 18 of the Statute–which applies to firms with more than 15 employees or more than 60 in case the firm has more than one plant–are relevant for those judicial cases in which a court has declared the dismissal illegitimate, consequently deciding upon the worker’s reinstatement even after various years since dismissal, with uncertain but possibly very high costs for the firm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Employers cannot always {{displace}} {{workers at}} their own discretion. In many countries, Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) includes restrictions on laying off workers. This paper studies whether employers use downsizing events, where the rules for dismissal differ from the rules that apply for <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal,</b> to displace workers selectively. We investigate empirically whether workers with low expected productivity relative to co-workers face particularly high exit risks when establishments downsize. Our evidence is consistent with establishments using downsizings as a sorting device to terminate the employment of the least profitable workers who are protected against dismissal under normal times of operation. However, only a minor share of the displacements in downsizings {{may be attributed to}} opportunistic sorting by employers, suggesting that EPL may not be an important obstacle to firms’ firing of individual workers.

Data are drawn from 4 waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) covering the period from 2004 to 2013. The sample is restricted {{to those who were}} aged between 50 and 80 and exited from paid work during the study period (N = 3, 446). EPL was measured using the OECD indicators of employment protection concerning regulations for <b>individual</b> <b>dismissals.</b> Exits from work were defined as forced or unforced based on the respondent’s description of the reason for leaving work. Our cross-national study shows considerable variety in the prevalence of forced career exit across 13 European countries. Furthermore, the results show that career exit through retirement is less likely to have been forced as compared to career exit through non-retirement routes. However, the results also show that with every unit increase in the EPL index, the probability of forced career exit through retirement becomes more likely. Apparently in countries with high levels of employment protection, retirement is a more attractive route to lay off older workers than in countries with low EPL. By forcing older adults to leave their jobs through retirement, these employers are shedding workers who would have preferred to continue their working lives...|$|R

A Decree of February 1989 laid down the safety and health requirements in relation to powered Industrial trucks and their equipment. The Arrete of April 1989 stipulated that occupational physicians should produce each year a schedule of activities based on employees' health and health requirements. The Arrete covered health risks, workplaces and working conditions and specified the studies to be undertaken and the minimum number and frequency of inspection visits to workplaces. In the same field, the Arrete of May 1989 stipulated that occupational physicians In enterprises and establishments with more than 10 employees must compile and keep up-to-date a register listing the occupational hazards in the enterprise and the numbers of employees exposed to such hazards. The register was to be transmitted to the employer, kept {{at the disposal of}} the administration, and presented to the works committee for safety, health and working conditions {{at the same time as}} the annual report.

There was also a [...] "procedure" [...] element providing for the works council to be kept informed and to be consulted, while the obligation to implement redeployment and retraining agreements was made generally applicable to all cases of redundancy for economic reasons. Regarding <b>Individual</b> <b>dismissals,</b> the legislation aimed to put an end to certain fraudulent practices detrimental to workers (e.g. reducing working time before dismissing a worker so as to circumvent the need to give notice). The law also set out methods of calculating the special award payable to workers who lost their jobs as a result of an accident or an occupational illness. Facilities for assistance for workers called to an interview prior to dismissal were also included.|$|R

On the other hand, despite the adoption of amendments to the Labour Act (LA), Croatian labour legislation governing employment protection for regular employment contracts remains relatively inflexible compared to that in other countries...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a model of {{individual}} dismissals based on the workers' right to file a suit against their employer arguing that the dismissal is unjustified or unfair. The model is a standard pre-trial bargaining game between a firm and a worker. We study two cases: when the law states the severance pay for unfair dismissal (the European case), and when judges can decide freely on the compensation {{to be paid to}} the worker (the American case). The model provides some guidelines for Labour Law reforms. In the European case, a decrease in the severance pay for unfair dismissals fixed by law will decrease the severance pay offered by the firm, and only under some assumptions will decrease the expected firing cost and will increase the settlement probability. In addition, the transition from the European to the American case is likely to increase the probability of settlement (and to decrease it in the opposite case) with ambiguous effects on agreed severance pay and expected firing costs. dismissal, <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal,</b> severance pay, firing costs, Labour Law...|$|E

30|$|In Italy, {{uncertainty}} and {{costs related to}} dismissals were previously responsible for employers relying on temporary contracts (IMF 2012 : 15 – 16). Therefore, the labour market reforms, approved by the Italian Parliament in June 2012, included <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal</b> rules and procedures. In order to reduce time and uncertainty related to individual dismissals, the discretionary area for judges in this respect was restricted. The “fast judicial track” intends to reduce indirect costs with regard to time and uncertainty owing to dismissal disputes (Fornero 2012). The previous legislation included the possibility of every employee working in a business unit with more than 15 employees, or for an employer with more than 60 employees to claim their job back. In addition, the employee was entitled to receive all lost salary since their dismissal and the employer {{could be forced to}} rehire the employees through the labour court’s decision. Since the reform came into force in July 2012, the employee can no longer claim their job back in case of a lay-off due to an economic reason.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} government policy to secure jobs in times of recession. In the Netherlands firms can choose to dissolve permanent worker contracts either through court or by requesting special permission from a public employment service. When permission is granted the firm is relieved from the obligation of severance pay. Severance pay lenience for firms in distress is a unique feature of the Dutch labor market. A simple theoretical equilibrium model is presented to study the policy’s effects. The model predicts {{that as long as}} the wage elasticity of labor demand does not exceed the inverse of the replacement ratio a system of severance payment exemption is less costly than the alternative of additional unemployment benefits. The likelihood that this condition holds increases when a firm is hit by a negative shock. A novel data set on <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal</b> cases for the period 2006 - 2009 identifies key differences in procedural durations and firing costs distributions between the two firing options. These differences result from the severance pay exemption policy and form the main reasons to explain the outstanding performance compared to EU countries of the Dutch labor market during the past decade...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} literature {{ignores the fact}} that in most European countries the strictness of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) varies across the firm size distribution. In Italy firms are obliged to rehire an unfairly dismissed worker only if they employ more than 15 employees. Theoretically, the paper solves a baseline model of EPL with threshold effects, and shows that firms close to the threshold are characterized by an increase in inaction and by a reluctance to grow. Empirically, the paper estimates transition probability matrices of firm level employment using a longitudinal data set based on Italian Social Security (INPS) records, and finds two results. First, firms close to the 15 employees threshold experience an increase in persistence of 1. 5 percent with respect to a baseline statistical model. Second, firms with 15 employees are more likely to move backward than upward. Finally, the paper tests the effect of a 1990 reform which tightened the regulation on <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal</b> only for small firms. It finds that the persistence of small firms relative to large firms increased significantly. Overall, these threshold effects are significant and robust, but quantitatively small. employment protection legislation, firm size...|$|E

30|$|Since The Charter of Workers Rights (Law 300 / 1970), {{individual}} dismissals {{are allowed}} in large firms {{only if there}} exists a “just cause” (for productive reasons or for severe misconduct of the employee). More precisely, a worker can be fired for “justified objective motive” that is, “for justified reasons concerning the production activity or the organization of labor in the firm”; or for “justified subjective motive” that is, “in case of a significantly inadequate fulfillment of the employee’s tasks specified by the contract”. Moreover, large firms are required {{to give to the}} employee a term of notice in order to proceed with an <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal,</b> whose length depends on the tenure of the worker, with detailed indications {{of the reasons for the}} dismissal. The worker can easily appeal to a Court against the dismissal. If the judge rules that the dismissal is “unfair”, the employee in a large firm has the right to receive as severance payments: 1) all the foregone earnings after the dismissal until the sentence (and the corresponding social security contributions); 2) either an extra financial compensation of 15 months earnings or the reinstatement in the firm (the choice is up to the worker). In addition, the firm has to pay the legal costs and a penalty for the delayed payment of social security contributions of up to 200 % of the original sum due.|$|E
30|$|The EPL Index takes {{a higher}} value if {{employment}} protection legislation is more stringent. This index is essentially based on Blanchard and Wolfers (2000), {{which in turn}} is based on Lazear (1990) and OECD (1994). Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) extend an EPL measure of OECD (1994) by connecting with Lazear (1990). In particular, Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) use a measure named version 1, which is the longest series of the three measures published by the OECD. Here we only briefly explain the method for constructing the OECD (1994) version 1 measure (See Nickell 2006 and OECD 1994 for more about the construction of version 1 of the EPL Index). The OECD indicators of employment protection measure the procedures and costs involved in dismissing individuals or groups of workers and the procedures involved in hiring workers on fixed-term or temporary-work agency contracts. The indicators are compiled from several items covering three different aspects of employment protection: <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal</b> of workers with regular contracts, additional costs for collective dismissals, and regulation of temporary contracts. The measure is an unweighted average of the sub-indicators of regular and temporary contracts. These sub-indicators are aggregates of basis measures, which take a value of 0 to 6.4 Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) construct their EPL index for every five years, and then Nickell (2006) interpolates them. In 2005, the US marked 0.07, France marked 1.00, and Japan marked 0.60.|$|E
40|$|The Romanian Labour Code – Act no 53 / 2003 – {{has been}} {{modified}} {{several times during}} its application. The most important modifications were aiming at the following aspects: the termination of the labour contract (especially the individual and collective dismissal and the rightful termination of the contract), the individual labour contract for a limited duration, the work time and the rest time. These modifications were punctual and determined by the necessity of assuring {{a balance between the}} position of the employees and the one of the employers. A lot of critics have been formulated by the representatives of the employers after the Labour Code got in force. They consider that the actual regulation is too restrictive for them. It is still extremely favourable for the employees, who are protected by the Code even in situations which are not necessary to assure this protection (professional evaluation, <b>individual</b> <b>dismissal,</b> disciplinary procedure and liability). These were the reasons which determined a constant pressure from the employer’s trade unions in relation with the Government in order to modify those parts of the Code which are too favourable to the employees. The draft of the modification act includes the following major aspects: the written form of the individual labour contract; the non-competition clause; the unilateral modification of the individual labour contract by the employer; the individual dismissal; the work time; the collective bargaining and the collective contracts; the material liability of the employee; the labour jurisdiction...|$|E
