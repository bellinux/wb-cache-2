Greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was acclaimed as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] "the Regulator" [...] Hitchen expresses his grievance for [...] "such abominable practices" [...] carried out by [...] "such as have assumed the title of thief-takers" [...] that [...] "if these should hold their peace, the stones in the city would cry out" [...] and thereupon adds that he hopes [...] "effectual care will be taken {{to have the same}} strictly examined into." [...] Hitchen gives one example out of many similar cases, where Wild saves his accomplices and prosecutes an innocent one, at least in that particular crime. Three [...] "notorious rogues", William Mathews, Christopher Matthews and Obadiah Lemmon robbed a lady in a coach near St. Paul's Churchyard. Wild for fear of losing these profitable criminals, met the three and arranged <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to be an evidence in the court, which meant him giving the names of [...] "a numerous train of offenders" [...] and convicting them. {{but at the same time}} he should not have mentioned the stealing of a dozen of handkerchiefs and other robberies involving Wild directly as a receiver, otherwise they would lose their [...] "factor" [...] by [...] "bringing his own neck into the noose and put it into power of every little prig". As a result, the three offenders escaped the justice and the thief-taker received a reward of £40 for arresting and hanging [...] "shim-sham thieves", Hugh Oakley and Henry Chickley.|$|E
2500|$|The GADA {{lost four}} men to a Shrike missile strike on June 3. While {{at least two}} Skyguard units were {{fighting}} off an air attack – believed {{at that time to}} be conducted by Harriers - two missiles were fired by one Vulcan bomber involved in the operation Black Buck six. The long range radars switched off their emissions as usual, but the two Skyguard systems waited {{until it was too late}} <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Second Lt. [...] Fernando Ignacio Huergo's section claims that they locked on to a [...] "bomb" [...] and destroyed it in mid-air – it may be they hit one of the missiles - but at the same time of this explosion, another blast was heard. The other missile, mounted on the radar wave of the 1st section of battery A's Skyguard had hit its target. First Lt. Alejandro Dachary, and three of his men were killed. Another soldier survived the attack. Apparently the operator, warned by the alarm, turned off the radar, but the missile was already in terminal phase and struck home anyway. [...] The bomber, Vulcan nº XM597, was forced to divert to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil during the returning trip, after its in-flight refuelling probe broke. One of the missiles it was carrying was ditched into the ocean to reduce drag, but the other remained stuck on the pylon and could not be released. Sensitive documents containing classified information were jettisoned into the sea via the crew hatch, and a [...] "Mayday" [...] signal was sent. The aircraft was eventually cleared to land by Brazilian authorities. The Vulcan remained interned for nine days, and returned along with its crew on 11 June. [...] However, the remaining Shrike missile was confiscated.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} give a better insight in [...] "the humours and actions in a case" [...] marshal draws {{the image of the}} [...] "Goat" [...] in Long Lane as a windmill, saying that its {{functioning}} depends on gaming houses, bawdy-houses, receivers and thief-takers the same way as windmill's on four sails. All four of them are regulated by the thief-taker of course. Besides denouncing him as a protector of coiners, prostitutes, etc. Hitchen coins the name of the thief-maker for Wild, used to refer to him by others later. Through a fictional character's eyes, that is some countryman, Hitchen tries to give a panoramic view of the [...] "Goat" [...] with old thieves, spies, suspicious women, Lemon himself sitting in the corner filling remorse for betrayal. This portrayal is considered somewhat clumsy alongside the insertion of [...] "proclamation", a parody of Wild's advertisements, {{in the middle of the}} pamphlet. Here, Wild proclaimed as [...] "His Skittish and Baboonish Majesty", assures the thieves of himself to be better equipped for subverting the course of justice and offers his legal protection and higher financial terms compared to those of their older [...] "locks, fences and flash pawnbrokers". Hitchen finishes his treatise with the list of [...] "flash cases" [...] and Wild's [...] "weekly pensioners". The list of convicts awaiting transportation under the [...] "Transportation Act"(introduced as an alternative punishment to hanging) enables dating of the pamphlet between June to August. As for the publishers, they were Warner and B. Boreham, publishing Wild's responding pamphlet in May.(p.102-104, Howson)Wild's [...] "Answer" [...] was written anonymously and polished most likely by a hack for two guineas. He refers mostly to the years 1713-1714 for he had personal experience of marshals adventures and could not resist the temptation to describe them, including the scene [...] "in a Sodomitish Academy". As other dealings are mentioned while reviewing their partnership, it is more interesting to describe the event when the under-marshal took his assistant, a buckle-maker as Wild refers to himself in his pamphlet, to a house near Old Bailey one night. The buckle-maker, having never met the types marshal was too willing to see, followed him and to his great surprise discovered men talking and behaving in effeminate way. No less surprising appeared marshal's reaction on being referred to as [...] "your Ladyship" [...] or [...] "Madam", even more, he [...] "dallied with the young sparks with a great deal of pleasure". However, no sooner had he seen those who might have exposed his [...] "power of securing the lads to himself", he flew into a rage and threatened to [...] "spoil their diversion". Later that night, marshal lurked with several constables near Mother Clap's House in Fleet street, Holborn, knowing that a masquerade would be held as usual and he would be able to catch several sodomites dressed in woman's apparel, which he did. Next morning detainees stood before the Lord Mayor and were committed to workhouse, but before were ordered to walk through the streets on the way in their bizarre look:"Some were completely rigg'd in gowns, petticoats, head cloths, fine lac'd shoes, furbelow scarves, and masks. Some had riding hoods; some were dressed like shepherdesses, others like milkmaids with fine green hats..." [...] etc. Some time later they were released after Hitchen's application to the Lord Mayor having been threatened by one of them for his previous adventures with them. The experience appeared too humiliating <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and in few days he died after the release. Wild completes the narrating with recommending the under-marshal and his expertise to anyone interested in [...] "Sodomitish Academy".|$|E
