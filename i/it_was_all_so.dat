500|$|Contemporary William Joseph Snelling, in his 1831 {{biography}} of Jackson, strongly criticizes Eaton. Of Eaton's Jackson biography, he wrote, [...] "it {{is hard to}} say which is more disgraced, the hero [...] or the historian. The book contains scarcely a period of good English, but makes amends by abundance of fulsome adulation, by the admission of many disgraceful acts and the palliation of others." [...] By 1831, Snelling says, he had become [...] "the laughing-stock of the nation." [...] Remini says that [...] "the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>so</b> needless." ...|$|E
500|$|The 20th Party Congress {{opened on}} 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates {{to rise in}} honor of the {{communist}} leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda. In {{the early morning hours of}} 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the [...] "Secret Speech" [...] to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the [...] "congress listened to me in silence.

500|$|The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's {{first ever}} {{win in a}} medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women, and it still remains {{the only time that}} the United States did not win the men's event. After the race, the team made a celebratory dive into the water and {{performed}} a poolside interview. Tonelli remarked that [...] "I was totally stunned. After all the hassle, and my being the athletes' mouthpiece, we'd come through and done it". Australia's women's captain Lisa Forrest hailed the win as [...] "a gold medal that should never have been". Evans said of the relay, [...] "It was unbelievable, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>so</b> logical.

500|$|IGN {{columnist}} Brian Zoromski rated [...] "Grief Counseling" [...] 9.5/10, {{an indication}} of an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. Writing that the opening sequence [...] "excellently set" [...] {{the tone of the}} episode, he found a [...] "ton of great moments", such as Michael's [...] "totally awkward speeches on Ed Truck's death" [...] and his conversation with Dwight over a robot statue. Zoromski saved the most praise for Pam and her pranks, particularly her [...] "completely ridiculous bird funeral... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>so</b> brilliantly over-the-top it becomes clear that the Scranton office will continue to be enjoyable to watch, as Pam takes over the mocking of the office all on her own, to a hilarious extreme." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea also lauded Pam and her pranks, especially highlighting her actions during the opening sequence and her song during the bird funeral. Sciannamea assumed that [...] "she feels liberated from Roy (and Jim, to some extent) [...] is allowing her personality and sense of humor to come out even more." [...] He concluded that it was [...] "another solid episode with Steve Carell at his best." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerry led off in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s to put Australia in second place, almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Evans had out-split Goodhew by 0.8s and Miskarov by 0.5s. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had ever done before. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then performed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first-ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed at the poolside.

His supreme chutzpah, a quality he shares with Streisand, allows him to feel secure within pop's traditions while taking them wherever he pleases. He made Davis' musical program, which at times got lost amid the chatter of the A-list crowd, come alive. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>so</b> simple then: an instant when one of pop's key traditional elements, that determination to wow, took on new dimension {{in the hands of}} an expert." ...|$|E
2500|$|For many Europeans {{this new}} way of {{conducting}} warfare seemed ridiculous, {{so that in the}} beginning they were openly mocked. But the Dutch army continued to drill the volley under both Louis and his cousin Maurice, Prince of Orange, so that it became second nature. [...] One Dutch historian recounts the exercises in which regiments marched [...] "man by man bringing the rearmost to the front and the frontmost to the rear.… The beginnings were very difficult, and many people felt, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>so</b> unusual, that it was odd and ridiculous [...] They were mocked by the enemy, but with time the great advantages of the practices became clear … and eventually they were copied by other nations." [...] Soon the reorganized Dutch army displayed the virtues of the countermarch volley and the practice spread across Europe. An important component to the successful deployment of volley fire was the drill, which according to Geoffrey Parker, [...] "only two civilisation have invented drill for their infantry: China and Europe. Moreover, both of them did so twice: in the fifth century BC in North China and in Greece, and again in the late sixteenth century. Exponents of the second phase— Qi Jiguang in Imperial China and Maurice of Nassau in the Dutch Republic—explicitly sought to revive classical precedents, and in the West, marching in step and standing on parade became a permanent part of military life." [...] Drill was difficult {{and the manner in which}} the volley fire should be executed had not been perfected in Louis' time. It is clear from Holland's historical sources that it took many trials and experiments for the process to be refined.|$|E
