5|$|Japan has close {{economic}} and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as {{the cornerstone of the}} nation's foreign policy. A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 20 years, most recently for 2009 and 2010. It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E
5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E

In times of crisis, <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> still meets primarily in consultations, {{but it also}} holds more public meetings. After the outbreak of <b>the</b> Ukraine crisis <b>in</b> 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> returned to <b>the</b> patterns of the Cold War, as Russia and the Western countries engaged in verbal duels <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> television cameras. <b>In</b> 2016, <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> held 150 consultations, 19 private meetings, and 68 public meetings.|$|R

25|$|The move also follows an {{aggressive}} {{and at least}} partially successful campaign by the Palestinians to court recognition in the build-up to the vote, including numerous Latin American countries.

25|$|On November 3, 1967 Ambassador Goldberg, {{accompanied}} by Mr. Sisco and Mr. Pedersen, called on King Hussein of Jordan. Goldberg said the US {{was committed to}} the principle of political independence and territorial integrity and was ready to reaffirm it bilaterally and publicly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> resolution. Goldberg said the US believes in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles: there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, the Communist Party of China won the Chinese Civil War in {{mainland}} China and established the People's Republic of China (PRC), {{claiming to be}} the sole legitimate government of China. The ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan (which it gained control of in 1945 {{at the end of}} hostilities in WWII), Quemoy Island, and the Matsu Islands. Until 1991, the ROC also actively claimed to be the sole legitimate government of China, and during the 1950s and 1960s this claim was accepted by the United States and most of its allies. While the PRC was an ally of the Soviet Union, the U.S. sought to prevent the Communist bloc from gaining another permanent seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> To protest the exclusion of the PRC, Soviet representatives boycotted the UN from January to August 1950, so they didn't veto the intervention of UN military forces in Korea.|$|E

25|$|In the 2004 {{election}}, Bagapsh had {{run with}} Stanislav Lakoba as Vice Presidential candidate. The power-sharing deal between Bagapsh and Khajimba {{to end the}} post-election crisis meant that Lakoba could no longer become Vice President. Instead, after the new election on 12 January 2005, Lakoba was appointed Secretary of the Security Council on 17 February. When Khajimba resigned as Vice President on 28 May 2009 he declared that within the government he had received most support by Lakoba. On 18 August Lakoba himself handed his resignation over the Abkhazian citizenship crisis. In an interview with Caucasian Knot on 3 September Lakoba stated {{that he would not}} participate in the December 2009 presidential election and he called absurd the notion that he would join the opposition. Nevertheless, {{in an interview with the}} newspaper Nuzhnaya on 17 November, Lakoba stated that as a private citizen he supported Khajimba's candidacy and he praised his work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> On 4 December Lakoba had a statement read out on Abkhazian television in which he stressed that this was only his private opinion and that it should not be used by any of the election campaigns.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{government}} has repeatedly made compromise offers to place strict limits on {{its nuclear program}} beyond what the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Additional Protocol legally require of Iran, {{in order to ensure}} that the program cannot be secretly diverted to the manufacture of weapons. These offers include operating Iran's nuclear program as an international consortium, with the full participation of foreign governments. This offer by the Iranians matched a proposed solution put forth by an IAEA expert committee that was investigating the risk that civilian nuclear technologies could be used to make bombs. Iran has also offered to renounce plutonium extraction technology, thus ensuring that its heavy water reactor at Arak cannot be used to make bombs either. More recently, the Iranians have reportedly also offered to operate uranium centrifuges that automatically self-destruct if they are used to enrich uranium beyond what is required for civilian purposes. However, despite offers of nuclear cooperation by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany, Iran has refused to suspend its enrichment program as the Council has demanded. Iran's representative asserted that dealing with the issue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> was unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility because its peaceful nuclear program posed no threat to international peace and security, and, that it ran counter to the views of the majority of United Nations Member States, which the Council was obliged to represent.|$|E

500|$|Though the UN Charter {{had been}} written {{primarily}} to prevent aggression by one nation against another, in the early 1990s the UN faced a number of simultaneous, serious crises within nations such as Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia. The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu, and the UN mission to Bosnia faced [...] "worldwide ridicule" [...] for its indecisive and confused mission {{in the face of}} ethnic cleansing. In 1994, the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan genocide amid indecision <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E
500|$|With the {{enlargement}} of the United Nations membership and increasing self-confidence among the new members, going {{hand in hand with}} processes of decolonization, old structures and procedures were increasingly challenged. The imbalance between the number of seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> and the total number of member States became evident, and the only significant reform of the Security Council occurred in 1965: this included an increase in the non-permanent membership from six to 10 members. With Boutros Boutros-Ghali elected as Secretary-General in 1992, the reform discussions of the UN Security Council were launched again as he started his new term with the first-ever summit of the Security Council and then published [...] "An Agenda for Peace". His motivation was to restructure the composition and arguably anachronistic procedures of the UN organ to recognize the changed world.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 May, European {{members of}} the UN Security Council, Germany and the United States {{circulated}} a draft UN Security Council resolution that would replace UN Security Council Resolution 1244, endorse Ahtisaari's Settlement and end the UN administration after a transition period of 120 days.
