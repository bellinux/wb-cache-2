5|$|Like {{most other}} regular {{planetary}} moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be synchronous with <b>its</b> <b>orbit.</b> The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. <b>Its</b> <b>orbit</b> is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.00720.0076 and 0.200.60°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.|$|E
5|$|Over time {{intervals}} of around 30 trillion years, the Sun will undergo a close encounter with another star. As a consequence, {{the orbits of}} their planets can become disrupted, potentially ejecting them from the system entirely. If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years and not ejected from <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> by a stellar encounter, its ultimate fate will be that it collides with the black dwarf Sun due to the decay of <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> via gravitational radiation, in 1020 (100 quintillion) years.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Adrastea lies inside Jupiter's {{synchronous}} orbit radius (as does Metis's), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces are slowly causing <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> to decay {{so that it will}} one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amalthea's then <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> would actually lie within the fluid Roche limit. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit.|$|E

50|$|If a {{unipotent}} group acts on an affine variety, all <b>its</b> <b>orbits</b> are closed, {{and if it}} acts linearly on a finite-dimensional {{vector space}} then it has a non-zero fixed vector. In fact, the latter property characterizes unipotent groups.|$|R

5|$|Although <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> {{is rather}} {{different}} from those of the main two groups, it is possible that the comet of 1680 is also related to the Kreutz sungrazers via a fragmentation many orbits ago.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} classification, {{introduced by}} B. J. Gladman, B. G. Marsden and C. Van Laerhoven in 2007, uses 10-million-year orbit integration {{instead of the}} Tisserand parameter. An object qualifies as an SDO if <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> is not resonant, has a semi-major axis no greater than 2000 AU, and, during the integration, its semi-major axis shows an excursion of 1.5 AU or more. Gladman et al. suggest the term scattering disk object to emphasize this present mobility. If the object is not an SDO as per the above definition, but the eccentricity of <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> is greater than 0.240, it is classified as a detached TNO. (Objects with smaller eccentricity are considered classical.) In this scheme, the disc extends from the orbit of Neptune to 2000 AU, the region {{referred to as the}} inner Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Phobos is below {{synchronous}} altitude, the tidal forces from the planet Mars are gradually lowering <b>its</b> <b>orbit.</b> In about 50 million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.|$|E
50|$|Proof: Write ΩG as a {{disjoint}} sum of <b>its</b> <b>orbits</b> under G. Any element x ∈ ΩG not {{fixed by}} G will lie in an orbit of order |G|/|Gx| (where Gx denotes the stabilizer), {{which is a}} multiple of p by assumption. The result follows immediately.|$|R

(a bounded, closed, and convex {{subset of}} a Banach space) such {{that all of}} <b>its</b> <b>orbits</b> {{converge}} to <b>its</b> unique fixed point, and for any nonsummable sequence of errors and any initial point, there exists an inexact orbit which does not converge to any compact set (cf. [6, Theorem 4.1]).|$|R
5000|$|Given [...] in , the set : [...] ∈ ℝ {{is called}} the orbit of [...] under [...] Informally, it may be {{regarded}} as the trajectory of a particle that was initially positioned at [...] If the flow is generated by a vector field, then <b>its</b> <b>orbits</b> are the images of its integral curves.|$|R
5|$|Finally, the Moon's perigee {{is moving}} {{forwards}} or precessing in <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> {{and makes a}} complete circuit in 8.85 years. The time between one perigee and the next is slightly longer than the sidereal month and known as the anomalistic month.|$|E
5|$|For most of <b>its</b> <b>orbit,</b> it is {{even farther}} from the Sun than at present, with its {{aphelion}} estimated at 937AU (31 times Neptune's distance), {{making it one of}} the most distant-known objects in the Solar System other than long-period comets.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 210 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Ara, orbiting the metal-rich and aged star HD 154672. This planet has a minimum mass five times that of Jupiter and orbits at about 60% {{the distance between the}} Earth to the Sun. <b>Its</b> <b>orbit</b> is very elliptical, which causes temperatures on the planet to vary significantly as it proceeds along <b>its</b> <b>orbit.</b> This planet was discovered in Las Campanas Observatory on September 5, 2008 using the radial velocity method (Doppler spectroscopy). Along with HD 205739 b, the planets were the first to be discovered by the N2K Consortium using the Magellan Telescopes.|$|E

500|$|It {{had been}} {{previously}} hypothesized that hot Jupiters particularly close to their parent star should exhibit this kind [...] of inflation due to intense heating of their outer atmosphere.

5|$|Hale–Bopp {{may have}} had a near {{collision}} with Jupiter in early June 2215BC, which probably caused a dramatic change in <b>its</b> <b>orbit,</b> and 2215BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System. The comet's current orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, so further close approaches to planets will be rare. However, in April 1996 the comet passed within 0.77AU of Jupiter, close enough for <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> to be measurably affected by the planet's gravity. The comet's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2,533years, and it will next return to the inner Solar System around the year 4385. Its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) will be about 370AU, reduced from about 525AU.|$|E
5|$|However, as the Earth {{gravity assist}} approached, astronomers {{were unable to}} locate Comet Boethin, which may have broken up into pieces too faint to be observed. Consequently, <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> could not be {{calculated}} with sufficient precision to permit a flyby.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> will increase. The lengths of <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E

5|$|Metis lies inside Jupiter's {{synchronous}} orbit radius (as does Adrastea), {{and as a}} result, tidal forces slowly cause <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> to decay.

5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in <b>its</b> <b>orbit)</b> cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence the celestial equator, known as nutation.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data {{suggests that the}} observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth's geysers,. The mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions {{is thought to be}} tidal heating. The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly {{as a function of the}} position of Enceladus in <b>its</b> <b>orbit.</b> The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis (the point in <b>its</b> <b>orbit</b> most distant from Saturn) than when it is at periapsis. This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis, pushing them shut, and under tension near apoapsis, pulling them open.|$|E
50|$|Dollosuchus is an extinct tomistomine. It is a basal form {{possibly}} {{related to}} Kentisuchus, {{according to several}} phylogenetic analyses that have been conducted in recent years, and is the oldest known tomistomine to date. Fossils have been found from Belgium and the United Kingdom. It had large supratemporal fenestrae in relation to <b>its</b> <b>orbits,</b> similar to Kentisuchus and Thecachampsa.|$|R
