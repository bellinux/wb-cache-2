40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-attendance {{at health}} {{appointments}} reduces health service efficiency, is costly to services, and can risk patient health. Reminder systems {{are widely used}} to overcome forgetfulness, the most common reason for non-attendance; however, other factors, such as patient demographics and service accessibility, may also affect attendance rates. AIMS: There is limited primary research on the reasons for patient non-attendance in the Australian healthcare setting, although the success of preventative health initiatives requires ongoing monitoring of patients. This study aims to improve {{our understanding of the}} Australian experience by <b>examining</b> <b>staff</b> perspectives. METHOD: This qualitative study explored staff perspectives of the reasons for non-attendance in a large, regional general practice super clinic, which has a low socioeconomic catchment, and serves a large Aboriginal population. RESULTS: The practical barriers to attendance of travel, cost, and waiting times had largely been overcome with transport provision, free medical care and responsive appointment times, but paradoxically, these were seen to devalue allocated appointments and reinforce the expectations of 2 ̆ 2 on-demand 2 ̆ 2 health care. For Aboriginal patients specifically, a distrust of authority, combined with poor health literacy was perceived to impact negatively on the uptake of diagnostic tests, filling of prescriptions, health monitoring, and adherence to medication. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a complex interplay between poor health literacy and low patient self-worth; a funding system that encourages 2 ̆ 2 five-minute medicine and prevents doctors getting to the root cause of patient problems or having the ability to provide health education...|$|E
40|$|Background. Previous {{research}} <b>examining</b> <b>staff</b> {{responses to}} clients with {{a learning disability}} and challenging behaviour have focused on behavioural models, and Weiner's (1980) helping behaviour model. More recently, Willems et al. (2010) considered the interactional nature of the staff-client interaction using Benjamin's Structural Analysis of Social Behaviour (1974). This was considered novel to this study. They developed the Staff Client Interactive Behaviour Inventory (SCIBI) {{on the basis of}} this model. Aims. The aim of the current study was thus twofold: to pilot the SCIBI in a British population, investigating possible relationships between staff responses ('helping behaviour') and the SCIBI factors, and to assess the psychometric properties of the SCIBI. Method. The SCIBI was originally piloted in a Dutch sample, and thus the language composition was adjusted initially. This study recruited frontline support staff in community settings for adults with a learning disability and challenging behaviour (N = 67). All participants completed the SCIBI, Intrex questionnaire (Benjamin, 1983, 2000) and measure of helping behaviour in response to an identified target client. The factors of the SCIBI were correlated with staff helping behaviour to explore possible relationships. The psychometric properties of the SCIBI were also assessed (internal consistency, test-retest reliability & concurrent validity). Results. A significant positive relationship was found between helping behaviour and assertive control on the SCIBI. The results of this study found poor reliability for the SCIBI in a British sample. The concurrent validity of the SCIBI was only found to be good enough for the hostility factor of the SCIBI. Conclusions. To conclude the results of this study found little support for a relationship between the SCIBI factors and helping behaviour. Further, the pilot data investigating its psychometric properties in a British population demonstrated poor reliability and validity. The SCIBI in this study had several limitations.

40|$|Angiography as an X - ray {{examination}} {{of blood vessels}} showed an expressive development since its creation. From translumbal puncture of the abdominal aorta up to more tender Seldinger technique it led to considerable decrease of occurrence of peripro-cedural complications. Angiographic interventions and involved materials, instrumenta-tion devices and image processing possibilities are expressively improving. Invasive an-giopraphic examinations are substituted by non-invasive interventions like ultrasonogra-phy, magnetic resonance or computer tomography. After all they remain integral part of examination algorithms, especially by vessels interventions. A common note of invasive procedures in Cath-lab - in addition to diagnostics also by an intravascular ultrasonography or by therapeutical procedures like percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, stent implantation, vessels embolisation, trombolysis and trombectomy and other [...] is using of fluoroscopy with ionizing radiation and intravascular application of a contrast medium. Radiologic assistant has its more and more unsubstitutable role by diagnostic im-aging of vessels. Radiologic assistant has {{to be familiar with}} course of single intervention and with sequence of doctors operations, {{in order to be able}} to fulfill his requirements in time and at the same time he has to understand possible risk of complication's and he has to know how to respond to them properly and in time. Further he must well manage an-giography device and all its parts and know postprocessing picture adjustment. Quality work of radiologic assistant should have fundamental influence on dose of ionizing radiation for patient and for <b>examining</b> <b>staff</b> and on consumption and risks of application of contrast medium.

40|$|Homelessness {{has become}} {{widespread}} in the United States over the past 20 years. Despite vast amounts of money and resources focused on resolving this problem, homelessness continues to grow. Based on three years of ethnographic research on the sheltering industry, I argue that a hypothesis of deviancy provides a hegemonic conceptual framework within which responses to homelessness operate. As a result, routine practices treat disorders within homeless people while marginalizing strategies of collective resistance against systemic inequities as unreasonable. ^ Chapter 2 examines the political-economic context within which homelessness prospers. I explore responses to homelessness {{on the level of}} social policy and concrete actions undertaken locally by homeless people and advocates. Despite data suggesting a correlation between systemic inequality and homelessness, responses focus on developing more services to treat disorders within homeless people. ^ Chapter 3 analyzes 2 ̆ 2 helping 2 ̆ 2 practices within the homeless shelter. Discourses of self-help and the medicalization of social problems guide efforts to detect and treat disorders. I argue that an effect of these actions is the production of self-blaming and self-governing homeless subjects unlikely to engage in collective resistance. The subject effects of statistical record-keeping practices re-producing 2 ̆ 2 the homeless 2 ̆ 2 as a category of subjects to be governed are also analyzed. Chapter 4, focusing on the experiences of one homeless woman, further analyzes how homeless people, even those who are non-compliant, remain enmeshed in a discourse of deviancy. ^ Through <b>examining</b> <b>staff</b> hiring, training, and responses to increasing homelessness, Chapters 5 and 6 demonstrate how the proper role for shelter staff is defined as a helping professional managing and governing homeless people within a therapeutic relationship. Finally, in Chapter 7, I discuss the potential of an explicitly oppositional ethnographic engagement. Through an activist ethnographic intervention which explicitly takes sides against 2 ̆ 2 common sense 2 ̆ 2 conceptions, I explore how dominant discursive practices may lose their dominance as 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 through engaging with social actors in problematizing routine practices and perceptions. New understandings become conceptually possible, creating space for new resistance practices to emerge within the shelter and in the local community. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Black, Asian and {{minority}} ethnic (BAME) groups {{have a high}} need for organ transplantation but deceased donation is low. This restricts the availability of well-matched organs and results in relatively long waiting times for transplantation, with increased mortality risks. Objective: To identify barriers to organ donor registration and family consent among the BAME population, and to develop and evaluate a training intervention to enhance communication with ethnic minority families and identify impacts on family consent. Methods: Three-phase programme comprising (1) community-based research involving two systematic reviews examining attitudes and barriers to organ donation and effective interventions followed by 22 focus groups with minority ethnic groups; (2) hospital-based research <b>examining</b> <b>staff</b> practices and influences on family consent through ethics discussion groups (EDGs) with staff, a study on intensive care units (ICUs) and interviews with bereaved ethnic minority families; and (3) development and evaluation of a training package to enhance cultural competence among ICU staff. Setting: Community focus group study in eight London boroughs with high prevalence of ethnic minority populations. Hospital studies at five NHS hospital trusts (three in London and two in Midlands). Participants: (1) Community studies: 228 focus group participants; (2) hospital studies: 35 nurses, 28 clinicians, 19 hospital chaplains, 25 members of local Organ Donation Committees, 17 bereaved family members; and (3) evaluation: 66 health professionals. Data sources: Focus groups with community residents, systematic reviews, qualitative interviews and observation in ICUs, EDGs with ICU staff, bereaved family interviews and questionnaires for trial evaluation. Review methods: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. Results: (1) Community studies: Organ Donor Register – different ethnic/faith and age groups were at varying points on the ‘pathway’ to organ donor registration, with large numbers lacking knowledge and remaining at a pre-contemplation stage. Key attitudinal barriers were uncertainties regarding religious permissibility, bodily concerns, lack of trust in health professionals and little priority given to registration, with the varying significance of these factors varying by ethnicity/faith and age. National campaigns focusing on ethnic minorities have had limited impact, whereas characteristics of effective educational interventions are being conducted in a familiar environment; addressing the groups’ particular concerns; delivery by trained members of the lay community; and providing immediate access to registration. Interventions are also required to target those at specific stages of the donation pathway. (2) Hospital studies: family consent to donation – many ICU staff, especially junior nurses, described a {{lack of confidence in}} communication and supporting ethnic minority families, often reflecting differences in emotional expression, faith and cultural beliefs, and language difficulties. The continuing high proportion of family donation discussions that take place without the collaboration of a specialist nurse for organ donation (SNOD) reflected consultants’ views of their own role in family consent to donation, a lack of trust in SNODs and uncertainties surrounding controlled donations after circulatory (or cardiac) death. Hospital chaplains differed in their involvement in ICUs, reflecting their availability/employment status, personal interests and the practices of ICU staff. (3) Evaluation: professional development package – a digital versatile disk-based training package was developed to promote confidence and skills in cross-cultural communication (available at: www. youtube. com/watch?v=ueaR 6 XYkeVM&feature=youtu. be). Initial evaluation produced positive feedback and significant affirmative attitudinal change but no significant difference in consent rate over the short follow-up period with requirements for longer-term evaluation. Limitations: Participants in the focus group study were mainly first-generation migrants of manual socioeconomic groups. It was not permitted to identify non-consenting families for interview with data regarding the consent process were therefore limited to consenting families. Conclusions: The research presents guidance for the effective targeting of donation campaigns focusing on minority ethnic groups and provides the first training package in cultural competence in the NHS. Future work: Greater evaluation is required of community interventions in the UK to enhance knowledge of effective practice and analysis of the experiences of non-consenting ethnic minority families.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{codes of ethics}} in the top 500 {{companies}} operating {{in the private sector}} in Australia. We seek to answer two questions. First, can businesses adopt codes of ethics in a meaningful way, or are business ethics a contradiction in terms for profit seeking organisations in competitive markets? Second, to what extent do Australia’s top 500 private sector firms show commitment to codes of ethics? A number of ancillary questions are explored to form a picture of the current Australian situation and to compare it {{to the rest of the}} world, especially the US and Canada. Chapter 1 discusses these questions and the origins of the author’s interest in business ethics. This chapter develops a focus upon codes of ethics and their role in assisting to establish and maintain an ethical culture. The chapter looks at previous research on codes of ethics and demonstrates a lack of understanding in Australia on the subject and the need for research into it. Also included in Chapter 1 is the plan for the thesis. Chapters 2 to 4 review the literature upon which the thesis is based. In Chapter 2, the meaning of the terms ethics and business ethics are considered. Deontological and teleological approaches are distinguished and a (largely) teleological model of business ethics is developed. This chapter also asks whether business ethics are possible. The contention that ethics may be good for a business’s profit is explored in-depth and the conclusion is reached that ethics should be pursued for its inherent worth regardless of the economic benefit that can be attributed to it. A number of models of ethical decision making are discussed in Chapter 3 starting with Kohlberg and Kramer (1969). This discussion leads to the conclusion that organisations must create an ethical culture for staff if they require them to embrace ethical practices. If this is a correct conclusion, then the role of senior managers becomes critical in the process. Chapter 4 looks further at the role of senior managers, organisational culture and ethical/unethical behaviour in organisations. The conclusion is that senior managers do play an integral part in shaping the culture of an organisation. Their actions, either overtly or covertly, impact upon their staff and highlight behaviour that the organisation is or is not willing to tolerate. Sims (1991) proposed ten ways to foster an ethical culture and these ideas are set out and further explored through the work of other writers on management ethics. Finally, the link between ethics and strategic planning is examined. In Chapter 5 the methods used for empirical data gathering are described and justified. A number of factors that can lead us to consider a company’s ‘commitment’ to ethics are outlined. A survey of Australian companies was the primary means of data collection. Each question in the survey instrument is listed and explained. Also the survey response rate is reported, as are major demographic characteristics of respondents. Chapter 6 provides the research findings from the survey of the top 500 companies operating in the private sector in Australia. The research examines: i) the current Australian usage and implementation of codes of ethics; ii) the measures put in place in organisations in order to support a code; From this analysis conclusions are drawn about the ‘commitment’ of companies operating in Australia to codes of ethics. Australian companies are becoming aware of the potential of code usage. Companies operating in Australia that have codes appear to be good at implementing codes and <b>examining</b> <b>staff</b> performance in relation to codes. However, they lack the procedures that incorporate education and training and the implementation of the support mechanisms necessary to enhance employee understanding of the code. In Chapter 7, Australian codes are compared to American and Canadian codes for similarity and disparity. The assessment found that in all three countries codes are primarily concerned with company continuance. Australian codes do tend to be more socially oriented than in the other two countries and also less legalistic. Chapter 8 looks at 4 companies from the first survey that were asked for more in-depth information in a quest to determine current best practice in Australia. These organisations were chosen because they appeared, from the first survey instrument, to have put in place mechanisms to assist employees to better understand the code. The implication is that companies must make a conscious, positive effort to ensure that employees are considered in the process of ethical development. They should have input into the process, rather than just being directed to follow another management initiative. The final chapter summarises the research findings and looks at answers to the two major questions and the seven subordinate empirical questions posed at the start of the thesis. The conclusion reached is that companies operating in Australia appear to be moving towards establishing codes of ethics. Those who already have codes display a real commitment to them. The movement appears to be gathering momentum as more organisations see the value of incorporating ethical business practices into the every day workings of their individual companies. Generally, most Australian companies lag behind the rest of the world, but the pace-setting companies are defining their own best practice and achieving positive outcomes for themselves, their employees and other stakeholders...|$|E

Footwear and falls is under {{researched}} and not documented, even though it has a big impact on falls risks. Objectives - To observe, document and describe the types, characteristics and source of footwear worn by inpatients on three health care of the elderly wards. Interviews will <b>examine</b> <b>staff</b> knowledge and perception of footwear and its links to falls, and comment on how to assess patient footwear to help promote patient comfort and safety. Methods - Observations were carried out to document and describe the types and characteristics of footwear of the patients. Photographs provided evidence of the footwear. Semi-structured interviews of the staff on the wards were carried out to <b>examine</b> <b>staff</b> knowledge and their perceptions of footwear on the wards, the hospital provided footwear and how footwear can impact falls risks. Results – 90 % of patients wore slippers or hospital gripper socks during the observations. Most footwear had no fixation, and the majority was supplied by the hospital. Staff had good perceptions and knowledge of footwear. They noticed what footwear was being worn by patients on their shift. They recognised the need for some form of documentation to be developed to aid the assessment and recording of footwear on the wards in order to aid falls risk reduction. Staff commented that although the hospital supplied footwear is good, improvements could be made. Conclusions - The majority of patients wore slippers or hospital supplied footwear. Therefore this has to be to the highest standard possible. A footwear assessment is recommended to be developed in order for staff to be able to assess footwear more competently, and be able to document footwear on the wards...|$|R

The ability to maintain boundaries between one's personal and professional self were explored and found {{to be a source of}} conflict for many workers.

40|$|A {{common theme}} from the National Student Survey is that {{students}} want more feedback, but {{increasing the amount of}} teacher-student feedback is not practicable. Peer assessment, if carefully supported, can be a cost-effective solution. In addition, peer assessment can help to reinforce transferable skills such as collaboration and communication.

This paper gives a brief analysis of some of the major online tools available and assesses them {{from the point of view}} of a large, traditional university. The paper concludes that there is scope for supporting a suite of complementary tools for peer assessment. It uses case studies to <b>examine</b> <b>staff</b> and student perceptions of peer assessment and concludes that having staff dedicated to supporting the technique and the technology has been a major reason for the moderately successful uptake of peer assessment at this institution...|$|R
