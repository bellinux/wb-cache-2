50|$|A common {{criticism}} of retrieval research {{has argued that}} many of the tests involved have simply measured retention on a short term scale. A study conducted by Karpicke and Bauernschmidt used this principle to determine the major differences between the different types of retrieval. The two focused on studying long term retention by testing participants over the course of one week. The participants were either assigned to a uniform schedule or an expanding schedule. No matter what type of spacing was assigned to the ninety-six participants, each completed three repeated tests {{at the end of their}} rehearsal intervals. Once those tests were completed, participants came back one week later to complete a <b>final</b> <b>retention</b> test. The researchers concluded that it did not matter what kind of retrieval schedule was used. The biggest contribution to effective long term learning was the spacing between the repeated tests (relative spacing).|$|E
50|$|In {{the pure}} study trial (pure ST condition) method, both items {{of a pair}} were {{presented}} simultaneously for study. In the test trial/study trial (TTST condition) method, subjects attempted to retrieve the response term during {{a period in which}} only the stimulus term was present (and the response term of the pair was presented after a 5-sec delay). <b>Final</b> <b>retention</b> of target items was tested with cued-recall tests. In Experiment 1, there was a reliable advantage in final testing for nonsense-syllable/number pairs in the TTST condition over pairs in the pure ST condition. In Experiment 2, the same result was obtained with Eskimo/English word pairs. This benefit of the TTST condition was not apparently different for final retrieval after 5 min or after 24 h. Experiments 3 and 4 ruled out two artifactual explanations of the TTST advantage observed in the first two experiments. Because performing a memory retrieval (TTST condition) led to better performance than pure study (pure ST condition), the results reject the hypothesis that a successful retrieval is beneficial {{only to the extent that}} it provides another study experience.|$|E
40|$|Food thermal {{processing}} {{conditions can}} be optimized {{in terms of}} <b>final</b> product quality <b>retention.</b> This optimization is possible due {{to the difference between}} the temperature dependence of quality factors and microorganisms or enzymes kinetics of thermal degradation or inactivation, respectively. All the available research in this field assume first order degradation kinetics for the quality parameters. In this work the effect of reaction type kinetics on optimal thermal processing conditions and <b>final</b> quality <b>retention</b> is analyzed. Zero, second and reversible first order kinetics are taken into consideration. Assuming that the Arrhenius model is applicable, the main conclusion is that the reaction type kinetics does not have influence on constant optimal thermal processing temperatures for maximizing the final surface product quality retention. Optimal conditions for maximizing volume average quality retention are affected by the reaction quality thermal degradation kinetics and the differences between optimal constant temperatures depend on the kinetic parameters values and processing conditions and requirements. For reversible first order degradation kinetics, <b>final</b> quality <b>retentions</b> are analyzed as a function of processing conditions and kinetic parameters and the calculation of optimal processing conditions is discussed.

40|$|The testing effect {{describes}} {{a method of}} retrieval practice that benefits long term retention of learned material, over restudying and re-exposure (Roediger 2 ̆ 6 Karpicke, 2006 a). The benefits of testing have been implemented outside of psychology laboratories into classrooms around the US, but are still not being taken advantage of by students outside of lecture (Karpicke, Butler 2 ̆ 6 Roediger, 2009). The current experiment seeks to acknowledge the testing effect as present in a widely used self-study website and further define the most effective retrieval practice students can implement within it. Fifty-eight introductory Psychology students at the University of Colorado, Boulder studied 30 Anthropology terms and their definitions in a paired associate learning format on Quizlet. com. The paired associates were split into different self-study modes on Quizlet. com: one restudy block, and two cued recall with feedback blocks that applied either a consistent direction of study to initial presentation, or inconsistent direction. Two days after the self-study session, participants took a <b>final</b> <b>retention</b> test to measure the retention of the learned paired associates. The test analyzed the bidirectional retention of the 30 -paired associates with recognition questions and cued-recall questions that manipulated direction; majority of questions included the paired associates verbatim to the study session, {{some of the questions}} were not verbatim to initial study but rather applied the paired associate relationships to an example to measure for comprehensive, conceptual understanding. The results of this study were inconclusive due to a confound in study block and question items, but paved way for future implications for studies on real self-study methods of students today, and the importance of retrieval practice direction on the direction of <b>final</b> <b>retention...</b>|$|E
40|$|A single {{field study}} was {{conducted}} in 1995 at the Marana Agricultural Center (2000 f elevation) to evaluate the effects of three planting dates on yield and crop development for one Pima and two Upland varieties.

General trends showed decreasing lint yield with the later (18 May) plantings for all varieties. Early plantings (6 April) however, for both Pima S- 7 and DPL 20 resulted in slightly lower yields than the later two planting dates.

40|$|The removal {{mechanisms}} of four natural steroid hormonesestradiol, estrone, testosterone, and progesteroneby nanofiltration (NF) membranes were investigated. Two nanofiltration membranes with quite different permeabilities and salt retention characteristics were utilized. To better understand hormone removal mechanisms, the membrane {{average pore size}} was determined from retention data of inert organic solutes of various molecular weights and a pore transport model that incorporates steric (size) exclusion and hindered convection and diffusion. Results indicate that, at {{the early stages of}} filtration, adsorption (or partitioning) of hormones to the membrane polymer is the dominant removal mechanism. Because the adsorptive capacity of the membrane is limited, the <b>final</b> <b>retention</b> stabilizes when the adsorption of hormones into the membrane polymer has reached equilibrium. At this later filtration stage, the overall hormone retention is lower than that expected based solely on the size exclusion mechanism. This behavior is attributed to partitioning and subsequent diffusion of hormone molecules in the membrane polymeric phase, which ultimately results in a lower retention. Hormone diffusion in the membrane polymeric matrix most likely depends {{on the size of the}} hormone molecule, hydrogen bonding of hormones to membrane functional groups, and hydrophobic interactions of the hormone with the membrane polymeric matrix...|$|E

Three experiments examined extinction of fear conditioning (using the conditioned emotional response method), and two experiments examined extinction of appetitive conditioning (using the food-cup entry method). In all experiments, conditioning and extinction were accomplished in single sessions, and retention testing took place 24 h after extinction. In both fear and appetitive conditioning, immediate extinction (beginning 10 min after conditioning) caused a faster loss of responding than delayed extinction (beginning 24 h after conditioning). However, immediate extinction was less durable than delayed extinction: There was stronger spontaneous recovery during the <b>final</b> <b>retention</b> test. There was also substantial renewal of responding when the physical context was changed between immediate extinction and testing (Experiment 1). The results suggest that, in these two widely used conditioning preparations, immediate extinction does not erase or depotentiate the original learning, and instead creates a less permanent reduction in conditioned responding. Results {{did not support the}} possibility that the strong recovery after immediate extinction was due to a mismatch in the recent “context” provided by {{the presence or absence of}} a recent conditioning experience.

Depending on the denitrification technology used, the water could contain a fair amount of sulfite and nitrite that need to be removed for water reuse or discharge. An integrated pressure-driven membrane and ion exchange (IX) process is therefore designed and tested for this purpose in this work. The process contains a combination of nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO), and a mixed bed IX.

However, the action of stomach fluid and short residence time of LLEP at the site of absorption become the "neck" for the oral administration of LLEP. To solve these problems, pH-sensitive Ca-alginate microparticles designed as an oral administration carrier were prepared by a spray-solidification method in this study. The spray conditions influenced the size of the Ca-alginate micropartides; thus, conditions were optimized to obtain microparticles with smaller particle size for oral administration to mice. Subsequently, LLEP was encapsulated into Ca-alginate microparticles and the activity retention of LLEP released from the micropartides was examined after the microparticles passed through simulated gastric fluid. The results showed that LLEP could be well protected against simulated gastric fluid and that the <b>final</b> activity <b>retention</b> was up to 92. 9 %. The effects of alginate concentration on the release profile in vitro and the encapsulation efficiency (EE) were studied, and the results revealed that the microparticles possessed the highest EE and a reasonable release rate when the alginate concentration was 1. 0 wt %. This alginate concentration, combined with optimized spray conditions, was used to prepare LLEP-encapsulated microparticles, and they were administered orally to mice with phenylketonuria (PKU). Compared with the groups given blank microparticles and non-encapsulated LLEP, the increase of the blood phenylalanine (Phe) level was significantly slowed after a 7 day treatment with LLEP-encapsulated microparticles.

Of the 102 people in the intervention group, 92 completed the final 6 -month assessment, 68 attended all on-site sessions, but only 1 reported exercising at home all 12 weeks. Those who lived alone were more likely (p =. 03) and those with symptoms of depression were less likely (p =. 05) to attend all on-site exercise classes. The final recruitment rate was estimated as 31. 8 %. The <b>final</b> <b>retention</b> rates were 90. 2 % and 87. 3 % for the intervention and control groups, respectively. Implications: Recruitment of frail elderly African American patients is resource inten-sive. Adherence to the on-site exercise classes was better than to the home-based component of the pro-gram. These findings have implications for the design of future community-based exercise programs and trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to analyze available research data on views on retention ofhigh school band students. As a veteran music educator, I see the importance ofkeeping students involved in instrumental music throughout graduation. There {{is a great deal of}} literature available about recruitment and retention ofelementary and middle school students, but very little concerning keeping high school students involved in band. After relevant literature was reviewed, factors influencing students staying involved in band was assembled into a handful ofcategories. Strategies, tips, and techniques in each of these categories were collected via personal interviews with band directors in Western Wisconsin. Data was compiled into a resource guide for use by high school band directors. Such a resource guide is not intended to be the <b>final</b> word on <b>retention,</b> merely a starting point for a discussion on keeping more students involved in instrumental music. 11 Interviews on a national scale would surely develop a much larger picture of suggestions for improvement of retention. This study was to discover what strategies are working for veteran instrumental music educators in Western Wisconsin...|$|R

Centro de Ciencias Medicas, Universidade Federal Fluminense. Rua Marques do Parana, 303, Niteroi, RJ 24030 - 210, Brasil. E-mail: sergian@ufnj. br Sixty four Wistar rats, male of two consecutive generations determined as F(0) and F(1) were used to study the cumulative effect of two variety soy beans, cultivated with organic seasoning and genetically modified, The animals of each generation were divided into three groups of eight rats each fed on diets consisted of organic soy, soy genetically modified and casein respectively. All the animals received water and the diet ad libitum for period of 28 days. Where the diet consumption and the animals weight were evaluated. After statistic analysis of the results no expressive differences were observed on diet consumption, weight variation, protein efficient ratio and food efficiency ratio on same group of animals in the different generations. On the other hand, significant difference was found on <b>final</b> proteinic <b>retention</b> on animal descendants of the same groups; however of different generations. With this, the supplementation of organic soy with L-cistin provided better avail of this protein in relation to the protein of the soy genetically modified. However, this supplementation did not reveal efficiency in keeping the proteinic employment from one generation to another one, since soy varieties presented better performance on F(0) generation when compared with F(1) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{looked at}} whether {{students}} retain information {{better if they}} are tested {{on a weekly basis}} or on a bi-weekly basis. The study used four groups of students in Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 classes. The study was conducted over the course of one term; tests were administered weekly to the experimental group and bi-weekly to the control group. All groups of students were given an announced final exam {{at the end of the}} term and an unannounced retention test administered one month after the end of the term. Dot and box plots for the weekly and bi-weekly testing groups were used to compare the medians and range of the data. Weekly versus bi-weekly testing for the Algebra 1 classes showed that the students who were tested on a bi-weekly basis scored better on both the <b>final</b> exam and <b>retention</b> test than the weekly tested group. When considering the Algebra 2 students, the weekly tested group had scores that were closer together; however they were lower than the bi-weekly tested group, which is consistent with the findings of the Algebra 1 classes. ii...|$|R
