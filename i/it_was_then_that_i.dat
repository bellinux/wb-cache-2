5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Smile" [...] is a bubbly, mid-tempo {{tune with}} [...] "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, {{singing in a}} light falsetto, while the organ riff {{contains}} a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song [...] "Free Soul" [...] by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I do say gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} television, radio, and {{newspaper}} reports listed Ladany {{as one of}} those killed. One headline stated: [...] "Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time". Ladany recalled later:The impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends {{came up to me and}} tried to kiss me and hug me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.|$|E
2500|$|She is {{comes from}} Salthill, a seaside resort in Galway, Ireland. Her {{grandparents}} owned a pub and her grandfather {{was often the}} main entertainer; Mulholland has said, [...] "When her family get together there's always a sing-song. I come from a very musical family - every year we would meet on Christmas night and all the kids were encouraged {{to get up and}} perform. I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> realised I loved singing." [...] The first musical Mulholland appeared in was an amateur production of The Sound of Music, where she played Brigitta. Shortly before starting her course at the Central School of Speech and Drama, she moved to London and successfully auditioned for a part as a traditional Irish dancer, in the professional dance show, Dance of Desire, in which she spent four months. In 2003, she became the 30th annual 'Galway Rose', and represented Galway at The Rose of Tralee contest.|$|E
2500|$|Spofforth truly {{announced}} {{himself to}} the cricketing world on 27 May 1878, when the touring Australians met the MCC at Lord's. In this, the second match of the tour, the might of the MCC was dismissed twice in one day at the fortress of English cricket for paltry scores of just 33 and nineteen. The colonists won by nine wickets, with Spofforth picking up ten for twenty after first clean-bowling Grace for a duck. Tom [...] "Felix" [...] Horan records that, when he did so, [...] "he jumped about two feet in the air, and sang out: 'Bowled! Bowled! Bowled!' And at the finish in the dressing-room, he said: 'Ain't I a demon? Ain't I a demon?' gesticulating the while in his well-known demonaic style. Whether or not he christened himself the demon, he certainly was a demon bowler." [...] Spofforth confirms this: [...] "To myself, {{it will always be}} a noteworthy occasion, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> first earned my popular sobriquet – 'the Demon'." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> spoke. “Yes,” I said, “it’s me {{that you}} see,” and made a step forward.

60|$|Presently an officer, {{in a blue}} uniform {{not unlike}} that of our flying artillery, came cantering down the road--an elderly, stout man he was, with grey side-whiskers.

The pendent sleeves adding much to the effect, the doctor called me the Bashaw with Two Tails.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{became aware}} of the {{presence}} of Nas ta Bega.

Nonnezoshe needed life, wild life, life of its millions of years--and here stood the dark and silent Indian.|$|E
