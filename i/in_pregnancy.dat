5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{alteration}} in the second-trimester maternal serum levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> conceived after assisted reproduction. Methods: We compared the amniotic fluid hCG and AFP concentrations of 45 pregnancies with fresh embryo transfer and 25 pregnancies with frozen-thawed embryo transfer with 269 spontaneous pregnancies. Wilcoxon rank-sum {{test was used}} for analysis. Results: The median amniotic fluid hCG MoM <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> conceived after frozen-thawed embryo transfer was significantly increased to 1. 41 compared to 1. 00 (p = 0. 01) <b>in</b> naturally occurring <b>pregnancies</b> and 0. 96 (p = 0. 049) <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> after fresh embryo transfer. Further analysis showed that this was only observed in frozen embryos fertilized by conventional insemination with MoM of 1. 59. The AFP MoMs were similar among the groups. Conclusions: The observed raised amniotic fluid hCG level <b>in</b> IVF-FET <b>pregnancies</b> may reflect the elevated maternal serum level <b>in</b> these <b>pregnancies.</b> Further studies should be directed towards exploring the underlying pathophysiology.

5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy</b> results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the levels of some of the cytokines which may be involved in the mechanisms leading to the impairment of placental perfusion and to the onset of uterine contractions <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with fetal genetic abnormalities compared with controls. METHODS: The amniotic fluid and maternal plasma levels of interleukin- 6, interleukin- 8 and tumour necrosis factor-beta in patients with fetal chromosomal abnormalities were measured, as well as <b>in</b> euploid <b>pregnancies</b> <b>in</b> the seventh week of gestation. RESULTS: An increase of interleukin- 6 (P = 0. 034) and a decrease of interleukin- 8 (P < or = 0. 0001) in amniotic fluid, and a decrease of interleukin- 6 in the maternal plasma (P = 0. 026) was shown <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with fetal chromosomal abnormalities. A positive correlation was observed between amniotic interleukin- 8 and serum interleukin- 6 in the presence of fetal aneuploidy (P < 0. 006). CONCLUSION: Further investigations of cytokine imbalance <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with poor outcome as a consequence of genetic disorders rather than infection is warranted...|$|R

5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} is a butterfly-shaped organ that {{sits at the}} front of the neck. It is {{composed}} of two lobes, left and right, connected by a narrow isthmus. The thyroid weighs 25 grams in adults, with each lobe being about 5cm long, 3cm wide and 2cm thick, and the isthmus about 1.25cm in height and width. The gland is usually larger in women, and increases in size <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{contraindicated}} <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.|$|E
40|$|Assisted {{reproduction}} technology is increasingly used {{for treatment of}} couples with subfertility. These women are usually of more advanced maternal age and carry {{a higher risk of}} fetal Down syndrome. Results from early publications showed that biochemical markers for screening of fetal Down syndrome in the second trimester were different between <b>pregnancies</b> from <b>in</b> vitro fertilization (IVF) and natural conception. This could potentially increase the false positive rate and result in unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. Questions were raised as to whether the alterations were related to ovarian stimulation. This laid the fundamentals of a series of studies presented in this thesis with an aim to address the variations in the concentrations of markers of fetal Down syndrome and the fetal growth profile of pregnancies conceived following different assisted reproduction treatments. Studies were conducted on maternal serum and amniotic fluid alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in the second trimester <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> conceived by assisted reproduction. A reduced level of AFP in maternal serum <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with fresh embryos together with an elevated level of hCG in both maternal serum and amniotic fluid <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with frozen thawed embryos were found. This pioneer piece of data showing the raised hCG in frozen thawed embryo pregnancies with unstimulated treatment cycles spoke against the ovarian driven hypothesis, but suggested placental dysfunction be a possible underlying pathophysiology. For markers adopted in the first trimester, the level of pregnancy associated protein A (PAPP-A) was significantly reduced <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> from assisted reproduction. The data on free βhCG was heterogeneous. Apart from biochemical markers, the nuchal translucency was also increased <b>in</b> these singleton <b>pregnancies</b> but not <b>in</b> dichorionic twins. As the direction of deviations of these markers <b>in</b> unaffected <b>pregnancies</b> from assisted reproduction resembled those observed <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> affected by Down syndrome, appropriate adjustment was necessary to reduce the false positive rate for these women. Altered biochemical markers, notably a low PAPP-A level, were also associated with adverse obstetric outcomes. The changes observed <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> from assisted reproduction might be a manifestation of an intrinsic placental insufficiency or fetal developmental delay. A longitudinal study was performed to examine the intrauterine fetal growth profile <b>in</b> these <b>pregnancies.</b> The rate of increment in the mean sac size, which could represent an adaptive compensatory mechanism, was significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>pregnancies</b> from assisted reproduction compared to natural conception. We concluded that pregnancies conceived after assisted {{reproduction technology}} were different from pregnancies from natural conception in terms of the concentrations of biochemical and ultrasound markers of Down syndrome. Due to the wide variation in treatment protocols and patients’ background demographics, the exact underlying pathophysiology might be difficult to be explored. Couples undergoing assisted reproduction treatment should be counseled on the increased risk of adverse pregnancy course and perinatal outcome. published_or_final_versionMedicineMasterDoctor of Medicin...|$|R

5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F.

The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories <b>in</b> <b>pregnancy</b> tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E
