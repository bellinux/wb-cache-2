(2008), the coal was {{pulverized}} into a particle size less than 0.3  mm, mixed with additives (caustic solution or hydrogen peroxide-acetic acid mixed solution), {{put into the}} water and stirred well. After exposed to microwave radiation for 2 – 10  min, the desulfurized coal is obtained through separation. By using this method, the desulfurization rate of Shandong Guohong coal can reach 62.5  %, the desulfurization rate of Xuecheng Shanjiazhong <b>fat</b> <b>coal</b> can reach 50.9  %; the XPS photoelectron spectroscopy shows that this method can effectively remove the pyrite in sulphur coal and can also remove the organic sulphur to some extent.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studied the}} deep-seat coal seam in Wangfenggang mine Huainan area, and {{analyzed}} {{the characteristics of}} coal petrology and coal type distribution, then discussed the influences of regional geothermal history and tectonic subsidence history on regional coal metamorphism process. The results show that a series of bituminous coal band including gas coal, 1 / 3 coking coal, <b>fat</b> <b>coal</b> and lean coal vertically distributing in the deep seated seam (- 600 m ∼- 1200 m). The metamorphism developing tend is same with coal seam structural shape. It presents that the tectonic stress on hydrostatic pressure state can affect coal metamorphism process. It was predicted that the metamorphic type of Wangfenggang minefield is superposition from the effect of energy transformation from tectonic stress on hydrostatic pressure state and katogenic metamorphism, which is long term regional extrusion has promoted and controlled coal metamorphism. The study on coal metamorphism on deep seated seam can be very important on coking coal's development in China and also contribute to present metamorphism theory...|$|E

The structures of raw coal and super pure coal {{were characterized by}} thermogravimetry and Fu Liye infrared spectrum. The {{results showed that the}} heat extraction rate of super pure coal was decreased with the increasing of coalification degree. The ash of raw coal which were silicate and alumina can be concentrated by heat extraction technology into coal residue and the mixtures of various structure were mainly composed of aromatic hydrocarbons also can be extracted effectively. With the production capacity of China's iron and steel industry continues to expand, the amount of coke continued to rise. Coking process is current still in coking coal (coking coal, <b>fat</b> <b>coal,</b> fat gas coal, gas coal, 1 / 3 coking coal, lean coal, etc.). Although coking coal is the full range in our country, it is a relatively small species, especially the quality of coking coal is scarce varieties. It is mainly distributed in the Permian and Carboniferous, Permian coal-bearing strata in Southern China. In the international market coking coal supply is tight, and the foreign monopoly on coking coal trend is clearly. Experiment 1. 1 Coal samples In the experiments Coal samples were used of the Hebei Xingtai well-off village 1 / 3 coking coal (XKZ), Ningxia state water bridge (YSQ) and Inner Mongolia Wuhai coal (WH), Shanxi Liulin coal (LL) and Sima of Shanxi coal (SM). According to the national standard GB 474 - 1996 for sample preparation, the coal samples were crushed and divided less than 100 µm in 150 min at 100 ℃ in drying and vacuum conditions. The coal samples were stored in a dryer, low temperature and avoiding light. Industrial analysis and elemental analysis data of coal is shown in table 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{moving bed}} {{was used as}} the reactor in {{experiments}} to produce synthesis gas by coal and natural gas co-conversion process. The effects of coal types on the temperature in the flame zone, the ingredients and the H- 2 /CO ratio of synthesis gas, together with the methane and steam conversions were investigated by using coke, anthracite, lean and <b>fat</b> <b>coals</b> as the raw materials. By comparing the results between coals and coke, {{it can be seen that}} the temperatures in the flame zone and the content of the active compounds (H- 2, CO) of coals are higher than those of coke. In addition, the H- 2 /CO ratio of synthesis gas closes to the calculated value by thermodynamic equilibrium. For the produced crude synthesis gas with coals by coal and natural gas co-conversion process, in which the H- 2 /CO ratio varies in 1. 0 - 2. 0, the content of the active compounds (H- 2, CO) is more than 92 %, and the residual methane is less than 2 %, the methane and steam conversion rates are more than 90 % and 75 %, respectively. All these results demonstrated that the concept of coal and natural gas co-conversion process is positive and feasible. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Four Upper Carboniferous limnic coal basins in the Cantabrian {{mountains}} are described. In the coal measures, which {{are known as}} the Cea formation and unconformably overlie the Older Palaeozoic, two sedimentary cycles are recognised. Accordingly, the unconformable sequence is subdivided into two members. The lower one, the Carrión member, starts with quartzite conglomerates and becomes gradually finer grained upwards. It yields anthracitic coal and upper Westphalian D floras. Its maximum thickness is 1200 m. The upper one, the Prado member, begins with limestone conglomerates and also grades to finer sediments upwards. It contains dry to <b>fat</b> <b>coals</b> and Stephanian A to B floras. Its maximum compiled thickness may be approximately 2500 m but a complete section is not found anywhere. The Cea formation shows onlap onto the Older Palaeozoic towards the west. The predominant structural trend in the Cea formation in the described area is east-west. A few structures with north-south axes were recognised in the Valderrueda and Ocejo basins. They {{are thought to have}} originated from differential compaction and to be the earliest structures of the Cea formation. The east-west structures are dominated by wide, asymmetric synclines, separated by narrow zones of disturbance instead of anticlines. They have originated as a secondary effect of block faulting in the underlying Older Palaeozoic formations. In the history of the Cea formation large east-west trending fundamental faults (terminology from de Sitter, 1956), probably separating basement blocks, play a dominant role in the deposition {{as well as in the}} deformation of the Cea rocks. Activity along these large east-west faults in the Older Palaeozoic rocks is proved to have continued intermittently from the upper Westphalian (and earlier, Rupke, 1965) to the middle Tertiary. Thus the deformation of the Cea deposits, which is dependent on the movement along these faults, must have been a long-lasting process and not a short-lived event like, for instance, the Permian Saalic phase, as was formerly believed...|$|R
50|$|In {{the small}} {{territory}} {{held by the}} Counts of Leyen, the most important economic endeavour was until the early 19th century agriculture. Since the Middle Ages, though, there had been other occupations in Glan-Münchweiler {{having to do with}} administration, transport and trade. In the original 1845 cadastral survey, 36 farming businesses and 45 people who ran other kinds of businesses were listed. Improvements to economic circumstances and the building of the railway in 1868 brought along with them a measure of upward mobility among the villagers. There was a great expansion in trades, among them dealers in livestock, fruit, fertilizer, agricultural machinery, <b>fat</b> and <b>coal</b> as well as brewers and tanners. The Volksbank was founded in 1875, and the Raiffeisenbank in 1891. The only major ﬁrm in Glan-Münchweiler is Gebrüder Hanz (“Gebrüder” = “Brothers”), which is in the construction business (road and underground construction), and was founded in 1940. The most important commuting destinations are Kaiserslautern and Homburg.|$|R

Charles Darwin states that he saw, {{from the base of the}} Andes, [...] "the masts of the vessels at anchor in the bay of Valparaiso, although not less than twenty-six geographical miles distant," [...] and that Anson had been surprised at the distance at which his vessels were discovered from the coast, without knowing the reason, namely, the great height of the land and the transparency of the air. Steamers may be detected much farther than sailing vessels, for, as one says, when their hulls and masts of wood and iron are down, their smoky masts and streamers still betray them; and the same writer, speaking of the comparative advantages of bituminous and anthracite coal for war-steamers, states that, [...] "from the ascent of the columns of smoke above the horizon, the motions of the steamers in Calais Harbor [on the coast of France] are at all times observable at Ramsgate [on the English coast], from the first lighting of the fires to the putting out at sea; and that in America the steamers burning the <b>fat</b> bituminous <b>coal</b> can be tracked at sea at least seventy miles before the hulls become visible, by the dense columns of black smoke pouring out of their chimneys, and trailing along the horizon." ...|$|R
