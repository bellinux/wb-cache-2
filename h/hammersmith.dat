5|$|The C Stock trains have {{recently}} been replaced by S7 Stock; the first new train entered service on the <b>Hammersmith</b> & City line on 6 July 2012, running a shuttle service between <b>Hammersmith</b> and Moorgate before operating between <b>Hammersmith</b> and Barking on 9 December 2012. By March 2014 all services were provided by S7 Stock trains.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{instances}} where two separate stations {{share the same}} name: there is one Edgware Road station on the Circle, District and <b>Hammersmith</b> & City lines and another Edgware Road on the Bakerloo line, and there is one <b>Hammersmith</b> station on the District and Piccadilly lines and another <b>Hammersmith</b> station on the Circle and <b>Hammersmith</b> & City lines. Although the Circle and <b>Hammersmith</b> & City lines station at Paddington {{is on the other}} side of the main line station to the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines station, it is shown as a single station on the current Tube map. It has been shown as two separate stations at different times in the past.|$|E
5|$|Between Acton Town and <b>Hammersmith,</b> District line trains serve all stations, but Piccadilly line trains run {{non-stop}} to <b>Hammersmith</b> {{except for}} calling at Turnham Green {{at the start}} {{and end of the}} day. The run between Acton Town and <b>Hammersmith</b> spans nearly three miles – the longest distance between stops on the Piccadilly line. West of Acton Town, District line trains go via Ealing Common to Ealing Broadway and Piccadilly line trains run either via South Ealing to Heathrow, or via Ealing Common to Uxbridge.|$|E

5|$|Between 1 October 1877 and 31 December 1906 some {{services}} on the H were extended to Richmond over the London and South Western Railway (L) via its station at <b>Hammersmith</b> (Grove Road).|$|E
5|$|Born in <b>Hammersmith,</b> London, Westbury {{experienced}} a nomadic childhood, living in Mongolia, Sakhalin, Malaysia, Easter Island, the Antarctic and Syria {{before moving to}} the Netherlands in her early teens.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} London Underground {{operations}} {{were transferred to}} the newly created Transport for London (TfL) in 2000, the A Stock trains were already 40 years old. The C Stock trains used on the Circle line, <b>Hammersmith</b> & City line and sections of the District line and the D Stock used on {{the remainder of the}} District line were also ageing, and no plans were in place for their replacement. Following lengthy and expensive negotiations, an order was placed in 2003 with Bombardier Transportation for a fleet of new trains to take over all operations on the Metropolitan, <b>Hammersmith</b> & City and District lines.|$|E
5|$|Former Met {{tracks and}} {{stations}} {{are used by}} the London Underground's Metropolitan, Circle, District, <b>Hammersmith</b> & City, Piccadilly, and Jubilee lines, and by Chiltern Railways.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{started his}} {{education}} at Hogarth Primary School in Chiswick but {{then moved to}} St Peter's Primary School in <b>Hammersmith,</b> Grant was then educated at an independent prep school Wetherby School. From 1969 to 1978, he attended the independent Latymer Upper School in <b>Hammersmith</b> on a scholarship and played 1st XV rugby, cricket and football for the school. He also represented Latymer on the popular quiz show, Top of the Form, an academic competition between two teams of four secondary school students each.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Bush's one live show, The Tour of Life, was {{recorded}} for the BBC and for release on VHS as Kate Bush Live at <b>Hammersmith</b> Odeon.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Circle line {{services}} began serving the station. Originally operating as a loop-line using tracks {{constructed by the}} MR and the DR and serving only the station in Praed Street, the Circle line's route was altered to include the <b>Hammersmith</b> branch to increase train frequency on the branch and improve the regularity of Circle line trains. Trains run in a spiral anti-clockwise from Edgware Road around the loop, back to Edgware Road {{and then on to}} the <b>Hammersmith</b> branch.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 2017 it was {{announced}} that the stadium was given the go ahead from <b>Hammersmith</b> and Fulham council for the new 60,000 stadium to be built.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{resubmit}} its 1901 bill, the CLR {{presented a}} much more ambitious alternative for the 1902 parliamentary session. The reversing loops were dropped, and the CLR instead proposed to turn the whole railway into a single large loop by constructing a new southern route between the two existing end points, adopting the committee's recommendation for a <b>Hammersmith</b> to City route. At the western end, new tunnels were to be extended from the dead-end reversing siding west of Shepherd's Bush station and from the depot access tunnel. The route was to pass under Shepherd's Bush Green and run under Goldhawk Road as far as <b>Hammersmith</b> Grove where it was to turn south. At {{the southern end of}} <b>Hammersmith</b> Grove a station was to be provided on the corner of Brook Green Road (now Shepherd's Bush Road) to provide an interchange with the three stations already located there.|$|E
5|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{were used}} north of Rickmansworth {{until the early}} 1960s when they were replaced following the electrification to Amersham {{and the introduction of}} electric multiple units, London Transport withdrawing its service north of Amersham. In 1988, the route from <b>Hammersmith</b> to Aldgate and Barking was branded as the <b>Hammersmith</b> & City line, and the route from the New Cross stations to Shoreditch became the East London line, leaving the Metropolitan line as the route from Aldgate to Baker Street and northwards to stations via Harrow.|$|E
5|$|The line's depot is at <b>Hammersmith,</b> {{close to}} <b>Hammersmith</b> station, {{built by the}} Great Western Railway to be {{operated}} by the Metropolitan Railway when the joint railway was electrified in the early 20th century. Sidings at Barking and near High Street Kensington (Triangle Sidings) stable trains overnight. Sidings at Farringdon were used during the C stock era; due to the greater length of the new S stock trains, these {{are no longer in}} use.|$|E
5|$|The system {{comprises}} eleven lines – Bakerloo, Central, Circle, District, <b>Hammersmith</b> & City, Jubilee, Metropolitan, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria, Waterloo & City – serving 270 stations. It {{is operated}} by Transport for London (TfL).|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of S Stock trains, the track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the Circle and <b>Hammersmith</b> & City lines by 65 per cent by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface railway is to be established in <b>Hammersmith</b> and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s. The cross-London Crossrail line, planned to open in 2018, is expected to reduce crowding between Paddington and Whitechapel.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Wilson {{developed}} {{an interest in}} early English music and was instrumental in founding the London-based sextet, the English Singers, in 1920. The following year he sang the role of Satyavan in the first professional performance of Gustav Holst's Savitri, at the Lyric Theatre, <b>Hammersmith.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the League's Fourth Conference in May 1888, {{factional}} divisions {{became increasingly}} apparent between Morris' anti-parliamentary socialists, the parliamentary socialists, and the anarchists; the Bloomsbury Branch were expelled for supporting parliamentary action. Under {{the leadership of}} Charles Mowbray, the League's anarchist wing were growing and called on the League to embrace violent action in trying to overthrow the capitalist system. By autumn 1889 the anarchists {{had taken over the}} League's executive committee and Morris was stripped of the editorship of Commonweal in favour of the anarchist Frank Kitz. This alienated Morris from the League, which had also become a financial burden for him; he had been subsidising its activities with £500 a year, a very large sum of money at the time. By the autumn of 1890, Morris left the Socialist League, with his <b>Hammersmith</b> branch seceding to become the independent <b>Hammersmith</b> Socialist Society in November 1890.|$|E
5|$|Confirmation was {{revealed}} on 3 February 2015 that the concert event {{was to take}} place in the Eventim Apollo, in <b>Hammersmith,</b> London. The last time the United Kingdom capital held any Eurovision events was the Eurovision Dance Contest 2007.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of his studies, he moved to Lancashire to assist a project building the Royal Ordnance factory number 7 in Kirby, before returning to London to work in housing design for the Metropolitan Borough of <b>Hammersmith.</b> On 18 May 1941, he married Doris Isabel Parker (1920–2003), an old friend {{who worked as a}} clerk and who, like Hollamby, {{was a member of the}} Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Their wedding took place at St Michael's Church at Tokyngton, Middlesex, after which they moved to St. Peter's Square, <b>Hammersmith.</b> They went on to have two daughters and a son. In August 1941, during Britain's involvement in World War II, Hollamby was called up to serve in the British armed forces. Assigned to the Royal Marine Engineers, he served most of the conflict in Trincomalee, Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|Hollamby {{was born}} in his parental home of 6 Wellesley Avenue in <b>Hammersmith,</b> West London. He was the oldest of two sons born to Ethel May Hollamby, née Kingdom (1899/1900–1966), and Edward Thomas Hollamby (1893–1978), a police constable. His primary {{education}} took place at St. Peter's Church School, before he won a scholarship to study at a junior technical school. From there, he gained a higher education by training in architecture at the nearby <b>Hammersmith</b> School of Arts and Crafts during the 1930s. At the college, he {{was inspired by the}} Arts and Crafts aesthetic propounded by one of his lecturers, Alwyn Waters, and through him came to take an interest in William Morris, who had been a pioneer of the Arts and Crafts movement {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. At the same time, Hollamby was influenced by the modernist movement in architecture to which two of his favourite lecturers, Arthur Ling and Alex Lowe, belonged, and joined the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS).|$|E
5|$|In 1867 the {{formerly}} independent <b>Hammersmith</b> and City Railway was {{absorbed by the}} Metropolitan Railway and the Great Western Railway, and was operated from then on by Metropolitan Railway trains. The plan for a terminus in Fulham was abandoned, and the line instead turned west at <b>Hammersmith</b> to run over London and South Western Railway tracks to Richmond. Although Wandsworth Town railway station, near {{the southern end of}} the bridge, had provided direct connections to central London since 1846, the lack of rail connections opening on the north bank meant the area on the Fulham side remained undeveloped, and bridge usage was low. Tolmé's design was not sturdy enough to carry heavy vehicles, and drainage problems on the approach road to the north discouraged vehicles from using Wandsworth Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 the Whitechapel & Bow Railway was opened, {{linking the}} District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an {{above-ground}} junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley-by-Bow station, and some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham. When the line was electrified in 1906 services to Richmond were withdrawn and the western termini became <b>Hammersmith</b> and Kensington (Addison Road), and to the east services were diverted from the ELR to Whitechapel, until the ELR was electrified in 1914 and services ran from <b>Hammersmith</b> to New Cross (SER) and New Cross (LB). The 6-car electric multiple units were jointly owned by the Met and GWR until 1923 when the GWR sold theirs to the Met.|$|E
5|$|In November 1912 a {{bill was}} {{published}} {{that included a}} plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from <b>Hammersmith</b> to connect to the L's Richmond branch tracks. The bill passed as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913, although the advent of World War I prevented work on the extension.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Street Underground {{station is}} served by the Central, Circle, <b>Hammersmith</b> & City and Metropolitan lines, and is the sixth-busiest on the London Underground network. In common with other tube {{stations}} serving Central London termini, it is in fare zone 1. There is no wheelchair access to the tube lines.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Street {{was built}} as a dual-level station with {{provision}} for the Underground. A tube station opened in 1875 for the Metropolitan Railway, and the station today is served by the Central, Circle, <b>Hammersmith</b> & City and Metropolitan lines, and is in fare zone 1.|$|E
5|$|Paddington is a London Underground station {{served by}} the Circle and <b>Hammersmith</b> & City lines. It is located {{adjacent}} to {{the north side of}} Paddington mainline station and has entrances from within the mainline station and from Paddington Basin. The station is between Royal Oak and Edgware Road and is in London Fare Zone 1.|$|E
5|$|The second bill sought {{permission}} for extensions {{east and west}} from the approved route. The eastern extension was to diverge from the main route immediately west of Piccadilly Circus station, {{which was to be}} expanded to have east and westbound platforms on both lines. The extension was then to pass under Leicester Square to a station at Charing Cross. Continuing eastwards under Strand, the tunnels were to cross under the branch from Holborn, with an interchange at Strand station. The line was then to continue under Fleet Street to Ludgate Circus, where a station was to be constructed to interchange with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway's Ludgate Hill station (since demolished). It would then proceed south under New Bridge Street, and east under Queen Victoria Street, to connect to the DR's proposed deep-level line west of Mansion House station. The western extension was to diverge from the approved route at Albert Gate, east of Knightsbridge station. This station was to have additional platforms on the new branch line which would head west under Knightsbridge, Kensington Road and Kensington High Street, with stations at the Royal Albert Hall, the DR's High Street Kensington station and Addison Road. The tunnels were then to follow <b>Hammersmith</b> Road to the DR's <b>Hammersmith</b> station. There they would turn north under <b>Hammersmith</b> Grove and east under Goldhawk Road, to terminate {{on the south side of}} Shepherd's Bush Green near to the CLR's Shepherd's Bush terminus.|$|E
5|$|Wandsworth Bridge {{crosses the}} River Thames in west London. It carries the A217 road between {{the area of}} Battersea, near Wandsworth Town Station, in the London Borough of Wandsworth on {{the south of the}} river, and the areas of Sands End and Parsons Green, in the London Borough of <b>Hammersmith</b> and Fulham, on the north side.|$|E
5|$|A {{worldwide}} tour dubbed The Unholy Alliance Tour, {{was undertaken}} {{to support the}} new record. The tour was originally set to launch on June 6, but was postponed to June 10, as Araya had to undergo gall bladder surgery. In Flames, Mastodon, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, and Thine Eyes Bleed (featuring Araya's brother, Johnny) and Ted Maul (London <b>Hammersmith</b> Apollo) were supporting Slayer. The tour made its way through America and Europe and the bands who participated, apart from Thine Eyes Bleed, reunited to perform at Japan's Loudpark Festival on October 15, 2006.|$|E
