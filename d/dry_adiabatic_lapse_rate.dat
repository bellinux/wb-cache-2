Thus, climates ranging from nearly tropical in the foothills to tundra above the snow line can coexist within several hundred metres of each other.

500|$|Most {{subtropical}} cyclones {{form when}} a deep cold-core extratropical cyclone drops {{down into the}} subtropics. [...] The system becomes blocked by a high latitude ridge, and eventually sheds its frontal boundaries as its source of cool and dry air from the high latitudes diverts away from the system. [...] Temperature differences between the 500hPa pressure level, or [...] above ground level, and the sea surface temperatures initially exceed the <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> which causes an initial round of thunderstorms to form at a distance east of the center.

[...] The initial thunderstorm activity moistens up the environment around the low, which destabilizes the atmosphere by reducing the lapse rate needed for convection. [...] When the next shortwave or upper level jet streak (wind maximum within the jet stream) moves nearby, convection reignites closer to {{the center and the}} system develops into a true subtropical cyclone. [...] The average sea surface temperature that helps lead to subtropical cyclogenesis is [...] If the thunderstorm activity becomes deep and persistent, allowing its initial low level warm core to deepen, tropical cyclogenesis is possible. The locus of formation for North Atlantic subtropical cyclones is out in the open ocean; the island of Bermuda is regularly impacted by these systems.|$|E

50|$|If the {{environmental}} <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> {{is between the}} moist and <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates,</b> the air is conditionally unstable — an unsaturated parcel of air does not have sufficient buoyancy {{to rise to the}} LCL or CCL, and it is stable to weak vertical displacements in either direction. If the parcel is saturated it is unstable and will rise to the LCL or CCL, and either be halted due to an inversion layer of convective inhibition, or if lifting continues, deep, moist convection (DMC) may ensue, as a parcel rises to the level of free convection (LFC), after which it enters the free convective layer (FCL) and usually rises to the equilibrium level (EL).|$|R
40|$|The mass {{transport}} in the shallow, wind-driven, overturning {{cells in the}} tropical oceans is constrained {{to be close to}} the {{mass transport}} in the atmospheric Hadley cell, assuming that zonally integrated wind stresses on land are relatively small. Therefore, the ratio of the poleward energy transport in low latitudes in the two media is determined by the ratio of the atmospheric gross static stability to that of the ocean. A qualitative discussion of the gross stability of each medium suggests that the resulting ratio of oceanic to atmospheric energy transport, averaged over the Hadley cell, is roughly equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of water to that of air at constant pressure, multiplied by the ratio of the moist to the <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> near the surface. The ratio of oceanic to atmospheric energy transport should be larger than this value near the equator and smaller than this value near the poleward boundary of the Hadley cell. ...|$|R
40|$|Extremely heavy {{precipitation}} affects human {{society and the}} natural environment, and its behaviour under a warming climate needs to be elucidated. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} observed extreme precipitation increases with surface air temperature (SAT) at approximately the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) rate, suggesting that atmospheric water vapour content can explain the relationship between extreme precipitation and SAT. However, the relationship between atmospheric water vapour content and SAT is poorly understood {{due to the lack of}} reliable observations with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage for statistical analyses. Here, we analyse the relationship between atmospheric water vapour content and SAT using precipitable water vapour (PWV) derived from global positioning system satellites. A super-CC rate appears in hourly PWV when the SAT is below 16 degrees C, whereas the rate decreases at high SAT, which is different from the precipitation-SAT relationship. The effects of upper air temperature and water vapour can consistently explain the super-CC rate of PWV relative to SAT. The difference between moist and <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> increases with SAT, in consequence of more ability to hold water vapour in the free atmosphere under higher SAT conditions; therefore, attainable PWV increases more rapidly than the CC rate as SAT increases...|$|R

5000|$|For dry air, {{which is}} {{approximately}} an ideal gas, we can proceed further. The adiabatic equation for an ideal gas is where [...] is the heat capacity ratio (=7/5, for air). Combining with the equation for the pressure, one {{arrives at the}} <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> rate,If the air contains water vapor, then cooling of the air can cause the water to condense, and the behavior is no longer that of an ideal gas. If the air is at the saturated vapor pressure, then {{the rate at which}} temperature drops with height is called the saturated <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate.</b> More generally, the actual rate at which the temperature drops with altitude is called the environmental <b>lapse</b> <b>rate.</b> In the troposphere, the average environmental <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> is a drop of about 6.5 °C for every 1 km (1,000 meters) in increased height.|$|R
50|$|The <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> is {{the rate}} at which a rising or falling air mass lowers or {{increases}} per distance of vertical displacement.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{generation}} of radiative-convective models a constant value for the critical atmospheric <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> generally 6. 5 K/km, is used. However, the moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> are a better approximation for use in simple climate models. Thus, a comparison of temperature profiles with critical constant and moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> has been made for a one-dimensional radiative-convective model. The commonly used <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> of 6. 5 K/km yields surface temperatures some 1 to 3 K higher than with the use of moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates</b> for both clear sky conditions and a single effective cloud. When multiple clouds are included the constant <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> of 6. 5 K/km yields the lower surface temperatures. More importantly, the surface temperature generated from the constant <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> formulation is more sensitive to changes in carbon dioxide, relative humidity, cloud cover, and surface albedo. For a doubling of CO, the moist <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> formulation yields surface temperature changes 25 to 60 % smaller than does a constant 6. 5 K/km <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> depending on the cloud treatment. 1...|$|R
50|$|If the {{environmental}} lapse rate {{is larger than the}} <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> it has a superadiabatic lapse rate, the air is absolutely unstable — a parcel of air will gain buoyancy as it rises both below and above the lifting condensation level or convective condensation level. This often happens in the afternoon mainly over land masses. In these conditions, the likelihood of cumulus clouds, showers or even thunderstorms is increased.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} in moist {{adiabatic lapse rate}} and the dry rate {{is the cause of}} foehn wind phenomenon (also known as [...] "Chinook winds" [...] in parts of North America). The phenomenon exists because warm moist air rises through orographic lifting up and over the top of a mountain range or large mountain. The temperature decreases with the <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> until it hits the dew point, where water vapor in the air begins to condense. Above that altitude, the adiabatic lapse rate decreases to the moist adiabatic lapse rate as the air continues to rise. Condensation is also commonly followed by precipitation on the top and windward sides of the mountain. As the air descends on the leeward side, it is warmed by adiabatic compression at the <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, the foehn wind at a certain altitude is warmer than the corresponding altitude on the windward side of the mountain range. In addition, because the air has lost much of its original water vapor content, the descending air creates an arid region on the leeward side of the mountain.|$|E
50|$|The {{convective}} {{condensation level}} (CCL) results when strong surface heating causes buoyant lifting of surface air and subsequent mixing of the planetary boundary layer, {{so that the}} layer near the surface ends up with a <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate.</b> As the mixing becomes deeper, it will {{get to the point}} where the LCL of an air parcel starting at the surface is at the top of the mixed region. When this occurs, then any further solar heating of the surface will cause a cloud to form topping the well-mixed boundary layer, and the level at which this occurs is called the CCL. If the boundary layer starts off with a stable temperature profile (that is, with a lapse rate less than the <b>dry</b> <b>adiabatic</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate),</b> then the CCL will be higher than the LCL. In nature, the actual cloud base is often initially somewhere between the LCL and the CCL. If a thunderstorm forms, then as it grows and matures, processes such as increased saturation at lower levels from precipitation and lower surface pressure usually lead to a lowering of the cloud base.|$|E

Therefore, moving up 100 m on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.|$|E
