Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, <b>good,</b> <b>I</b> don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
