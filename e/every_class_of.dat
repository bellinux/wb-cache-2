5|$|In Roman times, {{poisoning}} {{carried out}} {{at the dinner table}} or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening as early as 331 BC. These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in <b>every</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> the social order. The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred poison was said to be cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space around just about <b>every</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E

Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E

Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt's Naval Game, based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built {{on a scale of one}} inch to fifty feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy, a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color <b>every</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> ship in the Navy.|$|E

2500|$|A subalgebra of a {{power set}} algebra is called a field of sets; {{equivalently}} a field of sets {{is a set of}} subsets of some set W including the empty set and W and closed under finite union and complement with respect to W (and hence also under finite intersection). Birkhoff's [...] representation theorem for Boolean algebras states that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets. Now Birkhoff's HSP theorem for varieties can be stated as, <b>every</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> models of the equational theory of a class C of algebras is the Homomorphic image of a Subalgebra of a direct Product of algebras of C. Normally all three of H, S, and P are needed; what the first of these two Birkhoff theorems shows is that for the special case of the variety of Boolean algebras Homomorphism can be replaced by Isomorphism. Birkhoff's HSP theorem for varieties in general therefore becomes Birkhoff's ISP theorem for the variety of Boolean algebras.|$|E

Everywhere the taxes are heaped upon the needy, while the rich, who have the apportioning of the impost, escape comparatively free (v. 7). The great towns are wholly given up to the abominations of the circus and the theatre, where decency is wholly set at nought, and Minerva, Mars, Neptune and the old gods are still worshipped (vi. 11; cf- vi. 2 and viii. 2).|$|E

2500|$|When newly {{appointed}} governor George Izard arrived in Arkansas on May 31, 1825 {{he found that}} his predecessor had been unsuccessful in doing more than a bare minimum of militia organization. He found that the senior leadership of the Arkansas Militia were occupied with other duties. Holding multiple offices had been a common practice under Governor Miller. William Bradford, the Brigadier General of the Arkansas Militia, was living at Fort Townsen and serving as the sutler to the 7th Infantry Regiment. Terrance Farrelly, who had been appointed as adjutant general in 1823, was living in Arkansas County and serving as the Sherriff of that county. Izard was the ideal man to bring professional military standards to the rough and tumble Arkansas militia. On June 10, 1825 Izard issued a stern general order to all commanding officers telling them to report immediately to either Brigadier General William Bradford at Fort Towsen or to the Adjutant General's office in Little Rock. [...] "The organization of the Territorial Militia will engage the full attention of the Commander-in-Chief" [...] Izard wrote, [...] "and will be proceeded on without delay." [...] In a direct warning to recalcitrant officers, Izard promised that [...] "the laws for {{the government of the}} Militia, will be rigidly enforced..." [...] Izard's interest in the militia attracted widespread attention and support in the state. However, some Arkansans evidently believed that Izard was fighting a losing battle. The editor of the Arkansas Gazette endorsed Izard's efforts by urging [...] "the ready and hearty cooperation of <b>every</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> our citizens...." [...] But the writer also expressed the belief that the new governor [...] "will find it an arduous task to perform...." [...] Terrance Farrelly reacted to Izard's efforts by resigning the office of adjutant general in a letter dated June 18, 1825.|$|E
