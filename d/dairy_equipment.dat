25|$|The Sharples Separator Works began {{experiencing}} {{troubles in}} the 1920s. Philip M. Sharples resigned in 1925 after a large layoff of workers. His son Philip T. Sharples succeeded him {{as head of}} the company, and in 1926 shut down production of milk machines. The company managed to survive through building refrigerators and electric generators. With the 1929 stock market crash, the Sharples Separator Works was forced to call in loans from debtors. Vice President Fred Wood urged the federal government to raise tariffs on European products in December 1929. Due to effects of the Great Depression, the firm went out of business on March 29, 1933. The Sharples-owned Farmers and Mechanics Building, which cost over $100,000 to construct, was sold to the Daily Local News for $30,000. Wood and Anne Fitzpatrick formed the United <b>Dairy</b> <b>Equipment</b> Company out of the remains of the separator works.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} rabbinical writers {{imply that}} milk from an animal whose meat is kosher is also kosher. As animals are considered non-kosher if after being slaughtered they are discovered {{to have been}} diseased, this could make their milk retroactively non-kosher. However, by adhering to the principle that the majority case overrules the exception, Jewish tradition continues to regard such milk as kosher, since statistically {{it is true that}} most animals producing such milk are kosher; the same principle is not applied to the possibility of consuming meat from an animal which has not been checked for disease. Rabbi Hershel Schachter, a prominent rosh yeshiva at Yeshiva University, has made the bold claim that with modern <b>dairy</b> farm <b>equipment,</b> milk from the minority of nonkosher cows is invariably mixed with that of the majority of kosher cows, thus invalidating the permissibility of consuming milk from a large dairy operation; the Orthodox Union, however, released a statement declaring the milk permissible based on some leniencies.|$|R
40|$|Determination of {{enterotoxin}} production, diarrhoeal and emetic gene identification was {{studied in}} 41 Bacillus cereus strains isolated from raw cows’ and raw goats’ milk, pasteurized milk, dairy products during technological processing and from <b>dairy</b> plant <b>equipment.</b> Presence of enterotoxins {{was detected by}} BCET-RPLA (HBL) and ELISA immunoassay (NHE). Gene identification (nheA, nheB, nheC, hblA, hblC, hblD, bceT, cytK- 1, cytK- 2, entFM and ces) was achieved by means of PCR. Enterotoxin HBL was detected in 32 strains, enterotoxin NHE in all 41 strains. Presence of all three genes nheA, nheB and nheC was confirmed in 40 strains and genes hblA, hblC and hblD in 29 strains. Comparison of used methods was as follow: 1) BCET-RPLA (which detects L 2 component) and PCR (positive or negative all three hblA, hblC and hblD gene detection) were identical in 30 (73 %); 2) ELISA (NheA) and PCR (all three nheC, nheB and nheA gene expression) were identical in 40 (98 %) cases isolated strains...|$|R
