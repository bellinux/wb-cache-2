50|$|By 1972 Eisch {{was putting}} less time into <b>free-blown</b> <b>glass</b> sculpture. Instead, he devoted {{himself to the}} {{creation}} of sculptures from which ceramic molds for glass-blowing were made. His series of heads, including those of Harvey Littleton, Thomas Buechner, Picasso and the Buddha, and his “Blister-finger” series of works, were all mold-blown. This allowed Eisch to concentrate his efforts not only on sculpting but also on engraving and painting on glass. In using different cold-working techniques to create imagery on each piece in his series, along with distorting the hot glass sculpture as it came from the mold, Eisch made virtually identical mold-blown pieces into individual, unique statements.|$|E
50|$|Harvey Littleton {{called his}} first meeting with Erwin Eisch “a milestone” in his {{development}} as a glass artist. In August 1962 Littleton was visiting Germany on a research grant when he noticed, in the showroom of the Rimpler Kristall glass factory in Zwiesel, a piece of glass that was unlike the other objects on display. Littleton was told that it was from the Eisch Glass Factory in the nearby town of Frauenau. Visiting the Eisch factory, Littleton met Erwin Eisch and marveled at his expressionistic <b>free-blown</b> <b>glass</b> objects. “Meeting Erwin confirmed my belief that glass could be a medium for direct expression by an individual,” he wrote.|$|E

5000|$|Shelburne Museum's glass {{collection}} numbers nearly two thousand pieces dating from 1750 to 1900 and includes <b>free-blown</b> flasks, window <b>glass,</b> and mold-blown bottles and flasks; pattern glass plates, serving dishes and decorative piecesl colorful canes, rolling pins, marbles, [...] "witch balls" [...] and other whimseys; and miniature glass doll dishes. The Garrison collection of American pattern glass goblets includes eleven hundred patterns. In addition the collection includes {{a wide range}} of patent medicine and apothecary bottles.|$|R
30|$|Measuring {{approximately}} 29  cm {{in height}} and 19  cm in diameter at its maximum dimensions, the lamp in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection (Fig.  1 a) is of relatively small size {{as compared to}} many Mamluk mosque lamps [1]. <b>Free-blown</b> of colorless <b>glass,</b> the lamp comprises the typical globular body and conical neck. Six applied handles or suspension loops protrude from the vessel’s wall. The bulk glass of the lamp’s body comprises many small bubbles and granular inclusions, as well as large and elongated bubbles. Subtle concentric circular ridges mark the vessel’s underside, intimating the object’s free-blown manufacture. The body’s base appears to comprise a double pontil mark, with a larger scar partially filled by additional glass from a second pontil, suggesting that the object was reintroduced into the furnace during manufacture (Fig.  1 c). Uncommon among Mamluk lamps, an upright tubular wick-holder appears within the vessel {{at the base of}} the lamp’s body (Fig.  1 b).|$|R
40|$|The ancient glass {{collection}} of the National Museum has more than 200 completely intact and so far - beside few exceptions - unpublished vessels which encompass a wide chronological framework from the 5 th century BC {{until the end of}} antiquity. The core of the collection is composed of mold-blown and <b>free-blown</b> <b>glass.</b> The analysis of the collection offers a view into the history of the ancient glass production; examples of all kinds of production methods can be found in it - from a corn-formed glass, through a glass made by sagging into a form, and up to a mold-blown and <b>free-blown</b> <b>glass.</b> A great number of various decoration techniques and styles used in antiquity are represented in the collection; also, it contains vessels from various places within the Roman Empire, as well as outside of it. The major part of the work comprises blown glass from the Roman imperial period (chapter four), both free-blown and mold-blown, and from this virtually half are unguentaria of various types. Almost all types of vessel produced in this period are found in this chapter. The vessels were ordered according to types - e. g. open shapes, closed shapes and in the framework of these types they are arranged further - according to other criteria which create other sub-groups - as for example forms without a foot or on a [...] ...|$|E
