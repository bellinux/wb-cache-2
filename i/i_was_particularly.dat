As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his {{numerous}} fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{directed}} by Miguel Sapochnik, who had directed the fifth-season episodes [...] "The Gift" [...] and [...] "Hardhome". In an Entertainment Weekly interview before the episode aired, Sapochnik said he was brought on board by Benioff and Weiss after his previous-season success; [...] "Hardhome" [...] won several awards, including Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. About how the episode should be shot, he said: [...] "Every battle on Thrones is unique. I think that's why Benioff and Weiss keep doing them. In the case of 'Battle of the Bastards' – or 'BOB' as we affectionately called it in production – David and Dan {{wanted to do a}} thing of spectacle, a strategic pitchfield battle they hadn't had the resources to do back in season 1 or 2. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> interested in depicting both the horror of war and the role of luck in battle." [...] Benioff called Sapochnik's work on the episode some {{of the best in the}} series' history.|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E

2500|$|When President Calvin Coolidge {{announced}} in August 1927 {{that he would}} not seek a second full term of office in the 1928 presidential election, Hoover became the leading Republican candidate, despite the fact Coolidge was lukewarm on Hoover, often deriding his ambitious and popular Commerce Secretary as [...] "Wonder Boy". Coolidge had been reluctant to choose Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that [...] "for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>particularly</b> offended by his comment to 'shit or get off the pot'." [...] Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the popular Commerce Secretary's nomination. Prior to the 1928 Republican National Convention, many wary Republican leaders cast about for an alternative candidate such as Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, former Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, or Coolidge. But no challenger emerged, and Hoover won the presidential nomination on the first ballot of the convention. The delegates considered nominating incumbent Vice President Charles Dawes to be Hoover's running mate. But Coolidge (who hated Dawes) remarked that this would be [...] "a personal affront" [...] to him. The convention instead selected Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas. Hoover accepted the nomination at Stanford Stadium, telling a huge crowd that he would continue the policies of the Harding and Coolidge administration.|$|E
