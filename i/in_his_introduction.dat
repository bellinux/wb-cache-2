The Kingdom of Evils, a book on psychiatric social work by Southard and Jarrett, was published after his death. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the book, physician Richard Cabot wrote that it highlighted the collaboration between doctor and social worker; the physician excels at diagnosis, and the social worker is better able to provide resources for treatment.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of}} the 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E
5|$|King was {{influential}} in deciding who would play Flagg {{in the television}} adaptation of The Stand. He felt {{he was the best}} villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.|$|E

5|$|Larkin was {{a notable}} critic of modernism in {{contemporary}} art and literature. His scepticism {{is at its}} most nuanced and illuminating in Required Writing, a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to his collected jazz reviews, All What Jazz, drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for The Daily Telegraph between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts. Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired as an enemy of modernism, recent critical assessments of Larkin's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The Sundance Channel airings {{attracted}} more viewers in the 18-to-24 age range than was usual for their audience, which typically comprised men over age 25. After the second episode aired, cultural critic Lee Siegel {{wrote about the}} show for The New Republic.

25|$|Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ {{mentioned}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the Introduction 65 chapters, each {{specific to}} a particular type or term of hadith terminology before saying that an even larger number was conceivable.

25|$|The {{continuous}} {{historical development}} of modern arithmetic {{starts with the}} Hellenistic civilization of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of Euclid around 300BC, Greek studies in mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction,</b> Mailer details his {{conflicted}} {{attitude toward}} the short story and casts doubt on his own abilities to write a good one.

25|$|It was {{the fourth}} and final novel {{featuring}} Psmith, the others being Mike (1909) (later republished in two parts, with Psmith appearing in the second, Mike and Psmith (1953)), Psmith in the City (1910), and Psmith, Journalist (1915) – <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the omnibus The World of Psmith, Wodehouse {{said that he had}} stopped writing about the character because he couldn't think of any more stories.|$|E
25|$|R.D. Keynes, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the 2001 {{edition of}} Darwin's diary, {{suggests}} that FitzRoy {{had undergone a}} religious conversion.

5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>introductions</b> to {{the three}} 1986 Titan editions, Moore {{described}} its genesis.

[...] Moore {{said that he had}} [...] "no inclination to unleash yet another 'Tough Bitch With A Disintegrator And An Extra Y-Chromosome' upon the world". The idea to base the strip around an ordinary, unremarkable woman, typical of the society she lived in, was also very different for 2000 AD.|$|R
25|$|Robert Ardrey, {{an admirer}} of Eugène Marais's, {{attributed}} Marais' later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck.

In the chapter Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits, Hooke argues that John Dee made use of Trithemian steganography, to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I. The work of Waller, along with John Ward's Lives of the Gresham Professors and John Aubrey's Brief Lives, form the major near-contemporaneous biographical accounts of Hooke.|$|E
60|$|In January 1802 Scott {{published}} the two first volumes of The Minstrelsy. Lockhart describes {{the enthusiasm of}} dukes, fine ladies, and antiquarians. In the end of April 1803 the third volume appeared, including ballads obtained through Hogg and Laidlaw in spring 1802. Scott, by his store of historic anecdote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>introductions</b> and notes, by his way of vivifying the past, and by his method of editing, revived, but did not create, the interest in the romance of ballad poetry.|$|R
