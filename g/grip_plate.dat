5000|$|The Norwegian Landstad revolver, {{designed}} and introduced in 1900. Its very unusual design featured a flat cylinder with two chambers, {{in which the}} bottom chamber was loaded from a sideways-inserted magazine that also functioned as the left <b>grip</b> <b>plate.</b> During firing, the revolver's reciprocating bolt would extract and eject the round from the top chamber after firing, load a round into the bottom chamber, and then rotate the cylinder. The revolver would then be ready to fire again. It was chambered for the 7.5mm Nagant cartridge, {{which at the time}} was also used in both the Norwegian and Swedish versions of the Belgian Nagant M1895 revolver.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Match" [...] {{model is}} a {{sporting}} model featuring black laminated wood <b>grip</b> <b>plates,</b> extended magazine catch, skeletonized hammer, fully skeletonized SAO trigger and adjustable micrometer sights.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Classic" [...] model {{most closely}} resembles the X-Five and X-Six of old. The models feature walnut <b>grip</b> <b>plates,</b> short {{magazine}} release, completely adjustable SAO trigger system and micrometer sights.|$|R
5000|$|Orbit wheel skates, another spiritual {{relative}} of the freeline skate whereby the skate stands on a grip-tape-surfaced platform (just slightly larger than a freeline skate's) inside of a large hoop that contains a trapped wheel that can freely rotate under the <b>grip</b> <b>plate</b> each foot is planted on. The foot plates normally rest on the trough of the inner surface of these orbital wheels, with the toes pointing orthogonal to {{the rotation of the}} ringed wheel. It's said the experience of riding them is somewhat similar to skateboarding, and there are variants with the two wheels connected so the rider is fixed in a skateboarding-like stance.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 645 was {{introduced}} in 1985, and produced until 1988. [...] It has a stainless steel frame and slide, an ambidextrous safety/decocker, a squared trigger guard, and black plastic <b>grip</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "SO Series" [...] {{is a model}} {{intended}} for service pistol competitions. It comes in two variants where the difference is the frame material. The SO has a steel frame, while the AL SO SAO has an aluminium frame. Both versions feature fixed sights (on an adaptor plate), a non-adjustable SAO trigger, short magazine catch and polymer <b>grip</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The SIG P226 X-Six is designed, manufactured, {{and marketed}} as a {{precision}} pistol under SIG's sporting firearm line. The X-Six features an extended slide and frame {{to accommodate a}} 152 mm barrel, an ambidextrous manual safety and a trigger adjustable for pull weight, distance and stop. To further enhance the X-Six's sporting pedigree the pistol features a standard low profile adjustable sights, grip grooves cut into {{the front of the}} frame, lightweight magazine extension and NILL sporting <b>grip</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} messers is their hilt construction. Quite notable in its construction was the attachment of blade to the hilt via a slab tang sandwiched between two wooden <b>grip</b> <b>plates</b> that were pegged into place. Messers often include a straight cross-guard and a nagel: a nail-like protrusion that juts out from {{the right side of}} the cross-guard away from the flat of the blade, to protect the wielder’s sword hand. The lengths of hilts can range from one or two-handed grips.|$|R

5000|$|Adjustable {{dumbbells}} {{consist of}} a metal bar whose centre portion is often engraved with a crosshatch pattern (knurling) to improve <b>grip.</b> Weight <b>plates</b> are slid onto the outer portions of the dumbbell and secured with clips or collars. Shown to the right is a [...] "spinlock" [...] dumbbell, whose ends are threaded to accept large nuts as collars. Alternatively, a dumbbell may have smooth ends with plates being secured by a sprung collar. Nowadays, many commercially sold dumbbells are available with sophisticated, and easy-to-use methods for weight increments adjustments.|$|R
50|$|Barbells {{range in}} length from 4 ft to above 8 ft, {{although}} bars longer than 2.2 m are used primarily by powerlifters {{and are not}} commonplace. The central portion of the bar varies in diameter from 25 mm to 2 in (e.g. Apollon's Axle), and is often engraved with a knurled crosshatch pattern to help lifters maintain a solid <b>grip.</b> Weight <b>plates</b> are slid onto the outer portions of the bar to increase or decrease the desired total weight. These weights are often secured with collars {{to prevent them from}} sliding off during the exercise, which can result in injuries and death, or flinging the unevenly loaded barbell through the air.|$|R

6000|$|If the Achaeans had {{thoroughly}} excellent bronze, and had iron {{as bad as}} that of the Celts {{a thousand}} years later, their preference for bronze over iron for weapons is explained. In Homer the fighters do not very often come to sword strokes; they fight mainly with the spear, except in pursuit, now and then. But when they do strike, they cleave heads and cut off arms. They could not do this with bronze rapiers, such as those with which men give point over the rim of the shield on two Mycenaean gems. But Mr. Myres writes, [...] "From the shaft graves (of Mycenae) onwards {{there are two types of}} swords in the Mycenaean world--one an exaggerated dagger riveted into the front end of the hilt, the other with a flat flanged tang running the whole length of the hilt, and covered on either face by ornamental <b>grip</b> <b>plates</b> riveted on. This sword, though still of bronze, can deal a very effective cut; and, as the Mycenaeans had no armour for body or head," [...] (?) [...] "the danger of breaking or bending the sword on a cuirass or helmet did not arise." [...] [Footnote: Classical Review, xvi. 72.] The danger did exist in Homer's time, as we have seen. But a bronze sword, published by Tsountas and Manatt (Mycenaean Age, p. 199, fig. 88), is emphatically meant to give both point and edge, having a solid handle--a continuation of the blade--and a very broad blade, coming to a very fine point. Even in Grave V. at Mycenae, we have a sword blade so massive at the top that it was certainly capable of a swashing blow. [Footnote: Schuchardt, Schliemann's Excavations, p. 265, fig. 269.] The sword of the charioteer on the stêlê of Grave V. is equally good for cut and thrust. A pleasanter cut and thrust bronze sword than the one found at Ialysus no gentleman could wish to handle. [Footnote: Furtwängler und Loeschke, Myk. Va. Taf. D.] Homer, in any case, says that his heroes used bronze swords, well adapted to strike. If his age had really good bronze, and iron as bad {{as that of the}} Celts of Polybius, a thousand years later, their preference of bronze over iron for weapons needs no explanation. If their iron was not so bad as that of the Celts, their military conservatism might retain bronze for weapons, while in civil life they often used iron for implements.|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} {{with the aim of}} evaluating the physical characteristics of children at the age group of 9 - 15, who play football at amateur level, in accordance with age. Th e domain of the study consists of amateur male football players(n= 82) who play actively in Kayseri and have been selected with random sampling method. In order to investigate the effects of football training on physical parameters, some tests selected from Eurofit test battery such as hand <b>grip</b> strength, <b>plate</b> tapping, 30 seconds of sit - ups, flamingo, standing broad jump, sit and reach, 20 meters shuttle run, as well as 20 meters sprint and anthropometric measurements (height, weight and body mass index) we re applied to the subjects. The statistical evaluation of data is based on 0. 05 significance value; after the descriptive statistical and One - Way ANOVA tests have been applied, Duncan has been used as second level test in order to evaluate the differences between the groups. According to the results, some substantial differences(p 0, 05) have been found with respect to parameters such as BMI(...|$|R
50|$|The M1919A6 {{first saw}} combat {{service in the}} fall of 1943. It had a metal {{buttstock}} assembly that clamped to the backplate of the gun, and a front barrel bearing that incorporated both a muzzle booster and a bipod similar to that used on the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). A lighter barrel than that of the M1919A4 was fitted, and a carry handle was attached to the barrel jacket {{to make it easier to}} carry. Previous designs could change the barrel, but it required field stripping the gun - the pistol <b>grip</b> back <b>plate,</b> bolt group and the trigger group all had to be removed before the barrel could finally be replaced, and this put the gun out of action for minutes, and risked losing and damaging parts in the field. The M1919A6 muzzle device allowed the gun crew to replace the barrel from the front, an improvement, but still an awkward procedure compared to other machine guns of the day.The M1919A6 was a heavy (32 lb) and awkward weapon in comparison with the MG34 (26 lb) and MG42 (25 lb) and was eventually replaced in US service by the M60 machine gun in the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frying pan}} is 20.1 cm across and 28.2 cm from tip to <b>grip.</b> The <b>plate</b> has a round wall which is undecorated and {{projects}} outwards, forming the dish of the [...] "frying pan". The incised decoration {{on the reverse}} is very deep. The entire <b>plate,</b> with the <b>grips,</b> {{is surrounded by a}} border of chip impressions. At the base of the handle, above the grips is an engraved pubic triangle. It is separated from the main field by another chip border. In the main field, stamped spirals, linked together by engraved lines, surround a ship which is engraved slightly below centre, opposite the handle. The hull and an upward pointing prow are depicted by engraved double lines. There is a fish symbol and two banners on the high prow. Above and below the hull, oars or rudders are suggested by slanting lines - a different number on each side. A unique feature compared to other frying pans is the orientation of the ship. It is the only known depiction of a ship with a high prow, which is usually identified as the bow, at the left end.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1950s, however, {{manufacturing}} shortcuts {{have resulted}} in a quality decline of machetes. Today, most modern factory-made machetes are of very simple construction, consisting of a blade and full-length tang punched from a single piece of flat steel plate of uniform thickness (and thus lack a primary grind), and a simple <b>grip</b> of two <b>plates</b> of wood or plastic bolted or riveted together around the tang. Finally, both sides are ground down to a rough edge so that the purchaser can sharpen the blade to their specific geometry using a file. These machetes are occasionally provided with a simple cord loop as a sort of lanyard, and a canvas scabbard - although in some regions where machetes are valuable, commonly used tools, the users may make decorative leather scabbards for them.|$|R
5000|$|M1849/55 Army kammerlader. Probably {{the second}} most common large bore kammerlader, with a total {{production}} of more than 10,000 rifles (2,000 produced by A. Francotte in Liege, Crause in Hertzberg produced another 2,000 and Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk 6,021). In addition, a further 4.500 were manufactured at Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk in 1855 directly as M1849/55. There were a couple of improvements on the M1849, compared to the earlier model. The hammer was widened for a better <b>grip,</b> the butt <b>plate</b> was bent up under the stock in order to protect this better. As far as is known, all the M1849 had fitted new rear sights in 1855, attached with a band around the barrel — or at least no unmodified M1849 are known today. Since this is such a common variation, {{it is also one of}} the more affordable for a collector.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Older {{adults with}} type 2 Diabetes Mellitus are at {{increased}} risk of falling. The current study aims to identify risk factors that mediate the relationship between diabetes and falls. METHODS: 199 older adults (104 with diabetes and 95 healthy controls) underwent a medical screening. Gait (GAITRite®), balance (AccuGait® force <b>plate),</b> <b>grip</b> strength (Jamar®), and cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination and Clock Drawing Test) were assessed. Falls were prospectively recorded during a 12 -month follow-up period using monthly calendars. RESULTS: Compared to controls, diabetes participants scored worse on all physical and cognitive measures. Sixty-four participants (42 diabetes vs. 22 controls) reported at least one injurious fall or two non-injurious falls ("fallers"). Univariate logistic regression identified diabetes as a risk factor for future falls (Odds Ratio 2. 25, 95 %CI 1. 21 - 4. 15, p =  0. 010). Stepwise multiple regressions defined diabetes and poor balance as independent risk factors for falling. Taking more medications, slower walking speed, shorter stride length and poor cognitive performance were mediators that reduced the Odds Ratio of the relationship between diabetes and faller status relationship the most followed by reduced grip strength and increased stride length variability. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is a major risk factor for falling, even after controlling for poor balance. Taking more medications, poorer walking performance and reduced cognitive functioning were mediators of the relationship between diabetes and falls. Tailored preventive programs including systematic medication reviews, specific balance exercises and cognitive training might be beneficial in reducing fall risk in older adults suffering from diabetes...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityIn modern automated manufacturing systems, {{there is a need}} for work-holding devices that provide for precision, accuracy, reliability, flexibility and remoteness of control. One of such devices is the diaphragm chuck which utilizes the strain energy of its varying thickness diaphragm <b>plate</b> for <b>gripping</b> action. The jaw-carrying diaphragm plate is deflected by a thrust load, and the jaws are bored or ground to the nominal diameter of the workpiece. Gripping action occurs when the workpiece is inserted into the jaws and the thrust is relieved. Designers and manufacturers of diaphragm chucks have in the past been limited to the use of empirical data for diaphragm chuck design. This design limitation has been caused by complex problems due to factors such as the varying thickness encastre diaphragm <b>plate,</b> the <b>gripping</b> couples and the stiffening effects of the jaw slides. This work involved the establishment, by theory and experimental verification, of the design and performance parameters of a diaphragm chuck, and the provision of diaphragm chuck design methodology. The designer is therefore able to achieve the a priori design of the diaphragm chuck. In addition, the user is able to adapt existing diaphragm plates to achieve required gripping forces within existing constraints. The scope of this research is the static gripping action for any number of symmetric jaws. The design method is for diaphragm plates with small thickness taper, and carry detachable jaw slides. The concept of the equivalent constant thickness is applied to the diaphragm <b>plate.</b> <b>Gripping</b> action is divided into two major phases - the separate deflections of the diaphragm plate by a thrust load and symmetric couples. These deflections are equated to obtain the gripping force. This research concludes that the gripping force of a diaphragm chuck is closely predicted by the equivalent constant thickness method. Design data and methodology are provided for diaphragm chuck design. Thus, a designer can now design a diaphragm chuck based on a desired and pre-specified gripping force requirement...|$|R
