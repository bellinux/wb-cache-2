In the field of refrigerants in air conditioner, because of the destruction to the environment from freon(CFC), people are looking for new refrigerants which can replace the freon. And <b>difluoromethane</b> (HFC- 32) does no harm to the ozone layer, making it a good substitute. But it's still not widely used. One of the reasons is that <b>difluoromethane</b> is flammable, and its detection technology indoors is not mature. In this study, based on computational fluid dynamics theory and the CFD software FLUENT, the process of leakage of <b>difluoromethane</b> was simulated to study the law of HFC- 32 diffusion.

It will subside to the ground soon and diffuse from the leakage point, and then making it as the centre, spread from the near to the distant. And in the leakage process, the concentration near the leakage point is higher than that in other areas in the same plane. But when the leakage point is located higher (wall-mounted air conditioners scene), there is an obvious effect of sedimentation, in some areas there will be the lowest concentration value at intermediate height.

40|$|Introduction. Biologically active {{substances}} (BAS) of barberry roots represented by alkaloids of isoquinoline group are perspective substances {{for development of}} preparations with multiple pharmacological activities. However, now manufacture of them in Ukraine is stopped. One of the reasons of this is out-of-date production technologies of alkaloids involving use of toxic and/or flammable solvents. In the article possibility for application of liquefied gases in technology of obtaining of alkaloids from barberry roots has been studied. Materials and methods. Initial raw herb drug were barberry (Berberis vulgaris) roots harvested in spring on the territory of Southern Ukraine. Their moisture content was 11 %, comminuting degree was 0, 5 - 1, 4 mm. At the first stage purification of raw herb drug from lipophilic impurities (defatting) was made with use of some liquefied gases: tetrafluoroethane, isobutane, difluorochloromethane and <b>difluoromethane.</b> Extraction of the alkaloid sum was made with <b>difluoromethane</b> mixed with various quantities of liquid ammonia or diethylamine as alkaline agent. Crude extracts were exposed to two-level liquefiedgas purification. At first the alkaloid bases were transformed into saline forms with aqueous solutions of acids and purified from ballast impurities with liquefied freon- 22. Then alkaloid salts were reextracted from aqueous phase in the base form with liquefied mixture of <b>difluoromethane</b> and ammonia. Mixing of liquid phases was provided by creation of alternate gradients of temperatures and, as consequence, pressures between separators feeding alternately cool water into jacket of one of them, and warm water – into jacket of another one. Quantity of lipophilic ballast impurities and also weight of extractives were determined gravimetrically. Quantitative analysis of the alkaloid sum was made by titrimetric method after sedimentation of alkaloids with volumetric solution of phosphomolybdic acid. Results and discussion. It {{has been found that}} at stage of degreasing of raw crude drug the most selective solvent to lipophilic ballast compounds was isobutane and difluorochloromethane, but the latter was more rational for using in industrial scale concerning its fire-safety and economic availability. It has been also found that efficiency of the purification stage of Berberis alkaloids appreciably depends on composition of extracting solvent while obtaining of crude extracts. The best parameters in the finished product have been revealed after purification of the extracts obtained with <b>difluoromethane</b> containing 12 % of liquid ammonia: quantity of BAS (alkaloids) in the finished product reached 95 %, and their losses were insignificant – 3, 5 %. Increasing of cosolvent (ammonia) content in the extracting solvent considerably complicated purification of extractives, and losses of alkaloids raised to 13, 2 %, obviously as a result of presence of considerable quantity of hydrophylic ballast substances. Reducing of the ammonia content in the extracting solvent down to 1 % also caused negative impact on process of obtaining of the alkaloids which yield was the lowest among investigated assays. It’s possible to explain this by lower рН value in extracting medium, change of solvent polarity, therefore middle-polar and hydrophobic compounds preferably passed into composition of crude extracts. Conclusions. Acceptability for use of liquefied gases and their mixtures for purification of the alkaloid sum from barberry roots has been proved. It has been shown that prior to stage of extraction of these BAS it’s expedient to withdraw lipophilic impurities from the crude herbal drug with liquified difluorochloromethane (freon- 22). Purification efficiency of the finished product considerably depends on composition of extracting solvent during obtaining of crude extracts. The best parameters were found after purification of the extracts taken with <b>difluoromethane</b> containing 12 % of liquid ammonia. It’s the most expedient to purify crude extracts by two-step procedure using on the first step liquefied difluorochloromethane (freon- 22) as organic phase and on the second one – <b>difluoromethane</b> mixed with 10 % of ammonia, and as aqueous phase – 10 % acidic solutions; at the second step it’s necessary to provide liquid reextraction of the alkaloid bases in triplicate...|$|E

40|$|Supercritical (sc) fluids are {{extensively}} {{used for}} material processing {{and carbon dioxide}} is {{the most commonly used}} solvent. In these solutions, solute-solvent interactions consist primarily of Van der Waals forces and the small amount of data published shows that the solute has only a small effect on solution structure. The use of more polar solvents allows high concentrations of polar solutes to be dissolved resulting in more ordered solutions. This has an effect on clustering and mass transport. The aim of this thesis is to investigate solute-solute-solvent interactions in sc <b>difluoromethane</b> and to quantify the effect on solution viscosity for the first time. The local composition about the solvatochromic probe has been measured as a function of pressure and solute polarity and the Kamlet-Taft polarisability/dipolarity and hydrogen bond donor parameters determined.

The study was conducted near the downgradient end of the ammonium zone, which was characterized by inversely trending vertical gradients of oxygen (270 to 0 mM) and am-monium (19 to 625 mM) {{and appeared to be}} a potentially active zone for nitrification. The tests were conducted by injecting a tracer solution (ambient ground water + added constituents) into selected locations within the gradients using multilevel samplers. After injection, the tracers moved by natural ground water flow and were sampled with time from the injection port. Rates of nitrification were determined from changes in nitrate and nitrite concentration relative to bromide. Initial tests were conducted with 15 N-enriched ammonium; subsequent tests examined the effect of adding ammonium, nitrite, or oxygen above background concentrations and of adding <b>difluoromethane,</b> a nitrification inhibitor.
