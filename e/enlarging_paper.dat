40|$|What {{this thesis}} {{attempts}} to present is a systematic and ordered assembling of different true chemical toners on {{two types of}} black and white <b>enlarging</b> <b>papers</b> with two different developers. It is my hope that this study will be of some use as a reference in what effect it is possible to achieve with different combinations of toners, papers, and developers. Although not all possible combinations have been tried, most color choices are represented and I decided to display the same image repeatedly. A conventional paper developer, Kodak Dektol, as well as a developer of somewhat higher quality with a Glycin base, GAF 130, were used. Each respective thesis has its own enlarged and toned black and white photographic prints. An attempt has been made to try to report results clearly and factually, and to try to keep this paper as visual as possible. All toners are found with their respective formulas and all information necessary to duplicate results is supplied. I felt it was necessary to display the real effect of toners upon modern photographic materials because of their inherent capability to alter a convectional black and white photographic print. This alteration will ultimately affect the response of the viewer through the emotional impact of color. by Micaela Garzoni Rantoul. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

Intervention, includes international artists from the UK, Europe and USA: Cinzia Cremona, Lothar Gotz, Maria Anwanda, Amanda Couch, Shahrem Entekhabi, Laura White, Richard Ducker, Sarah Pucill, Ruben Aubrecht, Christy Johnson, Fiona Macdonald, Paul Carter, Julian Hughes Watts, Aisling Hedgecock, Andy Harper, Phil Coy and Charlie Jeffrey. The exhibition features seventeen separate installations, and explores the relationships between artwork and site, and also the dialogue between the installations themselves. It is designed to open up questions as to where one work ends and another begins, notions of authorship, and the power relationship between artist and curator. Johnson’s work is a site specific photographic installation entitled THIRTEEN MINUS ONE, where twelve 5. 5 ft high x 4 ft wide Lambda prints run continuously extending across two walls. The linear sequence is constructed from her Feast photographic archive and becomes a repetitive procession in the space. Johnson’s selection and use of these commemorative/vernacular images not only dialogue with each other, but with the industrial architectural surroundings and specific artworks: examples include Charlie Jeffrey’s scattered floor debris; Aisling Hedgecock’s hanging polystyrene stalagmites; Shahram Enttekhabi's architectural construction made of red and white 'do not cross' tape; as well as other pieces such as a performance using an <b>enlarged</b> <b>paper</b> dress; and a household clock with a cuckoo...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{reported}} here was to examine whether age and spatial ability are factors that influence a driver's ability to navigate and to use navigational displays. These factors were examined because previous research suggests that spatial ability may underlie navigational performance, including route-following and mapreading, and that these skills may diminish with age. Thus, older drivers and drivers with weak navigational skills, may have a heightened need for, and be particularly served by, in-vehicle route guidance displays found in Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). A total of 56 drivers were tested on spatial ability. The drivers then performed a navigational task in a part-task driving simulator using different navigational aids, including: (1) text directions, (2) an <b>enlarged,</b> mounted <b>paper</b> map, (3) a standard-scale paper map, and (4) a turn-by-turn route guidance ATIS display.

40|$|Abstract As a {{powerful}} sequence labeling model, conditional random fields (CRFs) have had successful applications in many {{natural language processing}} (NLP) tasks. However, the high complexity of CRFs training only allows a very small tag (or label) 1 set, because the training becomes intractable as the tag set <b>enlarges.</b> This <b>paper</b> proposes an improved decomposed training and joint decoding algorithm for CRF learning. Instead of training a single CRF model for all tags, it trains a binary sub-CRF independently for each tag. An optimal tag sequence is then produced by a joint decoding algorithm based on the probabilis-tic output of all sub-CRFs involved. To test its effectiveness, this approach is applied to tackle Chinese word segmentation (CWS) as a sequence labeling problem. Our evaluation shows that it can reduce the computational cost of this language processing task by 40 - 50 % without any significant performance loss on various large-scale data sets...|$|R
5000|$|The {{microfilm}} printer was originally {{developed for the}} Social Security Administration to handle its large volume of microfilm data. In 1959, Stromberg-Carlson introduced the SC4020, a computer-controlled {{microfilm printer}} and plotter, used chiefly for COM (Computer Output Microfilm) applications. The SC4020 utilized a Charactron cathode-ray-tube (CRT) with an internal mask (or stencil) through which the electron beam was deflected to choose an alphanumeric character, and the character-shaped beam was then deflected to a target position on the faceplate of the CRT. A 35 mm or 16 mm shutterless camera, in a lightproof enclosed cabinet along with the CRT, captured the imagery produced on the faceplate. The film was then developed chemically, separate from the SC4020, and could be later <b>enlarged</b> onto <b>paper.</b> The instructions to control the SC4020 were created by a mainframe computer and transferred to the SC4020 on magnetic tape. A “quick-look,” separate from the SC4020, was available using zinc oxide photosensitized paper.|$|R
