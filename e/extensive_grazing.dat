5|$|Southlake Moor {{is another}} SSSI, which forms {{part of an}} <b>extensive</b> <b>grazing</b> marsh and ditch system. When {{conditions}} in the River Parrett are suitable, the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river's floodbank. Some 96species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the greater water-parsnip (Sium latifolium). When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 wigeon (Anas penelope), 250Bewick's swan (Cygnus bewickii) and good numbers of pochard (Aythya ferina), teal (Anas crecca) and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Signs of European otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly seen on the muddy banks of the River Parrett. The ditches {{on the east side}} of the site are populated by palmate newts (Triturus helveticus).|$|E

Slow improvement in the abbeys finances took place over the next forty or so years in a period of relative stability. However this improvement was only relative; Dryburgh's neighbouring monasteries with their much more <b>extensive</b> <b>grazing</b> lands provided the main source of a much greater income.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century saw {{land use}} {{change as the}} {{draining}} {{and development of the}} Taieri Plain eventually led to that area eclipsing the Peninsula's dairying and mixed farms gave way to <b>extensive</b> <b>grazing.</b> The rural population, especially on the Pacific coast, dwindled, leaving abandoned steadings and roads decaying slowly behind macrocarpa and hawthorn plantings. The re-made, Europeanised landscape now took on an air of mellow decay, and started to look 'natural', unusual in a recently colonised country like New Zealand. This attracted the attention of visitors and artists. Colin McCahon, New Zealand's most celebrated painter, first worked out his 'vision' of the New Zealand landscape with studies of the peninsula, the most developed being that of 1946-49 now owned by the city and on display in the central Dunedin Public Library.|$|E

25|$|Stretching inland {{from the}} Aegean coastal plain, the Central Anatolia Region {{occupies}} {{the area between}} the two zones of the folded mountains, extending east {{to the point where}} the two ranges converge. The plateau-like, semi-arid highlands of Anatolia are considered the heartland of the country. The region varies in elevation from 600 to 1,200 meters from west to east. The two largest basins on the plateau are the Konya Ovası and the basin occupied by the large salt lake, Tuz Gölü. Both basins are characterized by inland drainage. Wooded areas are confined to the northwest and northeast of the plateau. Rain-fed cultivation is widespread, with wheat being the principal crop. Irrigated agriculture is restricted to the areas surrounding rivers and wherever sufficient underground water is available. Important irrigated crops include barley, corn, cotton, various fruits, grapes, opium poppies, sugar beets, roses, and tobacco. There also is <b>extensive</b> <b>grazing</b> throughout the plateau.|$|E
25|$|In the Great Plains, {{the prairie}} dog is a {{keystone}} species. Studies comparing species abundances {{in areas of}} colonization against areas with no prairie dog colonization show clear evidence that the prairie dog does {{have a significant impact}} on its surroundings by altering vegetation and therefore affecting habitat and food availability for other species. There is a great mosaic of vegetative diversity within the Great Plains due to the prairie dog’s <b>extensive</b> <b>grazing</b> on long grasses. This mosaic supports a variety of small mammals. In addition to altering vegetation, the prairie dog also creates habitat for many other organisms by creating extensive tunnel systems that other small mammals such as the desert cottontail, striped skunk and deer mouse use for shelter. A strong characteristic of keystone species is their ability to create and modify other organism’s habitats and it is evident that the prairie dog does this. In conclusion, the prairie dog is an iconic animal species North America. Its close link to the ecology and structure of the Great Plains make it the defining keystone species of the ecoregion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} problems of most Irish {{people were in}} part {{the result of the}} small size of their landholdings and a large increase in the population in the years before the famine. [...] In particular, both the law and social tradition provided for subdivision of land, with all sons inheriting equal shares in a farm, meaning that farms became so small that only one crop, potatoes, could be grown in sufficient amounts to feed a family. [...] Furthermore, many estates, from whom the small farmers rented, were poorly run by absentee landlords and in many cases heavily mortgaged. Enclosures of land {{since the start of the}} 19th century had also exacerbated the problem, and the <b>extensive</b> <b>grazing</b> of cattle had contributed to the decrease in size in the plots of land available to tenants to raise their crops.|$|E

2500|$|EUCC {{has a long}} {{record of}} field {{projects}} implementation related to nature conservation, especially in delta, wetlands and dune areas of the Baltic, Black sea and Mediterranean coast. Most projects deal with wetland restoration in former intensive agriculture grounds. In this regard, {{one of the most}} remarkable milestones has been the protection of ca. 4000 ha of coastal meadows, wetlands, forest and lagoon waters at the eastern, Polish part of the Szczecin Lagoon (Oder Delta). Coastal & Marine Union (EUCC) and EUCC Poland have joined efforts along the years to establish the first privately managed Nature Park in Poland, the Odra Delta Nature Park. EUCC Poland is the owner of ca. 1000 ha while the rest belongs to the Forestry and Maritime offices and some small private owners. The area belongs now to the Natura 2000 network. Stakeholders’ engagement, hydrological restoration, reintroduction of <b>extensive</b> <b>grazing,</b> eco-tourism development and educational programmes have resulted on a good practice example of international recognition. A development strategy for the community was drawn up [...] to embrace the opportunities which the Nature values of the area afforded. This has led to the area developing a niche market for eco-tourism with new occupations alongside more traditional ones.|$|E

40|$|Thesis: Behavioural {{patterns}} of heifers under intensive and <b>extensive</b> continuous <b>grazing</b> on species-rich pasture in the Czech Republic Author: doc. Mgr. Pavla Hejcmanová, Ph. D. Abstract The consumption of food {{is one of}} the most fundamental activities in all animals and takes its ultimate part in maximizing an animal's inclusive fitness. Foraging response mechanisms issue essentially from animal intrinsic characteristics, animal's cognitive abilities and environment, namely quantity and quality of available food resources. Understanding of animal's foraging decisions is not possible without the knowledge of other types of behaviour and factors they affect it. Therefore, the aim of the investigation was to evaluate heifers' behavioural pattern on species-rich semi-natural pasture under a continuous intensive (IG) and <b>extensive</b> (EG) <b>grazing</b> regime as this is currently the most extensive management system employed in central Europe. Ten or eight (IG), and six or four (EG) heifers were continuously stocked in two completely randomized blocks from June to late September in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2006 and 2007. Swards were maintained at a target height of 5 and 10 cm, respectively. Grazing, ruminating, resting, and other activities were monitored during 24 -hour observations, and grazing, chewing and ruminating rates [...] ...|$|R
