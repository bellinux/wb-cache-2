5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. <b>His</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} did not {{go unnoticed}} by <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to expel Burnett from Congress. The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{retained}} close {{connections with}} York throughout his life. After Jonathan Martin's arson attack on York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, Etty was {{prominent in the}} effort to restore the building to its original state. One of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> that campaign was Welsh politician Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn, the long-serving Conservative Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire.|$|E
50|$|Poplicola {{was elected}} consul three more times, in 508, 507, and 504 BC. Horatius was <b>his</b> <b>colleague</b> again <b>in</b> 507, while <b>his</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>in</b> 508 and 504 was Titus Lucretius Tricipitinus.|$|R

5|$|Andrew Farke and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> 2014 {{published}} {{a description of}} a new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{returned}} to Harvard after the war, and initiated {{the construction of}} a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E
5|$|Brunel died in 1859, {{without seeing}} the {{completion}} of the bridge. <b>His</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the Institution of Civil Engineers felt that completion of the Bridge would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds. In 1860, Brunel's Hungerford suspension bridge over the Thames in London was demolished {{to make way for a}} new railway bridge to Charing Cross railway station. Its chains were purchased for use at Clifton.|$|E
50|$|Theodorus (floruit 505-523) was a Roman {{politician}} {{during the}} reign of Theodoric the Great. He held the consulship with Flavius Sabinianus as <b>his</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>in</b> 505.|$|R

5|$|Burnett's {{actions were}} deemed treasonable by <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> Congress, {{and he was}} {{expelled}} from the House in 1861. He {{is one of only}} five members of the House of Representatives ever to be expelled. Following his expulsion, Burnett served in the Provisional Confederate Congress and the First and Second Confederate Senates. He was indicted for treason after the war, but never tried. He returned to the practice of law, and died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Ephraim Fabricant {{was named}} for real-life murderer Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor who shot dead four of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> {{what became known as}} the Concordia University massacre. In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to echo the case of Jack the Ripper—both were believed to be medically trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell letter, sent to the police by the Ripper along with one of his victims' kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Until 1998, India did {{not have}} an {{adequate}} facility for diagnosis of genetic disorders, prevalent in the country. The fundamental research carried out by Singh and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> that area, led to conceptualization and establishment of the first DNA based diagnostic laboratory in the country. The lab later evolved into a separate institute, the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics in Hyderabad, India to provide advanced DNA based molecular diagnostics services for the nation.|$|E
50|$|Also in 493, Lartius {{served as}} legate to the consul Cominius, <b>his</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>in</b> 501, at {{the siege of}} Corioli, where Gaius Marcius Coriolanus gained fame through his valor.|$|R

5|$|By the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians and Thracians, mostly primipilares {{and their}} descendants, came to {{dominate}} the army's senior officer echelons. Finally, the Danubian officer-class seized {{control of the state}} itself. In 268, the emperor Gallienus (ruled 260–68) was overthrown by a coup d'état organised by a clique of Danubian senior officers, including his successors Claudius II Gothicus and Aurelian (270–75). They and their successors Probus (276–82) and Diocletian (ruled 284–305) and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the Tetrarchy formed a sort of self-perpetuating military junta of Danubian officers who were born in the same provinces (several in the same city, Sirmium, a major legionary base in Moesia Superior) and/or had served in the same regiments.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, a large {{underground}} {{cold store}} at Smithfield was the theatre of secret experiments led by Dr Max Perutz on pykrete, {{a mixture of}} ice and woodpulp, believed to be possibly tougher than steel. Perutz's work, inspired by Geoffrey Pyke and part of Project Habakkuk, was meant to test the viability of pykrete as a material to construct floating airstrips in the Atlantic to allow refuelling of cargo planes in support of Admiral the Earl Mountbatten's operations. The experiments were carried out by Perutz and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> a refrigerated meat locker in a Smithfield Market butcher's basement, behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses. These experiments became obsolete {{with the development of}} longer range aircraft and the project was then abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{resigned}} {{after the}} Confederate government had fled from Richmond {{at the end}} of the war, and he and several of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated until the very end. He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E
50|$|Demetrios Palaiologos Kantakouzenos (flourished 1420-1453) was the mesazon (chief minister) of the Emperors John VIII Palaiologos and his brother, Constantine XI. <b>His</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>in</b> {{the office}} as mesazon was Loukas Notaras.|$|R

5|$|The rebel {{leaders were}} quickly rounded up. A rebel leader {{by the name}} of Jack Straw was {{captured}} in London and executed. John Ball was caught in Coventry, tried in St Albans, and executed on 15 July. Grindecobbe was also tried and executed in St Albans. John Wrawe was tried in London; he probably gave evidence against 24 of <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the hope of a pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1382. Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown. As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.|$|E
5|$|With his {{increasing}} reputation, local Republicans urged Harrison {{to run for}} Congress. He initially confined {{his political}} activities to {{speaking on behalf of}} other Republican candidates, a task for which he received high praises from <b>his</b> <b>colleagues.</b> <b>In</b> 1872, Harrison campaigned for the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana. Former governor Oliver Morton favored his opponent, Thomas M. Browne, and Harrison lost his bid for statewide office. He returned to his law practice and, despite the Panic of 1873, he was financially successful enough to build a grand new home in Indianapolis in 1874. He continued to make speeches on behalf of Republican candidates and policies.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E
50|$|Flavius Agapitus (floruit 502-523) was a Roman {{politician}} {{during the}} reign of Theodoric the Great. He held the consulship with Flavius Anastasius Paulus Probus Sabinianus Pompeius Anastasius as <b>his</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>in</b> 517.|$|R

5|$|Honório Hermeto {{departed}} for Montevideo, {{the capital of}} Uruguay, on 23 October. He chose José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to assist him. Paranhos was a brilliant {{young man who had}} once been a Liberal Party member and protégé of the disgraced Aureliano Coutinho. This surprising choice was a clear signal from Honório Hermeto to <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>in</b> the cabinet of his independence. On 21 November, Honório Hermeto signed a treaty of alliance with Uruguay and the rebel Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom. As a reward for his role, the Emperor granted Honório Hermeto the title of Visconde de Paraná (Viscount of Paraná) in July 1852. The title was derived from the Paraná River, a tributary of the Río de la Plata, upon which free passage rights for Brazilian shipping was secured after Rosas' downfall.|$|E
