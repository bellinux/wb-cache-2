He {{notes that}} some have a hollow stem, such as deadly {{nightshade}} and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E

25|$|There are {{approximately}} 400 entries for plants and non-botanical items. Of these, 150 plants are English natives. Some plant entries are mugwort, cypress, mandrake root, grapes, chamomile, muscat, and marrubium (<b>horehound).</b> Animals recommended for their medicinal value include hare, fox (fox grease {{is recommended for}} muscle cramps), goat, ox, elephant ivory, and beaver. Some of the minerals and liquids listed are lyme, glass, magnets, pearls, amber, sulpher, water, and vinegar. Foods that double as remedies are also present, with cheese prescribed for purgation, butter, honey, and zipules (a type of heavy fritter) recommended for toothaches. Some of the entries feature truly unusual remedies, such as a lengthy section {{on the use of}} mummy (spelled as mommie), the powdered version of which is described as a remedy for stopping nosebleeds. Besides medical uses, these entries also provide information on cosmetic applications of items, such as the bones of sepia (cuttlefish) for whitening the teeth and complexion.|$|E
25|$|The Braunton Burrows {{core area}} {{consists}} of fixed and mobile sand dune systems with geomorphological and successional processes. There are also variable-flooded slacks, grassland and scrub further inland supporting {{a wide variety}} of flowering and lower plants, birds, and insects. It includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. It is characterised by marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush (Juncus acutus), and willow (Salix) species. On the strandline there is rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). The fore and mid dunes are generally sandy yellow dunes, colonised and stabilised by marram grass. Other notable species include sea stock (Matthiola sinuate), sea stork's-bill (Erodium maritimum), sea clover (Trifolium aquamosum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias), and white <b>horehound</b> (Marrubium vulgare). Further inland, the stable grey dunes are stabilised by other species such as dune fescue (Vulpia membranacea). The dune slacks, the valleys between the dunes, may flood after heavy rain and are wet and marshy during the winter. They support round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush, round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia ssp. maritima), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), and many orchid species. Listed as endangered on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's Vascular Plant Red Data List for Great Britain, the water germander (Teucrium scordium), a perennial plant that lives in the slacks, has just one other population in the UK.|$|E
500|$|Astrologically, Capella portends {{civic and}} {{military}} honors and wealth. In the Middle Ages, {{it was considered}} a Behenian fixed star, with the stone sapphire and the plants <b>horehound,</b> mint, mugwort, and mandrake as attributes. [...] Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign [...] with the name Hircus (Latin for goat).|$|E
500|$|The {{first record}} of a named {{cultigen}} occurs in De Agri Cultura. written about 160 BCE by Roman statesman Cato the Elder (234–149 BCE) in a list that includes 120 kinds (cultivars) of figs, grapes, apples and olives. The names are presented {{in a way that}} implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans. The [...] "cultivar" [...] names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar (the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made). Writers up to the 15th century added little to this early work. In the Middle Ages the book of hours, early herbals, illuminated manuscripts and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens. For example, in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem Hortulus by Walafrid Strabo as growing in the monastery garden of St Gallen in Switzerland: sage, rue, southernwood, wormwood, <b>horehound,</b> fennel, German iris, lovage, chervil, Madonna lily, opium poppy, clary, mint, betony, agrimony, catmint, radish, gallica rose, bottle gourd and melon. It seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of Charlemagne (742–814 CE).|$|E
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white <b>horehound,</b> and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March 1789, James gave {{evidence}} on the theft by 2 fellow convicts of 6 cabbages. The thieves received 50 lashes each. James was then hauled before the magistrate, charged with stealing 'medicines' from the hospital stores where he worked at Port Jackson. These medicines were, in fact, 1 pound of pepper (or paper) and <b>horehound</b> (a herb that imitates the tangy flavour of hops), belonging to Surgeon John White. Though James claimed the stolen <b>horehound</b> was for his pregnant girlfriend, he later revealed at the Bigge inquiry that he began brewing beer on his arrival to Australia, which he sold for 4d per quart. Indeed, James was brewing beer for the personal consumption of Lieutenant Francis Grose and William Paterson over that time. Perhaps that explains Squire's possibly lenient sentence when petty theft was often severely punished. His sentence of 14 November 1789 read: [...] "one hundred and fifty (lashes of the whip) now, and the remainder when able to bear it".|$|E
2500|$|Wild lettuce, {{known as}} chazeret, was a leafy herb with prickly, red tinged leaves that became bitter as they matured. It was {{cultivated}} from around 800 BCE. Sweeter head-lettuce was only developed and {{introduced by the}} Romans. Bitter herbs eaten at the Passover sacrifice with the unleavened bread, matza, were known as merorim. [...] "Chazeret" [...] is listed in the Mishna (Pesahim 2:6) as the preferred bitter herb for this Passover ritual, along with other bitter herbs, including chicory or endive (ulshin), <b>horehound</b> (tamcha), reichardia or eryngo (charchavina) and wormwood (maror).|$|E

In October 2009, Mosshart {{confirmed}} that the second album was [...] "halfway done," [...] and the first single, [...] "Die by the Drop", was released on March 30, 2010. The new album (again on the Third Man Records label) was titled Sea of Cowards and was released on May 7 of that year in Ireland, on May 10 in the United Kingdom, and on May 11 in the U.S.|$|E
60|$|So Mrs. Morel {{bought him}} elixir of vitriol, his {{favourite}} first medicine. And {{he made himself}} a jug of wormwood tea. He had hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs: wormwood, rue, <b>horehound,</b> elder flowers, parsley-purt, marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey Day's {{storehouse}} at {{the back}} of his dwelling was hung with bunches of dried <b>horehound,</b> mint, and sage; brown-paper bags of thyme and lavender; and long ropes of clean onions. On shelves were spread large red and yellow apples, and choice selections of early potatoes for seed next year;--vulgar crowds of commoner kind lying beneath in heaps. A few empty beehives were clustered around a nail in one corner, under which stood two or three barrels of new cider of the first crop, each bubbling and squirting forth from the yet open bunghole.|$|E
60|$|One young New York man, with a bright, {{handsome}} face, {{had been}} lying several months from a most disagreeable wound, receiv'd at Bull Run. A bullet had shot him right through the bladder, hitting him front, low in the belly, and coming out back. He had suffer'd much--the water {{came out of the}} wound, by slow but steady quantities, for many weeks--so that he lay almost constantly in a sort of puddle--and there were other disagreeable circumstances. He was of good heart, however. At present comparatively comfortable, had a bad throat, was delighted with a stick of <b>horehound</b> candy I gave him, with one or two other trifles.|$|E
6000|$|Some of the half-eras'd, and not over-legible when made, memoranda {{of things}} wanted by one patient or another, will convey quite a fair idea. D. S.

L., 145th Pennsylvania, lies in bed 6, with {{jaundice}} and erysipelas; also wounded; stomach easily nauseated; bring him some oranges, {{also a little}} tart jelly; hearty, full-blooded young fellow--(he got better in a few days, and is now home on a furlough.) J. H. G., bed 24, wants an undershirt, drawers, and socks; {{has not had a}} change for quite a while; is evidently a neat, clean boy from New England--(I supplied him; also with a comb, tooth-brush, and some soap and towels; I noticed afterward he was the cleanest of the whole ward.) Mrs. G., lady-nurse, ward F, wants a bottle of brandy--has two patients imperatively requiring stimulus--low with wounds and exhaustion. (I supplied her with a bottle of first-rate brandy from the Christian commission rooms.) ...|$|E
60|$|On {{approaching}} the house I {{saw that there}} had formerly been a large plantation behind it, of which only a few dead stumps now remained, the ditches that had enclosed them being now nearly obliterated. The place was ruinous and overgrown with weeds. Dismounting, I led my horse along a narrow path through a perfect wilderness of wild sunflowers, <b>horehound,</b> red-weed, and thorn-apple, up to some poplar trees where there {{had once been a}} gate, of which only two or three broken posts remained standing in the ground. From the old gate the path ran on, still through weeds, {{to the door of the}} house, which was partly of stone and partly of red brick, with a very steep, sloping, tiled roof. Beside the ruined gate, leaning against a post, with the hot afternoon sun shining on her uncovered head, stood a woman in a rusty-black dress. She was about twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, and had an unutterably weary, desponding expression on her face, which was colourless as marble, except for the purple stains under her large, dark eyes. She did not move when I approached her, but raised her sorrowful eyes to my face, apparently feeling little interest in my arrival.|$|E
60|$|As I write, I have lying {{before me}} a little {{discarded}} note-book, filled with memoranda of things wanted by the sick--special cases. I use up one of these little books in a week. See from this sample, for instance, after walking through a ward or two: Bed 53 wants some liquorice; Bed 6--erysipelas--bring some raspberry vinegar to make a cooling drink, with water; Bed 18 wants a good book--a romance; Bed 25--a manly, friendly young fellow, H. D. B., of the Twenty-seventh Connecticut, an independent young soul--refuses money and eatables, so I will bring him a pipe and tobacco, for I see he much enjoys a smoke; Bed 45--sore throat and cough--wants <b>horehound</b> candy; Bed 11, when I come again, don't forget {{to write a letter}} for him; etc. The wants are a long and varied list: some need to be humored and forgotten, others need to be especially remembered and obeyed. One poor German, dying--in the last stage of consumption--wished me to find him, in Washington, a German Lutheran clergyman, and send him to him; I did so. One patient will want nothing but a toothpick, another a comb, and so on. All whims are represented, and all the States. There are many New York State soldiers here; also Pennsylvanians. I find, of course, many from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and all the New England States, and from the Western and Northwestern States. Five sixths of the soldiers are young men.|$|E
60|$|Thus, too, the tree-clumps on the pampas {{were mostly}} {{remains of a}} {{vanished}} past. To these clumps or plantations we shall return later on when I come to describe the home life {{of some of our}} nearest neighbours; here the houses only, with or without trees growing about them, need be mentioned as parts of the landscape. The houses were always low and scarcely visible at a distance of a mile and a half: one always had to stoop on entering a door. They were built of burnt or unburnt brick, more often clay and brushwood, and thatched with sedges or bulrushes. At some of the better houses there would be a small garden, a few yards of soil protected in some way from the poultry and animals, in which a few flowers and herbs were grown, especially parsley, rue, sage, tansy, and <b>horehound.</b> But there was no other cultivation attempted, and no vegetables were eaten except onions and garlic, which were bought at the stores, with bread, rice, mate tea, oil, vinegar, raisins, cinnamon, pepper, cummin seed, and whatever else they could afford to season their meat-pies or give a flavour to the monotonous diet of cow's flesh and mutton and pig. Almost the only game eaten was ostrich, armadillo, and tinamou (the partridge of the country), which the boys could catch by snaring or running them down. Wild duck, plover, and such birds they rarely or never tasted, as they could not shoot; and as to the big rodent, the vizcacha, which swarmed everywhere, no gaucho would touch its flesh, although to my taste it was better than rabbit.|$|E
