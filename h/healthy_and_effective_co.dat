40|$|Depleted gas {{reservoirs}} {{are potential}} sites for CO 2 storage; therefore, {{it is important}} to evaluate their storage capacity. Historically, there have been difficulties in identifying the reservoir drive mechanism of gas reservoirs using traditional P/z plots, having direct impacts for the estimation of the original gas in place (OGIP) and dependent parameters for both theoretical <b>and</b> <b>effective</b> <b>CO</b> 2 storage capacity estimation. Cole plots have previously provided an alternative method of characterization, being derived from the gas material balance equation. We use production data to evaluate the reservoir drive mechanism in four depleted gas reservoirs (Hewett Lower Bunter, Hewett Upper Bunter, and North and South Morecambe) on the UK Continental Shelf. Cole plots suggest that the North Morecambe and Hewett Upper Bunter reservoirs experience moderate water drive. Accounting for cumulative water influx into these reservoirs, the OGIP decreases by up to 20 % compared with estimates from P/z plots. The revised OGIP values increase recovery factors within these reservoirs; hence, geometrically based theoretical storage capacity estimates for the North Morecambe and Hewett Upper Bunter reservoirs increase by 4 and 30 %, respectively. Material balance approaches yield more conservative estimates. Effective storage capacity estimates are between 64 and 86 % of theoretical estimates within the depletion drive reservoirs, and are 53 [*]–[*] 79 % within the water drive reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the {{variability}} of theoretical <b>and</b> <b>effective</b> <b>CO</b> 2 storage capacity estimation within depleted gas reservoirs {{is dependent on the}} integrated analysis of reservoir structure, aquifer performance and thermodynamic behaviour. Four published theoretical CO 2 storage capacity methods <b>and</b> one <b>effective</b> method have been used to estimate the capacity and variability of two Triassic depletion drive reservoirs and two Triassic water drive reservoirs located within the UK Southern North Sea and East Irish Sea Basin. Input parameters to the storage capacity equations have shown a degree of natural variability whereas others are more accurately constrained. As such, {{attempts have been made to}} more accurately constrain the most variable input parameters. The geometric, petrophysical and production characteristics of the reservoirs are analysed. Material balance methods are used to assess the reservoir drive mechanism of the reservoirs. If reservoirs are found to experience a water drive, the aquifer strength is estimated. The gas compressibility factor, gas formation volume factor and CO 2 density is estimated under initial reservoir temperature conditions using six equations of state for comparison of results. These results are then input to storage capacity equations producing a range of estimates. The most susceptible parameter to variability was the cumulative volume of water influx to a reservoir, We. Variability was also found to be the result of error in estimation of the original gas in place. As such, the water drive reservoirs made further use of aquifer modelling to achieve more precise estimates of OGIP <b>and</b> We. The <b>effective</b> capacity coefficients for the various reservoirs have been estimated to assess the proportion of pore space available for CO 2 storage. The <b>effective</b> <b>CO</b> 2 storage capacity constitutes a fraction of the theoretical CO 2 storage capacity which ranges between 0 (no storage possible) and 1 (all theoretically accessible pore volume is occupied by CO 2). Overall, it was found that depletion drive reservoirs have the potential to store greater volumes of CO 2 than water drive reservoirs whose aquifer waters occupy the newly liberated pore space. ...|$|R

In order to assist athletes to attain their performance goals, <b>and</b> ensure <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> sustained involvement, long-term athlete development (LTAD) models have been devised and adapted by professional sporting bodies throughout the world. LTAD models emphasize the intellectual, emotional, and social development of the athlete, encourage long-term participation in physical activities, and enable participants to improve their overall health and well-being and increase their life-long participation in physical activity. At present there is no such long-term development model for musicians. Yet musicians must cope with a multitude of career-related physical and mental demands, and performance-related injuries and career burnout are rife within the profession.

Goal of the training was to foster coping self-efficacy and self determination to persist when confronted with the stressful conditions of the basic training. A more long-term goal was to enhance psychological resilience among Navy personnel as a form of prevention of PTSD or stress-related problems. This resilience training in basic training was considered a starting point of a continuous effort to foster resilience of service members throughout their careers.
