As the interbank payments involved in an IPO can be hundreds of {{times larger than the}} Aggregate Balance, increased funding needs and heightened demand for <b>interbank</b> <b>liquidity</b> may drive interbank interest rates up. Empirical estimates from error-correction models and GARCH models for HIBORs show that funding needs on the closing date of an IPO increase the level and conditional volatility of the overnight and one-week HIBORs (but not those of the one-month and longer-term HIBORs). On the other hand, estimated models for HIBORs with different maturities do not detect any statistically significant effect of the IPO variable on the refund date of an IPO.

Our empirical analysis uses a unique data set of 135 main refinancing operation auctions conducted at the ECB between June 2005 and December 2007. We find that our proxies for funding liquidity risk are typically stable and low, with occasional spikes, especially during the recent turmoil. We are also able to document downward spirals between funding liquidity risk and market liquidity.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of the <b>interbank</b> market <b>liquidity</b> and interest rates in the Czech interbank market with special focus on the period of global crisis. We analyze determinants of the interbank interest rates and their development with respect to the key monetary policy rate. We explain the significant departure of the interbank interest rates from the key monetary policy rate (impairment of monetary policy transmission) during the global crisis by an increase in risk premia on interbank lending. The source of the risk premia is decomposed into the individual components such as liquidity risk, counterparty risk, foreign influence and other factors. Their contribution to the overall risk premia over time during the global crisis is analyzed. We find that the liquidity risk was the key determinant of tensions in the Czech interbank market in the beginning of the global crisis. However, its influence weakened over time while the role of counterparty risk increased.

40|$|We {{argue that}} there is a {{connection}} between the <b>interbank</b> market for <b>liquidity</b> and the broader financial markets, which has its basis in demand for liquidity by banks. Tightness in the <b>interbank</b> market for <b>liquidity</b> leads banks to engage in what we term “liquidity pull-back”, e. g., selling assets in order to generate liquidity for themselves. By definition, trade in a highly liquid asset involves lower price impact, or transaction costs, on average than an equivalent trade in a less liquid asset. The implication, and our central hypothesis, is thus that increased tightness in the <b>interbank</b> market for <b>liquidity</b> is associated with an increase in the volume of more liquid assets relative to that of less liquid assets. Prices should also fall across the board, but not differentially so across assets with different “liquidity levels. ” We confirm these hypotheses on the CRSP universe of stocks using the three month Libor-OIS and TED spreads as measures of tightness in the interbank market. – All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full: unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

40|$|We {{argue that}} there is a {{connection}} between the <b>interbank</b> market for <b>liquidity</b> and the broader financial markets, which has its basis in demand for liquidity by banks. Tightness in the <b>interbank</b> market for <b>liquidity</b> leads banks to engage in what we term "liquidity pull-back," which involves selling financial assets either by banks directly or by levered investors. Empirical tests support this hypothesis. While our data covers part of the recent crisis period, our results are not driven by the crisis. Our general point is that money matters in financial markets. Different financial assets have different degrees of moneyness (liquidity) and, as a result, there are systematic cross-sectional variations in trading activity as the price of liquidity, or the level of tightness, in the interbank market fluctuates. interbank and financial markets; liquidity; liquidity pull-back; money...|$|R

For identification we exploit an idiosyncratic, sudden shock {{caused by}} a large-bank failure in conjunction with detailed data on interbank exposures. First, we find robust evidence that higher interbank exposure to the failed bank leads to large deposit withdrawals. Second, the magnitude of contagion is higher for banks with weaker fundamentals. Third, interbank linkages among surviving banks further propagate the shock. Finally, we find results suggesting that there are real economic effects. These results suggest that interbank linkages act as an important channel of contagion and hold important policy implications.

40|$|The classic {{relationship}} between deposit rates and {{interest rate derivatives}} has been fractured since August 2007. Uncertainty in the interbank money market has increased the risk premia differentials on unsecured deposits rates of different tenors, such as Euribor, leading to a new pricing framework of interest rate derivatives based on multiple curves.

We employ basis swap (BS) spreads &-floating-to-floating interest rate swaps- as instruments for extracting the interest rate curvedifferentials. Our {{results show that the}} multi-curve framework mirrors the standard single-curve setting in terms of level, slope and curvature factors. The level factor captures 90 % of the total variation in the curves, and this factor significantly covaries with a proxy for systemic risk.

In our set up, the results depend upon the existence of moral hazard.

These enforcement problems generate endogenous aggregate uncertainty as investment allocations depend upon the joint distribution of shocks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how {{agent-based}} simulations of payment systems can be used to aid central bankers and payment system operators in thinking about the appropriate design of payment settlement systems to minimise risk and increase their efficiency. Banks, which we model as the �agents�, are capable of a degree of autonomy with which to respond to payment system rules and adopt a strategy that determines how much collateral to post with the central bank at the start of the day (equivalently how much liquidity to borrow intraday from the central bank) and when to send payment orders to the central processor. An interbank payment system with costly liquidity requires banks to solve an intraday cash management problem, minimising their liquidity and delay costs subject to their beliefs about what the other banks are doing. Some preliminary results are given on how banks learn to endogenously determine how much liquidity to post in the <b>interbank</b> <b>liquidity</b> management game. ...|$|E

We find that (i) relationship lenders are more likely to provide liquidity to their closest borrowers, (ii) particularly opaque borrowers obtain liquidity at lower rates when borrowing from their relationship lenders, and (iii) during the crisis, relationship lenders provided cheaper loans to their closest borrowers. Our results hold after controlling for search frictions as well as a large set of (time-varying) bank and bank-pair control variables and fixed effects.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis it has become clear {{that there is a need}} for macroprudential oversight in addition to the existing microprudential banking supervision. One of the lessons from the crisis is that the network structure of the banking system has to be taken into account to assess systemic risk. There exists, however, no analysis on the influence of the network topology on contagion in financial networks. This paper therefore compares contagion in Barab 1 si-Albert (scale-free) with Watts-Strogatz (small-world) and random networks. A network model of banks, a firm- and household-sector as well as a central bank is used. Banks optimize a portfolio of risky investments and risk-free excess reserves according to their risk and liquidity preferences. They form a network via interbank loans and face a stochastic supply of household deposits. Contagion effects from the default of a large bank are studied in different network topologies. The results indicate that contagion is more severe in random and scale-free networks than in small-world networks. This situation changes when the central bank is not active in which case small-world networks are less stable than scale-free and random networks. It is also shown that <b>interbank</b> <b>liquidity</b> above a certain threshold leads to endogenous instability, regardless of the network topology.

We develop a model with credit and liquidity frictions in the interbank market consistent with the empirical results.

Moreover, the intraday fed funds rate can spike above the discount rate and crash to near zero.

40|$|In {{the years}} before the global {{financial}} crisis of 2008 [...] 2010, Qatar experienced a huge build-up of liquidity surplus in the banking system, mainly driven by surging net capital inflows. This paper identifies various sources of <b>interbank</b> <b>liquidity</b> in Qatar and discusses the various implications of structural primary liquidity surplus for the money market in particular and the economy at large. The paper attempts to evaluate the Qatar Central Bank policy making and conduct during the pre- and post-crisis periods within a framework of the Austrian monetary overinvestment theories, and concludes that the central bank had forcibly committed several forced monetary policy mistakes, {{which resulted in a}} breakdown in the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. This led to the inability of the central bank to control the interbank interest rate and to an accelerating inflation rate during the pre-crisis years. In contrast, a dramatic change in the central bank's monetary policy framework and a deliberate monetary policy mistake on behalf of the central bank resulted in a restoration of the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, stabilization of the interbank interest rate close to the central bank's policy rate and a sharp deceleration in the inflation rate in the post-crisis period.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers analysing time-varying cross-border correlation and spillover risk. Existing literature has devoted significant resources to quantify {{these two types of}} risk within a variety of markets and asset classes. The implications of these studies have great importance in policy making, securities trading and in commercial banking activities. In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis dynamic risk related topics have gained a renewed interest. This thesis aims to bridge gaps in the currently available research. "Dynamic Stock Market Covariances in the Eurozone" is a joint work with Professor Gregory Connor. This paper examines the short-term dynamics, macroeconomic sensitivities, and longer-term trends in the variances and covariances of national equity market index daily returns for eleven countries in the Euro currency zone. We modify Colacito, Engle and Ghysel’s Mixed Data Sampling Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (MIDAS-DCC GARCH) model to include a new scalar measure for the degree of correlatedness in time-varying correlation matrices. We also explore the robustness of the findings with a less model-dependent realized covariance estimator. We find a secular trend toward higher correlation during our sample period, and significant linkages between macroeconomic and market-wide variables and dynamic correlation. One notable finding is that average correlation between these markets is lower when their average GDP growth rate is lower or when more of them have negative GDP growth. "Correlation Dynamics in the G 7 Stock Markets" explores the changing magnitude of synchronised equity index return correlations within the G 7 stock markets in response to dynamic variation in the economic environment and secular trends toward greater capital market integration. The full sample period is split into "pre-crisis" and "crisis" periods. The empirical results show that the G 7 markets exhibit a significant positive trend toward higher cross-border correlations over the full sample period and that there is significant time-series autocorrelation in the magnitude of cross-market return correlations. These findings are consistent for both periods. Correlation magnitude seems to behave differently during the "pre-crisis” and “crisis” periods in relation to the business-cycle-related effect and the turbulence of the financial markets. During the "crisis" period the average correlation between these financial markets is lower during quarters when more of them have negative GDP growth or when their average GDP growth is lower. The reverse holds for the "pre-crisis" period. Also, the positive relationship between the correlation magnitude and stock market variance is only present in the “crisis” period. We argue that during the crises periods, financial markets are strongly influenced by local factors. "Directional Spillovers in Banks’ Credit Default Risk and Related Variables" analyses the total and directional spillovers across carefully selected variables directly related to the credit risk of financial institutions: bank CDS spread, real estate market index, interest rate term spread, <b>interbank</b> <b>liquidity</b> spread and national stock market index, using daily data from 1 st of January 2004 to 31 st of December 2012. The spillover analysis is undertaken within five European Union countries: core countries France and Germany, periphery countries Spain and Italy, and a reference country, the UK. A multiple structural break estimation procedure is employed to detect sudden changes in shock transmission. The directional spillover framework reveals complex dynamics between the CDS spreads and credit risk related variables. The national stock markets show a clear leading role in shock transmission across selected variables; whereas the role of other variables in sample is reversed {{during the course of the}} crisis. The real estate index is found to be mostly affected by country specific events; and the shock transmission of the interest rate term spread and the <b>interbank</b> <b>liquidity</b> spread differs for the UK and the Eurozone countries...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{subprime}} {{mortgage-backed securities}} market has attracted intense attention {{during and after}} the widespread financial turmoil of 2007 - 2009. Most commentators have reached a consensus that an underestimation of the risks associated with these products led to problems for the entire financial system. Therefore, this thesis seeks to provide a better understanding of these complex financial instruments and their role in the propagation of the crisis. We focus on three main issues. The first issue (Chapter 3) analyses the risk factors underlying this market. The goal is to identify key variables that may potentially explain its decline. Measures of the U. S. real estate market, <b>interbank</b> <b>liquidity</b> and counterparty risk, as well as market volatility are all found to play a role. Furthermore, we find that the importance of these risk factors changed as the crisis evolved from a real estate problem to a broader global credit crisis. The second issue (Chapter 4) concerns identifying interdependencies and contagion within this market during the crisis. We adapt the vector autoregressive (VAR) framework of Longstaff (2010) to estimate the intra-market relationships using a spliced ABX dataset and two traded ABX vintages. We find contagious effects during the subprime crisis, emanating mainly from shocks to the higher-rated assets. Finally, the third issue (Chapters 5 & 6) examines contagion from the subprime mortgage-backed securities market to several other asset markets using both the original and an extended version of Longstaff 2 ̆ 7 s (2010) VAR framework. Using the original specifcation, evidence of contagion is found but we uncover important differences between the choice of index used to proxy for the subprime mortgage-backed securities market. Furthermore, employing a more innovative econometric tool, namely a timevarying transition probability Markov-switching VAR, shows that although contagion played a role in transmitting the shock to other markets, {{it may not have been}} as prevalent as suggested by the original VAR framework. We conclude that accurately dating the crisis is crucial to the analysis...|$|E
