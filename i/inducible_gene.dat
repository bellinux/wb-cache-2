25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that AM fungi release an unidentified diffusional factor, known as the myc factor, which activates the nodulation factor's <b>inducible</b> <b>gene</b> MtEnod11. This is the same gene involved in establishing symbiosis with the nitrogen fixing, rhizobial bacteria (Kosuta et al. 2003). When rhizobium bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie et al. 2003). Molecules similar to Nod factors were isolated from AM fungi and were shown to induce MtEnod11, lateral root formation and enhance mycorrhization. Effective mycorrhizal colonization can also increase the nodulations and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mycorrhizal legumes.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> in yeast {{been shown}} to re-locate to the nuclear {{periphery}} by binding NPCs composed of specific Nups. Several of these <b>inducible</b> <b>genes,</b> including GAL1, INO1, TSA2, and HSP104 contain gene recruitment sequences (GRSs) found in the promoter, which are necessary for the attachment of the gene to the NPC by way of DNA binding to specific Nups. This initial relocation of genes containing GRSs requires the action of Snf1-p dependent Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA), a chromatin remodeling complex, {{as well as several}} mRNA export proteins, for their transcriptional activation at the nuclear periphery.|$|R
40|$|In insects, {{juvenile}} hormone (JH) and 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) regulate larval growth and molting. However, {{little is known}} about how this cooperative control is terminating larval diapause especially in the bamboo borer, Omphisa fuscidentalis. In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we here measured the expression levels of genes which were affected by {{juvenile hormone}} analogue (JHA: S-methoprene) and 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) in diapausing O. fuscidentalis larvae. Corresponding mRNA expression changes in the subesophageal ganglion (SG) and prothoracic gland (PG) were evaluated using qRT-PCR. The data showed similar response patterns of JH receptor gene (OfMet), diapause hormone gene (OfDH-PBAN), ecdysone receptor genes (OfEcR-A and OfEcR-B 1) and ecdysone <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> (OfBr-C, OfE 75 A, OfE 75 B, OfE 75 C and OfHR 3). JHA induced the expressions of OfMet and OfDH-PBAN in both SG and PG, whereas ecdysone receptor <b>genes</b> and ecdysone <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> were induced by JHA only in PG. For 20 E treatment group, expressions of ecdysone receptor <b>genes</b> and ecdysone <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> in both SG and PG were increased by 20 E injection. In addition, the in vitro experiments showed that OfMet and OfDH-PBAN were up-regulated by JHA alone, but ecdysone receptor <b>genes</b> and ecdysone <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> were up-regulated by JHA and 20 E. However, OfMet and OfDH-PBAN in the SG was expressed faster than OfMet and OfDH-PBAN in the PG and the expression of ecdysone receptor <b>genes</b> and ecdysone <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> induced by JHA was much later than observed for 20 E. These results indicate that JHA might stimulate the PG indirectly via factors (OfMet and OfDH-PBAN) in the SG, which might be a regulatory mechanism for larval diapause termination in O. fuscidentalis...|$|R

40|$|Photosynthetic {{acclimation}} to CO 2 -limiting {{stress is}} associated with control of genetic and physiological responses through a signal transduction pathway, followed by integrated monitoring of the environmental changes. Although several CO 2 -responsive genes have been previously isolated, genome-wide analysis has not been applied to the isolation of CO 2 -responsive genes that may function {{as part of a}} carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) in photosynthetic eukaryotes. By comparing expression profiles of cells grown under CO 2 -rich conditions with those of cells grown under CO 2 -limiting conditions using a cDNA membrane array containing 10, 368 expressed sequence tags, 51 low-CO 2 <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> and 32 genes repressed by low CO 2 whose mRNA levels were changed more than 2. 5 -fold in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Dangeard were detected. The fact that the induction of almost all low-CO 2 <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> was impaired in the ccm 1 mutant suggests that CCM 1 is a master regulator of CCM through putative low-CO 2 signal transduction pathways. Among low-CO 2 <b>inducible</b> <b>genes,</b> two novel genes, LciA and LciB, were identified, which may be involved in inorganic carbon transport.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{exists for}} a role for {{oestrogen}} in gastric cancer. The incidence of gastric cancer is much higher in men than in woman, and a similar sex difference is also seen in a rat experimental model of gastric cancer. AIMS: Evidence for a functional oestrogen receptor in normal gastric mucosa and cancer has been sought. METHODS: Oestrogen receptor and the oestrogen <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> pS 2 and ERD 5 were sought by northern blot analysis and in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. Oestrogen receptor protein was studied by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: mRNA for oestrogen receptor was detected in cancer and normal gastric mucosa. Enzyme immunoassay for oestrogen receptor showed a mean of 1. 8 fmol/mg protein in cancer and 13. 7 fmol/mg in paired normal mucosa. The oestrogen <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> pS 2 and ERD 5 were also detected in both cancer and normal mucosa, with expression localised to epithelium. Expression of pS 2 was lower in cancer compared with normal mucosa, whereas ERD 5 expression was higher in cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Significant amounts of oestrogen receptor were expressed in gastric mucosa with a lower amount in cancer. Oestrogen <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> were also expressed differentially but were not found to correlate closely with oestrogen receptor. Oestrogen receptor functionality remains to be demonstrated in the stomach...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of mature T {{cells in the}} thymus involves changes in the regulation of numerous genes.

One set of genes whose expression is initiated in the thymus encodes the T-cell receptor chains. Although surface T-cell receptor expression is a prerequisite for mature responsiveness, it is not sufficient. Mature T cells must also be able to induce the expression of various batteries of unlinked genes in response to antigenic stimulation. These <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> include interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and interferon-γ in some cells, interleukins- 4 and - 5 in others, perforins in still others, and the IL- 2 receptor 55 kd chain, which must explain changes in the regulation of both constitutively expressed and <b>inducible</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R

When rhizobium bacteria are present in the soil, mycorrhizal colonization is increased due to an increase in the concentration of chemical signals involved in the establishment of symbiosis (Xie et al. 2003).

40|$|Epithelial to mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) is a {{key event}} in cancer progression {{and the process of}} metastasis that creates a reservoir for cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is associated with highly aggressive traits. CSCs {{play a vital role in}} metastasis, therapeutic resistance and relapse in breast cancer patients. Protein Kinase C theta (PKC-­θ) is signal transduction kinase that has been implicated in inflammatory disorders, tumor progression, and metastasis has been recently linked to aggressive breast cancer. Rao lab has previously shown that PKC-­θ can directly translocate to nucleus to regulate <b>inducible</b> immune responsive <b>gene</b> transcription and micro-­RNAs that essential for effective immune response in T cells. Hence, it will be a crucial step to unravel the molecular role of PKC-­θ in EMT and CSCs formation process. Using cancer biological and epigenetics analysis, we have shown that PKC-­θ promotes EMT by directly tethering chromatin for mediating <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> via transforming growth factor beta (TGF-­β) and the key inflammatory regulatory protein NF-­kappa B. Chromatinized PKC-­θ acts as an essential active transcription complex for establishing permissive chromatin state at signature EMT genes. Genome-­wide analysis identifies a unique cohort of EMT <b>inducible</b> <b>genes</b> that are directly tethered to PKC-­θ.
