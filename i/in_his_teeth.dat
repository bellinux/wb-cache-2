25|$|R. A. Koestler-Grack reports that, on March 19, 1884, she {{was being}} watched by Chief Sitting Bull when:Oakley playfully skipped on stage, lifted her rifle, and aimed the barrel at a burning candle. In one shot, she snuffed out the flame with a {{whizzing}} bullet. Sitting Bull watched her knock corks off of bottles and slice through a cigar Butler held <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
25|$|Monday came, all was well. Tuesday came, he not sick.

Being {{in the middle of the}} Thames, he presently fell down, only saying, 'An impost, an impost,' and so died. A most sad storm of wind immediately following.|$|E

500|$|The next day, Mulder visits Barry in the hospital. Agent Kazdin appears, {{revealing}} that metal implants {{were found in}} Barry's body and that tiny holes were found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{in the same manner}} he had described. Mulder gives one of the implants to Scully, who has it reviewed by a ballistics expert; they find a microscopic barcode imprinted on it. Later, at a supermarket, Scully swipes the implant across a checkout scanner, causing the machine to malfunction while displaying a strange serial number. At her house, Scully leaves a message on Mulder's voicemail, suggesting that Barry had been [...] "catalogued" [...] by the implant. But just then, Barry—having just escaped from the hospital—breaks in through Scully's window and kidnaps her.|$|E
500|$|Cannons {{were fired}} and church bells rung {{throughout}} the North at the news. The Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Chicago reeled mad with joy." [...] The capture of Forts Henry and Donelson {{were the first}} significant Union victories in the war and opened two great rivers to invasion in the heartland of the South. Grant was promoted to major general of volunteers, second in seniority only to Henry W. Halleck in the West. After newspapers reported that Grant had won the battle with a cigar clamped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> he was inundated with cigars sent from his many admirers. (Grant would eventually die of throat cancer, likely brought on by his heavy smoking.) Close {{to a third of}} all Albert Sidney Johnston's forces were prisoners. Grant had captured more soldiers than all previous American generals combined, and Johnston was thereby deprived of more than twelve thousand soldiers who would otherwise have provided a decisive advantage at the impending Battle of Shiloh in less than two months time. The rest of Johnston's forces were 200 miles (320km) apart, between Nashville and Columbus, with Grant's army between them. Grant's forces also controlled nearby rivers and railroads. General Buell's army threatened Nashville, while John Pope's troops threatened Columbus. Johnston evacuated Nashville on February 23, surrendering this important industrial center to the Union and making it the first Confederate state capital to fall. Columbus was evacuated on March 2. Most of Tennessee fell under Union control, as did all of Kentucky, although both were subject to invasion and periodic Confederate raiding.|$|E

2500|$|Long-time Tampa Tribune {{cartoonist}} and Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla member Lamar Sparkman {{designed the}} first team logo. Faced {{with the challenge of}} designing a logo that did not closely resemble that of the other [...] "pirates" [...] in the league, the Oakland Raiders, Sparkman came up with a moustached pirate donning a plumed slouch hat, with a large hoop earring, clutching a dagger <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> The pirate appeared to be winking. For a very brief time he was referred to as [...] "Morgan," [...] and coach John McKay called him [...] "Errol Flynn." [...] Local St. Petersburg Times sportswriter Hubert Mizell coined the somewhat belittling nickname [...] "Bucco Bruce" [...] in a February 1976 column, noting almost immediately the mascot's unintimidating and [...] "cavalier" [...] appearance. The nickname stuck, while the logo and the name [...] "Bucco Bruce" [...] became symbols and reminders of the club's ongoing futility. Sports writer and commentator Nick Bakay once said that Bucco Bruce was a pirate who [...] "struck fear in the hearts of no one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reliefs {{from the}} wall of the temple of Soleb in Nubia and scenes from the Theban tomb of Kheruef, Steward of the King's Great Wife, Tiye, depict Amenhotep as a visibly weak and sick figure. Scientists believe that in his final years he {{suffered}} from arthritis and became obese. It has generally been assumed by some scholars that Amenhotep requested and received from his father-in-law Tushratta of Mitanni, a statue of Ishtar of Nineveh—a healing goddess—in order to cure him of his various ailments which included painful abscesses <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> A forensic examination of his mummy shows that he was probably in constant pain during his final years due to his worn, and cavity-pitted teeth. However, more recent analysis of Amarna letter EA 23 by William L. Moran, which recounts the dispatch of the statue of the goddess to Thebes, does not support this popular theory. The arrival of the statue is known to have coincided with Amenhotep III's marriage with Tadukhepa, Tushratta's daughter, in the pharaoh's 36th year; letter EA 23's arrival in Egypt is dated to [...] "regnal year 36, the fourth month of winter, day 1" [...] of his reign. Furthermore, Tushratta never mentions in EA 23 that the statue's dispatch was meant to heal Amenhotep of his maladies. Instead, Tushratta merely writes, ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, the London Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} challenged Houdini {{to escape}} from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinée performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his [...] "ghost house" [...] (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage {{and gave him a}} kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due {{to the size of the}} 6-inch key Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.|$|E
