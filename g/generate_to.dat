25|$|In {{the view}} of Jaynes (1957), {{thermodynamic}} entropy, as explained by statistical mechanics, {{should be seen as}} an application of Shannon's information theory: the thermodynamic entropy is interpreted as being proportional to the amount of further Shannon information needed to define the detailed microscopic state of the system, that remains uncommunicated by a description solely in terms of the macroscopic variables of classical thermodynamics, with the constant of proportionality being just the Boltzmann constant. For example, adding heat to a system increases its thermodynamic entropy because it increases the number of possible microscopic states of the system that are consistent with the measurable values of its macroscopic variables, thus making any complete state description longer. (See article: maximum entropy thermodynamics). Maxwell's demon can (hypothetically) reduce the thermodynamic entropy of a system by using information about the states of individual molecules; but, as Landauer (from 1961) and co-workers have shown, to function the demon himself must increase thermodynamic entropy in the process, by at least the amount of Shannon information he proposes to first acquire and store; and so the total thermodynamic entropy does not decrease (which resolves the paradox). Landauer's principle imposes a lower bound on the amount of heat a computer must <b>generate</b> <b>to</b> process a given amount of information, though modern computers are far less efficient.|$|E

500|$|Colt {{knew he had}} to {{make his}} revolvers affordable, as the death of many great inventions was a high retail price. Colt fixed his prices at a level below his {{competition}} to maximize sales volume. From his experience in haggling with government officials, he knew what numbers he would have to <b>generate</b> <b>to</b> make enough profit to invest money in improving his machinery, thereby limiting imitators' ability to produce a comparable weapon at a lower price. Although successful at this, for the most part, his preoccupation with marketing strategies and patent protection caused him to miss a great opportunity in firearms development when he dismissed an idea from one of his gunsmiths, Rollin White. White had an idea of a [...] "bored-through" [...] revolver cylinder to allow the use of metallic cartridges in a handgun. After Colt fired White for suggesting an improvement to his revolver, White took his idea to Colt's competitor, Smith & Wesson, who patented his invention and kept Colt from being able to build cartridge firearms for almost 20 years.|$|E

[...] This includes hypertension, which increases the pressure that the left ventricle has to <b>generate</b> <b>to</b> open the aortic valve during ventricular systole, and coronary artery disease which increases the stiffness of the left ventricle, thereby increasing the filling pressure of the left ventricle during ventricular diastole. [...] The left-to-right shunt increases the filling pressure of the right heart (preload) and forces the right ventricle to pump out more blood than the left ventricle. [...] This constant overloading of {{the right side of}} the heart causes an overload of the entire pulmonary vasculature. [...] Eventually, pulmonary hypertension may develop.|$|E

2500|$|The Allen and Eggers discovery, {{initially}} {{treated as}} a military secret, was eventually published in 1958. Blunt body theory made possible the heat shield designs that were embodied in the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Soyuz space capsules, enabling astronauts and cosmonauts to survive the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Some spaceplanes such as the Space Shuttle made use of the same theory. At the time the STS was being conceived, Maxime Faget, the Director of Engineering and Development at the Manned Spacecraft Center, was {{not satisfied with the}} purely lifting re-entry method (as proposed for the cancelled X-20 [...] "Dyna-Soar"). He designed a space shuttle which operated as a blunt body by entering the atmosphere at an extremely high angle of attack of 40Â° with the underside facing the direction of flight, creating a large shock wave that would deflect most of the heat around the vehicle instead of into it. The Space Shuttle essentially uses a combination of a ballistic entry (Blunt body theory) and then at an altitude of about , the re-entry interface takes place. Here the atmosphere is dense enough for the Space Shuttle to begin its lifting re-entry by reducing the angle-of-attack, pointing the nose down and using the lift its wings <b>generate</b> <b>to</b> [...] "start flying" [...] (gliding) towards the landing site.|$|E
2500|$|Particularly massive {{sperm whale}} {{specimens}} have also proven willing (on rare occasions) to attack comparably sized whaleships. In {{the most famous}} example, on November 20, 1820 a huge bull sperm whale (purportedly 85-ft in length) rammed the 87-ft Nantucket whaler Essex twice, staving in the hull under the waterline and forcing the crew to abandon ship. After months adrift in lifeboats, the crew eventually resorted to cannibalism, with only 8 out of the 20 sailors surviving until rescue; a 21st sailor had jumped ship in South America before the attack. The bull was unwounded and unprovoked {{at the time of}} the attack, but the crew of the Essex was in the process of hunting several smaller females from a nearby pod. Recent analysis suggests that the commotion and the bull's possible extreme size may have caused it to falsely identify the similarly-sized Essex as an intruding competitive male. Bull sperm whales, especially older, solitary bulls, are known to battle amongst themselves for dominance by ramming each other, with the heavy, spermaceti-filled head spaces providing the biological equivalent of a weighted boxing glove. Another proposed factor was the vibrations from repeated sledgehammer blows as the ship's hull was being repaired prior to the attack, which scientists suggest might have carried into the water and unintentionally mimicked the echolocation [...] "clicks" [...] that sperm whales <b>generate</b> <b>to</b> identify and communicate with each other.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic {{hyperinflation}} {{can occur}} in patients with asthma who are breathing spontaneously. It is a physiologic response to airflow obstruction and exists, to an extent, because increasing lung volume tends to increase airway caliber and can reduce the resistive work of breathing.
