The family is reviewed, its new additions elaborated. The {{spectrum analyzer}}'s CRT, displaying the important pa rameters, amplitude and frequency, makes the frequency domain immediately visually accessible, {{just as the}} oscillo scope gives access to the time domain (amplitude versus time). The modern spectrum analyzer, absolutely calibrated in all respects, is many instruments in one. It makes {{many of the same}} measurements as a power meter, selective volt meter, wave analyzer, <b>distortion</b> <b>meter,</b> frequency meter, and swept measuring system. More important, it displays these measurements simultaneously. If signals are complex, con taining energy at many frequencies, the analyzer can display all at once. Then, like a microscope, it can "zoom in " for...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} wired and {{wireless}} multi-media data challenges {{the researchers to}} develop an efficient objective assessment meter to estimate their quality. This research is focused to design objective quality assessment meters for images and video sequences. In this work, we proposed blockiness and blurriness distortion meters using full, reduced and no reference approaches. Both blockiness and blurriness distortions are calculated using frequency domain analysis. Since blockiness is an abrupt luminance change at DCT block boundaries which is also periodic therefore it generates harmonics in frequency domain, we used the strength of harmonics to estimate blockiness distortion. The more severe the blockiness is, the stronger will be the strength of harmonics in frequency domain. While blurriness removes the sharpness of the image by removing the high frequency components therefore we studied the loss of high frequency coefficients to measure blurriness artefact. We also aimed to design a multi-artefact <b>distortion</b> <b>meter</b> which can estimate the distortion without prior knowledge of distortion type. We developed the combined <b>distortion</b> <b>meter</b> for full, reduced and no reference approaches to estimate both blockiness and blurriness artefacts. We also studied the impact of spatial masking in image quality estimation. Due to the non linear behaviour of human visual system which perceives different amount of distortions at different spatial frequencies, we applied the masking process which weights the visibility of distortion according to the local spatial activity of the image. We investigated the importance of spatial masking in FR, RR and NR modes. Finally for video sequences, the quality metric of each frame is calculated and then we explored the methods to integrate these scores into a single value. Then the temporal masking is applied to mask the motion by using motion vectors and their standard deviations. The results are compared with the subjective scores provided by LIVE image and video database. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Audiophiles are exited. A {{special event}} has {{occurred}} {{that promises to}} undermine their very foundation and transcend "the event sociological": a minority group now cite conductor and interconnect performance as a limiting factor within an audio system. The masses, however, are still content to congregate with their like-minded friends and make jokes in public about {{the vision of the}} converted, content to watch their <b>distortion</b> factor <b>meters</b> confidently null at the termination of any old piece of wire. Believing in Ohm's law, they feel strong in their brotherhood. But the revolution moves forward [...] . This article examines propagation in cables from the fundamental principles of modern electromagnetic theory. The aim is to attempt to identify mechanisms that form a rational basis for a more objective understanding of claimed sonic anomalies in interconnects. Especially as I keep hearing persistent rumours about the virtues of single-strand, thin wires (John, is it OK to mention thin, single strand in HFN/RR yet? [...] .) Inevitably, the path towards an objective understanding depends upon both the correctness and completeness of the model selected. We shall establish, therefore, a theoretic stance initially and commence with the work of Maxwell (even though he could not avail himself of a <b>distortion</b> factor <b>meter.)</b> The equations of Maxwell concisely describe the foundation and principles of electromagnetism; they are central to a proper modelling of all electromagnetic systems. The equation set is presented below in standard differential form, where further discussion and background can be sought {{from a wide range of}} texts (1, 2, 3) ...|$|R

40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} dealing with low {{frequency}} all valve stereo amplifier unit conception for an electric guitar. The amplifier contains two independent output stages with two power tubes EL 34, working in AB class, with 40 Watts of power. The apparatus is equipped with two channels, EQ correctors, parallel effects loop, output selection with lowered anode power supply, selection between silicon or tube rectifier. The preamplifier works in mono mode and the stereophony is reached by dividing the signal in an added effects system. This unusual solution differs from both monaural conceptions and binaural power amplifiers which contains no preamp. It offers the possibility of stereophony without the necessity of dividing the guitar signal before the amplifier’s input. The sound {{that comes from the}} speaker on one side is effected {{and on the other side}} is dry by using monaural effects apparatus. The sound from both speakers is effected by using binaural effect apparatus. The amplifier can be used as power amplifier stage only when the return of the effect loop is used as the amplifier input. Every available possible solution is discussed in case of each block and then the most suitable is chosen. The biggest attention is paid to a proposal and calculation of both power and output transformer, ergonomical lay-out of the stages in need of the best S/N separation. The stages were simulated in Micro-Cap 9. 0 and Tonestack 1. 3 computer programmes. The construction was carried out with the emphasis on proper shielding and grounding. The overall stability tests were performed after building the amplifier as well as frequency characteristics with the scope and distortion with the <b>distortion</b> <b>meter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Standard {{metering}} {{of electric}} arc furnaces usually uses {{root mean square}} (RMS) or true root mean square (TRMS) measurements for determining power. Only sinusoidal signals are accurately described by RMS meters, and dc or high-frequency components normally are lost in standard TRMS metering. This can lead to inaccuracies when electrical signals are not sinusoidal, contain dc components, or include fast risetime perturbations, {{as is the case}} with the electric signals from an electric arc furnace. Electric arc furnace electrical waveforms, observed in research carried out by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, show high-frequency components and significant deviations from sinusoids. These perturbations and <b>distortions</b> make <b>metering</b> difficult for standard power meters. The inaccuracies in metering can cause further problems if those sensors are used in control systems. For control strategies requiring rapid response, any averaging scheme loses information that can be used in control decisions. In order to obtain better signals for both monitoring and control, a study of instantaneous, RMS, and TRMS power monitoring devices was conducted. From this study it was concluded that precision integrated circuits should be used to obtain instantaneous power with a bandwidth of at least 25 kHz. The information from these devices is more representative than that of standard meters and can be used in predictive control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many {{definitions}} {{have been}} formulated to characterize non-active power for nonsinusoidal waveforms in electrical systems, and no single, universally valid power {{theory has been}} adopted as a standard for non-active power. Most of the non-active power theories formulated thus far have had {{a particular type of}} compensation in mind, which has influenced the conventions used {{in the development of the}} definitions. Because nonsinusoidal loads are expected to continue to proliferate throughout electrical distribution systems, non-active power theories will only grow in importance for applications such as non-active power compensation, harmonic load identification, voltage <b>distortion</b> mitigation, and <b>metering.</b> This paper presents a comprehensive technical survey of the published literature on the topic and briefly outlines the salient points of each of the different theories as well as each one’s applicability to active power filtering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and computational {{study of the}} effect of severe inlet temperature distortion (hot streaks) on the efficiency of the MT 1 HP turbine, which is a highly-loaded unshrouded transonic design. The experiments were performed in the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (OTRF) (formerly the TTF at QinetiQ Farnborough) : an engine scale, short duration, rotating transonic facility, in which M, Re, and are matched to engine conditions. The research formed part of the EU Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows (TATEF II) programme. An advanced second generation temperature distortion simulator was developed for this investigation, which allows both radial and circumferential temperature profiles to be simulated. A pronounced profile was used for this study. The system was novel in that it was designed to be compatible with an efficiency measurement system which was also developed for this study. To achieve low uncertainty (bias and precision errors of approximately 1. 5 per cent and 0. 2 per cent respectively, to 95 per cent confidence), the mass flow rate of the hot and cold streams used to simulate temperature <b>distortion</b> were independently <b>metered</b> upstream of the turbine nozzle using traceable measurement techniques. Turbine power was measured directly with an accurate torque transducer. The efficiency of the test turbine was evaluated experimentally for a uniform inlet temperature condition, and with pronounced temperature distortion. Mechanisms for observed changes in the turbine exit flow field and efficiency are discussed. The data are compared in terms of flow structure to full stage CFD performed using the Rolls Royce Hydra code. Copyright © 2011 by Rolls-Royce plc...|$|R
