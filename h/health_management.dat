40|$|The {{participation}} of physicians in <b>health</b> care <b>management</b> has followed different paths in {{developed and developing}} countries. However, {{we can say that}} in most of the countries the physicians have had cyclical patterns of participation and withdrawal from <b>health</b> care <b>management.</b> It is readily apparent that these patterns are different in each country. We propose to take into account three different levels of analysis in which different factors interact to define the country specific pattern of physician involvement in <b>health</b> care <b>management,</b> as well as to assess the international convergence and divergence paths on physician participation. We present here a conceptual framework that could facilitate the analysis of this theme under a comparative perspective.

25|$|Evolutionary {{medicine}} identifies many {{symptoms such as}} fever, pain, and sickness {{behavior as}} evolved responses to protect or enhance the recovery from infection and injury. Fever, for example, is an evolved self-treatment that removes bacteria or viruses through raised body temperature. These evolved responses, however, also have a cost that depending upon circumstances can outweigh their benefit (due to this, for example, there is a reduction in fever during malnutrition or late pregnancy). According to the <b>health</b> <b>management</b> system theory proposed by Nicholas Humphrey, the brain has been selected to ensure that evolved responses are deployed only when the cost benefit is biologically advantageous. To do this, the brain factors {{in a variety of}} information sources, including the likelihood derived from beliefs that the body will get well without deploying its costly evolved responses. One such source of information is the knowledge the body is receiving care and treatment. The placebo effect in this perspective arises when false information about medications misleads the <b>health</b> <b>management</b> system about the likelihood of getting well so that it selects not to deploy an evolved self-treatment.|$|E
