2500|$|Lauren Barwick {{was born}} on 12 September 1977 in Langley, British Columbia. She worked at a place that {{supplied}} horses to movie shoots. She now lives in Reddick, Florida. She is classified as Grade II which means she is paralysed from the waist down. Before she was paraplegic, she also enjoyed cross country running and skiing.

2500|$|The English {{common law}} of deodands traces {{back to the}} 11th century and was applied, on and off, until Parliament finally {{abolished}} it in 1846. [...] Under this law, a chattel (i.e. some personal property, such as a horse or a <b>hay</b> <b>stack)</b> was considered a deodand whenever a coroner's jury decided that it had caused {{the death of a}} human being. [...] In theory, deodands were forfeit to the crown, which was supposed to sell the chattel and then apply the profits to some pious use. (The term deodand derives from the Latin phrase [...] "deo dandum" [...] which means [...] "to be given to God.") In reality, the juries who decided that a particular animal or object was a deodand also appraised its value and the owners were expected to pay a fine equal to the value of the deodand. [...] If the owner could not pay the deodand, his township was held responsible.|$|E

50|$|After hay was cut and had dried, the hay was raked or rowed up by raking it into {{a linear}} heap by hand or with a horse-drawn implement. Turning hay, when needed, {{originally}} was done by hand with a fork or rake. Once the dried hay was rowed up, pitch forks were used to pile it loose, originally onto a horse-drawn cart or wagon, later onto a truck or tractor-drawn trailer, for which a sweep could be used instead of pitch forks.Loose hay was taken to an area designated for storage—usually a slightly raised area for drainage—and built into a <b>hay</b> <b>stack.</b> The stack was made waterproof as it was built (a skilled task) and the hay would compress under its own weight and cure by the release of heat from the residual moisture in the hay and from the compression forces.
