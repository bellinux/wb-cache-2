5|$|Julie Walters was a {{long term}} {{collaborator}} of Wood's, although unlike Wood and Walters, their previous television series together, only Wood's name remained in the title. This was because in the interim, Wood was getting viewers of it turning up to her solo stand up shows <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a double act. This didn't stop Wood making Walters almost as prominent in this newer series. She played many two handers with Wood {{as well as other}} roles such as Margery the daytime television host, a mad shoe shop lady, the elderly waitress in the Two Soups sketch, and a transsexual hairdresser. Most famously, she was the char-lady Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques. She later revealed that alongside her starring role in Educating Rita, it's the part she's still recognised the most by the public for.|$|E

The club had finished fourth and had then beaten Parramatta and Norths to make the Grand Final. Souths had already beaten Saints twice during the 1965 season and the huge crowd showed up <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{an end to the}} Dragons' decade of dominance. Souths showed great heart in going down 12-8 {{in one of the most}} memorable grand finals of all time.|$|E

25|$|The goals {{kept coming}} {{at the start}} of April, as Gary McSwegan grabbed 4 goals in a 6–1 win over Dumbarton at Tannadice. Since that 1–0 defeat at Boghead six months previously, United had scored 17 goals against Dumbarton in 3 games. Just as United looked to be running away with the league, they lost another {{important}} three points with a 1–0 defeat to St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. a 2–0 victory away to Hamilton put United back in the driving seat, and with two games left, United had to play their two nearest challengers. With a one-point advantage, United faced Dunfermline at Tannadice, and with a crowd of 12,000 turning up <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> United clinch the title, Dunfermline left with a 1–0 win. That defeat left United two points behind Dunfermline, and the final game of the season was against third-placed Morton. In front of over 12,000, United managed a 2–2 draw to pip Morton to 2nd place on goal difference and secure the play-off place.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the season, Sue Ellen gets drunk {{after having}} seen J.R. {{in bed with}} Holly Harwood. She gets into a car and Ray Krebbs' cousin Mickey Trotter tries to stop her and they are {{involved}} in an accident, in a car belonging to J.R., just outside Southfork. Sue Ellen emerges with nothing worse than bruises, but Mickey is paralyzed from the neck down and in a coma. In the final episode of the season, Ray finds out that the driver of the other car was Walt Driscoll, J.R.'s rival. He also learns that Driscoll deliberately caused the accident, thinking that J.R. was driving, as a means of revenge for being put in jail by J.R. earlier in the year. An angered Ray comes to Southfork late at night demanding answers from J.R., who was not <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. J.R. asks him what is going on and Ray says he's going to kill J.R. for what happened. J.R. throws a candle holder at Ray, which misses him and knocks over another candle holder with lit candles in it. As the two brawl, the candles ignite a fire and the smoke starts to creep into both John Ross and Sue Ellen's bedrooms as they sleep. Sue Ellen had been given a sedative by the doctor earlier in the day so she doesn't wake up. J.R. notices the fire and tries to break free of Ray, finally knocking him out with a telephone, and runs upstairs to try to save his wife and son. Ray recovers and runs after J.R. but is consumed by smoke and falls. J.R. is hit with a falling beam as he gets upstairs and both men are unconscious as Southfork burns.|$|E
25|$|Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) visits Stan with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White) {{as he is}} {{in desperate}} need of money. Stan forces Shirley, who he has been estranged from him the longest, to accept the money, and their angst is {{revealed}} to have started when Stan's drinking meant a young Mick and Tina went into care. Stan gives Shirley Deano's (Matt Di Angelo) mobile number, saying that he is now going by the name of Dean. A few weeks later, Shirley learns from her aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) that Dean has been staying with Stan. Shirley visits him, <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Dean but Stan tells her that Dean went away a few days ago. A few weeks later, Mick receives news that Stan has been involved in an accident and broken his ankle. He visits him in hospital and Tina brings him to the pub, where they agree to stick it out for three weeks.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to its character roster, {{the game was}} criticized for its lack of diversity in game modes and online features. George expressed his disappointment that the development team did not supplement Marvel vs. Capcom 3s core experience with extras to add variety to the total package and extend its lifespan. GameTrailers criticized the Arcade Mode, stating that its [...] "underwhelming Powerpoint-style" [...] endings left much to be desired, especially {{in comparison to the}} intro, outro, and rival battle sequences seen in Street Fighter IV. Tim Turi of Game Informer stated that fans <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> extensive online functionality similar to Street Fighter IV should [...] "regulate their excitement". Eurogamer's Simon Parkin pointed specifically to the absence of a spectator mode, noting that the exclusion of viewable matches also presented a serious shortcoming.|$|E

500|$|Rock 'n' Roll is {{the sixth}} studio album by John Lennon. Released in 1975, {{it is an}} album of late 1950s and early 1960s songs as covered by Lennon. Recording the album was {{problematic}} and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song [...] "Come Together". As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on Rock 'n' Roll. Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album's tracks unrecoverable {{until the beginning of}} the Walls and Bridges sessions. With Walls and Bridges coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Lennon's Rock 'n' Roll album.|$|E
500|$|At that time, a Parisian ballet {{audience}} typically {{consisted of}} two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a [...] "Bohemian" [...] group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would [...] "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions [...] began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: [...] "Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with {{the intervention of the}} police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final [...] "Sacrificial Dance" [...] was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} weekend {{as the more}} prestigious Milan–San Remo, to which the team was not invited, they picked up two wins in single-day races. Veilleux won La Roue Tourangelle beating 's Anthony Delaplace in a two-up sprint five seconds ahead of the main field. Chavanel led the field across the line, giving Europcar two out of the three podium spots. That same day, team leader Voeckler won Cholet-Pays de Loire by foiling a field sprint. With [...] left in the race, Voeckler went on the attack. He opened up a ten-second time gap very quickly and just held on to win, having no appreciable gap over the peloton at the finish. Since Cholet-Pays de Loire is a UCI Europe Tour race, Voeckler had to wear the all-white jersey of Europe Tour leader and not the French {{national}} champion's jersey, something which spectators <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the tricolor jersey found absurd. While Voeckler was nonetheless happy to come away with a win, he stressed after the race {{that it was not}} Milan–San Remo, and that the victory should be viewed with the proper perspective.|$|E

He stated that it was [...] "a forgivable error committed by humans who were concerned about children <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Heidi". The following morning, Cline was called into a meeting with his bosses. He was told that if he had done anything other than what he did, NBC would have been at the mercy of Timex and Cline would have been fired. The network turned the fiasco into an advantage by subsequent self-mockery, promoting the following week's Jets game telecast with an advertisement showing Namath with Heidi on his shoulders, and running another ad with testimonials about Heidi, the last: [...] "I didn't {{get a chance to see}} it, but I hear it was great", signed by Namath. Other networks joined in: on the CBS Evening News the following Monday night (November 18), Harry Reasoner announced the [...] "result" [...] of the game: [...] "Heidi married the goat-herder". That same evening, NBC's own Huntley-Brinkley Report aired the tape of the game's final minute, complete with the re-created Gowdy/DeRogatis commentary. On the ABC Evening News, anchor Frank Reynolds read excerpts from Heidi while clips of the Raiders' two touchdowns were shown as cut-ins.|$|E
500|$|In {{anticipation}} of the film's debut at Sundance, John Brodie from Variety said the film could be the [...] "thunder from Down Under the way Shine was last year." [...] Having watched the film at Sundance, David Rooney from Variety praised several of the actors' performances and said the film [...] "should score with kids the protagonists' age, but its soap-opera-style plotting and overwritten dialogue will limit wider acceptance". Premiere also gave a negative review of the film's debut, commenting that audiences had been <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> another Shine, though left the screening disappointed. Elfick acknowledged that the initial screening of Blackrock at Sundance was less well received, which he blamed on sound problems. He stated that the issue was rectified for {{the second and third}} screenings, which were much more successful. Diane Carmen of The Denver Post gave the film a positive review of the film, which she said left audiences at Sundance [...] "reeling with its intensity", concluding it was [...] "almost guaranteed to find a distributor in the U.S", though in the event the film never received American distribution. Having viewed the film at the Boston Film Festival, Chris Wright from The Phoenix concluded, [...] "Even with its slightly over-the-top dénouement, Blackrock is a believable, touching teen drama. It's also a gripping thriller".|$|E
500|$|Peter and Joe visit Quagmire and are {{introduced}} to his father, Lieutenant Commander Dan Quagmire. <b>Expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the inspiration for Quagmire's wanton sexual behavior, they are surprised by Dan's stereotypically gay mannerisms and begin texting each other of how gay Dan is. The following morning, Quagmire invites Peter and Lois to the Naval Ball being held to honor his father, but soon begins arguing with Peter about his father's sexuality. At the ball that night, members of the Navy bombard Quagmire with compliments about his war-hero father, most {{of which can be}} taken as double entendres about Dan's alleged homosexuality. Concerned that his dad may be gay, Quagmire confronts him and Dan states that he is not gay, but is instead [...] "a woman who was born biologically Male" [...] and that he plans to have a sex change operation during his stay in Quahog. At first Peter and Lois conflate gender identity and sexual orientation, then at Lois' suggestion, Peter waits with Quagmire during the operation. The surgery is a success, with Quagmire's dad emerging as the newly named Ida Davis, an attractive blond woman. That night, Ida and Quagmire join the Griffins for dinner. As the dinner begins, however, Quagmire becomes frustrated when the Griffins turn the conversation towards Ida's surgery and other related topics, and storms out of the room. At Quagmire's home, Quagmire tells Ida that he is not sure he can deal with her new gender identity. Saddened, Ida leaves Quagmire's home and decides to stay at a nearby Marriott Hotel.|$|E

[...] Kirt Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film for being [...] "strange yet strangely beguiling" [...] for capturing Jackson in [...] "feverish grips of pure creativity" [...] and stated that while the film presents that audience with a screen filled with everyone ranging from [...] "performers, musicians, choreographers, crew members, craftsmen," [...] she took notice that the film had primarily focused on Jackson. Honeycutt perceived {{based on what he}} had seen from the behind-the-scenes look of rehearsals that he understood what it takes to [...] "attain such dizzying heights in entertainment" [...] and that he understood why Jackson [...] "chose to stay away" [...] from performing [...] "for a decade" [...] and, based on what he saw from footage from rehearsals that it [...] "looks like the world has missed one helluva concert." [...] Honeycutt cited that the only thing that frustrated him more than knowing the [...] "tragedy" [...] that prevented the concert from happening was [...] "not knowing what you're looking at" [...] and commented that the film did not feel like a complete concert film because it had a grip on the audience, stating: [...] "Where are Jackson and his conspirators at any given moment in the creative process? The film tries to be a concert film without having the actual footage. So when everything comes to a halt, audiences get thrown." [...] Peter Travers, of Rolling Stone described watching Jackson's [...] "struggle" [...] as being [...] "illuminating, unnerving and unforgettable" [...] and felt that the film was a great [...] "transcendent tribute" [...] to Jackson because it did not have, nor need, a [...] "safety net." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, GameSpot's Gerstmann made a later update on his March 26, 1999, review by commenting on the U.S. alterations to Stage 6, exclaiming, [...] "It doesn't really affect the game too much, since much of the game doesn't {{make a lot of}} sense to begin with." ...|$|E
