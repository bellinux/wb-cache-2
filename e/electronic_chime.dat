5000|$|UNO Attack {{comes with}} a special {{mechanical}} card launcher that runs on 3 C batteries. The card shooter contains a receptacle where the deck of cards is placed, and {{a button on the}} front, known as the [...] "Launcher Button". When the rules call for a player to [...] "Hit" [...] the card shooter, the player presses the button on the card shooter. An <b>electronic</b> <b>chime</b> sounds, and a random number of cards shoot out. As many as 12 cards have been known to shoot out.|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} {{repairs and}} commissioning of this towering belfry {{seems to be}} impossible before this year’s Peñafrancia festivities. Most of its window glasses were already broken and need replacements, the steel window frames themselves are no longer safe, the long and winding steel staircase towards the topmost part of the belfry had already been declared not passable by our engineers. To replace the same with concrete staircase will take a yearlong job. Only after this can we furnish it with a suitable Church Bell or with an <b>electronic</b> <b>Chime</b> Bells.|$|E
5000|$|Rather than holding {{classes on}} a rigid {{schedule}} of six fixed periods, Buchholz experimented with an innovative system of modular scheduling. The school day {{was divided into}} 21 mods, each 17 minutes long, and class length varied from one to three mods, depending on subject matter and day of the week. The traditional ringing bell to signal the end (and start) of a [...] "period" [...] was replaced with an <b>electronic</b> <b>chime</b> for each mod. The modular day included blocks of free time for students, designated Individual Directed Study time (IDS). In a January 1971 interview for the Gainesville Sun newspaper, Principal Temple explained that in a conventional school with a normal six and one-half hour day, students spend 275 minutes per week in each of six classes. In its first year operating on an abbreviated, [...] "early" [...] schedule, Buchholz students spent 260 minutes per-week, per-class; this increased to 275 minutes the following school year, when the county's acquisition of a dozen new school buses allowed Buchholz to begin classes at a [...] "normal" [...] time.|$|E

The Board of Trustees of Antioch Baptist Church {{dedicated}} <b>electronic</b> <b>chimes</b> given {{in memory of}} Dr. Benjamin Jesse Covington and Mrs. Jennie Belle Covington by their daughter Jessie Covington Dent and her sons Thomas, Benjamin, and Walter Dent...|$|R

2500|$|In 1991, as {{a result}} of lawsuits, <b>electronic</b> <b>chimes,</b> using a {{descending}} three-note arpeggio (either G-E-C ], , or between one or two semitones lower (F♯-D♯-B [...] or F-D-B♭ [...] )) and a flashing pair of orange lights above the doorway, added for the hearing impaired, were tested and gradually introduced system-wide during the 1990s. [...] The Toronto Rocket trains use the same door chimes and flashing orange lights as the older trains do, and also plays the additional voice announcement, [...] "Please stand clear of the doors". Those chimes have become synonymous with the TTC and Toronto {{to the point that the}} CBC Radio One local afternoon show, Here and Now, includes them in its theme music.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is crowned {{by a pair}} of clock towers: as a ship passed along the river, mariners could tell the time from these. The clocks were made by Gent and Co. of Leicester. The clock faces are 7.6 m in diameter, larger than those of London's famous landmark, the Great Westminster Clock, holding the distinction of being the largest electronically driven clocks in the UK.They were originally named George clocks, because they were started at the precise time that King George V was crowned on 22 June 1911.In 1953 <b>electronic</b> <b>chimes</b> were installed to serve as a memorial {{to the members of the}} Royal Liver Friendly Society who died during the two World Wars. During hours of darkness, the clock dials are illuminated.|$|R
50|$|The ringers of St Patrick's {{began the}} custom of ringing in the New Year in 1871. And by the 1880s, St Patrick's Cathedral became the leading tower for Australian change ringing. The bells were rung for the requiem mass of Pope Pius X in 1914. By 1959 the belfry fell into {{disrepair}} and the bells became unringable. The bells remained silent until in 1988, when the peal was sent to Eayre and Smith Bell foundry in England as the major Victorian project among Bicententennial bell restorations. Upon their return, a ninth bell, an Angelus bell, was added. An <b>electronic</b> <b>chiming</b> mechanism was also installed at this time for all the bells. The original manual method was retained by the electronic mechanism, in order to replicate how the bells would have sounded if they were rung by hand. The entire eight headstocks had to be replaced just ten years after this installation. The ringers are affiliated with The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers.|$|R
5000|$|The church's {{original}} towers consisted only of {{the first}} tier. A buttressed second tier and copper-clad steeples were subsequently added to the towers by Joseph E. Lanoue of Burlington {{with the assistance of}} a carpenter, Louis Berube in 1882. [...] By September 1883, steeple construction had been completed. A three-bell carillon was purchased in October 1885 for $930.00. Blessed on November 22, and installed in the belfry on November 25, the bells were made by the McShane Foundry in Baltimore, Maryland and tuned in minor keys. Following French custom, the bells were named. The first bell, Jean Baptise weighed 2260 lbs kg and was tuned in the key of C. The second bell, Saint Francis weighed 1200 lbs kg was tuned in the key of E. The third named Saint Marie weighed 744 lbs kg and was tuned to the key of G. [...] The bells were replaced with <b>electronic</b> <b>chimes</b> in 1978.|$|R
5000|$|Notification appliances: This {{component}} uses {{energy supplied}} {{from the fire}} alarm system or other stored energy source, to inform the proximate persons {{of the need to}} take action, usually to evacuate. This is done by means of a pulsing incandescent light, flashing strobe light, electromechanical horn, <b>electronic</b> horn, <b>chime,</b> bell, speaker, or a combination of these devices. Strobes are either made of a xenon tube (most common) or recently LEDs.|$|R
25|$|Completed in 1875, Old Main, a two-towered brick {{building}} {{designed in the}} Second Empire style, was the primary instructional and administrative building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its design {{was based on the}} plans for the main academic building at the University of Illinois, which has since been demolished. However, the clock and bell towers were switched at Arkansas. The northern taller tower is the bell tower, and the southern shorter tower is the clock tower. One legend for the tower switch is that the taller tower was put to the north as a reminder of the Union victory during the Civil War. A second legend is that the contractor accidentally swapped the tower drawings after having had too much to drink. Although the southern tower was designed with clock faces, it never held a working clock until October 2005. The bell tower has always had some type of chime, initially a bell that was rung on the hour by student volunteers. <b>Electronic</b> <b>chimes</b> were installed in 1959.|$|R
50|$|Meneely bells rang for President Franklin Roosevelt's and President John Kennedy's funerals, and for President Lyndon Johnson's inauguration. The {{replacement}} for the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, {{as well as many}} church bells in that city, were Meneely bells. Nearly every church bell in Troy, New York is a Meneely bell. Other Meneely bells include bells at Cornell University, the Metropolitan Life building in New York City, and the West Point Military Academy. Overall, the Meneely companies produced about 65,000 bells. The Meneely companies eventually closed in 1952 owing to metal shortages and the increasing popularity of <b>electronic</b> bells and <b>chimes.</b>|$|R
