5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. <b>Fasciotomy</b> is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for <b>fasciotomy</b> may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E

Nevertheless, South African polyvalent serum {{is known to be}} effective against the venom of at least two species. [...] However, envenomation can be very serious and in at least one case a bitten child had to have a <b>fasciotomy.</b> [...] A number of small dogs have had limbs amputated or died due to bites from this snake. The danger from this snake should not be underestimated as a bite from a large individual on a small child could potentially be fatal.|$|E

40|$|Background : <b>Fasciotomies</b> are a {{therapeutic}} treatment for compartment syndrome, {{but they also}} allow reperfusion to tissues that have been hypoxic. We report {{a case study of}} a 52 -year-old male with an ischemic leg. Despite prophylactic <b>fasciotomies,</b> ischemia-reperfusion injury resulted in delayed myonecrosis and progressive necrotizing fasciitis.   Results : After two hyperbaric oxygen treatments, edema was markedly reduced and all visible wound tissues were well perfused without evidence of ascending infection, allowing the patient more time for further evaluation. The patient did opt for an above the knee amputation in a non-emergent setting and now successfully utilizes a prosthesis for ambulation. Conclusion : Ischemia-reperfusion injury may result in delayed tissue loss in spite of appropriate <b>fasciotomies.</b> Hyperbaric oxygen may be a useful adjunct therapy even when initiated days after the initial injury. </p...|$|R

It is likely that this complication will be seen more often with the increased worldwide use of this drug and its approval for all arteriopathic patients...|$|R
50|$|Bites {{are similar}} to {{rattlesnake}} bites in the United States. Local symptoms may be severe, with pain, massive swelling, blistering, and necrosis that lead to <b>fasciotomies</b> {{and in some cases}} amputations. Systemic effects involving hemostatic disturbances are rare, as are renal failure and neurotoxicity. Only venom from neonates contains crotoxin; a constituent typically found in C. durissus venom that produces neurotoxic symptoms.|$|R
5000|$|Plantar <b>fasciotomy</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} after conservative treatment {{has failed to}} resolve the issue after six months and is viewed as a last resort. [...] Minimally invasive and endoscopic approaches to plantar <b>fasciotomy</b> exist but require a specialist who is familiar with certain equipment. The availability of these surgical techniques is currently limited. A 2012 study found 76% of patients who underwent endoscopic plantar <b>fasciotomy</b> had complete relief of their symptoms and had few complications (level IV evidence). Heel spur removal during plantar <b>fasciotomy</b> has not been found to improve the surgical outcome.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{compartment}} syndrome {{is a medical}} emergency requiring immediate surgical treatment, known as a <b>fasciotomy,</b> to allow the pressure to return to normal. Although only one compartment is affected, <b>fasciotomy</b> is done to release all compartments. For instance, if only the deep posterior compartment of a leg is affected, the treatment would be <b>fasciotomy</b> (with medial and lateral incisions) to release all compartments of the leg in question, namely the anterior, lateral, superficial posterior and deep posterior.An acute {{compartment syndrome}} has some distinct features such as swelling of the compartment due to inflammation and venous occlusion. Decompression of the nerve traversing the compartment might alleviate the symptoms (Rorabeck, 1984). Until definitive <b>fasciotomy</b> can be performed, the extremity should be placed {{at the level of}} the heart. Hypotension should also be avoided, as this decreases perfusion pressure to the compartment. Supplemental oxygen also optimizes tissue and neural oxygenation.|$|E

50|$|Wounds {{requiring}} surgical closure {{with skin}} grafts or flaps (typically {{anything more than}} a small full thickness burn) should be dealt with as early as possible. Circumferential burns of the limbs or chest may need urgent surgical release of the skin, known as an escharotomy. This is done to treat or prevent problems with distal circulation, or ventilation. It is uncertain if it is useful for neck or digit burns. <b>Fasciotomies</b> may be required for electrical burns.|$|R
40|$|Ischemic {{complications}} after fenestrated endovascular {{aortic aneurysm}} repair (FEVAR) {{can result in}} significant morbidity and mortality. We present {{a case of a}} 65 -year-old man who underwent a FEVAR complicated by bilateral lower extremity compartment syndrome requiring four-compartment <b>fasciotomies.</b> This ischemic complication was likely caused by sheath occlusion because the patient had no evidence of arterial injury or distal plaque embolization. This case highlights the importance of careful postoperative monitoring after FEVAR, because the larger sheaths required can be occlusive and result in lower extremity ischemia, even for relatively short cases...|$|R
40|$|Study Rationale: Chronic exertional {{compartment}} syndrome often forces patients {{to change their}} sporting activities or reduce their level of participation. Many undergo surgery with the aim {{to return to their}} activities symptom free. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine if <b>fasciotomies</b> for chronic exertional {{compartment syndrome}} are a reliable treatment option with a predictable outcome to allow patients to return to the same level of activities. Objective: The evaluation of the functional outcomes and patient satisfaction in an active population who had surgery, namely <b>fasciotomies,</b> for chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) of the lower leg. Design: A retrospective descriptive cohort study with a telephonic follow-up interview. Patients: A consecutive series of 41 patients that were surgically treated for CECS by a single orthopaedic surgeon from July 2005 to October 2013. Main Outcome Measures: Patient records were reviewed to determine their presenting symptoms, diagnostic investigations and surgical procedures performed. A questionnaire was completed by each participant to assess pain and level of activity before and after surgery, level of improvement after surgery and patient satisfaction with surgical outcomes. Results: Twenty-one of the 41 patients that were included in the study were categorized as active sportsmen, participating at a competitive or a non-competitive level. The remaining 20 were experiencing symptoms during leisure activities. The majority of all the patients (63 %) had to stop their activity due to their symptoms. After surgery 95 % were able to return to participate in the same level of activities as before surgery. Ninety percent of the active sportsmen were able to return to participation at a competitive or non-competitive level, with 45 % reporting an increase in the level of intensity that they could maintain. Overall satisfaction was reported by 80 % of participants although only 46 % were completely pain free. Conclusions: <b>Fasciotomies</b> are a viable surgical treatment option for chronic exertional compartment syndrome in active patients, including athletes. There is an 87 % return rate to previous activities within 6 months and an 80 % satisfaction rate reported by patients post-surgery. We do acknowledge that some of the data collected regarding symptomology is subject to recall bias due to the interval between surgery and completion of the questionnaire...|$|R

Both {{had previously been}} investigated and treated with bilateral, 4 -compartment <b>fasciotomies</b> for presumed chronic compartment syndrome with no effect on their symptoms. Vascular imaging in both relaxed and resisted plantar-flexed positions revealed a diagnosis of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) and both patients underwent bilateral release of the popliteal arteries to curative effect. These cases highlight the importance of appropriate investigation of young patients with claudicant symptoms, as the diagnosis of PAES is easily missed with conventional vascular imaging {{and can lead to}} irreversible arterial damage...|$|R
