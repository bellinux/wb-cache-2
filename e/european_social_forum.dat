Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of Hassan al-Banna, the Egyptian founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, also attended meetings. A few weeks earlier, Ramadan had published a controversial article on a website [...] after Le Monde and Le Figaro refused to publish it [...] criticizing several French intellectuals, who according to the Institute, were either Jewish or [...] "others he mistakenly thought were Jewish," [...] for having [...] "supposedly betrayed their universalist beliefs in favor of unconditional support for Zionism and Israel." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a cross-national comparative research project {{on the case of}} democracy in the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> (ESFs) process over the period from 2003 to 2005. The various progressive social movements engaged in the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> process try to construct “another world” and “another public sphere” internally within their own practices of participatory and deliberative democracy in public forums. This includes fighting discriminations against women in general and women from non-western European parts of the world in particular. I take as my point of departure the case of “women without,” that is women activists who lack financial resources and/or have problems participating in transnational meetings because of border or visa restrictions. In the context of the European, preparatory meetings to the ESF, these women are for the most part either migrants living in the European Union or women coming from Eastern, South or Central Europe. To what extent do the effective processes of decision-making in the ESF preparatory process include the perspective and claims of materially less privileged participants, in particular these distinct groups of “women without”? Based on a feminist critique of the Habermasian model of deliberative democracy, I discuss the quality of democratic deliberation in the ESF’s assemblies {{from the perspective of the}} networks of “women without. ” Then, as a second step, I show how the strategies of these materially less privileged activists break discursive mechanisms of exclusion inside the ESF process and build their own transnational networks subverting the ruling discourse structure of the ESF...|$|R

It is dangerous to wave the red flag of anti-Semitism at any moment. However, it is a text marked partly by Ramadan’s communitarian thought and which communicates his view of the world to others." [...] One {{of the leaders of the}} anti-globalization movement in France, José Bové of the Confédération Paysanne, told Le Monde: [...] "The anti-globalization movement defends universalist points of view which are therefore necessarily secular in their political expression.

2500|$|The {{former head}} of the French antiracism {{organization}} SOS Racisme, Malek Boutih, has been quoted as saying to Ramadan, after talking with him at length: [...] "Mr. Ramadan, you are a fascist". In an interview with Europe 1, Malek Boutih also likened Ramadan to [...] "a small Le Pen"; in another interview he accused him of having crossed the line of racism and anti-Semitism, thus not genuinely belonging to the alter-globalization movement. Bertrand Delanoë, mayor of Paris, declared Ramadan unfit to participate at the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forum,</b> as not even [...] "a slight suspicion of anti-Semitism" [...] would be tolerable. Talking to the Paris weekly Marianne, Fadela Amara, president of Ni Putes Ni Soumises (Neither Whores Nor Submissive, a French feminist movement), Aurélie Filippetti, municipal counsellor for The Greens in Paris, Patrick Klugman, leading member of the Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France, and Dominique Sopo, head of SOS Racisme, accuse Ramadan of having misused the alter-globalization movement's ingenuousness to advance his [...] "radicalism and anti-Semitism." [...] Egyptian intellectual Tarek Heggy has also charged Ramadan with saying different things to different audiences. Other criticisms have included claims that an essay attacking French intellectuals was anti-semitic and that Ramadan has shown excessive generosity in his rationalization of the motives behind acts of terrorism, such {{as in the case of}} Mohammed Merah.|$|E

40|$|While {{two other}} {{articles}} in this special issue look at events and movements in Muslim majority countries, this contribution examines the participation of European Muslims in France and Britain. It focuses specifically on the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> (ESF) {{that took place in}} those respective countries in 2003 and 2004 and presents an overview of the mobilisation of Muslims and their interaction with the existing movements and seeks to elaborate on the impact of this participation. It is argued that what is most significant is the effect it has had on the movements themselves and how it has challenged their own self-interpretation as open and tolerant. The most obvious result has been the series of debates, disagreements, fallouts and splits this caused within the existing groups and associations of the ‘global justice movement’ in both countries. The participation was also divisive for existing organisations representing Muslims and, even in the UK, coalitions between Muslim and non-Muslim activists have been hard to maintain. The differing reactions to this phenomenon in the two countries {{can be explained by the}} ‘discursive opportunity structures’ found in each context. In France in particular, the notions of laïcité and communautarisme force social movement actors to adopt ambivalent attitudes towards Muslim associations even though these groups agree upon the importance of the former and danger of the latter...|$|R

40|$|Inspired by the Arab revolts and {{regenerating}} some {{feature of}} the culture of the alter-activists, indignados and occupiers camps and activists have spread over Europe and North America. Drawing on fieldwork research in London and New York and of a review of the early literature dedicated to this movement, this paper proposes to successively analyze its mixed scales of actions, protest and meanings and to consider it as a reactive, creative and democratization movement. (1) A global movement? Preliminary fieldwork suggests a contrast between an international repertory of actions (places occupation, camps, symbolic action, democratic assemblies…) and global scope and meanings (opposition to the hold of global corporations and financial markets) on one side, and, on the other, the dominant national framework and limited international initiatives of most of its actors. In Western Europe, the continental scale has actually been less present than in previous waves of protests, including jobless mobilizations of the late 1990 s or the alter-globalization movements and its <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>forums.</b> (2) A reactive movement On one side, the intensity of the occupiers/indignados movement in each country seems to be connected to the intensity of the social and economic crisis. On the other side, the movement impact in mainstream media suggests it has been highly successful in providing alternative meanings and narratives to the global crisis (3) A creative movement The occupiers/indignados movements, and in particular their occupation camps, have open “spaces of experiences” that foster the expression of activists creativity and subjectivity (McDonald, 2006) and the implementation of prefigurative activism by which participants experiments alternative forms of social relations and democracy. (4) A democratic movement Democracy may be considered as the core value of these experiences, both in activists’ claims (e. g. the opposition to the power of global corporations) and in their concrete experimentations and innovations...|$|R
40|$|The {{protests against}} the World Trade Organisation in Seattle in 1999 have been described, along with the {{development}} of World and <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Forums</b> (WSF/ESF), as {{the beginning of a new}} Global Movement for Social Justice (GMSJ). This movement has been argued to represent a ‘new type of politics’ with an unprecedented ideological and organisational character based on new fragmented power relationships that have undermined traditional class and national relationships and consequently have undermined the relevance of classical socialist theory. In place of nation state-based socialist strategies for delivering social justice, the GMSJ has been established on the principles of autonomy and an absence of representative structures of any kind. Often, these movements are described as (transnational) New Social Movements. This thesis challenges these concepts and argues they fall within a post-socialist orthodox approach to social science. It compares socialist concepts relating to power, class, nations and political organisation with post-socialist concepts, and in so doing, argues that post-socialist ideas have gained an orthodox status in a period when Stalinist models of (national) state planning have collapsed and social democratic parties have capitulated to the demands of globalised neo-liberal capitalism. Under such conditions, it has been possible for post-socialist theory to reflect observed failures of socialist movements and the thesis argues that underlying post-socialist theories of power, globalisation and a fragmentation of material power relations are often excessively abstract and unconvincing. These arguments are developed through the presentation of research into GMSJ activist organisations, part of the movements that affiliated to the London round of the ESF in 2004. In presenting analysis of in-depth interviews with participants and key organizational leaders, the thesis examines how the contemporary GMSJ remains sceptical that class based socialist theory can mobilise contemporary mass movements. However, it also develops a better understanding of how activists in this new global social movement reflect socialist theories relating to power, property relations and class in their conceptualisation of patterns of social injustice. Overall, the research suggests post-socialist theories have failed to provide a programme or strategy for building a mass movement for social justice. It argues that, contrary to often stated claims about its Marxist foundations, post-socialist ideology has not been able to outline the systemic foundations for another world. However, the research suggests that the central concepts of Marxist theory relating to power, property relations, class and political organisation nevertheless remain relevant to the GMSJ and that democratic socialist planning is the only coherent systemic alternative to capitalism that has been placed before the GMSJ. The thesis will argue that the GMSJ could help to develop an ideological alternative to global capitalism by engaging with a rich history of socialist theory...|$|R
