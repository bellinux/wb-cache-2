5|$|Micaëla {{enters with}} a guide, seeking José and {{determined}} to rescue him from Carmen ("Je dis que rien ne m'épouvante"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is José, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. José's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight ("Je suis Escamillo, toréro de Grenade"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls ("Holà, <b>holà</b> José"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Micaëla is discovered; at first, José will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.|$|E

This result extends the well-known zero-field VE by adding a term involving a derivative over B. Similarly the VE for a periodic solid is obtained by applying a limiting procedure to the VE for a cluster ('finite crystal'). All VEs are valid for the systems in arbitrary (ground or excited) eigenstates...|$|R

25|$|The {{orthodox}} Khalsa Sikhs {{believe that}} Sikhism {{is against the}} concept of pilgrimage, and has since early 20th century emphasized that the Sikh scripture teaches against any pilgrimage tradition. However, the Khalsa Sikhs have also supported and helped develop major pilgrimage traditions to sacred sites such as Harmandir Sahib, Anandpur Sahib, Fatehgarh Sahib, Patna Sahib, Hazur Nanded Sahib, Hemkund Sahib and others. Sikh pilgrims and Sikhs of other sects customarily consider these as holy {{and a part of}} their Tirath. The <b>Hola</b> Mohalla around the festival of Holi, for example, is a ceremonial and customary gathering every year in Anandpur Sahib attracting over 100,000 Sikhs. Major Sikh temples feature a sarovar where some Sikhs take a customary dip. Some take home the sacred water of the tank particularly for sick friends and relatives, believing that the waters of such sacred sites have restorative powers and the ability to purify one's karma.|$|E

40|$|The {{accompanying}} Comment by A. <b>Holas</b> and N. H. March [Phys. Rev. A 66, 066501 (2002) ] {{is concerned}} with the {{issue of whether or not}} kinetic energy can be represented by an effective local potential, as required for an exact Thomas-Fermi theory equivalent to Kohn-Sham density-functional theory. They dispute [R. K. Nesbet, Phys. Rev. A 65, 010502 (R) (2001) ], which concludes that for more than two electrons the use by Kohn and Sham of the Schrödinger kinetic energy operator is variationally correct, while the equivalent local potential required for a valid Thomas-Fermi theory, a Fréchet functional derivative of the Kohn-Sham ground-state kinetic energy functional, does not exist. The argument of <b>Holas</b> and March is clearly invalid for the simple example of the lowest triplet state of a two-electron atom with noninteracting electrons. Why this fails, as do earlier arguments in the literature, has been explained in recent publications, summarized here. Comment: 2 pp resub to include title and autho...|$|R
25|$|Macleod was {{appointed}} Secretary of State for the Colonies in October 1959. He had {{never set foot}} in any of Britain’s colonies, but the <b>Hola</b> massacre had helped focus his thinking on the inevitable end of Empire. He told Peter Goldman of the Conservative Research Department that he intended to be the last Colonial Secretary, although he later wrote that he “telescoped events rather than creating new ones”. He saw Nigeria, British Somaliland, Tanganyika, Sierra Leone, Kuwait and British Cameroon become independent. He made a tour of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1960. He would often find himself in conflict with the more conservative Duncan Sandys, whom Macmillan had appointed Commonwealth Secretary as a counterweight to Macleod. Although Macmillan sympathised with Macleod’s aspirations, he was sometimes disturbed at the speed with which he progressed matters, and did not always come down on his side in political disputes.|$|E
25|$|In October 1963, {{along with}} Iain Macleod, Reginald Maudling and Lord Hailsham, Powell tried {{in vain to}} persuade Rab Butler not to serve under Alec Douglas-Home, in the belief that the latter would be unable to form a government. Powell commented that they had given Butler a revolver, which he had refused to use in case it made a noise or hurt anyone. Macleod and Powell refused to serve in Home's Cabinet. This refusal is not usually {{attributed}} to personal antipathy to Douglas-Home but rather to anger at what Macleod and Powell saw as Macmillan's underhand manipulation of colleagues during the process of choosing a new leader. However, at the meeting at his house on the evening of 17 October, Powell, who still enjoyed a liberal reputation on racial issues after his <b>Hola</b> Massacre Speech, reportedly said of Home: “How can I serve under a man whose views on Africa are positively Portuguese?”.|$|E
25|$|The Sikh gurus {{established}} a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react {{as a community}} to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, {{was responsible for the}} creation of the concept of Akal Takht (throne of the timeless one), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the Harmandir Sahib. The Sarbat Ḵẖālsā (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or <b>Hola</b> Mohalla and when {{there is a need to}} discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A gurmatā (literally, guru's intention) is an order passed by the Sarbat Ḵẖālsā in the presence of the Gurū Granth Sāhib. A gurmatā may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs. The term hukamnāmā (literally, edict or royal order) is often used interchangeably with the term gurmatā. However, a hukamnāmā formally refers to a hymn from the Gurū Granth Sāhib which is a given order to Sikhs.|$|E
