40|$|Objective: There is some {{suggestion}} in {{the literature}} that <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> might self-select to be more resistant {{to the effects of}} sleep deprivation; however, this question has not been directly examined. The current laboratory study aimed to compare performance changes during acute sleep deprivation between <b>professional</b> and nonprofessional <b>drivers.</b> Methods: Twenty volunteer male <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> and 20 nonprofessional drivers performed a simulated driving task (AusEd) and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) during 24 hours of continuous wakefulness. Ratings of subjective sleepiness were also examined. Results:There was a progressive and signiﬁcant increase in lateral lane position and speed variability on the simulated driving task and an increase in PVT reaction times and lapses after participants had been awake for 17 to 24 hours (Ps <. 01). There was no difference in performance changes between the <b>professional</b> and nonprofessional <b>drivers.</b> Conclusions: <b>Professional</b> <b>drivers</b> in this study had the same susceptibility to sleep deprivation as nonprofessional drivers. This ﬁnding does not support the concept that <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> are resistant to sleep loss...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{association}} of work nature, lifestyle and obesity with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b> Methods: A total of 3376 Chinese <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> aged 18 to 70 years were recruited to assess the HRQOL by SF- 12 summary scores (Physical Component Summary [PCS]; Mental Component Summary [MCS]), and collect data for work nature, lifestyle, and body mass index. Factors associated with HRQOL were examined by multiphase regression analyses. Results: <b>Professional</b> <b>drivers</b> reported poorer physical and mental HRQOL than the general population. Shift work and lorry driving had significant negative effect on HRQOL. Obesity was associated with lower PCS but higher MCS. Conclusions: HRQOL of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> tended to be low, especially among lorry drivers and shift drivers. Health intervention programs should promote regular exercise, healthy eating, no smoking, and weight control, which are modifiable factors improving HRQOL.

30|$|<b>Professional</b> <b>drivers</b> in {{the world}} confront the similar {{excessive}} workload conditions and considerably high crash risk. A survey in Australia showed that occupational drivers had a higher intention to speed in a work vehicle than their personal one [24], and thus {{were more likely to}} have crashes while driving for work. In Sri Lanka, taxi driver’s sociodemographic factors (i.e. level of education, marital status) are also found to be significantly associated with their aggressive driving and risk-taking behaviors [25]. 81 % of taxi drivers in Ankara, Turkey reported talking by using hand-held phone while driving [26]. On the other hand, many previous studies reported in the literature show that <b>professional</b> <b>driver’s</b> crash involvement is significantly related to the sociodemographic factors, working conditions or risky driving behaviors [10, 15, 27 – 29]; therefore, the proposed quantitative approach using all these possible contributory factors can be used to examine the potential crash risk for <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> (i.e., taxi, bus, coach, truck) in China, European countries and other areas {{in the world}} [15, 30]. The findings of this study provide valuable data with important implications for worldwide decision-making in public health policy and traffic regulation for <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present basic {{elements}} of the research directed at identifying and determining the personality traits of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> that affect safe, secure and enjoyable ride on the public roads. A quantitative method has been used here, whereas data were acquired from a questionnaire based on a sample of 59 <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b> Determining personality traits of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> that are in correlation with safe and pleasant ride on the roads has been enabled by applying the five factor model of personality (2 ̆ 7 Big Five 2 ̆ 7) and the Personality Inventory NEO-PI. From these results it was concluded that safe operation of the vehicle in traffic involves the successful 2 ̆ 7 conduct 2 ̆ 7 of oneself, that recognizes the importance of certain personality traits of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> for traffic safety and the need for appropriate professional selection in case of employment of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b> Research results suggest that extraversion is significant to separate drivers by the total number of accidents - more open and sociable drivers (extraverted) are significantly less involved in accidents than introvert ones. Research results have also confirmed that satisfaction is significant trait for separating drivers by the total number of drivers with a fault in such a way that the less pleased and more aggressive drivers have considerably more accidents. The research opens the way for new research tasks that should help in creating a specific structure of curricula that can be used in a variety of transportation companies and enterprises to improve general and public safety...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a literature study into alcohol consumption by <b>professional</b> <b>drivers.</b> To {{get an idea}} {{of the size of the}} problem, an inventory was made of the following four indicators of professional driversÆ alcohol consumption in the Netherlands and abroad: accident data, observed behaviour, police control results, and self-reported behaviour. The data found indicates that; in general, and among Dutch drivers in particular, alcohol consumption during working hours is not a common and widespread phenomenon. During alcohol controls, only small percentages of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> are above the legal limit. In the Netherlands they are considerably lower than in non-professional traffic. Although the indicators together give a reasonable impression of <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> in the Netherlands, they each have their limitations concerning validity and representivity. Based on the limited data found, the costs of alcohol consumption by <b>professional</b> <b>drivers</b> are difficult to estimate. The danger of drinking and driving is many times greater for heavy vehicles than for private ones. Therefore, the same is true for the costs and possible savings concerning drunk driving, Preventative programmes can be divided into laws, and collective and individual company measures. Collective labour agreements/contracts in the transport sector take alcohol consumption into account. However, there seems to be little interest for and belief in the existence of a problem...|$|R
