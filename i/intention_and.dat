40|$|Conflicting {{findings}} in the existing studies on insider dysfunctional information system (IS) behaviors have led some researchers to raise methodological concerns that samples in these studies are aggregated or disaggregated without sufficient attempt to differentiate their fundamental differences. Using a four-quadrant behavior taxonomy, this study investigates different types of dysfunctional information system behaviors to determine if, among them, there are any differences in behavioral <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> in the causal links between these <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> their predictor variables. The results show that both the <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> the causal links between these <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> their predictors vary among the four behavior categories...|$|R
40|$|Biospheric {{values and}} {{environmental}} self-identities {{are considered to}} be important antecedents of environmental preferences, <b>intentions,</b> <b>and</b> behaviour. Although various authors suggest a relationship between values and self-identity, this has rarely been studied empirically. This paper aimed to clarify the relationship between biospheric values and environmental self-identity and to study how both are related to environmental preferences, <b>intentions,</b> <b>and</b> behaviour. We hypothesized that biospheric values are related to environmental self-identity, and that self-identity is in turn related to preferences, <b>intentions,</b> <b>and</b> behaviour. Results of three studies including a wide range of environmental preferences, <b>intentions,</b> <b>and</b> behaviour support our reasoning and show that biospheric values are related to environmental self-identity, even when measured months before. Moreover, we found that the relationship between biospheric values <b>and</b> environmental preferences, <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> behaviour was fully mediated by environmental self-identity, indicating that biospheric values are related to preferences, <b>intentions,</b> <b>and</b> behaviour via one's environmental self-identity. This suggests that values need to be linked to the self in order to be influential in choices made. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the utility of volitional <b>and</b> forced <b>intentions</b> in predicting participation in physical activities and effort within the theory of planned behaviour. Four hundred and forty-four participants (184 males, 260 females) aged 19. 1 ± 3. 3 years (mean ± s) completed self-report measures of intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, volitional <b>intentions,</b> forced <b>intentions,</b> <b>and</b> past behaviour in a physical activity context. Six weeks later, they completed self-report measures of physical activity behaviour and effort. Results indicated that volitional <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> forced <b>intentions</b> contributed {{to the prediction of}} effort over <b>and</b> above <b>intentions,</b> attitudes, subjective norms, perceptions of control, past behaviour, and the product terms of attitudes × <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> subjective norms × <b>intentions.</b> Volitional <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> forced <b>intentions</b> did not predict participation in physical activities over and above effort. We concluded that volitional <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> forced <b>intentions</b> assist in the explanation of effort in the context of physical activity behaviour. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Many {{casualties}} were suffered {{by both sides}} but unlike General Bernard Montgomery, the Allied commander in Normandy, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel was unable to withdraw units into reserve after the battle, as they were needed to hold the front line.

Interpretations of the <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> conduct of Operation Epsom differ widely but there is general agreement concerning {{its effect on the}} balance of forces in Normandy. The Germans contained the offensive but only by committing all their strength, including two panzer divisions newly arrived in Normandy, which had been intended for an offensive against British and American positions around Bayeux.|$|E

All participants completed an online ‘Youth and the Environment Survey’ that assessed perceived responsibility of community and government to protect the environment, locus of control, environmental concern, self-reported environmental knowledge, pro-environmental <b>intentions,</b> pro-environmental behaviour <b>and</b> environmentally harmful behaviour. Attributing greater responsibility to the community was related to more positive environmental <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> actions, whereas, attributing greater responsibility to the government for environmental protection was related to more negative environmental <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> behaviour. In addition, young people with higher environmental concern and knowledge, and a more internal locus of control in relation to the environment, reported stronger pro-environmental <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> behaviour, and less environmentally harmful behaviour...|$|R

Criminally involved adolescents completed an initial measure of attitudes, beliefs, and prior behavior. Of the 300 who completed the initial measurement, 267 (89 %) completed a behavioral assessment 6 months later. Analyses validated a theoretical model of condom use <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> indicated that <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> attitudes measured at baseline were significant predictors of condom use behavior 6 months later. Neither alcohol use nor alcohol problems moderated relationships among model variables or the influence of <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> attitudes on behavior.

5|$|The film's {{music and}} sound was also {{thoroughly}} post-processed by the project's sound designer, Andrei Toncu, {{to improve the}} quality of the recordings, because the budget did not allow for complex equipment to be used, and for creative interest. The movie's background music has reduced volume, following the emotional evolution of the charactersToncu combining the background music (recorded with, or without <b>intention)</b> <b>and</b> a series of effects characteristic to electronic music and musique concrète. However, a few distinct moments can be observed in the film's music, either composed by Andrei Toncu (Andrei imagining stealing the trolleybus), or already existing recordings, edited so that they would integrate into the movie's atmosphere (Elvis Presley's dedication is dynamically equalized to suggest the shift from one radio to another). Another scene in which multiple layers of sound were used was the radio show heard in Giani's car about the breeding of Memestra brassicae butterflies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year 1506, Pope Julius {{conceived}} a program to paint {{the ceiling of the}} Sistine Chapel. The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ on the right side and the Life of Moses on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that the ceiling was painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance, it was Pope Julius' <b>intention</b> <b>and</b> expectation that the iconography of the ceiling was to be read with many layers of meaning.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most blood donors stop {{donating}} {{blood at}} the beginning of their donor career. This intervention study aims to increase first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors using implementation <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> explicit commitment techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newly registered donors (N = 937) received an extra information sheet during their medical check-up wherein implementation <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> explicit commitment techniques were tested. Donors were randomly assigned to either the control condition, information sheet only condition, information sheet with implementation intentions condition, information sheet with explicit commitment condition, or information sheet with both implementation <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> explicit commitment condition. Logistic regression analyses examined actual first-time return behaviour after an appeal to donate blood. RESULTS: Donors in the information sheet with both implementation <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> explicit commitment condition had an 11 · 5 % higher return rate than donors in the control condition. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the information sheet with both implementation <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> explicit commitment condition significantly increased the odds on return behaviour compared with the control condition (OR = 1 · 65, 95 %CI = 1 · 08 - 2 · 50). CONCLUSION: This study successfully increased actual first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors by using both implementation <b>intentions</b> <b>and</b> explicit commitment techniques...|$|R
