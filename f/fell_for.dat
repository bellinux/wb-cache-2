Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania <b>fell</b> <b>for</b> just 116, Barnes taking 3/1.

5|$|For {{their next}} match Somerset {{travelled}} to Moreton-in-Marsh, where they faced Gloucestershire. Bastard {{did not take}} part in the match, and it fell to Winter to bowl the majority of the overs in his absence. Along with his fellow opener, James Parfitt, Winter claimed three wickets, but both openers conceded over 100 runs for their wickets. Sainsbury tried eight different bowlers in an effort to take wickets, and Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 448 after 190 overs. In reply, Somerset conceded their first three wickets for 18 runs, before a brief revival took them to 61 for 3. The last seven wickets then <b>fell</b> <b>for</b> the addition of 39 more runs, and Somerset closed on 100, still trailing their opponents by overs 300 runs. Captain Edward Sainsbury top-scored for Somerset, reaching his highest total of the season, 40, and only two other batsmen reached double figures for the county: Parfitt and the professional, Albert Clapp. Five Somerset players <b>fell</b> <b>for</b> ducks. Asked by Gloucestershire to follow on, Somerset batted even more poorly in their second effort, in which Winter's total of 21 was the highest score. A total of 80 meant that they lost the match by an innings and 268 runs, their heaviest defeat in first-class cricket at that point.|$|E
