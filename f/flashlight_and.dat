5|$|Gameplay in Silent Hill 3 resembles closely {{that of its}} two predecessors, {{the three}} main {{gameplay}} elements being combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Combat, as well as exploration, takes place in third-person view, with the player able to equip weapons found throughout the game. Heather may also block and perform side-step maneuvers to avoid enemies. As series staples, the <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> radio return, the latter of which crackles when monsters are within close proximity.|$|E
5|$|In Luigi's Mansion, {{the main}} story is played out over four stages, with players able to also access a {{training}} {{room and a}} gallery at the laboratory of Professor E. Gadd between stages. In each stage, players control Luigi as he explores the mansion's rooms and hunts down the ghosts that lay within them, acquiring keys to get through locked doors and eventually dealing with a boss ghost hidden {{at the end of}} the stage, with more rooms becoming accessible as each stage is completed. To assist him in his task, Luigi uses a <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> two inventions supplied by E. Gadd - the Poltergust 3000, a specially modified, high powered vacuum cleaner; and the Game Boy Horror, a parody of Nintendo's Game Boy Color.|$|E
5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

5|$|Commercials {{instructed}} fans to mail in episodes' geographical destinations during sweeps week. Advertisements appeared through Time Warner's television channels, Sports Illustrated for Kids, DC Comics publications, radio stations, and Warner Brothers stores. The contest {{marked the}} first time that Cartoon Network U.S., TNT Europe, Cartoon Network Europe, Cartoon Network Asia, and Cartoon Network Latin America united for a single promotion. Turner encouraged local cable operators to submit their own spots, generating 34,000ads among 174cable systems for a total of $3.4million cross-channel media support. 50,000children with a median age of ten entered the competition, and 20,000answered correctly. Turner selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as grand-prize winners. They and two-hundred others received Quest-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> siren, travel journal, pen, T-shirt, and glow sticks. Cartoon Network aired the names of winning children on a special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> cell phone.|$|E

25|$|Cram himself {{informed}} investigators of Gacy's {{attempts to}} rape him in 1976 {{and stated that}} after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale upon noting a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether {{he had been to}} the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing. Cram stated these trenches were two feet (60cm) wide, six feet (200cm) long and two feet (60cm) deep—the size of graves.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, Stella and Eben see the deputy, Billy (Manu Bennett), {{signaling}} {{them with}} a <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> {{bring him back to}} the station, after finding out he killed his family to save them from a more painful death. The trio find the others have made for the utilidor, a power and sewage treatment station that still has power, and head over there but are separated after Stella saves Gail Robbins (Rachel Maitland-Smith), a young girl whose family was slaughtered by a vampire named Zurial (John Rawls) who was stalking her. Eben and Billy make it to the utilidor but are attacked by Arvin (Andrew Stehlin), who bites Billy; Billy knocks Arvin into the heavy-duty shredder, and in doing so, painfully grinds his own hand to a stump by accident, before being killed by Eben because he is starting to turn.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before midnight}} on July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau {{drove into the}} Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, four miles from the Lake Herman Road murder site, and parked. While the couple sat in Ferrin's car, a second car drove into the lot and parked {{alongside}} them but almost immediately drove away. Returning about 10 minutes later, this second car parked behind them. The driver of the second car then exited the vehicle, approaching the passenger side door of Ferrin's car, carrying a <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> a 9mm Luger. The killer directed the flashlight into Mageau's and Ferrin's eyes before shooting at them, firing five times. Both victims were hit, and several bullets had passed through Mageau and into Ferrin. The killer {{walked away from the}} car but upon hearing Mageau's moaning, returned and shot each victim twice more before driving off.|$|E

25|$|From its mistakes, and the Australians' discoveries, U.S. command {{realized}} that they needed {{a new way to}} approach the dilemma of the tunnels. A general order was issued by General Williamson, the Allied Forces Commander in South Vietnam, to all Allied forces that tunnels had to be properly searched whenever they were discovered. They began training an elite group of volunteers in the art of tunnel warfare, armed only with a gun, a knife, a <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> a piece of string. These specialists, commonly known as “tunnel rats”, would enter a tunnel by themselves and travel inch-by-inch cautiously looking ahead for booby traps or cornered PLAF. There was no real doctrine for this approach and despite some very hard work in some sectors of the Army and MACV (Military Assistance Command, Vietnam) to provide some sort of training and resources, this was primarily a new approach that the units trained, equipped and planned for themselves.|$|E
500|$|Later on, {{the protagonist}} {{encounters}} a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named Lisa, and {{upon entering the}} bathroom and being locked, he obtains a <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying in the sink. He soon gets out, but finds out that the apparition is watching him. If the protagonist is attacked by the ghost, he reawakens in the first room of the game, beginning the loop again, but it's possible to avoid her completely. In the room, a bloody moving paper bag speaks to him, speaking of a disturbing experience, and stating the same quote seen {{at the start of}} the game - [...] "Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?" ...|$|E
500|$|The comic {{contains}} many references to events and {{objects in the}} game. In one comic, Frohman makes a clerical error that causes the Combine to order far too many explosive barrels, thus suggesting {{an explanation for the}} barrels' ubiquity throughout City 17 and beyond. In another, he writes a letter to Dr. Breen asking why using his flashlight reduces his ability to run, a reference to Half-Life 2s <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> sprint functions using the same power source. In a further strip, the town of Ravenholm becomes the headcrab-infested ghost town seen in Half-Life 2 after Frohman writes to Breen expressing his happiness with being there, giving away Ravenholm's location. [...] Indeed, Frohman causes (intentionally or accidentally) many of the disastrous circumstances that Gordon Freeman runs across. He accidentally gives Breen the idea of headcrab shells while on a radio, and sets up all of the traps in Ravenholm himself in an attempt to catch Father Grigori.|$|E

5000|$|In 1905, Hubert {{changed the}} name again to The American Ever Ready Company, selling <b>flashlights</b> <b>and</b> {{batteries}} under the trademark Ever Ready. In 1906 the British Ever Ready Electrical Company was formed for export of batteries; it became independent in 1914. In 1914, The American Ever Ready Company became part of National Carbon Company. Hubert stayed on as the president. The trademark was shortened to Eveready. In 1917, National Carbon Company merged with Union Carbide to form the Union Carbide and Carbon Company. From 1917 until 1921, Eveready used the trademark [...] "DAYLO" [...] for their <b>flashlights</b> <b>and</b> on their batteries.|$|R

500|$|The lights, and, by extension, the <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> flash beacon, {{are found}} in all main games, {{excluding}} the third. While use varies per game, lights are generally used to ward off animatronics, or warn the player of their presence. Lights {{in the first game}} and second games are activated via buttons mounted into the walls, and light up the player's 'blind spot', being the doorway or vent exit, respectively. The fifth game has the lights work similarly, however, they are now mounted onto a control pad, and serve no purpose other than the ability to see the animatronics, due to the different gameplay style. [...] The flashlight in the second and fourth game works in the same fashion as its real life counterpart, {{in the sense that it}} has a limited battery life, albeit only in the second game, and must be toggled on and off. The flash beacon was introduced in Sister Location, and is used to quickly gather bearings in the pitch black room seen on the third and fifth nights.|$|E
500|$|The {{objective}} of Silent Hill: Origins is to guide player character Travis Grady as he searches the monster-filled town of Silent Hill {{for information about}} a girl he rescues from a burning house. The game uses a third-person perspective which it alternates with fixed camera angles. Following the gameplay formula of previous Silent Hill games, Origins primarily revolves around combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Typical gameplay of Origins consists of alternating between reality and its darker and dilapidated counterpart, the [...] "Other World", to obtain keys and objects needed to solve a riddle. Travis carries a <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> indicates {{the direction of a}} nearby usable item, while his [...] portable radio alerts the player to the presence of nearby monsters by emitting static. Often, actions performed in one dimension will affect the other; for example, raising a prop on the stage in the theater results in a similar reaction in the Other World. Once solved, the riddle leads to an encounter with a boss, whose defeat unlocks a new area. Completion of the game results in unlocking special items or alternative outfits for Travis depending on various accomplishments.|$|E
500|$|Climax Studios, the {{developer}} of Silent Hill: Origins, developed Shattered Memories with a development team {{made up of}} more than 55 members and a supporting network of more than 90 artists. With the completion of Origins—for which they had attempted to closely replicate the atmosphere and gameplay elements of the first Silent Hill game (1999)—Climax Studios {{wanted to create a}} different horror game. Because of the tenth anniversary of the first Silent Hill installment, Konami thought the time was ideal [...] "to revisit" [...] the game. Climax Studios saw the then-newly introduced Wii platform as a way to reach a wider range of gamers, especially as outside Japan, no Silent Hill title had been exclusively released on a Nintendo platform. Development costs for the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and their gamers' [...] "mindset" [...] factored into the decision for the gaming platform. Additionally, {{the developer}}s wanted to use the Wii Remote to incorporate the gameplay elements of the <b>flashlight</b> <b>and</b> radio static. Climax felt that the first game would be a good starting point, instead of continuing any existing storylines or adding onto the mythology of the town. To please fans of the series and bring in new ones, they decided to reimagine the setting and characters, such as Dahlia, who was changed from [...] "a haggard old woman" [...] who led the town's cult into a physically attractive young woman.|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of Tabqa (2017), YPG {{special forces}} were {{equipped}} with US-supplied combat helmets, AN/PVS-7 night vision devices, <b>flashlights,</b> <b>and</b> were armed with M4 carbines equipped with AN/PEQ-2 laser sights, holographic weapon sights, and STANAG magazines.|$|R
