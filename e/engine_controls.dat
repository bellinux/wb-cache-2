5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E

40|$|For the {{development}} of new models, automobile manufacturers are {{trying to come up with}} optimal software for <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> in all movement modes. However, in this case, a vehicle cannot reach outstanding characteristics in none of them. This is the main reason why modifications in <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> software used for adapting the vehicle for driver’s needs are becoming more and more popular. The article presents a short analysis of development trends towards <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> software. Also, models of mathematical statistics for engine power and torque growth are created.

To address this lack of research, our team has conducted an extensive on board survey of seven ships within the Swedish merchant marine fleet. One of the purposes of this project was to raise the <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> issues and to increase the knowledge of maritime engineering and human factors issues in the <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> room. The result indicates that the design of the ECR has not developed towards meeting the new demands which this utilization of new technology implies.

The XNBL-1 was the largest aircraft built in the United States until the Boeing XB-15 in 1935.|$|E
25|$|On January 21, 1982, Douglas DC-3A N211TA of Tursair, after {{departing from}} Opa-locka Airport, was {{destroyed}} in an accident at the Opa-locka West Airport (X46).

Inadequate supervision {{and the failure of}} the student pilot to relinquish control of the aircraft to the instructor were cited as contributing to the accident.|$|E
25|$|In the United States all {{motor vehicle}} {{gasoline}} is unleaded {{and is available}} in several grades with different octane rating; 87 (Regular), 89 (Mid-Grade), and 93 (Premium) are typical grades. The maximum octane rating in California is generally 91. At high altitudes in the Mountain States and the Black Hills of South Dakota, regular unleaded can be as low as 85 octane; this practice is now increasingly controversial, since it was instituted when most cars had carburetors instead of the fuel injection and electronic <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> standard in recent decades.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, McDonnell Douglas and F-15 radar manufacturer, Hughes, teamed to privately {{develop a}} strike fighter {{version of the}} F-15. This version competed in the Air Force's Dual-Role Fighter {{competition}} starting in 1982. The Boeing F-15E strike variant was selected for production over General Dynamics' competing F-16XL in 1984. Beginning in 1985, F-15C and D models were equipped with the improved P F100-PW-220 engine and digital <b>engine</b> <b>controls,</b> providing quicker throttle response, reduced wear, and lower fuel consumption. Starting in 1997, original F100-PW-100 engines were upgraded to a similar configuration with the designation F100-PW-220E starting.|$|E
25|$|July 19, 1986: All 4 {{occupants}} of a Cessna 421, registration number N6VR, {{were killed when}} the aircraft suffered an apparent right-hand engine failure, rolled over, and dived into a vacant lot immediately after takeoff from Addison Airport. The post-crash investigation revealed that the right-hand engine did not show any obvious signs of failure and its controls were not set to deliver full takeoff power. The crash was attributed to incorrect engine control operation; the pilot had recently purchased the Cessna 421 but had not been formally trained to fly it, {{and most of his}} twin-engined experience had been in an airplane with <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> that operated in the reverse direction of those in the Cessna.|$|E
25|$|While the DA42 is a twin-engined aircraft, this is {{predominantly}} a measure for safety. It is readily capable of sustained flight using {{only a single}} engine, and can still achieve a satisfactory rate of climb of 700 feet per minute under single-engine operations, unlike many of its contemporaries. The DA42 possesses considerable endurance, being capable of performing 13 hour-long flights without carrying additional fuel tanks; this is partially due to its high fuel efficiency of its Austro engines, which consume 13.6 US gallons per hour when operated at 75 per cent power, lower than some of its single-engined rivals. The digital FADEC (full authority digital <b>engine</b> <b>controls)</b> serves to lower operational difficulty, constantly performing tasks such as managing rpm and fault-checking.|$|E

25|$|The EC135 started {{development}} {{prior to}} the formation of Eurocopter under Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) under the designation Bo 108 in the 1970s. MBB developed it in partnership with Aérospatiale, the Bo 108 was initially intended to be a technology demonstrator, combining attributes of the successful MBB Bo 105 with new advances and an aerodynamically streamlined design. Technologies included on the Bo108 included the first full-authority digital <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> (FADEC) on a helicopter, a hingeless main rotor, and the adoption of a new transmission. The first prototype made its first flight on 17 October 1988, powered by two Allison 250-C20R/1 engines. A second Bo108 followed on 5 June 1991, this time with two Turbomeca TM319-1B Arrius engines; unlike later production aircraft, both technology demonstrators flew with conventional tail rotors.|$|E
25|$|The Katana {{provides}} excellent {{external visibility}} to its pilots via {{the use of}} an one-piece bubble canopy, which its hinged at the rear, enabling easy entry using the built-in steps. The cockpit features a comprehensive six-unit instrumentation panel on the left-hand side, the majority of avionics-related controls and displays {{in the center of the}} console, and engine-specific elements are allocated to the right-hand panel. The Katana makes use of individual stick-type flight control, as opposed to yokes, along with key <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> on a centrally-positioned pedestal. There has been positive reports on the aircraft's comfort, the crew accommodated on fixed-position reclined seats with a small personal stowage area located directly behind; the noise levels are so low that headsets are typically unnecessary for voice communication, although an intercom system is integrated for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Avionics {{include a}} triple-redundant digital {{fly-by-wire}} flight control system, a head-up display system, and Full Authority Digital <b>Engine</b> <b>Controls</b> (FADEC). The cockpit {{has been designed}} so that the AW609 can be flown by a single pilot in instrument flight rules conditions. Several of the aircraft's controls, such as blade pitch, are designed to resemble and function like their counterparts on conventional rotorcraft, enabling helicopter pilots to transition to the type more easily. Elements of the aircraft's controls feature touchscreen interfaces. Shortly following AgustaWestland's full acquisition of the program, a substantial modernisation of the AW609's design was initiated in 2012; these changes included new engines and the redesigning of the cockpit. As part of the design refresh, new flight management systems, Northrop Grumman inertial and GPS navigation systems, and various other avionics from Rockwell Collins were adopted.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} extend the type's service, six ex-South African SA 330L were {{purchased}} by Britain in 2002. A programme to produce an extensive upgrade of the RAF's Pumas saw the first Puma HC Mk2 enter service in late 2012 and was completed by early 2014, enabling the Puma fleet to remain in operational service until 2025. In 2008, it was envisaged that 30 aircraft would be upgraded, this was subsequently cut to 22, and was later revised upwards {{for a total of}} 24 HC Mk2 Pumas to be produced. Upgrades include the integration of two Turbomeca Makila engines, new gearboxes and tail rotors, new <b>engine</b> <b>controls,</b> digital autopilot, a flight management system, an improved defensive aids suite, as well as ballistic protection for helicopter crew and passengers. The upgraded aircraft can transport double the payload over three times the range than its predecessor, and will be deployed by for tactical troop transport, as well as fast moving contingent combat and humanitarian operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} log {{for the flight}} indicated that the co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) for the flight. The CVR and ATC recordings also indicate that the co-pilot was PF during the flight. Furthermore, injuries sustained by the co-pilot to his right hand are consistent with his having been handling the aircraft {{at the time of}} impact. As no autopilot or flight director (FD) was fitted, the PF was under a high workload throughout the flight. This was especially so as three approaches were made in poor weather to below minima with two go-arounds. Normally the PF handles both flight and <b>engine</b> <b>controls</b> in a coordinated manner to achieve the required flight path; the PNF carries out other tasks including monitoring the aircraft's flight path, radio communications and keeping the flight log. The CVR indicates that the commander (PNF) took control of the power levers during final approach, this action being acknowledged by the PF. This was significant, as both power levers were subsequently retarded below Flight Idle – an action which would have been unexpected by the PF.|$|E
500|$|This {{is a list}} of {{representative}} Merlin variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Merlin.

Merlin engines used in Spitfires, apart from the Merlin 61, used a propeller reduction ratio of [...]477:1. Merlins used in bombers and other fighters used a ratio of [...]42:1.|$|E
40|$|This lecture {{will provide}} an {{overview}} of the aircraft turbine <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> research at NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Glenn Research Center (GRC). A brief introduction to the <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> problem is first provided with a description of the current state-of-the-art control law structure. A historical aspect of <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> development since the 1940 s is then provided with a special emphasis on the contributions of GRC. The traditional <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> problem has been to provide a means to safely transition the engine from one steady-state operating point to another based on the pilot throttle inputs. With the increased emphasis on aircraft safety, enhanced performance and affordability, and the need to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft, there are many new challenges being faced by the designers of aircraft propulsion systems. The Controls and Dynamics Branch (CDB) at GRC is leading and participating in various projects in partnership with other organizations within GRC and across NASA, other government agencies, the U. S. aerospace industry, and academia to develop advanced propulsion controls and diagnostics technologies that will help meet the challenging goals of NASA programs under the Aeronautics Research Mission. The second part of the lecture provides an overview of the various CDB technology development activities in aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> and diagnostics, both current and some accomplished in the recent past. The motivation for each of the research efforts, the research approach, technical challenges and the key progress to date are summarized. The technologies to be discussed include system level <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> concepts, gas path diagnostics, active component <b>control,</b> and distributed <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> architecture. The lecture will end with a futuristic perspective of how the various current technology developments will lead to an Intelligent and Autonomous Propulsion System requiring none to very minimum pilot interface, interfacing directly with the flight management system to determine its mode of operation, and providing personalized <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> to optimize its performance given the current condition and mission objectives...|$|R
