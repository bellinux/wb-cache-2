30|$|It was {{revealed}} {{in this study}} that the onset of <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was within hours after acetaminophen exposure (Table  3), which was in sharp contrast to our previous experience with paraquat-induced <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (Yang et al., 2012). In paraquat patients, the symptoms of <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> usually developed within 6.7 [*]±[*] 6.3  days of exposure, peaked at 9.5 [*]±[*] 8.8  days, and were resolved in 17.3 [*]±[*] 9.8  days. It was hypothesized by Mullick et al. (Mullick et al., 1981) that paraquat injury to the liver is biphasic; it is initially hepatocellular but becomes cholangiocellular after the first 2  days. However, only hepatocellular damage mechanisms have been implicated following acetaminophen intoxication (Larson, 2007). Therefore, it is unclear whether the faster onset of <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in cases of acetaminophen poisoning can be explained by different liver injury mechanisms.|$|R

30|$|Acetaminophen is a {{well-known}} agent that causes dose-dependent <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> It was revealed {{in this study that}} although patients with <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> suffered higher serum acetaminophen levels than patients without <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> a univariate logistic regression analysis failed to identify serum acetaminophen level as a significant risk factor for <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> complication after ingestion, possibly due to small sample size and short follow up duration (Table  5). Theoretically, the toxic metabolite NAPQI is formed by cytochrome p 450 and then detoxified by conjugating with GSH (Nelson, 1990), and oversaturated NAPQI makes the hepatocytes more vulnerable to injury (Potter et al., 1973). Nevertheless, the amount of acetaminophen in patients without <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in was 36.5 [*]±[*] 25.1 tablets (or 17.8 [*]±[*] 12.6  g), which was much higher than 4  g, the maximum recommended dose for adult (Table  1). Mitochondria injury may be the major determinant for this because previous animal studies have demonstrated that NADQI binds to mitochondria and leads to oxidative stress (Jaeschke, 1990). NADQI induced mitochondria permeability transition pore opening and mitochondrial permeability changes (Bajt et al., 2006). Endonuclease G and the apoptosis-inducing factor are released by mitochondria, and DNA fragmentation occurs with the release of these enzymes (Kon et al., 2004). Although oversaturation is the major mechanism in acetaminophen-related <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> mitochondria-related cytotoxic damage may be the reason for the heterogeneity of the phenotypes after the ingestion of large amounts of acetaminophen.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{side effect of}} {{antituberculous}} treatment is hepatotoxicity. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the rate of <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and some risk factors for the development of <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> during antituberculosis treatment. Records of 212 patients diagnosed as smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis were analysed retrospectively. In 30 of 212 cases (14. 1 %) hepatotoxicity was developed. In 16 of 30 patients it was <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (7. 5 %) and the treatment was interrupted. In our study, in 6 of 151 male patients (4 %) and in 10 of 61 female patients (16. 4 %) <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was seen, and it was significantly higher in females than males (p: 0. 002). Hepatotoxicity was seen during the first two weeks of the treatment in all of the patients. Although serum transaminase levels was reached above five times of the normal levels, we didn’t interrupt the therapy in two asymptomatic cases and by the follow up the enzyme levels returned to normal. Regarding the age, radiologic appearence and cavitary lesions on chest x-ray, there was not significant differences between patients who did or did not have <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> In conclusion, hepatotoxicity usually develops in the first two weeks of the treatment. We think that in the diagnosis of <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> symptoms of patients and progressive increasing tendency of serum transaminase levels during the follow up are more important than the only one high serum transaminase level...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{patients}} with <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> received lesser proportion of gastric lavage and active charcoal than {{patients with}}out <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (Table  4). This {{could be due}} to longer time elapse between acetaminophen ingestion and hospital arrival in patients with than without <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (Table  1). Similarly, the time elapse was not a significant risk factor for mortality after logistic regression analysis (Table  5). In a study that was conducted in Hong Kong (Chan et al., 1996), {{it was found that the}} time that elapsed between acetaminophen ingestion and treatment was the most important prognostic factor for liver toxicity. However, the N-acetylcysteine antidote was only used in 50 % of the patients (Chan et al., 1996), but the proportion of patients that received N-acetylcysteine treatment was as high as 78.6 % in our study (Table  4). Therefore, it is unclear whether the difference in the use of the N-acetylcysteine antidote could influence predictions of time elapses for <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b>|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Industrial waste (which is {{composed}} of various toxic chemicals), changes to the disposal process, and addition of chemicals should all be monitored and controlled carefully in the industrial waste industry to reduce the health hazard to workers. CASE PRESENTATION: Five workers in an industrial waste plant developed acute <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> one of whom died after 3 months due to fulminant hepatitis. In the plant, we detected several chemicals with hepatotoxic potential, including pyridine, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, and methylenedianiline.

40|$|BACKGROUND Acute <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> {{associated}} with acute poisoning with alcohol-containing disinfectants remains a medical and social problem.

RESULTS The research showed that at the onset of a disease, patients with acute <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> had an expressed activation of free radical oxidation of the blood serum and biopsy tissue. This was indicated by almost double increase in the intensity of free radicals generation (Ssp). This signifi cantly increased production of peroxide (Sind- 1) and hydroxyl radicals (Slum) — 2. 5 and 1. 86 times, respectively; also, it increased concentration of lipid hydroperoxides (h) almost three times, evidencing activation of the initial stage of lipid peroxidation There was no statistically signifi cant fall of figures indicating the liver parenchymal oxidative status  30 days after the admission. The same situation was observed 6 months after the beginning of the study. CONCLUSION Analyzing chemiluminescence scans of blood serums up to 30 days from admission, it is possible to conclude indirectly on a condition of the oxidative status in a liver parenchyma of patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sulphydryl-containing {{captopril}} (CPR) {{appears to}} act as a scavanger of oxygen derived free radicals. This is not present in other angiotensin-converting enzymes such as enalapril (EPR). The hepatotoxic effect of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) may result from induction of reactive oxygen free radicals. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the effects of CPR and non-sulphydryl-containing enalapril (EPR) in healthy rats and in rats with CCL 4 -induced <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> The rats were divided into two major groups. The first group consisted of healthy rats, and the second group consisted of rats with CCl 4 -induced <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Each major group was sub-divided into 3 groups, where CPR, EPR, or a placebo was administered. The resulting 6 sub-groups were analysed for the hepatic effects of CPR and EPR in healthy rats and in rats with CCl 4 -induced <b>toxic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Co-administration of CPR or EPR with CCl 4 lead to an increase in hepatic enzyme levels, and to a greater level of liver damage in comparison with CCl 4 alone. In conclusion, both CPR and EPR may lead to hepatotoxicity, and sulphydryl-containing CPR does not appear to protect the liver from the toxic oxidant effect of CCl 4...|$|R
