5|$|The third column, {{commanded}} by the experienced Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, included 11battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry. The fourth, {{commanded by}} the dependable Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, included the entire vanguard of Charles' corps and approached {{on the far}} Austrian left. The two larger columns, under Latour and Nauendorf, were to attack the French right wing in force, and to turn {{it so that the}} French army's back was to the Rhine. This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances: they would approach the French uphill from them. Nauendorf divided <b>his</b> <b>column</b> into several smaller groups, and approached Kandern from several sides, up the steep slopes, by coordinating contact between <b>his</b> <b>column</b> and Latour's, using Maximilian, Count of Merveldt's regiment as the link between them.|$|E
5|$|Watson, {{who grew}} up in Seattle in the 1920s and 1930s, was a tireless advocate, through <b>his</b> <b>column</b> as well as through a fictional {{organization}} he created called Lesser Seattle, for limiting the seemingly unbridled growth and urban renewal that dramatically altered the Seattle landscape {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and <b>his</b> <b>column</b> conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress at every turn.|$|E

5|$|American author Dan Savage (born October 7, 1964) {{has written}} six books, op-ed pieces in The New York Times, and an advice column on sexual issues in The Stranger (an {{alternative}} newspaper from Seattle, Washington). A {{graduate of the}} University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Savage began contributing a column, Savage Love, to The Stranger from its inception in 1991. By 1998 <b>his</b> <b>column</b> had a readership of four million. He was Associate Editor at the newspaper from 1991 to 2001, when he became its editor-in-chief, later becoming its editorial director in 2007.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00, the San Francisco {{aircraft}} spotted Jojima's force off Guadalcanal {{and reported}} it to Scott. Scott, believing that more Japanese ships were likely {{still on the}} way, continued his course towards {{the west side of}} Savo Island. At 23:33, Scott ordered <b>his</b> <b>column</b> to turn towards the southwest to a heading of 230°. All of Scott's ships understood the order as a column movement except Scott's own ship, San Francisco. As the three lead U.S. destroyers executed the column movement, San Francisco turned simultaneously. Boise—following immediately behind—followed San Francisco, thereby throwing the three van destroyers out of formation.|$|E
5|$|Commandant Chaltin {{recovered}} three cannons, {{over seven}} hundred rifles, and a considerable supply of provisions from the Mahdist post at Rejaf. Three thousand Congolese regulars were garrisoned at the town, and a gunboat {{was brought up}} the Nile to defend its ports. After securing Rejaf, Chaltin and <b>his</b> <b>column</b> marched to the northernmost point of the Lado Enclave {{in order to establish}} a Belgian presence in the area and prevent Mahdist reentry. A serious assault on the post at Rejaf occurred in June 1898, when Mahdists forced their way through Free State defenses before being finally defeated near the town.|$|E

5|$|In hindsight, Callaghan {{was criticized}} for not putting his five ships that had the {{superior}} SG radar systems {{at the ends of}} <b>his</b> <b>column,</b> for not using one of them as his flagship, for directing the battle from his flagship's bridge instead of the radar plot, for not issuing his battle plans to his captains, and for issuing confusing orders during the battle. Analysis of the battle led to a rapid improvement in USN techniques for fighting in poor visibility, particularly in the adoption of combat information centers.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{reviewed}} {{television for}} the Manchester Guardian {{and wrote a}} weekly political column in The Spectator noted for its irreverence and influence on modern parliamentary sketches. During the 1960s he wrote five columns {{a week for the}} Daily Mail on any subject that he chose. After a disagreement with the proprietor of the paper over attempted censorship of <b>his</b> <b>column</b> in 1970, Levin moved to The Times where, with one break of just over a year in 1981–82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both serious and comic.|$|E
5|$|Major-General Hunter's column lost eighty {{killed and}} wounded, while the {{quantity}} of Mahdist casualties {{is estimated to be}} between 250 and 850. The Mahdist commander, Mohammed Zain, was captured in the fighting. Soon after news of the victory spread, work on the desert railway was resumed and Abu Hamed reached on October 31, where Major-General Hunter and <b>his</b> <b>column</b> had remained. With the completion of the railway across the Nubian Desert, Kitchener's general advance into the heartland of Mahdist Sudan was guaranteed, and the greatest issue of Kitchener's campaign, supply, resolved.|$|E

His direct reporting style in <b>his</b> <b>column</b> Red Privada ("Private Network"), which publicly exposed government and law enforcement corruption, organized crime, and drug trafficking, was distributed and read in over 200 newspapers across Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Roger Friedman, a gossip {{reporter}} for Fox News—a channel also owned by Fox's parent company News Corporation—was fired for writing {{a review of}} the film using the leaked copy he downloaded from the Internet.

5|$|The French infantry—mostly Gascons—had {{meanwhile}} {{started down}} the slope towards Sanseverino. Montluc, noting that the disorder of the Italians had forced them to a standstill, suggested that De Tais attack Madruzzo's advancing column of landsknechte instead; this advice was accepted, and the French formation turned left {{in an attempt to}} strike the landsknechte in the flank. Madruzzo responded by splitting <b>his</b> <b>column</b> into two separate portions, one of which moved to intercept the French while the other continued up the slope towards the Swiss waiting at the crest.|$|E

5|$|The median is {{the halfway}} point, {{which means that}} 50% of people will die before eight months, but the other half will live longer, {{potentially}} much longer. He then needed to determine where his personal characteristics placed him within this range. Given that the cancer was detected early, he was young, optimistic, and had the best treatments available, Gould reasoned {{that he should be}} in the favorable half of the upper statistical range.

5|$|The {{plan was}} for Major-General Hunter and a flying column of crack troops to race with all {{possible}} speed from Merowe north-east to Abu Hamed, {{where they would}} surprise the numerically inferior Mahdist garrison and win control of the town. Speed was essential, for it was certain Hunter's column would be spotted by Mahdist scouts during the journey. If these scouts managed to send word and reinforce the town prior to Hunter's arrival, <b>his</b> <b>column</b> might find itself outmatched and forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with <b>his</b> <b>column</b> south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E

5|$|Gamal Abdel Nasser {{wrote in}} his memoirs that already by May 25, the Egyptian forces were spread so thin {{that they had no}} mobile {{reserves}} to assault a Jewish force, and considered it strange that they would be ordered to allocate a major contingent to fight in an unfamiliar area. Following-up his victory in the Battle of Yad Mordechai on May 23–24, al-Mwawi pushed north along the coast, bypassing the relatively well-defended Israeli village of Nitzanim. <b>His</b> <b>column</b> was reinforced by sea near Majdal, where he sent part of his force to the Majdal–Hebron road, hoping it would be able to link with another column, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Aziz, south of Jerusalem. Reduced to about 2,500 men, al-Mwawi resumed his march northwards. Brigadier General Muhammad Naguib was put in charge of the column by al-Mwawi, because the original commander was on vacation in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015 in <b>his</b> <b>column</b> in Weekly Famitsu, Sakurai {{alluded to}} the {{possibility}} of retirement, expressing doubt that {{he would be able to}} continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was. In December 2015, Sakurai once again stated that he was not sure if there will be another Smash Bros. game in the series. In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. However, the rumour was debunked upon the release of the Switch.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{received}} word that Mawhood was leading his troops {{back across the}} bridge and back to Princeton. Mercer, on orders from Washington, moved <b>his</b> <b>column</b> to the right in order to hit the British before they could confront Washington's main army. Mercer moved towards Mawhood's rear but when he realized {{he would not be}} able to cut off Mawhood in time, he decided to join Sullivan. When Mawhood learned that Mercer was in his rear and moving to join Sullivan, Mawhood detached part of the 55th Regiment to join the 40th Regiment in the town and then moved the rest of the 55th, the 17th, fifty cavalry and two artillery pieces to attack Mercer.|$|E
