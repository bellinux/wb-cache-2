5|$|Following {{these beliefs}} and traditions, Kanak people and Conservation International (CI) have been jointly {{involved}} in conserving the ancestral waters and natural resources. According to a rapid assessment survey conducted {{with help from}} the Kanaks, 42 coral reefs have been identified for protection near Nord's Mont Pani Province. Its rich biodiversity reserves also include sea cucumbers, molluscs, crustaceans, herrings, groupers, and snappers. Supporting Kanak traditions, the Coral Reef Initiative for the South Pacific's (CRISP) partnership with CI provided recommendations and underwater species guides to the Kanak people. In 2004, a proposal was put forward to promote the entire coastal region as a World Heritage Site. Further work on this initiative has been pursued by CI's Center <b>for</b> <b>Applied</b> Biodiversity Science, the Coral Reef Initiative for the South Pacific (CRISP), and the French Government, in collaboration with WWF to assess marine resources used by both Kanak tribes and people of European descent across three coastlines of the Nord Province.|$|E

The gophers are relocated to a nearby location distant from the lupines.|$|E
