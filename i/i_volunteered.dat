25|$|Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich {{were unable}} to {{practice}} on Christmas Eve – {{mainly because of the}} drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, <b>I</b> <b>volunteered</b> the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two hour work-out on Christmas morning. It was quite a contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents.|$|E
2500|$|Vera {{decided to}} call Inayat Khan back to London, to meet and talk. Vilayet Inayat Khan remembered trying to stop his sister going on her mission exactly {{the time of this}} meeting. [...] "You see, Nora and I had been brought up with the policy of Gandhi's nonviolence, and at the {{outbreak}} of war we discussed what we would do," [...] said Vilayet, who had followed his father and become a Sufi mystic. [...] "She said, 'Well, I must do something, but I don't want to kill anyone.' So I said, 'Well, {{if we are going to}} join the war, we have to involve ourselves in the most dangerous positions, which would mean no killing.' [...] "Then, when we eventually go to England, <b>I</b> <b>volunteered</b> for minesweeping and she volunteered for SOE, and so I have always had a feeling of guilt because of what I said that day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cowdrey {{showed he}} had lost none of his timing and that his bat was as {{straight}} as ever until he was bowled behind his legs by Thomson (2/45) for 22. In the second innings he volunteered to open with David Lloyd instead of the badly bruised Brian Luckhurst. Cowdrey was dropped by Ian Redpath off Lillee, hit on the arm, survived a confident appeal by Rod Marsh before he was finally caught lbw by Thomson for 41, his highest score of the series. After the Second Test Cowdrey made 78 and took 2/27 against South Australia. Before the Third Test at Melbourne Frank Tyson recalled [...] "Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich were unable to practice on Christmas Eve – {{mainly because of the}} drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace.

He played his 114th and last Test at Melbourne, and opened the innings again as Lloyd was injured, but only made 7. Even so, England made 529 and won by an innings, with Cowdrey dismissing Rick McCosker for his 120th catch. He was given a warm farewell by his fans in [...] "an impromptu little gathering on the outfield in front of the banner reading 'M.C.G. FANS THANK COLIN – 6 TOURS'. The central figure, wearing a large straw sun-hat, was signing endless autographs, posing for photographs and exchanging friendly talk with young and old in the way that has made him as popular a cricketer as has ever visited Australia".|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} dazoxiben, a {{thromboxane}} synthetase inhibitor, on cold-induced forearm vasoconstriction was determined in {{two groups of}} human volunteers, those in whom dazoxiben abolished the platelet aggregation and release reaction induced by sodium arachidonate (group I) and those in whom it did not (group II). Dazoxiben abolished cold-induced forearm vasoconstriction in group <b>I</b> <b>volunteers</b> but not in those of group II. These results imply a correlation between platelet behaviour and cold-induced changes in vascular tone. In the group <b>I</b> <b>volunteers</b> the effect of dazoxiben on cold-induced vasoconstriction was abolished by 1800 mg of aspirin, but not by 40 mg. Since the lower dose of aspirin inhibits platelet cyclo-oxygenase but {{has no effect on}} cyclo-oxygenase in blood vessel walls, it is possible that platelets play no part in the modulation of vascular tone by dazoxiben. It is more likely that the effects of dazoxiben are confined to the vessel wall...|$|R
