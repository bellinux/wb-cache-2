50|$|After {{finishing}} the digestion the peptides generated {{in this process}} have to be extracted from the gel matrix. This is accomplished by one or several extraction steps. The gel particles are incubated with an <b>extraction</b> <b>solution</b> and the supernatant is collected. In the first extraction, {{almost all of the}} peptide is recovered, the repetition of the extraction step can increase the yield of the whole process by only 5-10%. To meet the requirements of peptides with different physical and chemical properties an iterative extraction with basic or acidic solutions is performed. For the extraction of acidic peptides a solution similar to the concentration and composition of the digestion buffer is used; basic peptides are extracted in dependence to the intended mass spectrometric method with a low concentrated acidic solution of formic acid for ESI and trifluoroacetic acid for MALDI respectively. Studies on model proteins showed a recovery of approximately 70-80% of the expected peptide yield by extraction from the gel.Many protocols contain an additional fraction of acetonitrile to the <b>extraction</b> <b>solution</b> which, in concentrations above 30% (v/v), is effective in reducing the adsorption of peptides to the surface of reaction tubes and pipette tips. The liquid of the pooled extracts is evaporated in a centrifugal evaporator. If the volatile salt ammonium bicarbonate was used for the basic extraction, it is partially removed in the drying process. The dried peptides can be stored at -20°C for at least six months.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of the}} {{extraction}} process is to obtain dry, powdered, sodium alginate. The calcium and magnesium salts do not dissolve in water; the sodium salt does. The rationale behind {{the extraction}} of alginate from the seaweed is to convert all the alginate salts to the sodium salt, dissolve this in water, and remove the seaweed residue by filtration. The alginate must then be recovered from the aqueous solution. The solution is very dilute and evaporation of the water is not economic. To the sodium alginate from the initial <b>extraction</b> <b>solution,</b> a calcium salt is added. This causes calcium alginate to form with a fibrous texture; it does not dissolve in water and can be separated from it with relative ease using a metal screen.|$|E

30|$|Approximately 5  mL culture broth was sprayed rapidly {{into the}} 25  mL precooled {{quenching}} solution, vortexed and instantaneous weighed {{to estimate the}} exact volume of the sample. The resulting mixture was then immediately transferred into the FiltRes-device for filtration (vacuum already applied, slide bar in opened position). After the filtration was finished, the slide bar was closed. To test the influence of washing steps, the mycelial filter cake was then additionally washed 1 – 3 times with 25  mL cold (− 40  °C) quenching solution. Afterwards, the <b>extraction</b> <b>solution</b> was injected as follows. The septa of the injection port were pierced with the canule of the dispenser and 16.5  mL of hot <b>extraction</b> <b>solution</b> was rapidly injected. The injection of the <b>extraction</b> <b>solution</b> from below the filter net forced the mycelial filter cake to completely detach from the nylon filter net (detached filter cake see Fig.  4). This exchange of the quenching and extraction solutions was performed within a few seconds as illustrated in Additional file 2 : Movie S 1, where {{the handling of the}} FiltRes-device was demonstrated with a preculture mycelium. In the next step, the FiltRes-device was tilted to transfer the extraction broth into pre-weighed polypropylene or polycarbonate tube with screw caps (50  mL, Nalgene, UK; preheated in a water bath at 90  °C). Due to the device’s dead-volume (<b>extraction</b> <b>solution</b> below the filter), some of the injected <b>extraction</b> <b>solution</b> (1 – 2  mL) could not be transferred into the extraction tubes. This proportion of <b>extraction</b> <b>solution,</b> however, never came into direct contact with the mycelial cake as it remained below the filter disk. Even if metabolites had diffused into this dead volume, the determined intracellular metabolite concentration would have been only minimally distorted. This shortcoming will be eliminated in future prototypes. In any case, to guarantee similar volumetric extraction conditions, the volume transferred from the FiltRes-device to the preheated test tube was determined by weighing and, if necessary, compensated with hot <b>extraction</b> <b>solution.</b> Afterwards, the samples were placed into a shaking water bath at 90  °C and extracted as described later. Since these extracts were subsequently evaporated and resuspended in a defined volume of buffer, the compensation with hot <b>extraction</b> <b>solution</b> had no dilution effect. Concentrations of intracellular nucleotides were normalized to biomass (“Calculations and data analysis” section).|$|E

40|$|Two {{species of}} desert truffles, Tirmania and Terfezia were {{collected}} from the Northern desert region in Saudi Arabia for antimicrobial and antioxidant activity testing. Both species were extracted with four types of <b>extraction</b> <b>solutions,</b> methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate and water to test for antimicrobial activity and with three <b>extraction</b> <b>solutions,</b> methanol, ethanol and water for antioxidant activity. Using disc diffusion method, the extracts were subjected to twenty three different microorganisms to observe the antimicrobial activity by measuring clear zones.

In Terfezia, ethanol extract was better than methanol extract in effectiveness. Ethyl acetate extracts were the least effective. The results indicate that truffles possess antimicrobial activity with broad spectrum effects against Gram positive, Gram negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as Saccharomyces, while no effect was recorded with fungi. The results on antioxidant activity showed that truffles have very strong antioxidant property with 99. 9 % with ethanol extracts of Tirmania species and 95. 5 % with ethanol extract of Terfezia species using beta-carotene bleaching method and antioxidant property with 96. 1 % with ethanol extracts of Tirmania species and 95. 3 % with methanol extract of Terfezia species using DPPH free radical method...|$|R

30|$|The {{procedure}} for polyethylene isolation by a Soxhlet extractor {{in this study}} was based on a simple principle: difference in solubility behavior for each component in the composites. That is, polyethylene is soluble in a hydrophobic solvent at an elevated temperature and near insoluble at room temperature (Brandrup and Immergut 1966; Barton 1975). After cooling the <b>extraction</b> <b>solution,</b> resin components should form a dense precipitate and be successfully recovered by filtration of the entire <b>extraction</b> <b>solution.</b> Fillers such as graphite, calcium carbonate, starch, and cellulose are insoluble in hydrophobic solvents and remain in an extraction thimble throughout the operation. Organic additives such as antioxidants, UV-absorbents, and flame-retardants, which are mostly low molecular weight substances, have good solubility in organic solvents even at room temperature (Bolgar et al. 2008; Tolinski 2009). Various hydrophobic chemicals are known as good solvents for polyethylene at elevated temperature: hydrocarbons such as xylene and dodecane, and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene and 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene. However, in this study we used cyclohexanone, which is typically not a good solvent for polyolefins due to a polar carbonyl function on the molecule, to improve resin recovery from the <b>extraction</b> <b>solution.</b> By cooling the solution to room temperature, polyethylene can form a precipitate, whereas hydrophobic organic additives remain in the <b>extraction</b> <b>solution.</b> Filtering the floating polyethylene precipitate and rinsing with a volatile solvent can yield a good sample with purity suitable for AMS measurement, and at the same time, can provide an estimate of the amount of resin content of composites.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMotivation: The {{identification}} of {{events such as}} protein–protein interactions (PPIs) from the scientific literature is a complex task. One {{of the reasons is}} that there is no formal syntax to denote such relations in the scientific literature. Nonetheless, it is important to understand such relational event representations to improve information <b>extraction</b> <b>solutions</b> (e. g., for gene regulatory events). In this study, we analyze publicly available protein interaction corpora (AIMed, BioInfer, BioCreAtIve II) to determine the scope of verbs used to denote protein interactions and to measure their predictive capacity for the {{identification of}} PPI events. Our analysis is based on syntactical language patterns. This restriction has the advantage that the verb mention is used as the independent variable in the experiments enabling comparability of results in the usage of the verbs. The initial selection of verbs has been generated from a systematic analysis of the scientific literature and existing corpora for PPIs. We distinguish modifying interactions (MIs) such as posttranslational modifications (PTMs) from non-modifying interactions (NMIs) and assumed that MIs have a higher predictive capacity due to stronger scientific evidence proving the interaction. We found that MIs are less frequent in the corpus but can be extracted at the same precision levels as PPIs. A significant portion of correct PPI reportings in the BioCreAtIve II corpus use the verb “associate”, which semantically does not prove a relation. The performance of every monitored verb is listed and allows the selection of specific verbs to improve the performance of PPI <b>extraction</b> <b>solutions.</b> Programmatic access to the text processing modules is available online (www. ebi. ac. uk/webservices/whatizit/info. jsf) and the full analysis of Medline abstracts will be made through the Web pages of the Rebholz group...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Given the {{increase}} in crop yields {{and the expansion of}} agriculture in low fertility soils, deficiency of micronutrients, such as iron, in plants grown in tropical soils has been observed. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate Fe availability and Fe uptake by corn (Zea mays L.) plants in 13 different soils, at two depths. Iron was extracted by Mehlich- 1, Mehlich- 3, and CaCl 2 (Fe-CC) and was fractionated in forms related to low (Feo) and high (Fed) crystallinity pedogenic oxyhydroxides, and organic matter (Fep) using ammonium oxalate, dithionite-citrate, and sodium pyrophosphate, respectively. In order to relate Fe availability to soil properties and plant growth, an experiment was carried out in a semi-hydroponic system in which part of the roots developed in a nutrient solution (without Fe) and part in the soil (the only source of Fe). Forty-five days after seeding, we quantified shoot dry matter and leaf Fe concentration and content. Fed levels were high, from 5 to 132 g kg- 1, and Feo and Fe-CC levels were low, indicating the predominance of Fe as crystalline oxyhydroxides and a low content of Fe readily available to plants. The <b>extraction</b> <b>solutions</b> showed significant correlations with various soil properties, many common to both, indicating that they act similarly. The correlation between the Mehlich- 1 and Mehlich- 3 <b>extraction</b> <b>solutions</b> was highly significant. However, these two extraction methods were inefficient in predicting Fe availability to plants. There was a positive correlation between dry matter and Fe levels in plant shoots, even within the ranges considered adequate in the soil and in the plant. Dry matter production and leaf Fe concentration and content were positively correlated with Fep concentration, indicating that the Fe fraction related to soil organic matter most contributes to Fe availability to plants...|$|R
