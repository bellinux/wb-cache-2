Spears stated, [...] "The video is more sensual than I'm used to [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> time doing a collaboration and I got Madonna.

In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, [...] "Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So {{it was a challenge}} to kind of bring both of the worlds together.

Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?'

[...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future.
