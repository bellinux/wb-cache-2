Her homecoming, however, {{was to be}} delayed. On the 15th, while New Jersey was still at sea, North Korean jet fighters shot down an unarmed EC-121 Constellation electronic surveillance plane over the Sea of Japan, killing its entire crew. A carrier task force was formed {{and sent to the}} Sea of Japan, while New Jersey was ordered to come about and steam toward Japan. On the 22nd she arrived once more at Yokosuka, and immediately put to sea in readiness <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> befall.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} part {{he would play}} in the war would occur at the Battle of Abydos. Alcibiades had remained behind at Samos with a small force while Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus led {{the greater part of}} the fleet to the Hellespont. During this period, Alcibiades succeeded in raising money from Caria and the neighboring area, with which he was able to pay the rowers and gain their favor. After the Athenian victory at Cynossema, both fleets summoned all their ships from around the Aegean to join them <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be a decisive next engagement.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{visited the}} RCA Dome {{for the second}} AFC divisional playoff game of the 2005 season. In the fourth quarter {{with only a few}} minutes left in the game, Manning threw what looked to be the game-ending {{interception}} to safety Troy Polamalu, but the interception was overturned (a call the NFL later admitted was incorrect). The Colts went on to score, and got the ball back down three points {{near the end of the}} game. On fourth down, Manning was sacked near his own goal line, and the game seemed to be over as the Steelers were one yard from a touchdown. On the next play, the ball was fumbled by running back Jerome Bettis and picked up by Colts defender Nick Harper who appeared to have a clear path down the sideline <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have been the game-winning score. However, Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger dove in front of Harper and tackled him by the leg, saving a touchdown. Then the Colts drove down the field to the Steelers 27-yard line, before Mike Vanderjagt missed a field goal as time ran out.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no natural}} {{candidate}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> cause {{what has been}} called dark energy but the current best guess is that it is the zero-point energy of the vacuum. One difficulty with this assumption is that the zero-point energy of the vacuum is absurdly large compared to the observed cosmological constant. In general relativity, mass and energy are equivalent; both produce a gravitational field and therefore the theorized vacuum energy of quantum field theory should have led the universe ripping itself to pieces. This obviously has not happened and this issue, called the cosmological constant problem, {{is one of the greatest}} unsolved mysteries in physics.|$|E

500|$|Game {{planning}} {{began in}} summer 2004. Initially, about six developers {{started with a}} [...] "clean slate" [...] to conceptualize a new Star Wars game; {{the small group of}} engineers, artists, and designers spent more than a year brainstorming ideas <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> make a good game. Over 100 initial concepts were whittled down to 20 to 25 that included making the game the third entry in the [...] series or having the protagonist be a Wookiee [...] "superhero", Darth Maul, a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a mercenary, or the last member of the Skywalker family. The decision to focus on the largely unexplored period between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope helped energize the design team. Consumer feedback helped the developers narrow in on seven concepts, and elements from those seven went into The Force Unleasheds overall concept.|$|E

[...] Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "A lot of characters out of the woodwork come back for the season-ending cliffhanger [...] But that's all window-dressing for a trio of big surprises that wrap up Season 7, in what many consider the show's death knell, or perhaps just a proper ending." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two noted that, {{despite the fact that it}} capped-off a [...] "lacklustre [...] " [...] season, the episode still managed to provide a good enough cliffhanger to hold fans until the premiere of the eighth season. Shearman and Pearson further noted that [...] "against the odds, after all the disappointments of the year, 'Requiem' is strong enough to leave its audience wanting more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between 1951 and 1968 under Hayes, the Buckeyes won 12 of 18 contests, {{including}} a 1957 victory in Michigan Stadium, {{the first game}} in the series attended by over 100,000 fans. In 1958, Ohio State had a 20–14 lead {{towards the end of}} the game. On the final play, Michigan fullback Gene Sisinyak ran the ball from the one-yard line <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have been a game-winning touchdown, but Ohio State defensive tackle Dick Schafrath hit Sisinyak, forcing a fumble. In the 1968 game, Ohio State won 50–14, outscoring its foe 29–0 in the second half and attempting an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt on its final touchdown. In the post-game interview Hayes was asked why he went for two points with an already insurmountable 50–14 lead and he replied, [...] "because I couldn't go for three". The victory gave top-ranked Ohio State the Big Ten title for the first time in seven years en route to an AP national championship. The Buckeyes had also narrowed the series margin to 37–24–4.|$|E
2500|$|Scientists often {{look for}} Fermi {{estimates}} of {{the answer to a}} problem before turning to more sophisticated methods to calculate a precise answer. This provides a useful check on the results. While the estimate is almost certainly incorrect, it is also a simple calculation that allows for easy error checking, and to find faulty assumptions if the figure produced is far beyond what we might reasonably expect. By contrast, precise calculations can be extremely complex but with the expectation that the answer they produce is correct. The far larger number of factors and operations involved can obscure a very significant error, either in mathematical process or in the assumptions the equation is based on, but the result may still be assumed to be right because it has been derived from a precise formula that is expected to yield good results. Without a reasonable frame of reference to work from it is seldom clear if a result is acceptably precise or is many degrees of magnitude (tens or hundreds of times) too big or too small. The Fermi estimation gives a quick, simple way to obtain this frame of reference <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> reasonably be expected to be the answer, giving context to the results.|$|E
