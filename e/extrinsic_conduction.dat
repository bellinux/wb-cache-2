Both enhancement and suppression of the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>conduction</b> has been found experimentally {{in addition to an}} enhancement at very high temperatures in the intrinsic region I'. These effects can be explained in terms of dislocations and their interactions during plastic flow.

40|$|The {{microwave}} (MW) {{dielectric loss}} (or quality factor, Q) of BaCo 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3 O 3 (BCN) ceramics exhibits a strong dependence on sample-processing conditions {{and is not}} always consistent with the degree of 1 : 2 B-site cation ordering. Impedance spectroscopy results reveal that these BCN ceramics exhibit remarkably different electrical properties due to low levels of nonstoichiometry induced during ceramic processing. These compositional changes are difficult to detect by common chemical techniques but can have a significant influence on the electrical properties, and in particular on the extrinsic electrical conduction and Q. The influence of <b>extrinsic</b> <b>conduction</b> induced by ceramic processing should therefore be considered when optimizing Q in MW dielectric ceramics...|$|E

40|$|By using {{techniques}} of rapid quenching from the melt, metastable phases {{have been obtained}} in ternary alloys which contain tellurium as a major component {{and two of the}} three noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) as minor components. The metastable phases found in this investigation are either simple cubic or amorphous. The formation of the simple cubic phase is discussed. The electrical resistance and the thermoelectric power of the simple cubic alloy (Au 30 Te 70) have been measured and interpreted in terms of atomic bondings. The semiconducting properties of a metastable amorphous alloy (Au 5 Cu 25 Te 70) have been measured. The experimental results are discussed in connection with a theoretical consideration of the validity of band theory in an amorphous solid.

40|$|The {{electrical}} resistances of ~-rhombohedraloand tetragonal polycrystall ine boron {{were measured}} at temperatures from 25 to 300 Cand pressures from 1 atm to 60 kb (ki lobars); the thermoelectric power was measured to 13 kb. Pressures were applied with an anvil press. With increasing temperature the resistance, R, continually decreased and the thermoelectric power, Q, at first increased and then levelled off. The {{shapes of the}} log R vs. 1 /T and Q. vs. T curves are explained by intrinsic conduction at high temperatures going to <b>extrinsic</b> <b>conduction</b> at the lowest temperatures studied. In the intrinsic re-gion an increase in pressure causes {{a reduction in the}} resistance, energy gap, and thermoelectric power of boron.

40|$|Lattice dynamics, {{low-temperature}} electrical transport, and high-temperature thermoelectric {{properties of}} (In, Yb) -doped CoSb 3 thin films on different substrates are reported. Pulsed laser deposition under optimized conditions yielded single-phase polycrystalline skutterudite films. Raman spectroscopy studies suggested that In and Yb dopants occupy the cage {{sites in the}} skutterudite lattice. Low-temperature electrical transport studies revealed the n-type semiconducting nature of the films with <b>extrinsic</b> and intrinsic <b>conduction</b> mechanisms, {{in sharp contrast to}} the degenerate nature reported for identical bulk samples. Calculations yielded a direct bandgap close to 50 meV with no evidence of an indirect gap. The carrier concentration of the films was identical to that reported for the bulk and increased with temperature beyond 250 K. The higher resistivity exhibited is attributed to the enhanced grain boundary scattering in films with a high concentration of grains. The maximum power factor of ∼ 0. 68 W m− 1 K− 1 obtained at 660 K for the film on glass is found to be nearly four times smaller compared to that reported for the bulk. The observed difference in the power factors of the films on different substrates is explained on the basis of the diffusion of oxygen from the substrates and the formation of highly conducting CoSb 2 phase upon the oxidation of CoSb 3...|$|R
40|$|Electric and {{magnetic}} properties of bulk and nano cobalt ferrite and modified with Bi 3 +, Cr 3 + and K 2 CrO 4 in nano level have been investigated. Bulk cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2 O 4) system was prepared by conventional solid state route and nano CoFe 2 O 4 system was prepared by auto combustion method {{of the chemical}} route. The contribution of microstructures (intrinsic grain and extrinsic grain boundary, sample surface-electrode contact) to the conduction mechanism was investigated by complex impedance spectroscopic analysis. Both the intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>conductions</b> were observed in the bulk cobalt ferrite system whereas intrinsic grain conduction is found absent in its nano system. It is observed that though the room temperature resistivity of the nano system is higher than bulk one but the rate of decrease in resistance with elevated temperature is higher in former case. Perhaps, {{this may be the}} reason behind the early surface-conduction in nano system. The high resistance of nano system at room temperature (RT) is due to the increase in density of high resistive grain boundaries. The high dielectric loss in nano system {{may be due to the}} early conduction of charge carriers in high resistive regions in comparison to bulk system. It is observed that the saturation magnetization of bulk cobalt ferrite was found to be higher than nano system. However, coercivity is higher in nano-cobalt ferrite which can be related to the surface spin effects. Bismuth substituted nano cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2 -xBixO 4, x= 0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 15) samples were prepared by auto combustion technique. The single phase XRD pattern confirmed the successful substitution of the larger cation. Surface morphology from FESEM image indicated the control average particle growth (50 nm – 160 nm) as an effect of bismuth substitution. The increased particle size has effectively modified the electrical properties of the system in three major ways: (a) increase in resistivity, (b) evolution of grain relaxation and (c) reduction in dielectric loss and surface conduction. Additionally, magnetic behavior is also affected due to control particle growth. Magnetic hysteresis study at room temperature confirmed the rise in saturation magnetization (MS = 74. 5 to 86. 5 emu/g.) and reduction in coercivity (HC = 1633 to 1524 Oe). The samples of CoFe 2 -xCrxO 4 (x = 0, 0. 15, 0. 3) series were prepared by auto combustion route. X-ray diffraction technique was used to confirm the phase formation and structure analysis. The surface morphology of samples was imaged by the field emission scanning electron microscope. The average particle size was found to be 55, 43 and 35 nm for x= 0, 0. 15, 0. 3 respectively. The substitution of Cr 3 + in the parent systems caused a significant reduction in particle size. The samples were subjected to magnetic characterization and also studied with Mossbauer spectroscopy at room temperature. Analysis of extracted parameters from Mossbauer spectroscopy concluded that Cr 3 + has replaced the Fe 3 + at B-site (octahedral). The decrease in magnetization at B-site was responsible for the observed reduced saturation magnetization and coercivity. The Cole-Cole plots of impedance showed the growth of semicircle describing the effect of grain boundary and the suppression of semicircle describing the electrode-sample surface conduction effect. The increasing radius of Cole-Cole semicircles indicated the enhancement of the material resistivity which was also confirmed by the dc resistivity measurement. All these results were explained on the basis of occupancy of Cr 3 + at B-site, surface anisotropy potential and reduced particle size. The parent cobalt ferrite system further modified with K 2 CrO 4 in which chromium exists in its highest oxidation state (6 +). The samples were synthesized by the auto-combustion method with different dopant concentration. The modified systems contain all the characteristic XRD peaks of cobalt ferrite and no peaks related to secondary phases are observed. The effect of dopant further reduces the particle size and at its higher percentage, the particle size is reduced to 15 nm. An interesting result of metallic to semiconducting transition behavior is observed in the modified cobalt ferrite system of higher dopant concentration. From the impedance spectroscopic analysis it is revealed that grain conduction was active in the temperature belt of metallic region. The variations of magnetic moment along with coercivity with addition of K 2 CrO 4 were explained on the basis of particle size...|$|R

40|$|Cuprous {{chloride}} is {{a direct}} wide bandgap (Eg = ~ 3. 4 eV) semiconductor with a large excitonic binding energy (~ 190 meV). In this study, CuCl has been deposited by the vacuum evaporation method {{on a variety of}} substrates (amorphous silica glass, indium tin oxide (ITO) coated on glass and Silicon (100)) substrates, encapsulated and characterized as a potential material for optoelectronic applications. Some of the samples were also oxygen plasma treated for durations of 1, 2 and 3 minutes, respectively. Room temperature x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show that CuCl grows preferentially in a (111) orientation irrespective of the underlying substrate. Microstructural properties of the films gave nearly the same values for untreated CuCl films deposited on glass, ITO and Si substrates (particle size, L = 9. 6 nm ± 1 nm). On the other hand, the microstructural properties of the plasma treated films vary as a function of plasma treatment duration. At 10 K, the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the untreated CuCl/Si films using 244 nm excitation reveals four peaks: the Z₃ free exciton occurring at 3. 203 ± 0. 003 eV, the I₁ impurity bound exciton located at 3. 181 ± 0. 003 eV, the M free biexciton occurring at 3. 160 ± 0. 003 eV and N₁ impurity bound to bi-exciton located at 3. 135 ± 0. 003 eV. However, the 20 K PL spectra of the untreated CuCl films deposited on all three substrates (using a 325 nm excitation) revealed only the Z₃ free exciton, the I₁ impurity bound exciton and the N₁ impurity bound biexciton at 3. 204 eV, 3. 18 eV and 3. 152 eV, respectively, irrespective of the underlying substrate. The room temperature PL spectra of the films were dominated by the Z₃ free exciton. The measured band gap increased as the temperature increases, which is opposite to most conventional semiconductors. This anomalous effect is believed to be related to electron-phonon renormalization or coupling of the electronic structure of CuCl. On the other hand the PL spectra of the O₂ plasma immersed film were all mainly dominated by the free Z₃ free exciton only. In addition, at low temperatures a broad band ascribed to an oxygen related emission process is observed at ~ 3 eV in all the plasma treated samples. The band gap of the O₂ plasma immersed films follow the anomalous temperature dependency in a similar manner to the untreated films; however the plasma treated films were less sensitive to temperature. Both steady state DC and AC impedance spectroscopy experiments suggested that the untreated CuCl is a mixed ionic-electronic semiconductor material. Room temperature steady state DC measurements using reversible electrodes (Cu) gave an Ohmic response while using irreversible electrodes (Au) gave an exponential I–V behaviour, both in conformance with Wagner’s defect chemistry analysis of a mixed ionicelectronic material. An electronic conductivity of the order of 2. 3 × 10 - 7 S/cm was deduced to be in coexistence with Cu⁺ ionic conductivity using irreversible electrodes (Au), while a total conductivity of the order of 6. 5 × 10 - 7 S/cm was obtained using reversible electrodes (Cu) at room temperature. The Arrhenius plot of the electrical characteristics of the untreated films reveal two distinct regimes corresponding to electronic conduction below ~ 270 K and a Cu⁺ <b>extrinsic</b> ionic <b>conduction</b> mechanism ix above that temperature. Due to the fact that at low temperatures, the thermal energy is inadequate for maintaining considerable ionic motion, it follows that the mode of conduction at lower temperatures is ascribed to electronic processes. On the other hand, the Arrhenius plot of the plasma treated films showed a single regime throughout most of the temperature range. This is interpreted to be an electronically dominant conduction mechanism. The large increase in the conductivity of the treated CuCl films (over 100 fold) is ascribed to effect of oxygen introducing an acceptor state in CuCl films. This {{is due to the fact}} that oxygen dissolves in cuprous halides on substitutional anionic sites. Cathodic deposition of Cu metal via electrolytic decomposition was observed when a steady state voltage greater than 5 V was applied to both the untreated and the plasma treated films. This poses a great challenge in utilizing this material to fabricate optoelectronic devices under the influence of steady state source. The untreated films were successfully encapsulated using organic polysilsesquioxane (PSSQ) and cyclo olefin copolymer (COC) dielectrics. However, both encapsulants failed to prevent the O 2 plasma immersed films from oxidising, and this will also represent a future challenge for this technology...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} some fundamental understandings of mechanism {{related to the}} dielectric, ferroelectric and impedance spectroscopic study of AgNbO 3 and its modified systems. The results analysis are mostly qualitative in nature which has accounted previous reported facts while explaining as well as added some new concepts that fits to be more appropriate. The quantitative figures are less stressed in order {{to focus more on}} the underlying physics for different mechanisms of some particular electric properties in the titled compounds. The modified systems are designed by partially incorporating impurity atoms at the B-site of the ABO 3 perovskite compound. The impurity atoms are chosen of isovalent (Ta 5 +, Sb 5 +, V 5 +) as well as alieovalent (Mn 4 +, W 6 +, Ti 4 +) in nature. The alieovalent impurities are chosen to design charge carrier (electron/hole) -doped systems. The effect of Jahn-Teller ions (Mn 3 +, W 5 + and Ti 3 +) on the ferroelectric properties also understood and properly explained. The role of impurities in bringing structural and microstructural changes and their effect on dielectric, ferroelectric and other electric properties of the compound is extensively analysed and discussed in the subsequent chapters. This work was carried out to improve the dielectric and ferroelectric properties of AgNbO 3 to be an alternative for the hazardous lead (Pb) based ferroelectrics. This is because the dynamics of cations (Ag, Nb) and nature of Ag-O, Nb-O bonds in AgNbO 3 features similarly to that of the dynamics of cations in Pb-based compounds. The compound exhibits an exceptionally large spontaneous polarisation(52 μC/cm 2) in its polycrystalline form at sufficient applied field (220 kV/cm) and iscomparable to 50 μC/cm 2 of polycrystalline PbTiO 3 ceramic, at room temperature. But, the former shows a poor 0. 041 μC/cm 2 at 12 kV which is quite lower than the latter, which is a matter of concern. Multiple dielectric anomalies also appear in the temperature dependent permittivity of the compound which is related to the complex coupling between NbO 6 octahedra and the cations dynamics. Therefore, numbers of modifications were carried out to verify the effects of dopants on dielectric and ferroelectric parameters and to understand the underlying science of several mechanisms. Solid state synthesis route is chosen to prepare samples for the investigated compound (AgNbO 3) in which required oxide materials are taken as raw precursors (Ag 2 O, Nb 2 O 5). Manual grinding is opted in order to properly mix the oxide powders for their homogeneous presence. Calcination and sintering are two thermal processes which are followed to bring the desired phase of the compound and to densify the pellet type sample for various experiments. The modified systems are titled with the element oxide (Ta 2 O 5, Sb 2 O 5, V 2 O 5, MnO 2, WO 3, TiO 2) -doped AgNbO 3 systems. The amount of element oxides is measured in molecular weight fraction of Nb 2 O 5 in order to partially incorporate the metal elements in place of Nb, at the B-site of ABO 3 perovskite structure. All the prepared samples are characterised with X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM) /Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and RAMAN spectroscopy to extract the structure and microstructure information. The frequency dependent electrical parameters (impedance, dielectric loss, phase angle and capacitance) are collected with the help of Impedance analyser within a broad range of temperature from room temperature (RT), 25 oC to 450 oC. The temperature dependent dielectric constant is extracted from the impedance data to examine the nature of dielectric anomalies, the effect of modification on dielectric constants, Curie temperatures and dielectric losses of the compounds. The polarisation-electric field (P-E) hysteresis loops for all the samples are collected by Radiant precision loop tracer. The role of precipitated silver particles in AgNbO 3 is thoroughly and systematically investigated by complex impedance spectroscopy within frequency and temperature domain of 100 Hz to 1 MHz and 25 oC to 450 oC respectively. Extensive analysis over relaxation mechanisms verified that only intrinsic (grain) conduction is the major contributing source. The absence of <b>extrinsic</b> (interfacial) <b>conduction</b> indicates that the precipitated silver nano particles has no active role in the electrical properties as these are supposed to be deposited in various interfaces. In the isovalent metal oxides doping, satisfactory results in ferroelectric properties came in Sb 2 O 5 -doped and V 2 O 5 -doped systems. In the Sb 2 O 5 -doped system, the improved P-E loop appeared at higher applied field. MnO 2 -doped AgNbO 3 systems are prepared successfully by retaining the phase of the parent system. Low concentration of MnO 2 was substituted in molecular weight fraction (x = 0. 02, 0. 04) of Nb 2 O 5 to prepare the modified AgNbO 3 compound by solid state route, with an object to partially incorporate Mn 4 + in place of Nb 5 + site. The XPS results identify the presence of manganese in Mn 4 + and Mn 3 +state. The ferroelectric parameters were improved and results were properly discussed. WO 3 -doped AgNbO 3 systems were successfully prepared by retaining the phase of the parent system. Low concentration of WO 3 was substituted in molecular weight fraction (x = 0. 02, 0. 04) of Nb 2 O 5 to prepare the modified AgNbO 3 with an object to incorporate W 6 + in place of Nb 5 + to design the electron doped systems. XPS peaks identify the presence of tungsten in W 6 + and W 5 + state and hence confirm the possible hole doping in the modified systems. In the AWN 2 system, the ferroelectric properties reduced but in AWN 4 system, significant increase in the parameters was observed which were analysed with possible reasons. Transition metal oxide TiO 2 was selected to dope with the AgNbO 3 system in order to partially incorporate Ti 4 + in place of Nb 5 + cation. XPS results confirmed the presence of Ti 4 + and Ti 3 + state and hence the possible hole doping in the system was successful. In the TiO 2 -doped systems, though ferroelectric parameters exhibited high enhanced value but the shape of the loop approaches lossy feature. Apart from this, the effect of modifications on structure, microstructure, dielectric constant, tangent loss, activation energy, resistance of the materials were accurately reported, sincerely analysed and properly discussed. The thesis provides some qualitative information regarding the titled compound which will benefit the other researchers to go for other transition metal oxide modifications. The properties of the modified systems are also suitable to be used in capacitors and memory applications. ...|$|R
