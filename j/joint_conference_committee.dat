50|$|This was {{the first}} time in four years that the Senate had {{approved}} its own budget resolution, allowing the possibility of 'regular order' procedures in which the Senate and House appoint representatives to a <b>joint</b> budget <b>conference</b> <b>committee</b> to negotiate a compromise. Democratic Party members of the House Appropriations Committee wrote a letter on 17 April 2013 urging Speaker Boehner to appoint House members to the budget <b>conference</b> <b>committee.</b> Slate political correspondent John Dickerson argued that Democrats were eager to begin conference discussions because they believed that Republicans would not be able to defend their 'no taxes' position when working with actual budget numbers. Under <b>conference</b> <b>committee</b> rules, the Senate Democrats would gain the power to force the committee to vote, which in Dickerson's view caused Republicans to worry about being embarrassed.|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{regulations}} promulgated {{under the law}} required additional funding for women's teams, athletic directors did not immediately embrace the requirements.

The NCAA, which regulated men's intercollegiate sports, raised money to help fight Title IX. [...] In 1974 the Senate passed the Tower Amendment, which decreed that Title IX did not cover football or other revenue-producing sports.

40|$|In {{order to}} fill California’s $ 24 billion budget deficit, Governor Schwarzenegger has {{proposed}} a budget that would make severe cuts to spending on vital {{health and human services}} programs. In June, the <b>joint</b> Budget <b>Conference</b> <b>Committee</b> approved a budget that accepted some of the Governor’s proposals, made other spending cuts, and increased revenues. 1 This brief describes the significant negative economic impacts of the proposals, especially with respect to health care. Due to the nature of public health care programs and the significant financial participation of the federal government, the negative economic impacts of the cuts are significantly greater. Specifically, the economic impacts of the Governor’s proposed budget cuts include: • California will lose $ 7. 5 billion in federal funds for health, human service, and other programs next year alone. • Over 600, 000 Californian jobs will be lost. • The state’s economy (GDP) will shrink by more than two percent. • Over two million more Californians will lose health coverage, increasing the number of uninsured by one-third. The Budget <b>Conference</b> <b>Committee</b> budget package will still {{have a significant impact on}} the economy, but far less severe than the Governor’s proposal. Specifically, the economic impacts of the Budget <b>Conference</b> <b>Committee</b> budget package include: • California will lose over $ 1. 2 billion in federal funds for health and other programs this year alone. • About 220, 000 Californian jobs will be lost. • The state’s economy (GDP) will shrink by almost 1. 3 percent. • An estimated 550, 000 more Californians will lose health coverage. While the state faces significant financial challenges, there are better budget choices for California than the ones the Governor has proposed. For example, cuts to health care have four times the negative economic impact of a high-income tax increase. As such, the Legislature should consider revenues in their approach to the budget, which would result in fewer lost jobs and a less significant negative impact on the economy...|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, Congress {{passed the}} Handicapped Children’s Protection Act, {{allowing}} parents who prevail in due process hearings and litigation under the IDEA to recover their legal fees and costs. The language was modeled on similar {{provisions in the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5k). [...] Congress’ <b>Joint</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>Committee</b> Report explained that the courts would have discretion to award attorneys’ fees {{as part of the}} costs of litigation. It noted that “The conferees intend that the term ‘attorneys’ fees as part of the costs’ include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian’s case in the action or proceeding.” [...] The statute also directed the GAO to study the costs to parents, including costs of “attorneys andconsultants” in IDEA proceedings.|$|E
5000|$|March 9, 2006 - Bush {{signs the}} USA PATRIOT Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 into law. The act amended {{the law for}} the interim {{appointment}} of U.S. Attorneys by deleting two provisions: (a) the 120-day maximum term for the Attorney General's interim appointees, and (b) the subsequent interim appointment authority of Federal District Courts. (The text to the statute (U.S.C Title 28, Section 546), and its amendments, may be found at Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy#Law references). With the revision, an interim appointee can potentially serve indefinitely (though still removable by the President), if the President declines to nominate a U.S. Attorney for a vacancy, or the Senate either fails to act on a Presidential nomination, or rejects a nominee different from the interim appointee. The change was written into the bill by Republican Senator Arlen Specter when the bill was modified in <b>joint</b> <b>conference</b> <b>committee,</b> reconciling the Senate and House versions of the bill.|$|E
