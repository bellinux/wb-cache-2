Based {{on the results}} of 12 case studies, this research has adopted a dynamic perspective. It has focused on the implementation and subsequent evolution of <b>intranets,</b> the ways they are shaped by and impact diverse aspects of organisational life, including strategic management and daily tasks. It shows that gradual and radical changes are not mutually exclusive but complementary. On the one hand, <b>intranets</b> evolve incrementally, by co-construction of their technical and organisational dimensions. On the other hand, they experience substantial changes aimed at interpreting them in new ways. This dual pace is noticeable in the changes <b>intranets</b> provide on critical organisational dimensions, such as information management and human resources policies. Finally, this dynamic perspective underscores how new balances in traditional managerial tensions may be reached {{as a result of these}} radical and progressive co-evolutions between <b>intranets</b> and organisations...|$|R

40|$|This work {{shows how}} the {{characteristics}} of the current business environment, in which knowledge and human resources are considered of high importance, should be propitious for implanting technologies like <b>intranets.</b> Nevertheless, this is not happening in Spain's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). One of the causes of the low rate of adoption is the difficulty for managers to value and measure the benefits generated by <b>intranets</b> inside the organisations. With the traditional methods of economic valuation being questioned, we present the example of an analysis of benefits that <b>intranets</b> generated for 80 SMEs of the ICT sector, carried out by means of a methodology of measurement that combines qualitative and quantitative indicators. The results obtained show the positive contribution of <b>intranets</b> to these organisations...|$|R

E-DRM, now more commonly referenced as IRM (Information Rights Management), is generally intended to prevent the unauthorized use (such as industrial or corporate espionage or inadvertent release) of proprietary documents.

This paper provides findings from two interpretive case studies that illustrate how corporate <b>intranets</b> can be dynamically interwoven with other knowledge technologies in socio-technical networks (STNs) to integrate distributed formal and infonnal knowledge. A key finding suggests that businesses should carefully examine employee use of <b>intranets</b> for dynamic knowledge integration, and any implications stemming from this new integrative role for <b>intranets.</b> The paper also provides a theoretical framework for dynamic knowledge integration in STNs, which can underpin future research in this area. <br /...|$|R

By the 1990s, the library was able to access thousands of U.S. and foreign newspapers and magazines, highly specialized biographic and subject information, and U.S. government and think tank documents through commercial and government databases. The development of the Department's <b>Intranet</b> on the Open Net system has made the resources of the library accessible to Department employees worldwide.
