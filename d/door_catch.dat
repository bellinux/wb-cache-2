50|$|Essentially the {{new model}} was a revised and updated version of the 308 GTS, which had survived for eight years without any radical change to the overall shape, albeit with various changes to the 3-litre engine. The 328 model {{presented}} a softening of the wedge profile of its predecessor, with a redesigned nose that had a more rounded shape, which was complemented by similar treatment to the tail valance panel. The revised nose and tail sections featured body colour bumpers integral with the valance panels, which reflected the work done concurrently to present the Mondial 3.2 models, with which they also shared a similar radiator grille and front light assembly layout. Thus all the eight-cylinder cars in the range shared fairly unified front and rear aspects, providing a homogeneous family image. The exhaust air louvres behind the retractable headlight pods on the 308 series disappeared, coupled {{with an increase in}} the size of the front lid radiator exhaust air louvre, which had been introduced on the 308 Quattrovalvole models, whilst a new style and position of exterior <b>door</b> <b>catch</b> was also provided. The interior trim also had a thorough overhaul, with new designs for the seat panel upholstery and stitching, revised door panels and pulls, together with more modern switchgear, which complemented the external updating details. Optional equipment available was air conditioning, metallic paint, Pirelli P7 tyres, a leather dashboard, leather headlining to the removable roof panel plus rear window surround, and a rear aerofoil (standard on Japanese market models).|$|E
40|$|Everyone {{has seen}} a bar magnet {{in the form of}} a compass or a <b>door</b> <b>catch.</b> Anyone who has ever casually played with magnets or {{magnetic}} toys knows that magnets interact with other magnets; i. e., a magnet experiences a force caused by thp presence of an external magnetic field produced by the other magnet. A wire carrying a current experiences a force caused by the presence of a nearby magnet (as you saw in the module Magnetic Forces). We then expect the converse to also hold true, i. e., that the bar magnet will also experience a force from the presence of the current-carrying wire. This expectation can be verified experimentally by putting a compass needle near a current-carrying wire. Thus both a bar magnet and a current-carrying wire produce a magnetic field. A bar magnet, however, cannot be broken down into a single magnetic pole similar to the electric charge. Even on the atomic scale, there are always two magnetic poles similar to the two magnetic poles produced by a small loop of current-carrying wire. A bar magnet is really just a collection of atomic current loops or charges in motion. In this module (and the module Magnetic Forces), you are actually investigating the interaction at a distance of moving electric charges (e. g., electric currents). The intermediary in this interaction is the magnetic field B(r). By introducing B, you separate the interaction into two parts: (1) creation of the B field by given currents (to be treated in this module), and (2) the action of this field on other given currents or moving charges (which you studied in Magnetic Forces). Along beside the other memorable force relations involving magnetic fields, you will now add to your collection of fond memories the field relations known as Ampere 2 ̆ 7 s Law and the Biot-Savart Law. (Please note: The latter is pronounced Bee-oh Sah-var 2 ̆ 7. ...|$|E

40|$|Therefore, the {{detector}} of foreign objects caught in doors with improved function for preventing passenger dragging accidents {{is required to}} have a function to detect objects without failing to stop the train in A and B, while not detecting objects to prevent excessive inhibition of train operation in C. Changes were thus made {{in order to ensure}} detection of those foreign objects in doors. The foreign object detector has a rubber tube called a “detection tube ” in the door stop rubber and a pressure sensor that measures the fluctuation of internal air pressure of the detection tube. In this detection mechanism, a foreign object is detected when the <b>doors</b> <b>catch</b> the object and press the detection tube to deform it.

5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the <b>door,</b> first <b>catches</b> sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the <b>door</b> to <b>catch</b> a glimpse of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules {{at the top of}} his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|R
