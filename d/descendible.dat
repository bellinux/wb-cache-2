I {{will give you the}} law, briefly: <b>descendible</b> estates among us are of two kinds, estates in fee simple and estates in fee tail. Had your grandfather died without a will, his estate, which we suppose to be in fee simple, would have descended to you as the son of his eldest son, according to the fourth of the canons of descent in Blackstone. But with us fee simple estates are devisable, and Mr. Carvel was wholly within his right in cutting off the line of his eldest son. Do you follow me?" ...|$|E
60|$|I mean {{to prove}} the direct {{contrary}} of everything that has been said on this subject by the prisoner's counsel, or by himself. I mean {{to prove that the}} people of India have laws, rights, and immunities; that they have property, movable and immovable, <b>descendible</b> as well as occasional; that they have property held for life, and that they have it as well secured to them by the laws of their country as any property is secured in this country; that they feel for honor, not only as much as your Lordships can feel, but with a more exquisite and poignant sense than any people upon earth; and that, when punishments are inflicted, it is not the lash they feel, but the disgrace: in short, I mean to prove that every word which Montesquieu has taken from idle and inconsiderate travellers is absolutely false.|$|E
60|$|First, {{the people}} are divided into classes and ranks, with more {{accuracy}} of distinction than is used in this country, {{or in any other}} country under heaven. Every class is divided into families, some of whom are more distinguished and more honorable than others; and they all have rights, privileges, and immunities belonging to them. Even in cases of conquest, no confiscation is to take place. A Brahmin's estate comes by descent to him; it is forever <b>descendible</b> to his heirs, if he has heirs; and if he has none, it belongs to his disciples, and those connected with him in the Brahminical caste. There are other immunities declared to belong to this caste, in direct contradiction to what has been asserted by the prisoner. In no case shall a Brahmin suffer death; in no case shall the property of a Brahmin, male or female, be confiscated for crime, or escheat for want of heirs. The law then goes on to other castes, and gives to each its property, and distinguishes them with great accuracy of discrimination.|$|E
60|$|My Lords, the Commons of Great Britain are not {{disposed}} {{to resort to}} the ridiculous relations of travellers, or to the wild systems which ingenious men have thought proper to build on their authority. We will take another mode. We will undertake to prove the direct contrary of his assertions in every point and particular. We undertake to do this, because your Lordships know, and because the world knows, that, {{if you go into}} a country where you suppose man to be in a servile state,--where, the despot excepted, there is no one person who can lift up his head above another,--where all are a set of vile, miserable slaves, prostrate and confounded in a common servitude, having no <b>descendible</b> lands, no inheritance, nothing that makes man feel proud of himself, or that gives him honor and distinction with others,--this abject degradation will take from you that kind of sympathy which naturally attaches you to men feeling like yourselves, to men who have hereditary dignities to support, and lands of inheritance to maintain, as you peers have; you will, I say, no longer have that feeling which you ought to have for the sufferings of a people whom you suppose to be habituated to their sufferings and familiar with degradation. This makes it absolutely necessary for me to refute every one of these misrepresentations; and whilst I am endeavoring to establish the rights of these people, in order to show in what manner and degree they have been violated, I trust that your Lordships will not think that the time is lost: certainly I do not think that my labor will be misspent in endeavoring to bring these matters fully before you.|$|E
50|$|An {{estate in}} fee simple denotes the maximum {{ownership}} in land that can be legally granted; it is the greatest possible aggregate of rights, powers, privileges and immunities available in land. The three hallmarks of the fee simple estate are that it is alienable, devisable and <b>descendible.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} a base fee is an estate <b>descendible</b> to heirs general, but {{terminable}} on an uncertain event; for example, a grant of land to A and his heirs, tenants of the manor of Dale. The estate terminates whenever the prescribed qualification ceases. An early meaning of base fee was an estate held not by free or military service, but by base service, i.e. at {{the will of the}} lord.|$|E

5000|$|Shaw Family Archives Ltd. v. CMG Worldwide, Inc., 486 F.Supp.2d 309 (S.D.N.Y., 2007) {{ruled on}} May 7, 2007 that {{in regard to}} Marilyn Monroe, because she died before California's Celebrity Rights Act was passed in 1985, {{and the state of}} New York does not {{recognize}} a right of publicity after the artist's death, her name, image, and voice are now in the public domain in the states of California and New York. By implication, they would also be in the public domain in any state that, at the time of Monroe's death in 1962, did not recognize a right of publicity that survived the artist's death. In response to that court ruling, California passed legislation that created <b>descendible</b> rights of publicity that last 70 years after death, retroactively for any person deceased after January 1, 1938. A similar law has failed in the New York Legislature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} is the complete {{text of the}} Virginia Declaration of Rights: A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS made by {{the representatives of the}} good people of Virginia, assembled in full and free convention which rights do pertain to them and their posterity, as the basis and foundation of government.Section 1. That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.Section 2. That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants and at all times amenable to them.Section 3. That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people, nation, or community; of all the various modes and forms of government, that is best which is capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration. And that, when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the community has an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter, or abolish it, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.Section 4. None of mankind is entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services; which, not being <b>descendible,</b> neither ought the offices of magistrate, legislator, or judge to be hereditary.Section 5. That the legislative and executive powers of the state should be separate and distinct from the judiciary; and that the members of the two first may be restrained from oppression, by feeling and participating the burdens of the people, they should, at fixed periods, be reduced to a private station, return into that body from which they were originally taken, and the vacancies be supplied by frequent, certain, and regular elections, in which all, or any part, of the former members, to be again eligible, or ineligible, as the laws shall direct.Section 6. That elections of members to serve as representatives of the people, in assembly ought to be free; and that all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property for public uses without their own consent or that of their representatives so elected, nor bound by any law to which they have not, in like manner, assented for the public good.Section 7. That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights and ought not to be exercised.Section 8. That in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man has a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call for evidence in his favor, and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of twelve men of his vicinage, without whose unanimous consent he cannot be found guilty; nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself; that no man be deprived of his liberty except by {{the law of the land}} or the judgment of his peers.Section 9. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.Section 10. That general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offense is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted.Section 11. That in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the ancient trial by jury is preferable to any other and ought to be held sacred.Section 12. That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by despotic governments.Section 13. That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.Section 14. That the people have a right to uniform government; and, therefore, that no government separate from or independent of the government of Virginia ought to be erected or established within the limits thereof.Section 15. That no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.Section 16. That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practise Christian forbearance, love, and charity toward each other.Written by George Mason, and adopted by the Virginia Constitutional Convention on June 12, 1776.|$|E

40|$|In past {{issues of}} the Review Professor Chaffin has {{illuminated}} many areas of Trust and Estates Law. In this Article he treats the inscrutable area of <b>descendible</b> future interests. Future interests which do not terminate at death obviously result in nonpossessory property passing through the estates of their holders. This Article first shows the unhappy consequences of such passage of property. It then points out not only that most draftsmen and testators are unaware of the undesirable consequences of creating <b>descendible</b> future interests, but also that many such interests exist {{as a result of}} Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s constructional preference for early vesting of remainders, rather than from intentional creation. Professor Chaffin determines that the preference for early vesting has no contemporary relevance. He then examines the series of confusing, contradictory, and often startling Georgia cases applying this preference, revealing methods by which an attorney can recognize the areas where unintentional creation of <b>descendible</b> interests is likely, and can avoid through careful draftsmanship the problems attending the creation of such interests...|$|E
40|$|California {{recently}} passed legislation that creates retroactive, <b>descendible</b> rights of publicity. The New York State Assembly {{is poised to}} enact similar legislation. Legal recognition of postmortem rights of publicity permits a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s named beneficiaries or heirs to control (and financially benefit from) use of a deceased personality 2 ̆ 7 s image and likeness. Legislators, proponents of these laws, and legal commentators have overlooked two significant federal estate tax consequences of these new state law property rights. First, a <b>descendible</b> right of publicity likely {{will be included in}} a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Second, the estate tax value of rights of publicity easily could exceed the estate 2 ̆ 7 s liquid assets available to pay taxes. These tax concerns could be eliminated, however, by rewriting the statutes to limit a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s ability to control the disposition of any postmortem rights of publicity...|$|E

40|$|The {{untimely}} death of Michael Jackson this past June presents {{an opportunity to}} reassess some thorny estate tax issues that may arise when a celebrity dies owning valuable intellectual property. Elsewhere we have debated hypothetical, tax-motivated changes to state laws relating to postmortem publicity rights. This article will focus on existing legislation, like California’s, that makes publicity rights both devisable and <b>descendible.</b> Federal transfer taxes are levied on intangible property as well as tangible assets, and therefore apply to intellectual property, including a celebrity’s right of publicity and copyrights retained by an artist in his creations. Using Jackson’s estate as an example, and focusing primarily on publicity rights, we will examine two questions that any estate planner representing a celebrity client should consider. First, how should a personal representative value intellectual property for estate tax purposes? Second, what strategies are available to lessen the estate tax burden associated with some intellectual property rights...|$|E
40|$|The {{right of}} {{publicity}} protects a person {{against the use}} of his or her name, identity, likeness, or other personal characteristics for commercial purposes without consent. Many states have implemented a statutory right of publicity or have recognized the right under common law. Currently, only three states have a post-mortem right of publicity. This article discusses jurisdictions that have adopted a postmortem right of publicity, and advocates that Arkansas adopt a postmortem right of publicity for everyone. Specifically, the article argues that traditional protection stemming from actions for invasion of a right of privacy, trademark infringement, and copyright infringement cannot substitute for the protection afforded by a post-mortem right of publicity. Therefore, the article argues that a postmortem right of publicity should be <b>descendible</b> and inheritable as personal property upon the owner’s death. The article concludes that adopting a post-mortem right of publicity in Arkansas would protect Arkansans from use of their name, image, or likeness for commercial purposes without their consent...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{considers}} important {{consequences of}} the commodification of human reproduction. Anyone who has opened a campus newspaper has seen advertisements seeking to match an infertile couple with {{a young woman who}} will “donate” her egg (in return for a fee). Some college-age men earn thousands of dollars through regular visits to a sperm bank. The characterization of human ova and sperm cells as transferrable “property” is the very foundation upon which the entire fertility industry rests. But the law of donative transfers has largely ignored the commercial market for human reproductive material. This Article considers how courts and the Internal Revenue Service [...] unevenly and incompletely [...] treat transfers of human bodily material. The Article reveals how classifying human eggs or sperm as <b>descendible</b> and devisable property could have far-reaching and even absurd consequences for human sexual relations. Property-related laws should never be the primary lens for considering complex questions regarding human reproduction, but the particular failure of tax law to address these transfers may create a de facto tax preference for work that many people may find objectionable or immoral...|$|E
