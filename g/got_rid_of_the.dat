[...] Ladenson points out that, unlike some Bond girls, Galore's role in the plot is crucial and she is not just there as an accessory: it is her change of heart that allows good to triumph over evil.

Previously, each Justice would author a separate opinion (known as a seriatim opinion) as was done in the Virginia Supreme Court of his day and is still done today in the United Kingdom and Australia. Under Marshall, however, the Supreme Court adopted the practice of handing down a single opinion of the Court, allowing it to present a clear rule. As Marshall was almost always the author of this opinion, he essentially became the Court's sole spokesman in important cases.

25|$|Bindusara's {{death in}} 272 BCE {{led to a}} war over succession. According to the Divyavadana, Bindusara wanted his elder son Susima to succeed him but Ashoka was {{supported}} by his father's ministers, who found Susima to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them. A minister named Radhagupta seems to have {{played an important role}} in Ashoka's rise to the throne. The Ashokavadana recounts Radhagupta's offering of an old royal elephant to Ashoka for him to ride to the Garden of the Gold Pavilion where King Bindusara would determine his successor. Ashoka later <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. Radhagupta, according to the Ashokavadana, would later be appointed prime minister by Ashoka once he had gained the throne. The Dipavansa and Mahavansa refer to Ashoka's killing 99 of his brothers, sparing only one, named Vitashoka or Tissa, although there is no clear proof about this incident (many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements). The coronation happened in 269 BCE, four years after his succession to the throne.|$|E
25|$|The {{loss of the}} Proto-Indo-European {{contrastive}} accent <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditioning {{environment for}} the consonant alternations created by Verner's law. Without this conditioning environment, {{the cause of the}} alternation was no longer obvious to native speakers. The alternations that had started as mere phonetic variants of sounds became increasingly grammatical in nature, leading to the grammatical alternations of sounds known as Grammatischer Wechsel. For a single word, the grammatical stem could display different consonants depending on its grammatical case or its tense. As a result of the complexity of this system, significant levelling of these sounds occurred throughout the Germanic period {{as well as in the}} later daughter languages. Already in Proto-Germanic, most alternations in nouns were leveled to have only one sound or the other consistently throughout all forms of a word, although some alternations were preserved, only to be levelled later in the daughters (but differently in each one). Alternations in noun and verb endings were also levelled, usually in favour of the voiced alternants in nouns, but a split remained in verbs where unsuffixed (strong) verbs received the voiced alternants while suffixed (weak) verbs had the voiceless alternants. Alternation between the present and past of strong verbs remained common and was not levelled in Proto-Germanic, and survives up to the present day in some Germanic languages.|$|E

500|$|While the Progress Party had {{witnessed}} close to 35% support in opinion polls in late 2000, its support fell back to 1997 {{levels in the}} upcoming election in 2001. This was largely a result of turmoil surrounding the party. The party's deputy leader Terje Søviknes became involved in a sex scandal, and internal political conflicts came to the surface; Hagen had already in 1999 tried to quiet the most controversial immigration opponents in the parliamentary party, who had gained influence since the 1994 national convention. In late 2000 and early 2001, opposition to this locally in Oslo, Hordaland and Vest-Agder sometimes resulted in expulsions of local representatives.

He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt.

50|$|Eimsheim belonged from 1565 until Napoleonic {{times to}} <b>the</b> Electorate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palatinate, {{explaining}} the Palatine Lion in <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> escutcheon. The Catholic Church is consecrated to Saint Pirmin, who therefore {{appeared in a}} court seal known from 1546. Another court seal with the same composition comes from 1769. In both seals, the saint’s full figure is shown, and he is clothed as a bishop with a mitre and a crozier. Beside the saint is a small spring basin {{on the ground with}} a stream of water coming forth from it. This motif recalls that Saint Pirmin, according to legend, made a spring come forth with a blow from his bishop’s crozier. The spring’s water was said to have healed eye complaints and rheumatic illnesses. The spring itself water was said to have been on Reichenau Island in Lake Constance, where Pirmin founded his well-known monastery - and indeed where he <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> venomous snakes. The saint, who died in Hornbach near Zweibrücken - his last place of work - was one of Southwest Germany’s most important missionaries. In the Middle Rhine area he seldom appears as a church’s patron saint, and that he is such a thing for a church in Eimsheim {{can be explained by the}} municipality’s former allegiance to the Palatinate, where his name often cropped up. Furthermore, to this day, springs can still be found in Eimsheim giving forth water from slopes, and they are also to be seen on many farms. As late as 1906, the municipality got its water supply from ten municipally owned springs.|$|R

A great quantity of this waste is <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> indiscriminately into <b>the</b> environment thereby causing pollution {{one way or}} the other. In this study, instead of discharging them into the environment where they normally negatively affect the environment, watermelon peels have been carbonized at different temperatures between 200 to 350 o C for 15, 30, 45 and 60 min for <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> optimum conditions for pre-treatment. <b>The</b> chemical treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting carbon produced using the obtained optimum conditions was carried out using different concentrations of H 2 SO 4, HCl and ZnCl 2 (from 0. 5 to 1. 5 M). The results obtained revealed that the optimum carbonization temperature was 300 o C while the time was 60 min. Moreover, the best watermelon peel activated carbon that produced the highest percentage reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy metals considered was the one treated with 1. 0 M sulphuric acid. Therefore, it has been discovered that local agricultural wastes like watermelon peels should always be considered worthwhile raw materials for <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> high quality materials one of which is activated carbon that is very useful industrially.

2500|$|The British {{researchers}} Richard Harris & Stephen Drinkwater also {{highlighted the}} problem that the PIM {{does not account for}} premature scrapping. The reason is that a constant depreciation rate (based on average asset lives) is applied for the stock; a discrepancy therefore arises between depreciated value and scrap value (often statisticians also fail to track what happens to fixed assets that are <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of,</b> and therefore <b>the</b> assets can be counted twice in the same year). The mathematical problem is that, given a constant depreciation rate, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> overstated stock values in the data will increase cumulatively across a series of years, unless a special adjustment is made. Thus, Harris & Drinkwater's 2000 study of fixed capital in British manufacturing 1970–1993 (23 years) found that, if <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> capital scrapping which occurs due to plant closures is ignored from the 1969 benchmark onward, then this will lead to a 1993 capital stock estimate for plant and machinery which is 44% larger than it is when an appropriate adjustment is made for premature asset disposals. Another depreciation measurement problem is <b>the</b> accelerating replacement <b>of</b> fixed assets, particularly of computer systems, affecting estimated asset lives and therefore average depreciation rates. These two factors alone could, according to a 1997 OECD paper, make a difference <b>of</b> 10% to <b>the</b> estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> annual capital stock for some UK industries. Dutch and French statisticians suggested that if capital scrapping is ignored, capital stock results obtained with the PIM could be up to 20% larger than they probably are. New Zealand statisticians acknowledge explicitly that [...] "PIMs may typically overstate the gross capital stock because of a failure to account for changing cyclical or accelerating rates of retirements". Although he is not a Marxist, Thomas Piketty usefully discusses many problems with the PIM. Unlike orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist academics, Piketty and Zucman did not use the PIM method to get a measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital stock, but instead used book values and corporate equity at market value.|$|R

Men can also qualify for benefits based solely on their status as husband or widower of a worker; but spouse benefits go overwhelmingly to women. No additional payroll tax is levied on the employee-spouse to cover spouse benefits nor do they constitute a shift in the payout pattern between spouses of a set amount of benefits. These are quite simply additional payments based on marriage. Appended to Social Security in 1939 and dramatically liberalized since, spouse benefits represent a discrete and increasingly problematic feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program. At a time when analysts and politicians of nearly all persuasions agree that the long-term fiscal health of Social Security calls for legislative revision, one might expect serious proposals for spouse benefit reform, but so far that has not occurred. No doubt, that is because any prospective reduction in spouse benefits that promised to contribute to Social Security’s long-term fiscal balance would, standing alone, quite properly be perceived as having a negative impact on women. Costly, outdated, and inequitable, these marriage-based benefits may be, but unless supplanted by some less arbitrary way to connect Social Security to families and alternative measures to assure adequate retirement income for women they cannot be <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, any package of Social Security reforms that fails to rethink and revise the spouse-benefit provisions will miss a rare opportunity to improve the fairness and adequacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program’s benefits for women and run <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> disadvantaging them as a group. The article traces <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provisions governing entitlement to and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> spouse benefits, exploring why a program addition that seemed so attractive in the program’s early years has become a source of disturbing arbitrariness and inequity and how a measure specifically designed to improve retirement income for women has become less and less effective. <b>The</b> deficiencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present system are illuminated through comparison with alternative methods of connecting a family’s covered earnings with later benefits modeled on state marital property regimes and <b>the</b> law’s treatment <b>of</b> other forms of spousal retirement income. The article concludes with a survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> challenges, administrative and political, that would confront any serious effort to pursue so dramatic a reform...|$|R
