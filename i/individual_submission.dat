50|$|The <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> {{documents}} were {{adopted by the}} IETF Provisioning Registry (provreg) working group, which was created after a BoF session was held at IETF-49 in December 2000. Proposed Standard documents (RFCs 3730 - 3734) were published by the RFC Editor in March 2004. Draft Standard documents (RFCs 4930 - 4934) were published in May 2007. In August 2009 IETF granted EPP the status of full standard, STD 69.|$|E
50|$|However the {{government}} has been criticised for ignoring the overwhelming majority of those replying who stated that they did not want national identity cards. The government claimed that over five thousand negative online responses through a single portal site, organised by stand, represented one lobby group so treated them as one reply, thus reversing what would otherwise have been recognised as an overwhelming vote against national identity cards. However, the Government claimed that many supportive organisations did not number their entire membership numbers in their submissions and thus, {{it would not be a}} true representation to include each <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> by this campaign.|$|E

50|$|Comments such {{as these}} show West's ideological stand {{on the power of}} {{literature}} as well as her personal philosophy of law. West's arguments tend to focus on the human condition as read in books as well as the <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> to authority, and what she believes to be an apparent contradiction. She calls for scholars to interpret, create and critique narrative texts in order to broaden their understanding of the human condition, and the law's effect on it and the community as a whole. West believes in a so-called 'political, communal and ethical re-constitution', a mode of thinking that one might engage in when reading and critiquing texts, both fictional and legal. Because of this duality, West asserts, law and literature become more related and thus more valid in discussion when debating the implications of one or the other.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{advantages}} of online learning programmes in university curricula, such programmes can present challenges, particularly {{in terms of}} assessment of group coursework and participation in discussion fora. The author’s experiences suggest ways to mitigate the “free rider” problem often accompanying group coursework, in which a few motivated students perform {{the bulk of the}} work. Mitigation of this problem can be achieved by requiring a shorter, <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> separately from each student, in order to better judge the relative contribution to the whole. Participation in online discussions can also be incentivized by making this element a meaningful part of the overall summative assessment. Lastly, both attendance and learning, whether online or face to face, can be motivated by including in each session a brief quiz, to be done individually or in groups, which again counts towards the overall assessment, and encourages students to participate, and reinforces concepts on an ongoing basi...|$|E
40|$|The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database ([URL] {{maintained}} at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), incorporates, organizes and distributes nucleotide sequences from public sources. The database {{is a part}} of an international collaboration with DDBJ (Japan) and GenBank (USA). Data are exchanged between the collaborating databases on a daily basis to achieve optimal synchrony. The web-based tool, Webin, is the preferred system for <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> of nucleotide sequences, including Third Party Annotation (TPA) and alignment data. Automatic submission procedures are used for submission of data from large-scale genome sequencing centres and from the European Patent Office. Database releases are produced quarterly.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of three independent essays on econometrics and economics of education. The first chapter investigates how the Research Excellence Framework (REF) perceives the quality of economics journals. Exploiting aggregate information available in the published REF dataset, we propose a novel algorithm within an ordered probit framework that provides an effective recovery of underlying disaggregated outcomes (i. e. <b>individual</b> <b>submission).</b> The estimated results {{can be viewed as a}} directory for predicting the perception of journal quality for the REF 2014 exercise. In the second chapter, I suggest a new matching methodology—the Dirichlet process (DP) matching—that has several important advantages compared to conventional matching methods, including the balancing property, a more efficient ATT estimator and a credible confidence band. I describe the DP matching as a story of the “Chinese restaurant with invited guests”. In the third chapter, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment, namely the PelCa program in Ecuador, and study its consequences on mothers’ empowerment and children’s early development. We find optimistic evidence that the program helped mothers rear their children in a more learning conductive environment, resulting in positive effects on children outcomes and greater empowerment in mothers at home and in the community...|$|E
40|$|The Institution of Complaint According to the Administrative Procedure Code The {{subject of}} this {{rigorous}} thesis is a special type of complaint, which is a complaint about certain kind of behavior or procedure in public administration. Author of this thesis generally defines the complaint as an <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> of the complainant intended to achieve a correction of the perceived drawbacks. The element of the individuality differs this type of submission from petitions, for which the shared interest is characteristic. Unlike the petition law the legal regulation of the complaints is very problematic and fragmented. It {{happens to be a}} remnant of for a long time unsolved situation, where the complaints were regulated by a controversial governmental decree from 1958, which was issued by unauthorized government and which was intended as provisional only. Despite the subsequent polemics regarding its validity and binding effect was this decree abolished as of 1 January 2006 relatively without any substitute. Until that time the complaints were regulated in a plenty of special acts, but the general regulation was missing. The change was supposed to be brought by the current Administrative Procedure Code, which original government proposal lacked the regulation of the complaints, but in the end it [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the large}} amount of data stored in {{biological}} databases, the management of uncertainty and incompleteness in them is a non-trivial problem. To cope with {{the large amount}} of sequences being produced, a significant number of genes and proteins have been functionally characterized by automated tools. However, these tools have also produced a significant number of misannotations that are now present in the databases. This paper proposes a new approach for validating the automated annotations, which uses {{the large amount of}} publicly available information to compare automated annotations with preexisting curated annotations. To test the proposed approach, we developed a novel unsupervised method for filtering misannotations provided by automated annotation systems. We evaluated our method using the automated annotations submitted to BioCreAtIvE, a joint evaluation of state-of-the-art text-mining systems in Biology. The method scored each of these annotations and those scored below a certain threshold were discarded. The results have shown a small trade-off in recall for a large improvement in precision. For example, we were able to discard 44. 6 %, 66. 8 % and 81 % of the misannotations, maintaining 96. 9 %, 84. 2 %, and 47. 8 % of the correct annotations, respectively. Moreover, we were able to outperform each <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> to BioCreAtIvE by proper adjustment of the threshold. These results show the effectiveness of our approach in assisting curators of large biological databases in the use of contemporary tools for automatic identification of annotation...|$|E
5000|$|The {{campaign}} that began at Duke University spread to many colleges across the nation. But while the campaign did spark interest, it also experienced backlash. On Duke's campus, {{many of the}} posters were torn down or vandalized. Some of the vandals added signs to the posters reading “I need feminism because sandwiches can’t make themselves,” or “I need feminism because it’s funny watching them try to play sports.” The online outlets also experienced significant backlash in the comments made on the movement in general and <b>individual</b> <b>submissions.</b> One of the largest incidents of backlash was the Women against Feminism {{campaign that}} was created. This group took the original campaign's ideas of creating posters and changed the words to [...] "I don't need feminism..." [...] and posted them.|$|R

Another tool, gene view reports the location of the variation within a gene (if it is in a gene), the old and new codon, the amino acids encoded by both, and whether the change is synonymous or non-synonymous. Sequence viewer shows the position of the variant in relation to introns, exons, and other distant and close variants. 3D structure mapping, which shows 3D images of the encoded protein is also available.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} participants in co-creation initiatives {{referred to as the}} ‘crowd’ of customers, who get involved in firm-led creative and social processes designed to co-create value. In a general introduction, the theoretical background is outlined considering co-creation, service-dominant logic and consumer empowerment literature. In four individual papers, the thesis provides a more granular perspective on the members of the crowd and investigate how the crowd can be constructed, managed, and empowered to accomplish favorable outcomes. Paper 1 shows that effects of an enjoyable co-creation experience vary on the basis of personal features of participating crowd members such as novelty seeking, web usage and dissatisfaction with current products. In addition, paper 2 sheds light on more negative personal characteristics, specifically the three dimensions of Machiavellianism – distrust of others, amorality and desire for status. Machiavellian characteristics affect participation behavior, the quality of submissions and the kind of contributions, however, in oppositional ways. Proof is provided that Machiavellianism also affects collaborative behavior of crowd members. Paper 3 outlines design principles for constructing and managing the crowd in order to ensure integrated and contextualized submissions. The paper further highlights two boundaries - team vs. <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> mode and context-specific vs. global submissions – and the consequences of co-creation design on elicited submissions by the crowd. Paper 4 underscores the importance of participant empowerment on favorable outcomes in terms of submission quality and consumer-brand relationships. Empowerment is found to positively affect the quality of submissions and lead to a higher change in passion for the host brand relative to the level of passion before participation. The last chapter discusses the main findings and derives implications for theory and practice...|$|E
40|$|Project-based {{learning}} (PBL) can simulate {{and reflect}} current industry practice. Many civil engineering design modules contain major elements of group work that provide open-ended realistic project scenarios that aim to integrate knowledge from different subject areas. The group work element of PBL reinforces collaboration and team-working {{seen by the}} construction industry as being very important and useful. In PBL different design options need to be explored and require students to research, critically analyse and communicate effectively. These activities help build professional and practical skills necessary for learning and provide students with the opportunity and freedom to organise their own programme of work. Assessment tasks are devised so that they satisfactorily demonstrate achievement of the intended learning outcomes. Assessment outcome {{is seen as a}} record of academic achievement that allows progression. Assessment methods are therefore essential tools used to measure learning. These methods influence and impact the nature of learning and the retention of knowledge. Devising the assessments for modules containing PBL requires careful consideration. Frequently in group submissions, academically weaker students rely on their peers to produce the work. Disagreements, none or late production of work by team members and personality clashes can also occur. PBL modules at UWL are assessed via a number of group and individual submissions. The group submissions are covered by two or three group assignments. Each member of the group is awarded the group mark unless evidence is provided to the contrary. The <b>individual</b> <b>submission</b> is set to determine an individual's overall contribution. This is covered by one assignment that requires reflection on group interaction and based on gained experience, how concept and final designs, procedures including time management and managing own learning, could have been improved. PBL assessments methods are used in conjunction with the more traditional assessments methods of exams and time-controlled assignments...|$|E
