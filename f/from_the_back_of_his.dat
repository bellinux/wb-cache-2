5|$|Murphy {{finds an}} ice core sample {{believed}} to originate from a meteor crater, and theorizes {{that the sample}} might be 250,000 years old. Although Bear insists on leaving, the others are concerned about infecting the outside world. When he is asked to provide a stool sample, he attacks Mulder and tries to flee. Something moves under Bear's skin, and he dies when Hodge removes a small worm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> neck. Now without a pilot, the group is informed that evacuation is impossible because of the weather.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 Beethoven's body (and {{also that}} of Schubert, who was buried nearby) was exhumed, studied and reburied, in {{proceedings}} {{paid for by}} the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. At that time, fragments <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> skull, which had been separated during the autopsy, were acquired by the Austrian doctor Romeo Seligmann, which are also now in the Center for Beethoven Studies. His remains were moved in 1888 to the Zentralfriedhof.|$|E

25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school and ran toward a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E
500|$|In July 1950, Schnaufer {{was on a}} wine buying {{visit to}} France. On the {{afternoon}} of the 13 July, he was heading south on the Route Nationale No. 10 in his Mercedes-Benz 170 convertible with a registration number [...] "AWW 44-3425". Just south of Bordeaux, at about 18:30, he was involved in a collision with a Renault 22 truck. The accident occurred at the intersection of road D1, present-day D211, and the N10, present-day D1010, in Cestas (...) [...] The truck, driven by Jean Antoine Gasc, was carrying a [...] load of empty gas cylinders. The collision ruptured the fuel tank of the Mercedes and ignited the petrol. Witnesses to the accident quickly put out the flames. Alice Ducourneau gave first aid to Schnaufer, who was bleeding from a wound <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. The police appeared {{at the scene of the}} accident at about 19:30, followed by an ambulance shortly thereafter. Schnaufer had suffered a fractured skull, and was immediately taken to the Saint-André Hôpital in Bordeaux.|$|E
500|$|Leyland was {{regarded}} by critics {{as a good}} fielder in almost any position. He bowled left-arm spin, but contrary to the orthodox practice for a left-arm spinner to use his fingers to spin the ball, usually bowled the ball <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand—the delivery known as the chinaman. He did not take bowling seriously, but enjoyed it. In this role, he was effective at times, but other players {{were used in the}} main spinner's role for Yorkshire in preference to him, and he was generally used as back-up, for example when the other bowlers had failed to dismiss well-set batsmen. His Wisden obituary suggests that, had he played for another county, he might have developed into a world-class all-rounder. His lack of opportunity prompted him to experiment with wrist spin, and he later claimed that he originated the term [...] "chinaman" [...] to describe the delivery. Wisden suggests: [...] "Whenever two batsmen were difficult to shift or something different was wanted someone in the Yorkshire team would say, 'Put on Maurice to bowl some of those Chinese things.' Roy Kilner explained, 'It's foreign stuff and you can't call it anything else. Another version was the Leyland believed that the particular delivery was only good enough [...] "to get the Chinese out". However, there are several theories over how the delivery came to be named.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1863, Wright was {{run down}} by a mule team but {{recovered}} from his wounds. [...] He {{was shot in the}} left arm during the Battle of Cold Harbor on June 2, 1864.

[...] He recovered, however, and the bullet was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. [...] He kept the bullet as a reminder of his brush with death.|$|E
2500|$|... "Jones had a {{handsome}} and strange voice. His singing was always partly about {{the appeal of}} the tones he produced, regardless of the meaning of the words. In this sense, Jones had something in common with singers of formal music and opera, though his means of vocal production were radically different from theirs. He sang <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> throat, rather than from deep in his diaphragm. He tightened his larynx to squeeze sound out. He clenched his jaw, instead of wriggling it free. He forced wind through his teeth, and the notes sounded weirdly beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Blazing, known {{within the}} game as [...] "Crazy Dave", serves as a narrator and an {{instructor}} during Adventure Mode, introducing the player to certain levels and explaining some of the mini-games and bonus levels. He is later abducted by a Bungee Zombie on level 5–10 right before he can tell the player Dr. Zomboss' weakness, and reappears during Sunflower's rendition of [...] "Zombies on your Lawn" [...] after Dr. Zomboss's defeat {{at the end of}} the game. He has a shop known as [...] "Crazy Dave's Twiddydinkies" [...] that he runs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car once the player finds his car keys after Level 3–4. He sells several plant upgrades, extra defenses, and Zen Garden items. Crazy Dave's notable features include a rugged beard and a pot always worn on his head.|$|E

2500|$|Wolverine {{was born}} James Howlett in {{northern}} Alberta, Canada, {{during the late}} 1880s, purportedly to rich farm owners John and Elizabeth Howlett, though he is actually the illegitimate son of the Howletts' groundskeeper, Thomas Logan. After Thomas is thrown off the Howletts' property for an attempted rape perpetrated by his other son, named simply Dog, {{he returns to the}} Howlett manor and kills John Howlett. In retaliation, young James kills Thomas with bone claws that emerge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hands, as his mutation manifests. He flees with his childhood companion, Rose, and grows into manhood on a mining colony in the Yukon, adopting the name [...] "Logan". When Logan accidentally kills Rose with his claws, he flees the colony and lives in the wilderness among wolves, until he is captured and placed in a circus. Saul Creed, brother of Victor Creed, frees Logan, but after he betrays Logan and Clara Creed to Nathaniel Essex, Logan drowns Creed in Essex's potion. Logan returns to civilization, residing with the Blackfoot people. Following the death of his Blackfoot lover, Silver Fox, at the hands of Victor Creed, now known as Sabretooth, he is ushered into the Canadian military during World War I. Logan spends time in Madripoor before settling in Japan, where he marries Itsu and has a son, Daken. Logan is unaware of his son for many years.|$|E
