40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} unusual mechanical properties of tension wood <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fiber</b> (G-fiber) was investigated. We discussed origins of high tensile growth stress, high drying shrinkage, and rapid increase of Young's modulus due to drying, {{in association with}} microscopic structure of gelatinous layer (G-layer). Anatomical, crystallographic, and micromechanical approaches were employed. As the result, it is cleared that G-layer structure as hydro-gel has a key to understand hygromechanical properties in the tension wood G-fiber. The origin of contractive force in maturing G-layer is still unknown, however, the structure and behavior of the swollen hydro-gel may give some key to solve it...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Tension wood is an {{important}} anatomical structure for its participation in {{the orientation of the}} trunk and the architecture of the branches as a function of structural reinforcement. However, its presence in large amounts significantly affects the technological properties of wood, just as in the rubber tree. Nevertheless, there is still demand for information about the origin, distribution and structural features in this species. Thus, this study aims to characterize the cellular structures in tension and opposite wood in Hevea brasiliensis (rubber tree), as well as its radial and longitudinal distribution. Discs at the base and the middle of the commercial logs were collected from three trees in a commercial plantation located in Tabapoã - SP. Tangential diameter of vessels, fiber length (gelatinous and non-gelatinous fibers), microfibril angle and proportionality of cellular elements (vessels, axial parenchyma, ray, gelatinous fibers and non-gelatinous fibers) were measured, and influence of <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fiber</b> presence in vessel diameter was observed. Gelatinous fibers were observed in the two types of wood and in the two trunk heights. Both types of wood were distinguished by <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fiber</b> length and the proportion of axial parenchyma. The tension wood in mid-trunk was the most different, with long gelatinous fibers and less abundant, larger vessel diameter and vessel proportion. Moreover, smaller vessel diameter was observed in the regions with a high proportion of gelatinous fibers, suggesting that the plant invests more support than in liquid transport...|$|E
40|$|Tension wood xylem of {{arboreal}} eudicot species often produces unusual wood fiber, called <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fiber</b> (G-fiber). The G-fiber forms a gelatinous layer (G-layer) as {{the innermost}} {{layer of the}} multi-layered cell wall. The G-fiber generates a high tensile growth stress, which enables the hardwood species to perform the negative-gravitropic behaviors in its inclined shoot. However, the tension wood often causes various obstacles when we use the forest resources as the raw material for the timber products. Examples are the processing defects caused by its abnormal growth stress. Other examples are a high longitudinal Young's modulus and a high longitudinal drying shrinkage; their combined effect causes serious processing defects during the lumbering and drying process, e. g., distortion and cleavage of the sawn lumber, and so forth. Some researchers consider that characteristic properties of the G-fiber should {{be attributed to the}} intrinsic behaviors of the G-layer, while others emphasize the role of other lignified layer because the G-layer is often peeled off the lignified layer in the same direction during microtoming. Lately, Clair et al. revealed that detachment of the G-layer is an artifact that is caused by the stress concentration from the microtome blade, and they concluded that the G-layer is strongly attached to the lignified layer even in the oven-dried specimen. This positively supports the idea that the characteristic behaviors of the G-fiber originate from the property of the G-layer. However, the researchers still have no explanation for the generation mechanism of those G-layer properties. In our presentation, we focused our attentions on the moisture dependent changes of the longitudinal Young's modulus and the longitudinal shrinkages in two Quercus acctissima containing the tension wood xylem. And, we revealed the astonishing difference of those properties between G-layer and the lignified wall (= normal wood cell wall). Based on the obtained results, we propose a model of fine structure of the G-layer (and that of the lignified wall) to explain what is going on the drying G-layer...|$|E
30|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{position of a}} current-year branch of the weeping Japanese cherry,Prunus spachiana Kitamura f.spachiana cv.Plenarosea, was estimated by measuring the released strains of growth stresses. In current-year branches that were supported with wires to prevent weeping {{as soon as the}} branches first budded, tensile growth stresses on the upper side were smaller than those of the control branches. <b>Gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> were rarely found on {{the upper part of the}} cross section of the supported branches, whereas the control branches had many <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> on the upper part. The upright orientation of the supported branches was closer to the {{equilibrium position}} than the weeping orientation of the control branches. The equilibrium position of the branches was thought to be in the initial bud direction, above the horizontal plane; and the weeping style of branch was not the preferred angular orientation forP. spachiana.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{relationship}} {{between the amount of}} growth stress and the degree of artificial inclination was investigated in saplings of two angiosperm species. The tensile growth stresses generated in Prunus spachiana, which forms <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers,</b> were larger than those in Liriodendron tulipifera, which does not form <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers.</b> In both species, the tensile growth stresses generated in the upper side of inclined stems increased and the cellulose microfibrillar angle decreased proportionally as the inclination changed from 0 ° (vertical) to 20 °. At inclinations over 20 °, the tensile growth stress and cellulose microfibrillar angle did not change further. The thickness of the current growth layer increased linearly with the angle of inclination, but eccentric growth was not the main fac-tor contributing to the upward bending moment to return the axis to the normal vertical position. This paper reveals that the growth stress generated by inclination is limited. That is, growth stress increases with the inclination angle to a point, but then does not increase further...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Three {{different}} types of woods, tension, opposite and side woods, were isolated from fagus crenata Blume and their anatomical and chemical properties were compared. Tension wood was composed of well developed <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> and was characteristic in its low lignin and pentosan contents {{as well as its}} high ash, alpha-cellulose and uronic acid contents. Carbo-hydrate portion of tension wood {{has been found to be}} peculiar in that tension wood contains the highest amount of galactose in contrast to the lowest amount of mannose among three types ofwood. Each wood was further subjected to sequential fractional extractions. The peculiarity of the chemical composition of the tension wood reflected the differences in the carbohydrate compositions of the extracted hemicelluloses. In analysing the molecular weight distribution of the extracted hemicelluloses by gel filtration on Sepharose 4 B, it has been found that all components included in the gel matrices have quite similar molecular weights in spite of the differences in the carbohydrate compositions. These results may give a clue in ellucidation of the distribution and function of hemicelluloses in wood. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} properties and morphology of kraft paper handsheets obtained from tension wood of intensively managed, 5 -year-old trees of Populus "Tristis # 1 " {{were compared to}} those produced from isolated normal wood of the same stems. Pulp yields of tension wood (TW) and normal wood (NW) were 60 and 53 %, respectively. Over a beating range of 0 - 45 minutes, strength properties of TW paper were in all cases noticeably inferior to those obtained from NW. During paper formation, the TW or <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> resisted collapse, even upon extended refining, and produced thick, porous sheets of poorly bonded elements. It was concluded that the differential behavior of NW and TW pulps was in several respects analogous to those displayed by earlywood and late-wood pulps, respectively, of softwood species as well as thin- vs. thick-walled hardwood fibers. Consequently, {{it appears that the}} inferior strength of TW paper is primarily a function of fiber mor-phology, and the difference in hemicellulose content between NW and TW (viz., lower pentosan content of TW) often cited in the literature as a potential major factor here probably contributes little if any significant effect on ultimate interfiber bonding and paper quality...|$|R
30|$|This study {{examined}} how boiling and drying treatments influenced various physical {{properties of the}} tension wood with <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> (G-fibers) of a 29 -yearold Zelkova branch. By boiling treatment, tension wood with numerous G-fibers contracted considerably in the longitudinal direction and the longitudinal Young’s modulus decreased {{in spite of the}} water-saturated condition. The drying treatment caused green tension wood and boiled tension wood with numerous G-fibers to shrink longitudinally and increased their longitudinal Young’s moduli. These specific behaviors in tension wood were highly correlated with the proportion of G-fibers in a specimen and were probably caused by the microscopic behavior of cellulose microfibril (CMF) in the gelatinous layers (G-layers). The longitudinal shrinkage of tension wood due to drying suggests the existence of a hygro-sensible, noncrystalline region in the CMF, which is abundant in the G-layer. Furthermore, the noncrystalline region in the CMF softens during boiling treatment, resulting in the reduction of the longitudinal Young’s modulus in tension wood. The longitudinal contraction of tension wood with G-fibers by boiling might be caused by the tensile growth stress remaining in green G-layers. However, no changes were detected in the 004 d-spacing of cellulose crystal in tension wood from the boiling and drying treatments, regardless of the proportion of G-fibers.|$|R

40|$|The family Apocynaceae {{includes}} many medicinal species, such as Aspidosperma olivaceum Müll. Arg. and A. polyneuron Müll. Arg. The first, {{popularly known as}} "peroba-branca", {{is a source of}} indole alkaloids that are recognized for their antitumor activity. The second, known as "peroba-rosa", is used by some people for treating malaria. To contribute to the knowledge about Brazilian medicinal plants and potential vegetal drugs, a morpho-anatomical analysis of the leaves and stems of these tree species was carried out. The botanical material was fixed, sectioned and stained using standard techniques. Histochemical tests were performed and the material was also analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. Aspidosperma olivaceum and A. polyneuron are morphologically similar, both presenting alternate, simple, elliptic-lanceolate leaves. The leaves are hypostomatic with anomocytic stomata and have non-glandular trichomes. In the stem, there are peripheral phellogen, lignified fibers and some stone cells in the cortex and pith, as well as numerous <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> near the phloem. Prismatic calcium oxalate crystals and laticifers are present in the leaves and stems. Unlike A. olivaceum, A. polyneuron also has cyclocytic stomata, predominantly unicellular non-glandular trichomes and a biconvex midrib with a sharper curve on the adaxial side.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} anatomical responses to waterlogging of mangrove seedlings (Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh.) grown in experimentally simulated semidiurnal tides. The following treatments were used: 0, 2, 4. 6, 8, 10 and 12 h submergence period with two daily tidal cycles. With increasing waterlogging duration, the leaf thickness, mesophyll thickness, palisade parenchyma thickness, palisade-spongy ratio and hypodermis thickness decreased, but the mesophyll to leaf thickness ratio, stem and pith diameter, and cortex thickness increased. The tangential vessel diameter, vessel wall thickness in stem and leaf and fiber wall thickness in stem showed a similar tendency {{in response to}} waterlogging, remaining constant between 0 and 4 h waterlogging duration, but decreasing with more prolonged waterlogging. When the waterlogging duration exceeded 4 h, no sclerenchyma cells in leaves or <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> in stems were observed. The response of these leaf and stem features indicated that water transport and mechanical support could remain relatively stable in the 0 - 4 h waterlogging duration, but they would be negatively influenced by longer flooding. Tissues for gas exchange were stimulated by waterlogging, while the functions of water storage, photosynthesis, mesophyll conductance were weakened with increasing waterlogging. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood features are reported for 38 species representing 22 genera, including the scandent genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia. Woods of Acanthaceae {{are characterized by}} relatively narrow vessels with simple perforation plates and alternate lateral wall pitting, septate libriform fibers, scanty vasicentric axial parenchyma, rays both multiseriate and uniseriate, erect ray cells abundant in rays (some species rayless or near-rayless), numerous small crystals or cystoliths in ray cells in a few genera (first documented reports of both characters in woods of Acanthaceae), and nonstoried structure. This constellation of features is very closely matched by woods of Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myoporaceae (families listed in order ofdecreasing resemblance). Narrowness ofvessels in tropical Acanthaceae appears related to understory ecology. A few species in warm and seasonally dry areas have narrow, short vessel elements numerous per unit transection. Vasicentric tracheids occur in two nonscandent genera in dry areas. Vessel grouping is roughly proportional to dryness of habitat. Thunbergia alata, T. laurifolia, and all collections of Mendoncia have interxylary phloem (first report for Mendoncia). That feature, plus presence of occasional acicular crystals in rays and axial parenchyma and presence of large <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> in phloem ally Mendoncia closely with Thunbergia, and Mendonciaceae is not justified for this and other reasons. Species of Thunbergia differ among themselves, and T. erecta and T. holstii resemble shrubby Acanthaceae {{more than they do}} Mendoncia in wood features.

40|$|Abstract—Why {{does the}} heart beat? This question—known as the myogenic versus neurogenic theory—dominated cardiac {{research}} in the 19 th century. In 1839, Jan Evangelista Purkinje discovered <b>gelatinous</b> <b>fibers</b> in the ventricular subendocardium that he thought were muscular. Walter Gaskell, in 1886, demonstrated specialized muscle fibers joining the atria and ventricles that caused “block ” when cut {{and found that the}} sinus venosus was the area of first excitation of the heart. By examining serial embryologic sections, Wilhelm His, Jr, showed that a connective tissue sheet became a bundle connecting the upper and lower cardiac chambers, the bundle of His. Sunao Tawara traced the atrioventricular (AV) bundle of His backward to find a compact node of fibers {{at the base of the}} atrial septum and forward where it connected with the bundles of cells discovered by Purkinje in 1839. Tawara concluded that this “AV connecting system” originated in the AV node, penetrated the septum as the His bundle, and then divided into left and right bundle branches that terminated in the Purkinje fibers. Martin Flack and Arthur Keith studied the conduction system of a mole and found a structure in the sinoauricular junction that histologically resembled the AV node. They felt that this was where “the dominating rhythm of the heart normally begins ” and named it the sinoauricular node in 1907. The ECG of Einthoven soon brought a new understanding to the complex electrical system that makes the heart beat. In 2006 and 2007, we celebrate the 100 th anniversaries of the publication of the exciting discovery of the AV and sinus nodes, truly landmarks in our understanding of cardiac structure and physiology.

40|$|Os danos de Ctenarytaina spatulata Taylor, 1977 foram caracterizados em observações {{realizadas}} em campo,  laboratório e casa de vegetação. Os primeiros danos de C. spatulata em Eucalyptus grandis são provocados  pela postura, ficando uma pequena mancha preta, onde o ovo é depositado, que evolui para manchas maiores,  podendo levar a seca da gema. Os espécimens eliminam grandes quantidades de líquidos ricos em  açúcares “honeydew”, que se acumulam sobre folhas e  ponteiros, propiciando a proliferação de fungos formadores de fumagina e fungos fitopatogênicos. As  plantas atacadas ficam com as folhas deformadas,  menores que as normais, encarquilhadas, com falhas  entre as nervuras e com fumagina.   Conseqüentemente, a capacidade fotossintética  diminui. Com os danos provocados pelas picadas,  posturas, acúmulo de fumagina, aparecimento de  fungos oportunistas e a morte dos brotos, a planta  perde a dominância apical, ocorrendo uma  superbrotação no local. O ataque de C. spatulata causa uma diminuição do diâmetro das plantas e encurtamento dos internódios, ocasionando uma maior  fragilidade na área onde há esta formação. Cortes  anatômicos do caule, infestado com C. spatulata, mostram que a parte interna do lenho, na região onde  houve um superbrotamento, apresenta grande  concentração de fibras gelatinosas, que são menos  lignificadas. Estas fibras conferem menor resistência ao  caule das plantas, tornando-o frágil e susceptível a  quebra em função de ventos ou mesmo pelo próprio  peso. Além disto, as plantas atacadas apresentaram  modificações anatômicas quanto ao arranjo dos poros e  maior espessamento da casca. The injuries of Ctenarytaina spatulata Taylor, 1977, {{were characterized}} through observations in field,  laboratory and greenhouse. The first injuries of C. spatulata in Eucalyptus grandis are caused during  oviposition. At {{the point where}} the egg is inserted, a   small black spot appears, which may grow larger, causing the bud death. The insect eliminates large  amount of honeydew, accumulating on leaves and  apical parts, which starts the proliferation of sooty mold,  and fitopathogenic fungi.
