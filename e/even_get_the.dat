25|$|The Nottingham Ice Stadium {{opened on}} 10 April 1939 and hosted its {{first game of}} ice hockey two days later when the Harringay Racers {{defeated}} the Harringay Greyhounds 10-6 in a challenge game. The souvenir brochure published to mark the Stadium's opening included details of a new professional ice hockey team called the Nottingham Panthers to begin play in the English National League that autumn. A team was assembled in Canada and brought to the United Kingdom but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of World War II. Some of the players from this team didn't <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> {{chance to see the}} Ice Stadium.|$|E
500|$|Downes {{said that}} his voicing for Master Chief was based entirely on Bungie's written {{character}} description provided, which specified a character similar to Clint Eastwood and of few words. In a podcast interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, {{he was given a}} fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality. In the games, Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him an almost silent protagonist. Even during cut scenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as [...] "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [...] apply their own personality." [...] Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described Master Chief as [...] "pretty much the consummate professional. He does his job, walks off, doesn't <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> girl, he's that cool he doesn't need her." [...] Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm, quiet, and wryly cynical, some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund's portrayal of the character in Halo: The Fall of Reach deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media. Alternatively, William C. Dietz's portrayal of the Chief in [...] was occasionally blasted by fans as too radical a departure from Nylund's template.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, [...] "You Lift Me Up (To Heaven)" [...] {{brought her}} to the Top 10 for the first time. Her third studio album, Feel the Fire was {{released}} in October and spawned two additional Top 20 hit singles that year. In September 1981, [...] McEntire's fourth album, Heart to Heart was issued and became her first album to chart the Billboard Top Country Albums list, peaking at No. 2. Its lead single, [...] "Today All Over Again" [...] became a top five country hit. The album received mainly negative reviews from critics. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic gave it two-and-a-half out of five stars, stating she did not get creative control of her music. Ruhlmann called [...] "There Ain't No Love" [...] "essentially a soft pop ballad". Most of the album's material consisted of mainly country pop-styled ballads, which was not well liked by McEntire herself. Her fifth album, Unlimited was issued in June 1982, and spawned her first Billboard number one single in early 1983: [...] "Can't <b>Even</b> <b>Get</b> <b>the</b> Blues" [...] and [...] "You're the First Time I've Thought About Leaving". The following year her sixth album, Behind the Scene was released and was positively received by music critics. In 1983, McEntire announced her departure from Mercury, criticizing the label's country pop production styles.|$|E

500|$|The band's debut album, Take This to Your Grave, {{was issued}} by Fueled by Ramen in May 2003. Previously, {{one of the}} band's {{earliest}} recordings, Evening Out with Your Girlfriend, had not seen release until shortly before Grave in March 2003, when the band had gained considerable momentum. [...] "Our record was something being rushed out to help generate some interest, but that interest was building before we could <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> record out," [...] said Sean Muttaqi. The band actively tried to stop Uprising from releasing the recordings (as the band's relationship with Muttaqi had grown sour), as the band viewed it as a [...] "giant piece of garbage" [...] recorded before Hurley's involvement that the band members ceased to consider the debut album of the group. Gradually, the band's fanbase grew in size as the label pushed for the album's mainstream success. According to Wentz, shows began to end in a near-riot and the group were banned from several venues because the entire crowd would end up onstage. The band gained positive reviews for subsequent gigs at South by Southwest (SXSW) and various tour appearances. The band joined the Warped Tour for five dates {{in the summer of}} 2004, and on one date the band had only performed three songs when the stage collapsed due to the large crowd. The band appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 2004 edition of Alternative Press, and listening stations at Hot Topic partially helped the album move 2,000-3,000 copies per week by Christmas 2004, at which point the label considered the band [...] "tipping" [...] into mainstream success.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis later {{revealed}} that her departure from Syco had come after [...] "several years" [...] of consideration. She {{also stated that}} when she expressed her desire to part with the label, she was threatened with the public being told {{that she had been}} dropped instead of parting amicably. However, further creative differences in relation to her fifth studio album finally caused Lewis to leave the label. Of her departure, she stated, [...] "I was asked to make a record {{that would not have been}} true to myself. By all means as an artist in this climate, I was thankful to <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance to make another record. But I cannot make music that does not speak to my soul, and as scary as it seemed, I could no longer compromise myself, and so I decided to leave".|$|E
2500|$|The 1956 Bel Air {{received}} a face-lift {{with a more}} conventional full-width grille, pleasing those customers who didn't favor the Ferrari-inspired '55 front end. Distinctive two-tone bodyside treatments and graceful front and rear wheel openings completed the [...] "speedline" [...] restyling. Single housings incorporated the taillight, stoplight, and backup light, and the left one held the gas filler - an idea popularized on Cadillacs. Among the seven Bel Air models was a new Sport Sedan, a pillarless four-door hardtop that looked handsome with all the windows rolled down and allowed easy entry into the back seat. Production exceeded 103,000, compared to 128,000 two-door hardtops. Shapely two-door Nomad wagons topped the price chart at $2,608, but now carried the same interior and rear-wheel sheetmetal as other Bel Airs, lacking the original's unique trim. Only 7,886 were built. The least costly Bel Air, at $2,025, was the two-door sedan. Seatbelts, shoulder harnesses, and a padded dashboard were available, and full-size cars could <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> hot Corvette 225-horsepower engine. In 1956 sales material there was an optional rain-sensing automatic top, which was first seen on the 1951 LaSabre concept car. However, {{it is believed that}} it was never installed on a car. Popular Mechanics reported only 7.4% of owners in their survey ordered seat belts.|$|E

2500|$|In {{front of}} the largest crowd to ever attend a regular-season game at Tampa Stadium, the Tampa Bay defense held Billy Sims, in only his second year the Lions' career leader in 100-yard games, to only 75 yards rushing while forcing six turnovers. Several other {{potential}} interceptions were dropped. The Buccaneers were held to only 49 yards rushing, but Doug Williams compensated by passing for four touchdowns. Williams was dazed by {{a blow to the}} head from Lions tackle Doug English, but returned to the game. The Lions' only touchdown was set up by a botched first-quarter punt attempt. Coming after an Eddie Murray field goal, it produced a 10–0 Lions lead that had the crowd cheering when an airplane carrying a [...] "Throw McKay in the Bay" [...] banner flew overhead shortly afterward. Williams then hit Kevin House with two touchdown passes, the second of which was controversial due to replays that showed it inconclusive whether House had both feet in bounds. It was speculated that House was given {{the benefit of the doubt}} due to pass interference not having been called on the previous play, when Jimmie Giles was tackled before Williams could <b>even</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> pass off. After the concussion, Williams returned to throw touchdown passes to James Wilder and Jim Obradovich. Gordon Jones, Ricky Bell and Lee Roy Selmon all missed the game for the Buccaneers, while Jeff Komlo replaced injured Lions quarterback Gary Danielson. It was believed to be the first Buccaneer game in which neither Selmon played.|$|E
