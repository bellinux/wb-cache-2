5|$|In 1922, São Paulo and Minas Geraes {{helped to}} put down the first of the Tenente revolts. Soldiers seized Fort Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro on 5 July, but no other men joined them.

5|$|During the duel between Vengeur and Brunswick, the {{undamaged}} HMS Ramillies {{had approached}} and put {{herself in a}} favourable position to rake Vengeur, and was waiting for Brunswick to separate to open fire.

Soon afterwards, seawater inundated the powder room of Vengeur, denying her all means of defence, and 250 of her crew were out of action.

The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs would go off in Palma. <b>Half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E
