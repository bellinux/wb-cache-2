According to the characteristics of <b>electrode</b> <b>regulator</b> system, an affine-like equivalent model is first derived. Then, the nonlinear control law is derived directly based on the affine-like equivalent model identified with neural networks, which avoids complex control development and intensive computation. The control scheme is simple enough {{that it can be}} implemented on an automotive microcontroller system, and the performance meets the system requirements. The stability of the system is established by the Lyapunov method. Several simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the controller...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the issue of outlier {{detection}} for time series in the process industry. Considering the characteristics of time series in process control systems, such as high non-linearity, strong noise and the special relationship between the input and output of the controlled object, a new outlier detection algorithm is proposed. The algorithm adopts an improved Radial Basis Function Network to construct the model of the controlled object and an Auto-Regression Hidden Markov Model to detect outliers. Unlike many conventional outlier detection methods, this algorithm does not need any prior data and can detect outliers accurately without preselecting the threshold. The proposed detection algorithm is validated by the application to the <b>electrode</b> <b>regulator</b> system of an arc furnace and comparison with Takeuchi&# 39;s auto-regressive model detection approach.

40|$|We {{focus on}} the issue of outlier {{detection}} for time-series data in a process control system (PCS), since outlier detection is a critical step before performing data-based system analysis. Several published articles have proved that a wavelet transform (WT) technique can be used to detect outliers in time-series data, but the standard WT detection method, as well as any other univariate outlier detection technique, does not distinguish between the sudden change caused by the changes of inputs and the fluctuations caused by outliers in PCS. In order to improve this shortcoming of the conventional WT method for the data in a PCS, a new algorithm combining the wavelet technique with a robust radial basis function (RBF) network is proposed here. In this method, a robust RBF network (RBFN) training algorithm is proposed, which can train the RBFN online using the original data as a training set without the need of clean data and thus fits the application of online detection. Furthermore, a hidden Markov model is adopted as an analysis tool to accomplish online automatic detection without pre-selecting the threshold. We compare the performance of our proposed method with the conventional wavelet method and the AR model method to demonstrate its validity through simulation and experimental applications to the data pretreatment process in an electric arc furnace <b>electrode</b> <b>regulator</b> system.
