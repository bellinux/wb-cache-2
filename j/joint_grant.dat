50|$|John Bannerman {{offers a}} {{different}} explanation.

Causantín, not Ethelred, was clearly earl of Fife at that time. Bannerman argues that the translator was thrown off by the use of a singular Gaelic verb for a <b>joint</b> <b>grant</b> (i.e., where the verb had two subjects), common in Gaelic charters. As a result, the translator omitted the mormaer, Causantín.|$|E

The prior was unable to settle the dispute as both Bardolf and de Everingham [...] "held a Moiety of the barony of Shelford", and the prior had one charter stating Haunselyn had founded the priory, a second in which de Caus refers to [...] "his monks of Shelford", and a third which was a <b>joint</b> <b>grant</b> by both Haunselyn and de Caus.

50|$|He is co-author, with Margaret Wetherell of the {{influential}} book Discourse and Social Psychology {{which is one}} of the foundational texts that developed a discourse analytic approach to social psychology, a programme now refined into discursive psychology. It offered new ways of conceptualizing fundamental social psychological notions such as attitudes, categories, social representations and rules. It has been cited more than three thousand times in more than a hundred different journals. One of its central achievements was to develop the analytic notion of 'interpretative repertoires' from Gilbert and Mulkay's work on scientific discourse and show how it could be more generally applied to social psychological topics. A <b>joint</b> <b>grant</b> led by Margaret Wetherell resulted in the volume Mapping the Language of Racism in 1992 that focused on the way racism is displayed and legitimated in conversations, newspaper articles and parliamentary debates.|$|E
50|$|Settlement {{along the}} border was {{creating}} inevitable friction between settlers representing each colony. The first report of problems appears indirectly in a November 1, 1700, Act passed by the Council of New York. The act deals with a dispute between two residents of Kingston, New York, Gerritt Aeritsen and Thomas Swartwout. Aeritsen had contacted the Council complaining that Swartwout was not holding to his part of their 1696 <b>joint</b> <b>grant</b> {{of land in the}} Minisink Country. The Council passed an act instructing Swartwout to honor the agreement, and within the act they also requested that Governor Bellomont of New York begin considering the increasing friction between New York and New Jersey residents along the disputed border. Aeritsen, when he approached the council, must also have told them of the increasing threat to property because of the continuing dispute over the border.|$|E
