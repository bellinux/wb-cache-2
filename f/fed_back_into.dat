5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is <b>fed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E

25|$|The {{critical}} {{detail of}} stimulated emission {{is that the}} induced photon has the same frequency and phase as the incident photon. In other words, the two photons are coherent. It is this property that allows optical amplification, {{and the production of}} a laser system. During the operation of a laser, all three light-matter interactions described above are taking place. Initially, atoms are energized from the ground state to the excited state by a process called pumping, described below. Some of these atoms decay via spontaneous emission, releasing incoherent light as photons of frequency, ν. These photons are <b>fed</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the laser medium, usually by an optical resonator. Some of these photons are absorbed by the atoms in the ground state, and the photons are lost to the laser process. However, some photons cause stimulated emission in excited-state atoms, releasing another coherent photon. In effect, this results in optical amplification.|$|E

40|$|The present {{argument}} {{reflects an}} attempt to write a coherent world history of mythology along strict methodological lines of empirical enquiry. Point of departure is the Out-of-Africa hypothesis. The argument seeks to identify the mythological content, if any, of the Out-of-Africa package (140, 000 BP). For this purpose a corpus of c. 200 mythemes is constructed from sub-Saharan Africa cosmogonic myths as attested in historical times. The corpus is then subsumed under 20 Narrative Complexes, whose number is further reduced because some {{turn out to be}} implied in others. The Narrative Complexes are subjected to elaborate methodologies of absolute and relative dating, based on considerations from the fields of astronomy, genetics, archaeology, modes-of-production analysis, ethnographic distributional analysis, and hermeneutics; these are also argued to offer clues as to the location of origin of each Narrative Complex. It turns out that, as an abstract model with mainly heuristic claims, all Narrative Complexes may be situated, in space and time, along a sustained global mainstream process of mythological development. This starts out in South East Africa with a pre-Out-of-Africa package, subsequently follows the recursive path (first eastward along the Indian Ocean coast, then westward) of Anatomically Modern Humans across the Old World, finally to be <b>fed</b> <b>back,</b> secondarily, <b>into</b> Africa.

In addition to the approved advantages for transportation, EVs {{have the potential to}} provide other benefits within the connected residential distribution to micro-grids and smart grids as part of a vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) system, knowing that in future systems residential distribution can be seen as an energy resource with decentralized and autonomous decisions in the energy management called smart house or prosumer.

40|$|Nature {{has many}} {{attractive}} properties that engineers hope to once incorporate into man-made technology to revolutionize computing. Properties include, among other things, reproduction, learning, adaption and massive parallelism. One bio-inspired computational structure is the Cellular Automaton (CA), which can mimic the massively parallel, distributed and locally interactive nature of multi-cellular organisms. At NTNU, three master theses {{have gone into}} creating a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform whose purpose is to allow research on CAs in combination with artificial evolution and development. The main principle is that a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to create development rules, which are then used to build a CA, which can finally be used to compute a fitness value. The fitness value is then <b>fed</b> <b>back</b> <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> the GA and the process is repeated until a good solution is found. In expectation of new hardware with a larger FPGA, the purpose of most recent thesis was {{to take advantage of}} increased resources to improve speed and to extend the CA into 3 D. However, the hardware failed to be delivered on time due to manufacturing problems. This caused the new communication module to remain unimplemented and only allowed rudimentary simulation testing. In a specialization project leading up to this thesis, a new communication module was implemented and integrated into the platform, allowing proper hardware verification. It showed that the design had many issues, including failing instructions, extensive use of outdated features and separate versions for 2 D and 3 D CAs. In this thesis, the entire platform has therefore been revised and rebuilt. The new platform solves all major issues with the previous and adds further enhancements such as more advanced control flow and an adaptive software API. More and better fine-tunable build parameters allow wider adjustment of performance and make it possible to fit larger CAs within the FPGA. The functionality of all instructions is verified in hardware and a program that creates replicating structures is demonstrated, proving that the platform is complete and ready to be used for research. A clocking issue with the communication module is currently reducing the entire platform to half speed, but if fixed, the raw CA performance will be 35 % higher in 2 D and 300 % higher in 3 D compared to the previous design. For those performance configurations, resource usage is significantly lower in 2 D and equivalent in 3 D...|$|R

Main objective is to review the data collected so far and to analyze and interpret it.

In addition to that, the interpretations derived from the data allow identification of larger-scale changes to the software development process which can be implemented and validated in subsequent software projects.
