5|$|A Wesleyan chapel {{was built}} in 1865; a small {{weatherboard}} building with an attached Sunday School. The Church eventually fell out of use and became a private home. It was demolished during the 1930s.

5|$|Proposals for {{the line}} {{have been made}} since the {{extension}} to Østerås. The current municipal master plan calls for the line to be extended to Bekkestua Station, where it would again intersect with the Kolsås Line. One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås Line and a new branch be built to Sandvika, the municipal center of Bærum. However, an extension <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> priority for the municipal politicians, although the right-of-way has been secured, which will simplify construction.|$|E
5|$|The Roma form {{a sizable}} {{minority}} in contemporary Romania, {{and a small}} but visible presence in Cluj-Napoca: self-identifying Roma in the city comprise only 1 percent of the population; yet they are a familiar presence {{in and around the}} central market, selling flowers, used clothes and tinware. They are an important object of public discourse and media representation at the national level; however, Cluj-Napoca, with its small Roma population, <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> major focus of Roma ethno-political activity.|$|E

5|$|The medieval {{church of}} St John was {{demolished}} in 1824 and rebuilt {{on the same}} site, though a stump of the medieval preaching cross survives by the exterior south wall. The former rectory is a 17th-century structure with later additions. Though it remains adjacent to the church, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> parsonage house {{since the end of}} the 19th century. Today it is known as Glebe House and is divided into flats.|$|E
5|$|Across {{northern}} Australia, Banksia dentata {{has been}} recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to {{as far south as}} Cooktown. Off the coast, it {{has been recorded}} from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands. It also extends onto the Aru Islands, where it is found around Trangan, and New Guinea, where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby, and around Bulolo and Mount Mau. It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> prominent component of the island flora.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} United Kingdom, {{the basic}} {{political}} system in England is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system. There <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> government of England since 1707, when the Acts of Union 1707, putting into effect {{the terms of the}} Treaty of Union, joined England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Before the union England was ruled by its monarch and the Parliament of England. Today England is governed directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although other countries of the United Kingdom have devolved governments. In the House of Commons which is the lower house of the British Parliament based at the Palace of Westminster, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} indoor {{continental}} competitions in Europe (European Athletics Indoor Championships) and Asia (Asian Indoor Athletics Championships). There <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> consistent championships {{for all of}} North America, which may be (in part) due {{to the success of}} both the Central American and Caribbean Championships and the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Most countries have a national championship in track and field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many track and field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes. Some of these have gained significant exposure and prestige, such as the NCAA Track and Field Championship in the United States and the Jamaican High School Championships. However, the number and status of such competitions significantly vary from country to country.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{life was}} {{depicted}} {{in a series}} of contemporary illustrations sketched and water-coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris, mostly drawn in the margins of the Chronica majora. Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering. Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary Dante, who depicted Henry in the Divine Comedy {{as an example of a}} negligent ruler, sitting alone in Purgatory to one side of the other failed kings. It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself, highlighting his unusual piety. Unlike many other medieval kings, Henry did not feature significantly in the works of William Shakespeare, and in the modern period he <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> prominent subject for films, theatre or television, having only a minimal role in modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{high regard}} with which The Invincibles {{are held in}} the annals of Australian and world cricket is {{reflected}} in the various honours accorded to the players. Bradman, Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996. Hassett, Morris and Harvey were later inducted, so that 20% of the inductees are from the 1948 team. Of these six, all except Hassett were selected in Australia's Team of the Century, with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy. Bradman, Lindwall, Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council's Hall of Fame. In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians. Graveney strongly disagreed with the result, writing 'there <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman's Australian tourists of 1948'. The computer regarded Sam Loxton {{as a member of the}} team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey, if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team.|$|E

Yet Bruce himself was frequently caricatured in public as [...] "an Englishman who happened {{to have been born}} in Australia". He drove a Rolls-Royce, wore white spats, and was often seen as distant and lacking the common touch: characteristics that did little to personally endear him to the Australian public.|$|R
