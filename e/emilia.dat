5|$|<b>Emilia</b> {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about}} 18hours, during which it passed about 60mi (95km) southwest of Cabo San Lazaro, {{which is a}} cape located southwest of Ciudad Constitución on the southwestern coast of the Baja California peninsula. After brushing the peninsula with its outer rainbands, <b>Emilia</b> {{turned away from the}} coast into cooler waters, and subsequently began to weaken rapidly. On July 27 it deteriorated into a tropical depression, and the next day <b>Emilia</b> degenerated into a convective-less remnant low. The low continued westward until turning northward on July 30, and on July 31 the remnants of <b>Emilia</b> dissipated about 495mi (800km) west-southwest of San Diego, California.|$|E

5|$|The storm brought {{tropical}} storm force winds and precipitation to the southwestern Mexican coastline. Later, <b>Emilia</b> produced similar {{conditions in the}} southern portion of the Baja California peninsula, where its passage caused minor damage and flooding. Moisture from <b>Emilia</b> reached the southwestern United States, producing thunderstorms and flash flooding in Arizona, as well as beneficial rainfall in southern California. No deaths were reported in association with <b>Emilia.</b>|$|E

5|$|As <b>Emilia</b> first {{approached}} the southwest coast of Mexico, officials issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; the watch was discontinued 30hours after it was issued. The storm passed the region on July 22, and {{is believed to have}} produced tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. A ship recorded 40mph (65km/h) winds while <b>Emilia</b> was just off the coast. Further up the coast, in Mazatlán, strong waves from the storm caused beaches to close, while the outer fringes of the storm dropped 4.68inches (119mm) of precipitation. Inland, the interaction between <b>Emilia</b> and a tropical wave brought increased moisture and precipitation to southeastern and central Mexico.|$|E

5|$|<b>Emilia</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclones on record in the Eastern Pacific, with a minimum pressure of 926mbar (hPa; 27.34inHg). In the CPHC warning zone, only Gilma and Ioke of 2006 attained deeper pressures. <b>Emilia</b> was also a Category5 hurricane for 18hours, the most ever at the time in the Central Pacific. That record was broken later in the season by Hurricane John.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{forecasts}} significantly {{underestimated the}} intensification of <b>Emilia,</b> {{which was one of}} three tropical cyclones to attain Category5 status in the central Pacific during the season. On July 16, a 72-hour forecast misjudged the strengthening of <b>Emilia</b> by 41m/s (92mph). Later, winds at 72hours were 31m/s (69mph) too high when the cyclone began to weaken. Tropical cyclone forecast models consistently predicted <b>Emilia</b> to remain south of the Hawaiian Islands because of the upper troughs' climatologically weak nature during the summer. This led to high confidence in the forecasts, resulting in a lack of watches or warnings. Nonetheless, a high surf advisory was issued for the south and east coasts of all islands.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Emilia</b> was, at the time, {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on {{record in the}} Central Pacific Ocean, and the first of such to be classified as a Category5 hurricane– the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. However, hurricanes Gilma later that year and Ioke in 2006 later reached lower barometric pressures in the Central Pacific. The fifth named storm and {{the first of three}} Category 5hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season, <b>Emilia</b> developed from an area of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July16. Tracking westward, the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Subsequently, <b>Emilia</b> entered the Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC).|$|E

5|$|Pressure {{readings}} from John's peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane <b>Emilia</b> and Hurricane Gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane <b>Emilia</b> and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like <b>Emilia</b> and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than <b>Emilia,</b> Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Emilia</b> {{was a rare}} {{tropical}} cyclone that affected the Baja California peninsula in July 2006. The sixth tropical depression and fifth tropical storm of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, it developed on July 21 about 400miles (650km) {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It moved northward toward the coast, reaching peak winds of 65mph (105km/h) before turning westward and encountering unfavorable conditions. <b>Emilia</b> later turned to the north, passing near Baja California as a strong tropical storm. Subsequently the storm moved further away from the coast, and on July 27 it dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Early on July 23, {{the storm}} briefly became disorganized, with the {{low-level}} circulation becoming ill-defined. Around the same time, <b>Emilia</b> passed about 175mi (280km) southwest of Manzanillo, which was its closest approach to southwestern Mexico; {{it is believed}} to have caused tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. Later that day, after turning west-northwestward, the convection increased markedly as an eyewall began to form. Operationally, it was estimated to have reached winds of 70mph (115km/h), and it was forecast to continue strengthening to attain Category2 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the NHC later re-assessed <b>Emilia</b> as reaching peak winds of 65mph (105km/h), since the eye feature was temporary and not well-defined.|$|E
