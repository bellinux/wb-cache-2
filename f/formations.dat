5|$|Juniata County lies over 16 {{different}} rock <b>formations,</b> some {{of which}} contain limestone. These rock <b>formations</b> come from the Ordovician Period, the Silurian Period, and the Devonian Period. The northernmost {{part of the county}} contains rocks of the Juniata Formation, the Bald Eagle Formation, and undivided Juniata and Bald Eagle <b>formations.</b> All of these <b>formations</b> primarily consist of sandstone. South of these <b>formations</b> lie the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation undivided, the Clinton Group, and the Tuscarora Formation. The first two of these consist mainly of shale, while the third is composed of quartzite. The rock <b>formations</b> in the southwestern part of the county include the Brallier and Harrell <b>Formations</b> undivided, the Hamilton Group, the Irish Valley member of the Catskill Formation, and others. The eastern part of the county lies almost entirely over the Hamilton Group, the Tuscarora Formation, and the Irish Valley member of the Cataskill Formation.|$|E
5|$|Karstic {{limestone}} <b>formations,</b> which {{comprise the}} main geological <b>formations</b> {{of the park}} and the plateau, are found in the park in the form of ponors (sinkholes) in small canyons and rock rims.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area {{includes}} nine known exposed <b>formations,</b> all {{visible in}} Zion National Park in the U.S. state of Utah. Together, these <b>formations</b> represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation {{in that part}} of North America. Part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase, the <b>formations</b> exposed in the Zion and Kolob area were deposited in several different environments that range from the warm shallow seas of the Kaibab and Moenkopi <b>formations,</b> streams and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta <b>formations</b> to the large deserts of the Navajo and Temple Cap <b>formations</b> and dry near shore environments of the Carmel Formation.|$|E
50|$|Examples of rock units formed {{during the}} Aptian are:Antlers <b>Formation,</b> Cedar Mountain <b>Formation,</b> Cloverly <b>Formation,</b> Elrhaz <b>Formation,</b> Jiufotang <b>Formation,</b> Little Atherfield, Mazong Shan, Potomac <b>Formation,</b> Santana <b>Formation,</b> Twin Mountains <b>Formation,</b> Xinminbao Group and Yixian <b>Formation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Dutch Landen <b>Formation</b> is {{not totally}} equal with the Belgian Landen Group. In Belgium, the Orp and Gelinden Members {{are seen as}} one {{separate}} <b>formation,</b> the Heers <b>Formation.</b> The Dutch Landen <b>Formation</b> correlates with the Belgian Heers <b>Formation,</b> Hannut <b>Formation,</b> Tienen <b>Formation</b> {{and parts of the}} Opglabbeek <b>Formation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Horn River <b>Formation</b> is overlain by the Fort Simpson <b>Formation</b> and {{underlain}} by the limestones of the Lonely Bay <b>Formation,</b> Nahanni <b>Formation</b> or Pine Point <b>Formation.</b> It {{is equivalent}} to the Slave Point <b>Formation.</b> In the Northwest Territories it includes the Muskwa <b>Formation,</b> and the Waterways Member of the Hay River <b>Formation.</b> It includes the pinnacle reefs of the Horn Plateau <b>Formation.</b>|$|R
5|$|There are, however, shared rock units {{between all}} three, {{creating}} a supersequence of <b>formations</b> that geologists call the Grand Staircase. Together the <b>formations</b> of the Grand Staircase record nearly 2000 million {{years of the}} Earth's history. Bryce Canyon's <b>formations</b> are the youngest known units in the Grand Staircase. Younger rock units, if they ever existed, have been removed by erosion.|$|E
5|$|This {{table of}} <b>formations</b> exposed in the Death Valley area lists and {{describes}} the exposed <b>formations</b> of the Death Valley National Park {{and the surrounding}} area.|$|E
5|$|A true {{ocean basin}} {{developed}} to the west, breaking all the earlier <b>formations</b> along a steep front. A wedge of clastic sediment {{then began to}} accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves. Three <b>formations</b> developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. The region's first known fossils of complex life are found in the resulting <b>formations.</b> Notable among these are the Ediacara fauna and trilobites, the evolution of the latter being part of the Cambrian Explosion of life.|$|E
50|$|The Redknife <b>Formation</b> is conformly overlain by the Kakisa <b>Formation</b> and overlies the Tathlina <b>Formation</b> in {{northern}} Alberta and the Fort Simpson <b>Formation</b> in British Columbia and Northwest Territories. The Fort Simpson <b>Formation</b> replaces the Redknife <b>Formation</b> to the west. The Redknife <b>Formation</b> can {{be correlated with}} the Nisku <b>Formation</b> and {{upper part of the}} Ireton <b>Formation</b> in central Alberta.|$|R
50|$|The BiCoNi <b>Formation</b> is a {{hydrothermal}} lode <b>formation,</b> {{in which}} bismuth, cobalt, nickel and uranium ores have coalesced. It occurs {{mainly in the}} Ore Mountains and is the youngest <b>formation</b> in the hydrothermal sequence (polymetalliferous (kb) <b>formation,</b> iron-barite (eba) <b>formation,</b> precious brownspar (eb) <b>formation,</b> fluorite-barite (fba) <b>formation,</b> BiCoNi <b>formation).</b> Due to its combination with uranium, it is occasionally also called the bismuth-cobalt-nickel-uranium <b>formation.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kaskapau <b>Formation</b> in {{northern}} Alberta replaces the upper Blackstone <b>Formation,</b> the Cardium <b>Formation,</b> and the Muskiki <b>Formation.</b> Where the Kaskapau <b>Formation</b> includes post Cardium beds, the Muskiki {{is considered a}} member of the Wapiabi <b>Formation.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{selecting}} the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley <b>formations,</b> two geologic {{units of the}} lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners {{to be the primary}} sampling interest of the mission. It was these <b>formations</b> that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of lunar samples from the mission.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone <b>formations</b> are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic <b>formations</b> is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic <b>formations</b> include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
5|$|Both the 31st and 51st Battalions {{were later}} re-raised as {{separate}} units when Australia's part-time military was re-raised in 1948 {{under the guise}} of the Citizen Military Forces. Later, they became company-level <b>formations</b> of the Pentropic 2nd Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, in 1960. A further re-organisation saw the units split again in 1965 and re-raised as battalion-level <b>formations</b> under their old numerical designations. They have remained separate since then.|$|E
5000|$|The Judith River <b>Formation</b> {{conformably}} overlies the Claggett <b>Formation</b> and Pakowki <b>Formation.</b> It is overlain by the Bearpaw <b>Formation.</b> It {{is equivalent}} to the Belly River <b>Formation</b> in the southern Canadian Rockies foothills, the Lea Park <b>Formation</b> in central Alberta and the Wapiti <b>Formation</b> in the northwestern plains.|$|R
50|$|The Vilquechico <b>Formation</b> is a Late Campanian to Late Maastrichtian {{geologic}} <b>formation</b> {{in southern}} Peru.

50|$|The Santa Lucía <b>Formation</b> is a <b>formation</b> of the Potosí Basin in Bolivia {{dated to}} the Paleocene, 60 to 58.2 Ma. It overlies the Cretaceous El Molino <b>Formation</b> and is overlain by the Cayara <b>Formation.</b> The <b>formation</b> is {{laterally}} equivalent with the Maíz Gordo <b>Formation</b> of northern Argentina, and time-equivalent with the Salamanca <b>Formation</b> of Argentina, the Maria Farinha <b>Formation</b> of the Paraíba Basin in northern Brazil and the Guaduas <b>Formation</b> of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and fossiliferous Cerrejón <b>Formation</b> of the Cesar-Ranchería Basin, Colombia.|$|R
5|$|Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Los Alamitos (Ferugliotherium), La Colonia (Ferugliotherium and Argentodites), and Allen <b>Formations</b> (Trapalcotherium). All three are {{approximately}} the same age, dating to the Campanian (84–71mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71–66mya), but the La Colonia Formation is perhaps a little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen <b>Formations</b> may have been deposited in a marshy environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia <b>Formations</b> {{may have been an}} estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain.|$|E
5|$|Gannon {{has also}} been called a 'tactical maverick' due to his unusual <b>formations.</b> These <b>formations</b> include 3–4–1–2, 4–3–2–1, 4–1–2–3, and his {{preferred}} set-up of 4–2–3–1. He has stated that he prefers <b>formations</b> that use four lines of players (as opposed to three lines in the classic 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence and presence in midfield, and was inspired to use the <b>formations</b> by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he prefers the 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football. He {{is known to be}} extremely thorough and meticulous in preparing his players for games.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to independent movements, the party can create <b>formations,</b> with specific <b>formations</b> triggering different status buffs such as regenerating HP or AP. New <b>formations</b> are acquired {{through the course}} of the game, and are specific to characters. Following each battle, characters gain both experience points and ability points; the former raises their experience level and general statistics, while the latter are used as currency to unlock more or upgrade existing abilities. Each character's equipment can be enhanced through the combined effects of assigning types of equipment and items or accessories to a particular character, strengthening their abilities. In {{addition to}} standard battles, characters have access to mechs with their own move sets and abilities, with basic mechanics shared with normal battles.|$|E
