30|$|The lower {{market prices}} of the {{upstream}} product could also enhance the competitiveness of country H’s <b>downstream</b> agricultural <b>industry.</b> However, country H’s <b>downstream</b> agricultural <b>industry</b> would be simultaneously facing higher import competition levels from country F.

For instance, consider the case where the increases in the downstream market competition levels, which are promoted by the lower prices of the upstream product, outweigh the corresponding competitiveness benefits for country H’s <b>downstream</b> agricultural <b>industry.</b> Then, the previously discussed patterns could prevail where increases in import competition could either induce country H’s <b>downstream</b> agricultural <b>industry</b> to upgrade its technology and productivity (as illustrated in the previous section) or to reduce its technology and productivity upgrading efforts (as illustrated in the previous section).

The {{results of the study}} suggest that even after controlling for firm heterogeneity, stronger presence of foreign firms in <b>downstream</b> <b>industries</b> yields better export performance of domestic firms. We do not find any evidence on the effect of supplying to foreign affiliated firms on the quality of exporting.

Across industries, those characteristics of FDI, such as the labour productivity gap between indigenous and foreign companies, whether FDI is from Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan or other countries and whether FDI is wholly owned or jointly owned, appear less influential on the backward linkages than the activities of foreign enterprises (e. g. value-added activities and import and export activities).

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model in}} which a monopolist supplier can contribute to downstream product improvements by creating knowledge spillovers which downstream firms use {{as a substitute for}} their own R&D efforts. Although a market for R&D information does not exist, the supplier may appropriate an indirect return on R&D for two reasons. Sufficiently high levels of spillover information lead to greater downstream product quality, and spillover information reduces the equilibrium sunk cost of R&D for downstream firms and thus facilitates entry. Both effects cause an expansion of downstream output and enhance the demand for the supplier's intermediate good. Given sufficiently strong incentives for supplier R&D, the locus of R&D shifts partially from the downstream to the upstream industry. R&D expenditures, technological opportunities, and <b>downstream</b> <b>industry</b> structure are determined endogenously. Weak appropriability conditions in the <b>downstream</b> <b>industry</b> enhance innovation incentives in the supply sector. innovation, knowledge spillovers, research and development...|$|R
