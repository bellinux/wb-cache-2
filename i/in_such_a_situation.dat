5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> insurers would have to raise their premiums to cover the relatively sicker and thus more expensive policies, which could create a vicious cycle in which {{more and more people}} drop their coverage.|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|In the High Court Colin Rimer QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, {{held that}} since the shares were all identical, the lack of {{segregation}} between them did not invalidate the trust. The standard case in this area, Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, was distinguished because the subject matter there was potentially different, while all of Moss's shares were identical.

5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up evidence that would show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|Mello invades SPK—an {{organization}} {{that aims to}} catch Kira—to retrieve a photograph of himself from Near. Before he leaves SPK, Mello tells Near about Sidoh and the fake rules, which sharpens Near's suspicions on Light. Mello then enlists {{the help of his}} friend Matt to spy on Misa Amane, suspecting she is helping Kira. After learning that Light is Kira and Near is going to attempt to apprehend him, Mello and Matt kidnap Kiyomi Takada, Kira's spokesperson. Matt pretends to attack Takada, and Mello offers to take her to safety. Takada agrees but then realizes his identity. Mello forces her to strip naked to get rid of any tracking devices. However, Takada uses a hidden piece of Death Note paper to kill Mello, as Light had told her his name and what to do <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation.</b> Mello's actions ultimately lead to Light's downfall; Teru Mikami uses the hidden real Death Note to try to kill Takada, which leads to Near learning that the notebook Mikami had been using prior is fake and swapping the real Death Note with his own fake for the final confrontation with Kira.|$|E

5|$|On 26 August, the {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious sailed from Singapore with her two escorting destroyers, HMS Caesar and HMS Cavendish, bound for Fremantle in Western Australia. The genuine purpose of the voyage is still disputed, but {{it is probable that}} the carrier group was passing through as a show of strength to Indonesia {{in the wake of the}} Pontian landings as well as the routine 'goodwill visit' that the vessel was purportedly making to Britain's ally. The task force was surprisingly met by very little Indonesian response as it passed through their territorial waters, the carrier reporting only a single Tupolev Tu-16 aircraft making a flyover as the warships passed through the Sunda Strait the following day. The ownership of the Strait itself was complex, as Indonesia claimed it despite British assertions that it was an international waterway that her warships could pass through at any time. Following standard British procedure <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation,</b> the British Military Attache in Jakarta had telephoned ahead to the Indonesian Director of Naval Intelligence that the squadron would be passing through Indonesian territory without seeking their clearance, a precedent set the last time Britain had used the Straits in October 1963. This policy, engineered by the Foreign Office, had the dual purpose of notifying the Indonesians of a possibly provocative action without recognizing what they thought to be exaggerated claims on international waters. The return date to Singapore was not set exactly at the time of sailing but was to be sometime in mid-September.|$|E
