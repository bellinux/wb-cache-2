50|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} of nerve injury including <b>mechanical</b> <b>lesions,</b> ischemia, immunologic attack, metabolic disorder, toxic agents, {{and exposure to}} radiation. The most common mechanism of injury is nerve compression in which external pressure causes decreased {{blood flow to the}} nerve and deformation of the nerve fibers. Repeated or prolonged compression of the nerve results in ischemia and ultimately edema above and below the source of the pressure (I). The thinning of myelin sheaths or focal demyelination are the main consequences of the injury that lead to conduction blockage.|$|R

40|$|Sulphated glycoprotein- 2, {{thought to}} be {{involved}} in programmed cell death in peripheral organs, has been detected at increased levels in brain degenerative states. In this paper we have investigated the regional and cellular expression of this protein during development of brain lesion. With this aim sulphated glycoprotein- 2 mRNA levels were studied in models of ischemic (transient forebrain ischemia) or mechanical (partial mesodiencephalic hemitransection) brain injuries using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Marked increases in sulphated glycoprotein- 2 mRNA were observed in lesioned brains in both models. In addition, we report a shift in the regional distribution of positive cells in both lesion models 1 - 7 days post-lesion. After transient forebrain ischemia, sulphated glycoprotein- 2 mRNA increases were always localized in selectively vulnerable regions (caudate-putamen, hippocampal formation), showing a temporal change in the pattern of intraregional distribution from less to more lesioned parts. In the case of <b>mechanical</b> <b>lesion</b> at 1 day, increased labelling had a widespread distribution on the lesioned side and was also observed on the intact side near the midline. In contrast, at 7 days increased labelling was restricted to regions directly lesioned (either areas whose input and/or output connections were severed by the transection or areas which were directly affected by the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lesion).</b> Analysis at the cellular level revealed that at both time intervals and in both lesion models most cell bodies overlain by dense clusters of specific grains were non-neuronal cells. The distribution patterns and their change over time suggest {{that at least some of}} these cells are inflammatory and phagocytic cells. The majority of degenerating neuronal cells after ischemia did not show increased levels of sulphated glycoprotein- 2 mRNA.

40|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>lesion</b> in hippocampal organotypic {{cultures}} {{is followed}} by a recovery process involving scar formation, sprouting of fibres and formation of new functional synapses. Here we tested the effect of staurosporine and chelerythrine, two protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, on this lesion-induced neurite outgrowth of Shaffer collaterals. At a concentration of 1 microM, staurosporine delayed functional recovery assessed by measuring synaptic field potentials across the lesion, without altering synaptic transmission on nonlesioned cultures. Immunostaining carried out by using antibodies directed against neurofilament proteins showed that there was a marked {{reduction in the number of}} regenerating fibres crossing the lesion. In contrast to this, chelerythrine (50 microM) did not prevent functional recovery, although it affected synaptic transmission and plasticity at this concentration.

This phenomenon is related to the creation of shear-induced high-mobility zones. The characteristics of these zones appear to be independent of the deformation level applied to the system. The use of a specific procedure allows the determination of the values of the apparent activation energy of the mechanism.
