She married the Rev. Henry Mackarness in 1852, and with him had eleven children, four of whom did not survive infancy. Taking after her father <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> output, Matilda Mackarness produced an average of one book a year until her death, most of them under her married name. Her husband's death in 1868 left her with little means of supporting her family, as the books did not produce much income. She and her children {{moved in with her}} father.|$|E

Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. During the 1980s, the Ethiopic character set was computerized.

500|$|Private {{investigator}} Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston), {{a character}} inspired {{in part by}} Shore's love of The Rockford Files, appears in three episodes of season five. House initially hires Douglas to spy on Wilson, who has ended their friendship after Volakis's death (the friendship is subsequently rekindled). House later pays Douglas {{to look into the}} private lives of his team members and Cuddy. If the character had been accepted by the audience, plans existed to feature him as the lead in a spin-off show. In September 2008, Shore spoke to Entertainment Weekly about his vision for the character: [...] "I don't want to do just another medical show. What does excite me <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> is the choices people make and the nature of right and wrong... and a private investigator can approach that question much more readily than a doctor can." [...] There was no show featuring Douglas on the fall 2009 network television schedule. He returns to House in season six as Cuddy's boyfriend. They are briefly engaged until Cuddy breaks it off, realizing that she is in love with House.|$|E

Working from a selection of Australian cookery books such as those for girls by Flora Pell {{in the first half of}} the last century, through Margaret Gossett's landmark Children’s Picture Cookbook (1947) to today's plethora of children-targeted volumes, this paper will address this Australian publishing phenomenon...|$|R
500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", and for the past two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. And then, something happens and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create not just what we are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E

This paper describes a technique for combining the Index-less Indexed Flash Code (ILIFC) and the Layered Index-less Indexed Flash Code (LILIFC) in order to decrease the write deficiency. Two resulting flash codes are proposed: the Bi-Modal Flash Code (BMFC) and the Two-Split Bi-Modal Flash Code (BMFC 2). These proposed flash codes have an asymptotic worst case <b>write</b> deficiency <b>of</b> O(k 2 q + n/k), and through computer simulation are shown to have significantly lower average write deficiency compared with the ILIFC and LILIFC...|$|R

Although, we are taking a [...] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now." [...] Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated [...] "We intend to pay respect to Myth and its fans.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} models for public health surveillance of illnesses among children in out-of-home child care facilities. METHODS: Between July 1992 and March 1994, 200 Seattle-King County child care facilities participated in active or enhanced passive surveillance, or both. Reporting was based on easily recognized signs, symptoms, and sentinel events. Published criteria were used in evaluating surveillance effectiveness, and notifiable disease reporting of participating and nonparticipating facilities was compared. RESULTS: Neither surveillance model was well accepted by child care providers. Enhanced passive and active surveillance had comparable sensitivity. Reporting delays and the large amount of time needed for data entry led to problems with timeliness, especially <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>written</b> reporting during active surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread active public health surveillance in child care facilities is not feasible for most local health departments. Improvements in public health surveillance in child care settings will depend on acceptability to providers...|$|R

To this end, a total number of 41 undergraduate English B 1 students have been working on 10 sequenced subtitling activities using short pre-selected videos taken from an American sitcom in the course of a month and a half.
