30|$|Reconstructing {{meandering}} paleo-channels {{is attracting}} global research attention. We implemented a novel method by comprehensively integrating migration models and sedimentary structures. Firstly, the <b>migration</b> <b>architectures</b> of the corresponding characteristics in planform and cross-sectional models were summarised as expansion, translation, expansion and translation, expansion and downstream rotation, constriction and downstream rotation, and expansion and countercurrent rotation models. Secondly, full continuous core data from 270 dense drilling wells {{were collected from}} the Daqing Oil Field in the Songliao Basin, China, providing information on rock textures, sedimentary cycles, and boundary information for the two layers being studied. Through a comprehensive analysis of dense drill cores and logging data, the abandoned channels and the initial and final channel centrelines were identified. Consequently, four profiles, including one longitudinal and three transverse sections, were constructed to reveal the cross-sectional structures and planform <b>migration</b> <b>architecture.</b> Profile interpretation revealed the evolution from the initial channel centreline to the final centreline. Using a method of rational interpolation, {{we were able to}} reconstruct the <b>migration</b> <b>architecture</b> of the meandering channels. The results showed that the average ancient bankfull width (Wc) was approximately 100  m, a single meandering belt was 800  m, the radius of the curvature was 250  m, the length of the channel bend was 700  m, the average meander wavelength was 1300  m, the sinuosity was 3.0, and the annual average discharge rate was 450  m 3 /s. Furthermore, we compared the results from empirical equations, which verified that our reconstruction is both feasible and potentially widely applicable.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis describes a component-based methodology {{for developing a}} new class of systems called spatial decision support systems (SDSS). The methodology is presented {{within the context of the}} development of the ARIES (army Reserve Installation Evaluation System) software application, an SDSS designed to evaluate and compare site desirability for Army Reserve unit locations. The ARIES SDSS consists of a flexible component-based architecture that seamlessly integrates a user interface, GIS, multi-criteria decision model with associated DSS, and data warehouse. To build the SDSS, the ARIES developers introduced a new architectural paradigm, undertaking a collaborative approach with U. S. Army Reserve Command (USARC) decision-makers to rapidly prototype ARIES using component-based technologies. The developers implemented several domain specific architectures using a formalized proof of concept heuristic, Concept to Code (C 2 C), which conceptualizes user requirements in architectural terms, and migrating legacy data sources into a spatial data warehouse. C 2 C allowed the resultant ARIES application to be conceptualized initially in general terms, and then specialized architecturally around existing off the shelf components, as design requirements were collaboratively prototyped and implemented within the existing USARC information system infrastructure. C 2 C facilitated the complete development of a complex, map-based system and accompanying data warehouse in the span of a few months with a technical team of three analysts and programmers.

40|$|Electrical {{energy is}} {{high-quality}} form of energy, {{and thus it}} is beneficial to store the excessive electric energy in the electrical energy storage (EES) rather than converting into {{a different type of}} energy. Like memory devices, no single type of EES element can fulfill all the desirable requirements. Despite active research on the new EES technologies, it is not likely to have an ultimate high-efficiency, highpower/energy capacity, low-cost, and long-cycle life EES element in the near future. We propose an HEES system that consists of two or more heterogeneous EES elements, thereby realizing the advantages of each EES element while hiding their weaknesses. The HEES management problems can be broken into charge allocation into different banks of EES elements, charge replacement (i. e., discharge) from different banks of EES elements, and charge migration from one bank to another bank of EES elements. In spite of the optimal charge allocation and replacement, charge migration is mandatory to leverage the EES system efficiency. This paper is the first paper that formally describes the charge migration efficiency and its optimization. We first define the charge <b>migration</b> <b>architecture</b> and the corresponding charge migration problem.

40|$|What {{happened}} to urban policies? Rumours {{and evidence of}} retreat or even death of urban policies have been documented {{in line with the}} restructuring of the nation state, globalisation processes and the neo liberal turn of many public policies: large public investments in social housing is for instance at low ebb (Harloe 1995). By contrast, urban policies seem to be everywhere, ―new‖ urban policies in particular, whatever that means, seem to flourish even at every level. Against the view that globalisation is sweeping everything and determining the faith of cities, a set of literature attempts to show that state and cities have still a major say in the structuring and organisation of cities, hence a role for politics and institutions in relation to social groups, and economic relations constrained and articulated to different sets of pressures (Saraceno 2002; Marcuse & Van Kempen 2002; Moulaert 2002; Jessop 2002; Le Galès 2002, Brenner 2005, Harding, Forthcoming). Urbanization is reaching new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities beyond 15 million inhabitants such as Calcutta, Los Angelès, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Bombay or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of those large urban areas: postmetropolis, global cities, global city-regions. Processes of globlisation, including transnational <b>migration,</b> <b>architecture,</b> financial transactions, transport flux, or dissemination of technological innovations contribute to the rise of mega cities in different part of the globe.

EM area and energy consumption are very competitive, and, on the average, it outperforms a directory-based MOESI baseline by 1. 3 × and a traditional S-NUCA design by 1. 2 ×. We argue that with EM scaling performance has much lower cost and design complexity than in directorybased coherence and traditional NUCA architectures: by merely scaling network bandwidth from 256 to 512 bit flits, the performance of our architecture improves by an additional 13 %, while the baselines show negligible improvement. ...|$|R
