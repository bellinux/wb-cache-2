5|$|Private flying is most {{associated}} with the traditional form of factory-produced two and <b>four-seater,</b> single piston-engine training and touring aircraft. Examples of these are the Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper PA28 Cherokee, all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of Cirrus. The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £133, compared to an estimated £77 per hour for gliders, and a reported £35 per hour for microlights. Recent trends have seen {{an increase in the}} use of microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the Robinson R22 and R44. Another growth area in private flying {{in recent years has been}} in the use of amateur built aircraft, such as the Van's Aircraft RV-4 and the Europa.|$|E
25|$|The Cessna Model 160 was an American single-engine, <b>four-seater,</b> high wing, strut-braced, {{prototype}} monoplane {{designed in}} 1962 by Cessna.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, the Van {{received}} a higher roof {{and became a}} <b>four-seater.</b> This was necessitated by Japanese commercial vehicle regulation which require the floor to be completely flat when the rear seat is folded. Because the Rex's engine was mounted in the rear, the cargo floor was rather high, meaning that more head room would be required before a seat could be installed. The Wagon continued in production until the SEEC-T version was introduced in December, but it lost most of its market with {{the availability of a}} <b>four-seater</b> Van.|$|E

50|$|Around 1300 Albatross were built, {{from which}} 800 two-seaters (715 MkI/2/3), and 267 <b>four-seaters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the three-seat touring plane Klemm Kl 32 in the European touring plane {{championship}} Challenge 1932, the company was ordered by the German Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) to develop another aircraft {{to take part in the}} next Challenge 1934. Due to changes of contest rules, it had to be more modern machine, <b>four-seater</b> with better performance and better STOL capabilities. Designer was Friedrich Fechner. As a result, new aircraft Kl 36 was a streamlined comfortable <b>four-seater</b> with rich wing mechanization, and was the fastest of all Klemms.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a demand}} from some {{customers}} {{for a larger}} <b>four-seater</b> car, for whom AC produced the Greyhound. This was built on a stretched Ace chassis with coil suspension all around and a 2.2-litre Bristol engine.|$|E
25|$|Although the 1955-57 Thunderbird was a success, Ford executives—particularly Robert McNamara – were {{concerned}} that the car's position as a two-seater limited its sales potential. As a result, the car was redesigned as a <b>four-seater</b> for 1958.|$|E
50|$|The Hupp-Yeats used Westinghouse motors {{with five}} {{selective}} speeds. The cars were built as <b>four-seaters</b> in both open and closed models, and came with standard solid rubber tires.|$|R
50|$|Howard Darrin {{continued}} to build special orders in his Hollywood shop. The bodies contracted out were convertible Victorias, <b>four-seaters</b> {{with a low}} profile but with wind-down windows in their doors.|$|R
50|$|The car {{was one of}} {{the fastest}} {{production}} <b>four-seaters</b> of its era. The Mk II, capable of 136 mph, ran a quarter mile (~400 m) in 14.6 seconds, and accelerated from 0-60 mi/h km/h in 6.7 seconds.|$|R
25|$|In July and August 1929, Violette Cordery and {{her younger}} sister Evelyn drove her 4.5 litre <b>four-seater</b> Invicta for 30,000 miles in less than 30,000 minutes (approximately 20 days, 20 hours), {{averaging}} 61.57mph and earning her second Dewar Trophy from the Royal Automobile Club.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the CAA {{reclassified}} all ARVs as PFA (now LAA) Permit aircraft. The ARV Super2 {{was originally}} intended to be aerobatic, but the Isle of Wight factory closed before CAA clearance was obtained, so aerobatics remain prohibited. Also, the factory had planned to develop a <b>four-seater</b> version, wing-tip tanks and floats.|$|E
25|$|Cessna {{thought that}} a less {{expensive}} <b>four-seater</b> aircraft than the existing Cessna 172 would have good market potential. The company designed a simplified four-seat high-wing aircraft using non-tapering wings, extensive use of heavily beaded wing and fuselage skins as well as free-castering nose gear to save weight and decrease the man-hours required for construction.|$|E
5000|$|A {{parliamentary}} committee in 2010 discussed the [...] "increasing trend towards {{the creation of}} three-seat constituencies in Ireland" [...] and recommended not less than <b>four-seaters,</b> except where the geographic size of such a constituency would be disproportionately large.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1897 Paris-Dieppe, the [...] four-cylinder Delahayes ran in four- and six-seater classes, {{with a full}} {{complement}} of passengers. Archdeacon was third in the <b>four-seaters</b> behind a De Dion-Bouton and a Panhard, Courtois winning the six-seater class, ahead of the only other car in the class.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} further {{developed}} {{to produce the}} more powerful and heavier SM-7 and SM-8 models which were full <b>four-seaters</b> and these were also used by commercial firms. The Junior R of 1932 had a deeper fuselage and a low-set stub wing to mount the undercarriage and wing struts.|$|R
25|$|In the 1940s, William Paley and Leon Levy formed Jaclyn Stable, which {{owned and}} raced {{a string of}} {{thoroughbred}} race horses. Paley formed a modern art collection {{with as many as}} 40 major works, and he enjoyed photographing Picasso in Cap d'Antibes. Like Picasso, Paley drove an exotic French Facel Vega Facel II, the fastest <b>four-seater</b> car in the world in the early 1960s.|$|E
25|$|On January 12, 1992, Graham Sellers, {{the pilot}} and only {{occupant}} of a Piper Twin Comanche two-engine <b>four-seater</b> plane, died when both engines failed on his final approach to land at the airport. Sellars was test flying the aircraft after it had been serviced for engine problems. His plane clipped the treetops, crashed through the airport's perimeter chain link fence and {{came to rest on}} the grass next to Runway 33.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, Supercars {{released}} details {{concerning the}} future of the category. New regulations, dubbed Gen2 Supercar, were introduced in 2017 to allow the use of two-door coupé body styles and turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines. However, no teams elected to build cars for the new regulations until 2018. Cars are still required to be based on front-engined, rear-wheel drive, <b>four-seater</b> production cars that are sold in Australia. The chassis and control components will be carried over from the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, while engine and aerodynamic parity will be reviewed.|$|E
50|$|There {{was a clear}} {{cleavage}} by 1925. As <b>four-seaters</b> {{were more}} profitable, two-seaters increasingly turned over to specialist manufacturers, led by Alvis, Aston-Martin, and Frazer-Nash, with shoestring budgets, fanatic followers, and limited sales (today exemplified by Aston and Morgan): between 1921 and 1939, 350 Astons were built; 323 Frazer-Nashes in the period 1924-39.|$|R
50|$|The LWB 250 GT {{theme was}} {{expanded}} with the 2+2 model 250 GT/E, the first large-production four-seat Ferrari (earlier <b>four-seaters</b> {{were made in}} very small numbers). Interior space was increased by moving the engine forward in the chassis. The rear seats were suitable for children but small for adults. Pirelli Cinturato 185VR15 tyres (CA67) were original equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The other {{standard}} bodies advertises {{were four}} or two-seater cabriolets, the <b>four-seaters</b> priced in 1937 at approximately 6,000 francs above the steel-bodied saloons, and the two-seaters even more expensive at 72,700 or 83,610 francs for a 17CV or 23CV two-seater cabriolet. [...] (At this stage the 15CV Baby was not listed with a two-seater cabriolet body.) ...|$|R
25|$|By 1959, BMW was in {{debt and}} losing money. The Isetta was selling well but with small profit margins. Their 501-based luxury sedans were not selling well enough to be {{profitable}} and were becoming increasingly outdated. Their 503 coupé and 507 roadster were too expensive to be profitable. Their 600, a <b>four-seater</b> based on the Isetta, was selling poorly. The motorcycle market imploded in the mid-1950s with increased affluence turning Germans away from motorcycles and toward cars. BMW had sold their Allach plant to MAN in 1954. American Motors and the Rootes Group had both tried to acquire BMW.|$|E
25|$|JKSB Ronda is {{the highway}} patrol unit to patrol along the Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge and land expressways {{and also to}} provide {{assistance}} to commuters on the bridge. The current highway patrol vehicles are the Japanese made Toyota Hilux and the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, the <b>four-seater</b> electric vehicle, with similar dimensions of a Perodua Viva, is able to travel 150km after an eight-hour full charge. Seven charging stations were also set up at the toll plaza on the mainland, two of them being rapid chargers which are able to give an 80 percent charge in 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1930s, then, six {{vehicles}} were introduced (designated 22a through f), including {{a sports car}}, a sports coupe, a truck, a delivery van, a farm tractor, and a tank. They were all cast in lead. Soon after, the first Dinky model car available individually was numbered 23 – a sports car based on the MG Magic Midget. At this early time a series 24 (a-h) were introduced and included a generic ambulance (made until the late 1940s) a grand sport open <b>four-seater,</b> a grand sport two-seater, a coupe and a limousine (Gardner and O'Neill 1996, pp.46–47). The 24 series was also made in France.|$|E
5000|$|The company built a {{wide range}} of {{electric}} carriages - some bodied as high, ungainly-looking dos-a-dos <b>four-seaters</b> - these were claimed to be capable of running from 35 mi to 50 mi. Perhaps optimistically, the manufacturer claimed that [...] "very few private carriages would ever be subjected to such a test". The company moved to New Jersey in 1902, according to a company statement, “to find more wealthy customers,” but they shutdown operations within the year.|$|R
5000|$|Before the Tipo 26M, the {{original}} Tipo 26 from 1926 had evolved into version such as 26B, 26C and 26R. Based on these, the Tipo 26M was designed in 1930 as mostly single-seaters (M meaning monoposto) and {{also referred to}} as 8C 2500 (8 cylinder, 2500 cc). [...] Six of the 26M were made intoTipo 26M Sport for long endurance purposes.Special two-seaters for road use, were the 26M Grand Sport by Carrozzeria Castagna, and the Sport Tipo 1000 Miglia by Ugo Zagato. Two <b>four-seaters</b> were later referred to as the company's first attempt at non-racing cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{winner of}} the first event, held on Saturday 12 August 1905, was Ernest Instone (35 hp Daimler), who {{established}} the hill record by recording a time of 77.6 seconds for an average speed of 26.15 mph (42.08 km/h). However, at that time hillclimbs were not strictly speed events at all, performances being rated {{in terms of a}} formula based on power and cars of 20 hp or more being required to be <b>four-seaters</b> and to carry passengers. There was also the question of whether a particular car would make it up the hill at all. In fact, in these early years, drivers' actual times were not even announced to spectators.|$|R
25|$|Al Mooney {{had been}} {{developing}} the designs for a <b>four-seater</b> plane {{for some time}} while the Mite was in production. In early 1953, the company moved to Kerrville, Texas, and {{when it became clear}} that the Mite was nearing the end of its production, the development of the new plane was accelerated. The first M20 flight took place on September 3, 1953. Charles Yankey had been the primary financial backer since he helped Al establish the company in 1948, and when he visited Kerrville for a ride in the new airplane, he was pleased with the project and began to develop the financial plans necessary to put the plane into production.|$|E
25|$|Influenced by {{the public}} {{response}} {{to the introduction of}} Mercedes-Benz's 300SL and 190SL show cars at the International Motor Sports Auto Show in New York in February 1954, the management of BMW approved Grewenig's proposal to build a sports car based on the 502. Preliminary design sketches were seen by U.S. importer Max Hoffman, who suggested to industrial designer Albrecht von Goertz that he should submit design proposals to BMW's management as an alternative. Based on these proposals, BMW contracted the design of the sports car and a four-seat grand tourer to von Goertz in November 1954. The 507 roadster was introduced at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York in the summer of 1955, while the 503 <b>four-seater</b> was introduced in September of that year at the Frankfurt Motor Show.|$|E
500|$|This {{section of}} the park {{originally}} opened with five rides: Dragon Fire, Wild Beast, The Rage, Spinovator, and Nightmares. Steel roller coaster Dragon Fire includes 4 inversions, {{and is now the}} only Arrow Dynamics coaster in existence to have counter-clockwise turning corkscrews. Out and back wooden roller coaster Wilde Beast has 3000 feet of track, while Night Mares is a standing Enterprise ride featuring ten <b>four-seater</b> gondolas rises 60 feet, tilting 90 degrees. Viking's Rage, was the first of three pendulum rides the park operated; unlike the now removed Jet Scream, the boat ride does not go upside down. Spinovator features spinning kettles on a tilted platform. (Two years before opening, Dragon Fire was simply called the Looping Corkscrew, and another ride was to be the Wildcat.) ...|$|E
50|$|The name harkens back to Aero Airlines's and Finnair's first incarnation, Aero AS, {{founded in}} 1923, and its first Junkers F 13 {{seaplane}} {{took off from}} Helsinki harbor in Katajanokka to a lake near to the present Ülemiste Airport in Tallinn for its first flight, March 20, 1924, carrying 162 kg (357 lbs) of mail. Other destinations were quickly added: Stockholm and Königsberg, from where passengers took trains respectively to Göteborg (sometimes boarding other planes to Copenhagen, Oslo and London) and to Berlin, and passengers began to queue up at some periods — up to 48 per day in 1926 waiting for the <b>four-seaters</b> to fly them.|$|R
5000|$|After the Second World War the one {{much larger}} 13.5 fiscal {{horsepower}} Oxford Series MO replaced {{the range of}} Ten horsepower series M, Morris's Twelve and Morris's Fourteen. It was announced along with the new 918 cc Minor and the 2.2-litre Six on 26 October 1948. Designed by Alec Issigonis, the Oxford, along with the Morris Minor, introduced unit construction techniques, {{although it is not}} widely recognized as a true unibody car. [...] The MO was sold as a 4-door saloon and 2-door Traveller estate with an exposed wooden frame at the rear. Both were <b>four-seaters.</b> A six-cylinder version was sold as the Morris Six MS. It was replaced by the Oxford Series II announced Tuesday 18 May 1954.|$|R
50|$|Production of cars ceased {{during the}} war years, but by 1946 a new vehicle was offered, the Jensen PW (a luxury saloon). Few were {{produced}} since raw materials were carefully limited by the new government's central planning. Also in 1946 body designer Eric Neale joined Jensen Motors from Wolseley and his first project was the more modern coupe which followed in 1950, named the Interceptor, which was built until 1957. In 1955, Jensen started production of Neale's masterpiece, the 541, which used the then-revolutionary material of fiberglass for its bodywork. The 541S was replaced by another Neale design, the C-V8 in October 1962, which replaced the Austin-sourced straight-6 of the previous cars with a 6-litre American Chrysler V8. This large engine in such a lightweight car made the Jensen {{one of the fastest}} <b>four-seaters</b> of the time.|$|R
