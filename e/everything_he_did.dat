5|$|Flanders had {{a strict}} Congregationalist {{religious}} beginning, which evolved with his experience into {{a belief in}} “moral law.” He felt that “recognition of moral law {{is as much a}} necessary requirement of social achievement as physical law is of material advancement.” In Flanders’s view, moral law required honesty, compassion, responsibility, cooperation, humility, and wisdom—values that all cultures hold in common. For him it was an absolute standard. He spoke of a “Presence” or “daimon” that “renewed his courage” and “indicated direction” in <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

25|$|Charles {{approached}} stuttering {{from the}} viewpoint that the stutterer should scrutinize his stuttering behavior, {{to become aware of}} <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> from anticipation of stuttering, to struggling during a block, and to the utterance of the word. A speech-language clinician using his methodology was to explain to her client the nature of the many attitudes and behaviors of stutterers. Wendell Johnson, a member of the same graduate program in Iowa who also became renowned for his work in the field of stuttering, said that Charles Van Riper's methodology was hard work. As a clinician, Charles was known for being warm and sympathetic, but tough on adult stutterers who refused to work and cooperate with him, since they were expected to be able and willing to practice behaviors and attitudes that would minimize their stuttering.|$|E

500|$|McAloney's sons {{recalled}} {{that their father}} [...] "was a very knowledgable and intelligent man", who was largely self-taught and a perfectionist in <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> But {{he was also a}} strict disciplinarian with a strong sense of duty. Severe punishments were handed out for minor infractions, while McAloney could also be obsessive about the family's finances. Though, as Marion Hebblethwaite suggests, his failed business in the 1930s and the duty he shouldered after his father's death—of helping to financially support his mother and some of his younger siblings—may have been the cause for the latter. He did, however, possess a dry sense of humour that appealed to many of his extended family, and his grandchildren thought of him with affection.|$|E

But he enchanted England." [...] Howat writes: [...] "Cricket apart... Constantine's reputation must rest on his contribution to racial tolerance, his benevolent view of empire and Commonwealth, and his personal acceptance within the British 'establishment'. In the end he was more English than Trinidadian and he needed that wider platform." ...|$|E

500|$|Singer-songwriter David Gray {{commented that}} the great {{achievement}} of The Basement Tapes is that Dylan found {{a way out of}} the anguish and verbal complexity that had characterized his mid-sixties albums such as Blonde on Blonde: [...] "It's the sound of Dylan letting his guard down. 'Clothes Line Saga' and all those ridiculous songs, he's obviously just making it all up, they were having such a great time. The sound of The Band is so antiquated like something out of the Gold Rush and Dylan fits in because he's this storyteller with an ancient heart. At the time <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was so scrutinized, yet somehow he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again. You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don't ever hear again." [...] "He mocks his own inertia and impotence", writes critic Mike Marqusee, [...] "but with a much gentler touch than in Blonde on Blonde. In place of that album's strangled urgency, Dylan adopts a laconic humor, a deadpan tone that speaks of resignation and self-preservation in the face of absurdity and betrayal." ...|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t be shy, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Show {{us what you}} can do." [...] He did praise the visual effects in the episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> looked pretty cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now they just need to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whittlesey was {{the first}} (1984) to {{formulate}} and popularize a quote that entered political parlance about Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire that is often attributed to her: [...] "Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, except backwards and in high heels." [...] The official [...] attributes {{the origin of the}} quote to Bob Thaves who wrote in a 1982 Frank and Ernest comic strip about Fred Astaire: [...] "Sure he was great, but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> backwards…and in high heels." [...] The attribution to Whittlesey traces to a speech she delivered to a large Teamsters Union meeting in 1984 where she was representing Reagan. Sometimes the quote is also attributed to Ann Richards, who later used the line in her 1988 Democratic National Convention speech, but Richards said she got the line from television journalist Linda Ellerbee who said she heard the line from a fellow passenger on an airplane. Both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama used the line in the 2016 campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon further {{advised the}} Qing court {{that it was}} unwise for the Manchu elite to live apart from and treat the Han Chinese {{majority}} as something less than human, warning that this not only weakened China in the present, but would cause {{a revolution in the}} future. After speaking so bluntly, Gordon was ordered out of the court and Beijing, but was allowed to stay at Tianjin. After meeting with him in Tianjin, Hart described Gordon as [...] "very eccentric" [...] and [...] "spending hours in prayer", writing that: [...] "As much I like and respect him, I must say he is 'not all there'. Whether religion or vanity, or the softening of the brain-I don't know, but he seems to be alternatively arrogant and slavish, vain and humble, in his senses and out of them. It's a great pity!". Wade echoed Hart, writing that Gordon had changed since his last time in China, and was now [...] "unbalanced", being utterly convinced that all of his ideas came from God, making him dangerously unreasonable since Gordon now believed that <b>everything</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was the will of God.|$|E
