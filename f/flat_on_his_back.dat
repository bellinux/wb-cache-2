25|$|Patterson {{knocked out}} Johansson {{in the fifth}} round of their rematch on June 20, 1960, {{to become the first}} man in history to regain the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. Johansson hit the canvas hard, {{seemingly}} out before he landed <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> With glazed eyes, blood trickling from his mouth and his left foot quivering, he was counted out. Johansson lay unconscious for five minutes before he was helped onto a stool.|$|E
25|$|In 1971–72 Lloyd {{suffered}} {{a back injury}} while playing for a Rest of the World team at the Adelaide Oval. He was fielding in the covers when Ashley Mallett hit a lofted drive towards his area. He made an amazing effort to take the catch but it bounced {{out of his hands}} when he hit the ground awkwardly. When he went to get up, he felt a stabbing pain in his back and he was unable to move. He spent the next few weeks in an Adelaide hospital <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

50|$|The perfect {{result is}} the lamm. It ends the bout {{immediately}} and is worth 6 points. The lamm is the perfect fall: the loser falls <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>back</b> with both shoulders touching the floor.|$|R
25|$|He had a {{major role}} in the melodrama Another Time, Another Place (1958) as a British {{reporter}} named Mark Trevor, caught in a love affair opposite Lana Turner and Barry Sullivan. During filming, star Lana Turner's possessive gangster boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato, who was visiting from Los Angeles, believed she was having an affair with Connery. He stormed onto the set and pointed a gun at Connery, only to have Connery disarm him and knock him <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> Stompanato was banned from the set. Connery later recounted that he had to lie low for a while after receiving threats from men linked to Stompanato's boss, Mickey Cohen.|$|E
500|$|For all of Dunglass's humour and patience, the {{following}} two years were a grave trial. He was encased in plaster and kept <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> for most of that period. Although buoyed up by the sensitive support {{of his wife and}} family, as he later confessed, [...] "I often felt that I would be better dead." [...] Towards the end of 1942 he was released from his plaster jacket and fitted with a spinal brace, and in early 1943 he was mobile {{for the first time since}} the operation. During his incapacity he read voraciously; among the works he studied were Das Kapital, and works by Engels and Lenin, biographies of nineteenth and twentieth century politicians, and novels by authors from Dostoyevsky to Koestler.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the seventh}} round, he sent Cooper <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the turf and jumped {{on top of}} him, winding Cooper so badly he could hardly rise. [...] He did rise for the next round, but in the eleventh, Donnelly {{finished}} him off with a tremendous right hand that smashed Cooper's jaw. [...] The sound of the cheering was likened {{to the sound of}} artillery going off. [...] The cheers could be heard in villages for miles around. [...] Donnelly was the conquering hero.|$|E
60|$|The {{route through}} the forest soon grew worse. The heavy frost of the past winter had upheaved many rocks and they lay {{scattered}} in all directions {{on the side of}} a hill up which they were climbing. Sometimes a horse would slip on them and go down, and once a pack animal rolled completely over, smashing <b>flat</b> what was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
50|$|The shock {{position}} is used usually by a medical worker of First Responder or higher. The shock {{position is}} {{the position of}} a person who is lying <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>back</b> with the legs elevated approximately 8-12 inches. This is used when a patient is showing signs of shock. The shock position is also used for patients experiencing heat related emergencies. The purpose of the shock position is to elevate the legs above the heart in a manner that will slightly help blood flow to the heart, hopefully helping more blood become oxygenated and reducing the hypoxia that causes shock.|$|R
6000|$|... "No--I'm so glad, but I can't {{get over}} it," [...] {{continued}} Di, while those near to her stood quietly by unable to avoid overhearing, {{even if they}} had wished to do so. [...] "And they do such strange things in my dreams," [...] continued Di, [...] "you can't think. Only last night I was in our basket-cart--the dream-one, you know, not the real one--and the dream-pony ran away again, and gave my boy such a dreadful knock that he fell <b>flat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> tumbled over two or three times, and rose up--a policeman! Not my policeman, you know, but quite another one that I had never seen before! But the very oddest thing of all was that it made me so angry that I jumped with all my might <b>on</b> to <b>his</b> breast, and when I got there it wasn't the policeman but the pony! and it was dead--quite dead, for I had killed it, and I wasn't sorry at all--not a bit!" ...|$|R
2500|$|An {{came into}} the Olympic Games ranked first and was largely {{expected}} to take the gold in Rio. He was hailed by Korean media {{as one of the}} two predicted golds from judo at the Rio. In Round 2 he faced Kazakhstan's Zhansay Smagulov. He won by waza-ari through seoi nage, and sealed the win awasete ippon with a juji-gatame. He continued his ippon streak in the third round with another waza-ari with seoi nage, and then landed his opponent from France, Kilian LeBlouch, with sode-tsurikomi-goshi <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
2500|$|He was 5'11" [...] {{tall and}} wore a size 38 jacket and size 9C boots. At various times he weighed between 143 pounds (at {{the end of the}} 1869 Kansas campaign) to a muscular 170 pounds. A splendid horseman, [...] "Custer mounted was an inspiration.". He was quite fit, able to jump to a {{standing}} position from lying <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> He was a [...] "power sleeper", able to get by on very short naps after falling asleep immediately on lying down. He [...] "had a habit of throwing himself prone on the grass for a few minutes' rest and resembled a human island, entirely surrounded by crowding, panting dogs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1975, a group of {{traveling}} Finnish athletes (without Lasse Virén) took part in an NCAA Prep meet at Hayward Field in Eugene. After the event on Thursday, May 29, which included a 5,000-meter race that Prefontaine won, the Finnish and American athletes attended a party. [...] While returning from the party shortly after midnight, Prefontaine was driving on Skyline Boulevard, east of the University of Oregon campus near Hendricks Park. His orange 1973 MGB convertible swerved into a rock wall (...) and flipped, trapping Prefontaine underneath it. A nearby resident was {{first on the scene}} and reported he found Prefontaine <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> still alive but pinned beneath the wreck. By the time medics arrived, he was pronounced dead. It had been reported that his blood alcohol content was found by the Eugene Police Department to be 0.16.|$|E
5000|$|The {{objective}} of Cornish wrestling is to throw your opponent {{and make him}} land as <b>flat</b> as possible <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> Three sticklers (referees) watch and control each bout whilst also recording down the score of points achieved in play. Four pins are located {{on the back of}} a wrestler, two at the back of each shoulder and two either side just above the buttocks. If a wrestler manages to throw his opponent flat onto <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> simultaneously scoring with all 4 pins they score four points in that single throw and this is called a [...] "Back" [...] to which the bout is then finished and the throwing wrestler is the winner. The sticklers will each raise their sticks when they perceive a Back has been achieved. If two sticklers raise their sticks but one does not a back is still awarded.|$|R
50|$|Presumably {{designed}} at {{the beginning}} of the All Stars Tour, though possibly not until later in the run, this is something of a forgotten masterpiece, even though it has always been available on the Russian All Stars video. Both are dressed in shiny white outfits with blue and mauve embroidery. The ice is lit a wintry blue and the movements take full advantage of the images of Husky-drawn sleighs, winter pageants, and snow-covered landscapes that the music evokes so successfully. The dance is immensely fast and yet graceful at the same time. It actually begins in a static lift already posed as the lights go up, and it contains many large lifts from then on. Jayne leaps effortlessly onto Chris’s shoulders on a number of occasions and, in one move, even leaps all the way round him, going above his head, with seemingly very little assistance (they later incorporated this move into Mack and Mabel for their Face the Music Tour in the mid '90s). It contains many symmetrical dance steps and large sweeping arm gestures, with a succession of impressive lifts and a series of symmetrical jumps and leaps carried out in perfect unison with each other, giving the impression of animals running through the forest. Unique to this dance is a series of two symmetrical steps where they literally leap high into the air together but leaning forward with their inside leg bent as they plunge back to the ground, putting their outside leg straight out behind them. The move actually makes them look like two stags leaping and bounding and thrusting their antlers forward. The piece ends with Jayne throwing herself onto Chris, who bends with Jayne balanced <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees and allows himself to fall <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> to <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> ending with Jayne suspended in the air held up by Chris, forming a dramatic and very beautiful final tableau as Chris continues to glide across the ice <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Years later, Blanc {{revealed}} that during his recovery, his son Noel [...] "ghosted" [...] several Warner Bros. cartoons' voice tracks for him. Warner Bros. had also asked Stan Freberg {{to provide the}} voice for Bugs Bunny, but Freberg declined, {{out of respect for}} Blanc. At the time of the accident, Blanc was also serving as the voice of Barney Rubble in The Flintstones. His absence from the show was relatively brief; Daws Butler provided the voice of Barney for a few episodes, after which the show's producers set up recording equipment in Blanc's hospital room and later at his home to allow him to work from there. Some of the recordings were made while he was in full-body cast as he lay <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> with the other Flintstones co-stars gathered around him. He also returned to The Jack Benny Program to film the program's 1961 Christmas show, moving around by crutches and a wheelchair.|$|E
2500|$|Jamerson's discography at Motown {{reads as}} {{a catalog of}} soul hits of the 1960s and 1970s. His work {{includes}} Motown hits such as, among hundreds of others, [...] "You Can't Hurry Love" [...] by The Supremes, [...] "My Girl" [...] by The Temptations, [...] "Shotgun" [...] by Jr. Walker & the All Stars, [...] "For Once in My Life," [...] "I Was Made To Love Her" [...] by Stevie Wonder, [...] "Going to a Go-Go" [...] by The Miracles, [...] "Dancing in the Street" [...] by Martha and the Vandellas, [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] by Gladys Knight and the Pips, and later by Marvin Gaye, {{and most of the}} album What's Going On by Marvin Gaye, [...] "Reach Out I'll Be There" [...] and [...] "Bernadette" [...] by the Four Tops. According to fellow Funk Brothers in the 2002 documentary Standing in the Shadows of Motown, Gaye was desperate to have Jamerson play on [...] "What's Going On," [...] and went to several bars to find the bassist. When he did, he brought Jamerson to the studio, who then played the classic line while lying <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> He is reported to have played on some 95% of Motown recordings between 1962 and 1968. He eventually performed on nearly 30 No. 1 pop hits—surpassing the record commonly attributed to The Beatles. On the R charts, nearly 70 of his performances went to the top.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, Michigan {{was short}} of backfield talent, and Coach Yost moved Wieman again, {{this time from}} tackle to fullback. [...] With his weight {{increased}} to 194 pounds, Wieman played eight games at fullback and one at left tackle, and [...] "starred in each position." [...] An October 1917 newspaper account described Wieman's value to the team as follows:"Yost's one lucky move seems to hinge on the recent change of 'Tad' Wieman from tackle to fullback. [...] Wieman is a giant who musters nearly 200 pounds of actual muscle. [...] This is only his third year in the university, but he already was talked of a sure all-American tackle. [...] Shifting him to fullback may have ruined his chances of making Camp's all-American this year, but it undoubtedly will save the Michigan team. [...] The whole Michigan offense will be built around Wieman. [...] He has developed the plunging habit that results in big gains every time he tries it in scrimmage. [...] Wieman also is a lad who can use his head. [...] Nobody knows what Yost would do if Wieman got laid out, {{but he is not}} the type of man that is likely to spend any time <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> [...] As a kicker, Wieman is beginning to shine too, scoring from drop and place kicks in scrimmage after only a few days of practice in the toe art." ...|$|E
