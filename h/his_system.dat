5|$|An autopsy of Hawkins {{showed that}} he had 200 nanograms per {{milliliter}} of Valium in <b>his</b> <b>system,</b> which is {{the low end of}} its therapeutic-use range (100-1500ng/mL). No trace of any other drug was found in <b>his</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and <b>his</b> <b>system</b> {{was largely}} {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published <b>his</b> <b>system</b> in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes {{because they were too}} difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{approach}} influenced {{future generations}} of coaches down to the present day. Men he worked directly with, including Don Shula, Weeb Ewbank, Chuck Noll and Bill Walsh, all adopted <b>his</b> <b>system</b> to some degree.|$|E

5|$|After these events, Ueshiba {{seemed to}} slowly grow away from Takeda, {{and he began}} to change his art. These changes are {{reflected}} in the differing names with which he referred to <b>his</b> <b>system,</b> first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E
5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, {{disagreed}} with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones {{on the basis of}} sound production, but membranophones {{on the basis of the}} shape of the instrument). <b>His</b> <b>system</b> divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle {{distinguished}} about 500 {{species of}} birds, mammals and fishes in History of Animals and Parts of Animals. <b>His</b> <b>system</b> of classification, {{one of the}} earliest in scientific taxonomy, was influential for over two thousand years.

But she does not specify who the two were.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{created his}} own raised-dot system {{by using an}} awl, {{the same kind of}} {{implement}} which had blinded him. In the process of designing <b>his</b> <b>system,</b> he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it, based on Barbier's own slate and stylus tools. By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which would keep the lines straight and readable.|$|E
5|$|By then, Brown had put <b>his</b> <b>system</b> into place: a strict, {{systematic}} approach to coaching {{combined with a}} well-organized recruitment network that drew promising young players from Massillon's junior high school football program.

Doctor Octopus's anti-serum also prevents Osborn's attempts of restoring his powers, ultimately he seeks to rid it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity.|$|E
5|$|In adulthood, Braille {{served as}} a {{professor}} at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely spent the remainder of his life refining and extending <b>his</b> <b>system.</b> It went unused by most educators for many years after his death, but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the seventeenth century Bishop John Wilkins, the first {{secretary}} of the Royal Society in England, was asked by the society to devise a universal standard of measure. In 1668, in his book An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language, on the possibility of an international language, he devoted a short section to physical measurement in which he proposed an integrated system of measurement based on a decimal system. While Wilkins did propose <b>his</b> <b>system</b> two years before Moulton, it was never promoted and lay undiscovered until 2007.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in <b>his</b> <b>system</b> were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{established}} {{at least one}} archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire. He encouraged the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. <b>His</b> <b>system</b> of local administration was based on counties organized around fortresses and administered by royal officials. Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for pilgrims and merchants traveling between Western Europe and the Holy Land or Constantinople.|$|E

50|$|He {{established}} the Robinson Electric Railway Signal Company in 1873 {{and during the}} 1870s <b>his</b> signal <b>systems</b> were installed on railroads throughout the United States. He lived in Boston in the mid-1870s and supervised installation of <b>his</b> <b>systems</b> on the Boston and Lowell Railroad, the Boston and Providence Railroad, and other roads in the region. He organized the Union Electric Signal Company in 1878. This company, holding valuable patents on track circuit designs, was acquired by the newly formed Union Switch and Signal (US&S) in 1881.|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} {{only works}} {{if the air}} is cooler than the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that <b>his</b> <b>system</b> would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E
5|$|Yeats's mystical inclinations, {{informed}} by Hindu Theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided {{much of the}} basis of his late poetry, which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to <b>his</b> <b>system</b> of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision (1925).|$|E
5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected in their form (eidos). They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. <b>His</b> <b>system</b> had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to replacement technologies, in 2002, {{under the heading}} Project Cyborg, a British scientist, Kevin Warwick, had an array of 100 electrodes fired into <b>his</b> nervous <b>system</b> in order to link <b>his</b> nervous <b>system</b> into the internet to investigate enhancement possibilities. With this in place Warwick successfully carried {{out a series of}} experiments including extending <b>his</b> nervous <b>system</b> over the internet to control a robotic hand, also receiving feedback from the fingertips in order to control the hand's grip. This was a form of extended sensory input. Subsequently, he investigated ultrasonic input in order to remotely detect the distance to objects.
