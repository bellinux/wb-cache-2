40|$|The basic {{magnetic}} {{and electronic}} properties of most binary compounds {{have been well}} known for decades. The recent discovery of superconductivity at 39 K in the simple binary ceramic compound magnesium diboride, MgB 2, was therefore surprising. Indeed, this material has been known and structurally characterized since the mid 1950 s (ref. 2), and is readily available from chemical suppliers (it is commonly used as a starting material for chemical metathesis reactions). Here we show that the addition of electrons to MgB 2, through partial substitution of Al for Mg, results {{in the loss of}} superconductivity. Associated with the Al substitution is a subtle but distinct structural transition, reflected in the partial collapse of the spacing between boron layers near an Al content of 10 per cent.

The GaAs JFET has required the development of shallow p-type implants using Zn or Cd with junction depths down to 35 nm after the activation anneal. Implant activation and ionization issues for AlGaAs are reported along with those for InGaP and InAlP.

At {{high electron concentrations}} and temperatures below 4. 2 K, two series of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations have been observed. The temperature damping of the second series oscillations indicates that the second occupied subband belongs to the first energy level of the fourfold-degenerate ladder 0 '. Samples with two occupied subbans exhibit a strong anomalous negative magnetoresitance, reaching ≈ 25 % of a zero field value at B = 12 T. The resistance decrease is more pronounced for lower temperatures and <b>higher</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations.</b> We explain this behaviour by an increase of the second subband mobility due to the freezing-out of the scattering of 0 ' electrons.

40|$|The {{open issue}} of the n-type {{conductivity}} and its correlation to threading dislocations (TDs) in InN is addressed through first principles calculations on the electronic properties of a-edge TDs. All possible dislocation core models are considered (4 -, 5 / 7 -, and 8 -atom cores) and are found to modify the band structure of InN in a distinct manner. In particular, nitrogen and indium low coordinated atoms in the eight-atom core induce states near the valence band maximum and above the conduction band minimum, respectively. The formation of a nitrogen–nitrogen “wrong” bond is observed at the 5 / 7 -atom core resulting in a state inside the band gap. The 4 - and 5 / 7 -atom cores induce occupied states resonant in the conduction band due to In–In strain induced interactions and wrong bonds, respectively.

Two types of films are investigated in this work: InN on AlN/Si(111) and InN on GaN/AlN/Si(111). Their properties are compared to a layer deposited on GaN/ sapphire substrate. The dielectric function (DF) is obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The infrared studies yield the plasma frequency and thus the electron density, while the interband absorption is probed between 0. 56 and 9. 8 eV. For InN grown on Si(111) substrate, the absorption onset is slightly shifted to higher energies {{with respect to the}} InN film grown on GaN/sapphire which can be attributed to <b>higher</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Despite this, strongly pronounced optical transitions due to critical points of the band structure are found in the high-energy part of the DF. It emphasizes the already promising quality of the InN films on silicon.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 This thesis {{presents}} investigations for {{two related}} fields of semiconductor electrochemistry: redox potential determination of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, and mechanistic analysis of photoelectrochemical water oxidation with electrocatalyst modified mesostructured hematite photoanodes. Adapting electrochemical techniques to colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (SC NC) is a long-standing challenge for {{this class of}} materials. Subject {{to a variety of}} complications, standard voltammetric techniques are not as straight forward for SC NCs as they are for small molecules. As a result, researchers have developed creative ways to side step these complications by coupling electrochemistry with NC spectroscopy. Chapter 1 discusses the fundamental electronic and spectroscopic properties of SC NCs at different redox states. We present a brief review of some of the notable studies employing SC NC spectroelectrochemistry that provide the theoretical and experimental context for the following chapters. Chapter 2 presents an investigation on NC redox potentials of photochemically reduced colloidal ZnO NCs using a solvated redox-indicator method. In the one electron limit, conduction band electrons show evidence of quantum confinement, but at <b>higher</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations,</b> the NC Fermi-level becomes dependent on the electron density across all NC sizes. Chapter 3 outlines a poteniometric method for monitoring the NC redox potentials in situ. NC redox potentials for ZnO and CdSe are measured, and as predicted from these measurements, spontaneous electron transfer from CdSe to ZnO is demonstrated. Chapter 4 details the impact of the surface of CdSe NCs on the NC redox potentials. We find that the ratio of Cd 2 +:Se 2 - on the surface of CdSe NCs changes both the NC band edge potentials, as well as the maximum electron density achievable by photochemical reduction. These changes are proposed to arise from interfacial dipoles when CdSe has a Se 2 [...] rich surface. Chapters 5 and 6 examine the mechanistic pathways of solar water oxidation on Co-Pi modified α-Fe 2 O 3 photoanodes. A rate constant analysis of water oxidation and electron-hole recombination paired with the identification of surface-morphology-dependent current-voltage characteristics reveal new insights into the role of the semiconductor/electrocatalyst interface on the overall solar water oxidation efficiency. These findings reconcile disparate observations from previous studies...|$|E
40|$|This work {{recounts the}} efforts to {{completely}} characterize recombination, absorption and luminescence in n-type GaAs grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and doped with selenium to create electron concentrations, n o, from 1. 3 × 1017 cm- 3 to 3. 8 × 1018 cm- 3. To investigate recombination, photoluminescence (PL) decay was observed on double heterostructures (DH 2 ̆ 7 s) with thicknesses ranging from 0. 25 to 10 μm. For n o 3 ̆c 1018 cm- 3, recombination is dominated by radiative transitions with no evidence of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination. For <b>higher</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations,</b> samples show evidence of SRH recombination {{as reflected in the}} intensity dependence of PL decay. Even so, radiative recombination and photon recycling are important for all n o studied. No evidence for Auger recombination is found, but an upper limit on the Auger coefficient is determined. ^ Transmission measurements on thin-film DH 2 ̆ 7 s were used to deduce the near band edge absorption coefficient, α(hν), over the photon energy range of 1. 35 < h nu < 1. 7 eV. A strong dependence of α(hν) on the electron concentration was found as expected, based on previous work. Differences in the absorption tail, which increase with increasing n o, were attributed to compensation in the material studied previously. PL decay on thin-film membranes (for which the substrate is removed) yielded lifetimes greater than 1 μs for n o = 1. 3 × 1017 cm- 3. This lifetime was enhanced three times over that observed with the substrate intact, because of enhanced photon recycling. By suppressing bulk recombination in this manner, it is found that the AlGaAs/GaAs interface recombination velocity, S, has an absolute upper limit of 25 cm/s. A more reasonable value is estimated as S < 11 cm/s. The absorption and recombination measurements are used to compute B, the radiative recombination coefficient, with self-consistent results. It is found that B decreases significantly with increasing n o. This is qualitatively in agreement with previous work, but the results differ quantitatively. This work describes completely the near band edge absorption properties and the recombination characteristics of high-quality n-GaAs grown by MOCVD. The results fill a void of understanding of intrinsic recombination in moderately doped n-GaAs and should be of value for the characterization and modeling of GaAs devices. ...|$|E
