25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. <b>Emamectin</b> benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Emamectin</b> benzoate, an {{insecticide}} {{derived from}} the avermectin family of natural products, has a unique translocation behavior in trees when applied by tree micro injection (TMI), which can result in protection from insect pests (foliar and borers) for several years. Active ingredient imported into leaves was measured {{at the end of}} season in the fallen leaves of treated horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) trees. The dissipation of <b>emamectin</b> benzoate in these leaves seems to be biphasic and depends on the decomposition of the leaf. In compost piles, where decomposition of leaves was fastest, a cumulative <b>emamectin</b> benzoate degradation half-life time of 20 d was measured. In leaves immersed in water, where decomposition was much slower, the degradation half-life time was 94 d, and in leaves left on the ground in contact with soil, where decomposition was slowest, the degradation half-life time was 212 d. The biphasic decline and the correlation with leaf decomposition might be attributed to an extensive sorption of <b>emamectin</b> benzoate residues to leaf macromolecules. This may also explain why earthworms ingesting leaves from injected trees take up very little <b>emamectin</b> benzoate and excrete it with the feces. Furthermore, no <b>emamectin</b> benzoate was found in water containing decomposing leaves from injected trees. It is concluded, that <b>emamectin</b> benzoate present in abscised leaves from horse chestnut trees injected with the insecticide is not available to nontarget organisms present in soil or water bodies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Emamectin</b> {{benzoate}} {{is a novel}} macrocyclic lactone insecticide {{derived from}} naturally occurring avermectin molecules isolated by fermentation from the soil microorganism Streptomyces avermitilis Kim & Goodfellow. The present study aims to evaluate the toxicity of <b>emamectin</b> benzoate to codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), and oriental fruit moth, C. molesta (Busck), under laboratory and semi-field conditions. RESULTS: Dose response bioassays showed that <b>emamectin</b> benzoate had {{a high level of}} intrinsic toxicity to early-stage larvae of both species, and that contact activity might contribute significantly to mortality. In the semi-field trials, residual toxicity lasted for more than 1 week. Ovicidal activity was recorded only for C. pomonella (approximately 30 %), irrespective of the concentrations tested. Field trials confirmed the efficacy of <b>emamectin</b> benzoate on codling moth when applied at 7 day intervals. Fruit damage, both from the first and second generations, was comparable with that on treatment with chlorpyrifos-ethyl, used as a chemical reference. CONCLUSION: <b>Emamectin</b> benzoate may be considered a valuable tool for the control of codling moth as a component of an IPM programme.

When insecticides were mixed based on LC 50 and tested at serial concentrations against Lab-UK, significant synergy (CI < 1) occurred between bifenthrin, spinosad and <b>emamectin.</b> In contrast, the interaction between bifenthrin and indoxacarb was additive (CI B< 1). The toxicity of bifenthrin against the field population increased significantly (P < 0. 01) when combined with spinosad, <b>emamectin</b> and indoxacarb. Synergistic effects could be attributed to the complementary modes of action by these insecticide classes acting on different components of nerve impulse transmission (which are not identical forbifenthrin and indoxacarb either).

Dependence on a limited number of theraputants to control such infestations has led to concerns of reduced sensitivity in some sea lice populations. This study investigates trends in the efficacy of the in-feed treatment <b>emamectin</b> benzoate in Scotland, the active ingredient most widely used across all salmon producing regions. Study data were drawn from over 50 commercial Atlantic salmon farms on the west coast of Scotland between 2002 and 2006. An epi-informatics approach was adopted whereby available farm records, descriptive epidemiological summaries and statistical linear modelling methods were used to identify factors that significantly affect sea lice abundance following treatment with <b>emamectin</b> benzoate (SLICEH, Schering Plough Animal Health). The results show that although sea lice infestations are reduced following the application of <b>emamectin</b> benzoate, not all treatments are effective.

In this study, six chemical pesticides were selected and injected into the trunks of Osmanthus fragrans to control the nettle caterpillar, Latoia lepida (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae), using a no-pressure injection system. The absorption rate of the insecticides, the leaf loss due to insect damage, and the mortality and frass amount of L. lepida larvae were evaluated after 77 and 429 days. The results showed that 4 % imidacloprid + carbosulfan and 21 % abamectin + imidacloprid + omethoate had the fastest conductivity and were completely absorbed into the trunkswithin 14 days; however, the efficiencies of these insecticides in controlling L. lepidawere extremely low. Additionally, the treatment 10 % <b>emamectin</b> benzoate + clothianidin and 2. 5 % <b>emamectin</b> benzoate was almost completely absorbed within 30 days and exhibited a longer duration of insecticide efficiency (> 80 % mortality) in the upper and lower leaves of the canopy.

The objectives of this thesis were: (1) to review and describe methods for the evaluation of sea lice treatment effectiveness, (2) to evaluate and establish if changes in effectiveness of <b>emamectin</b> benzoate for the treatment of sea lice (L. salmonis) on farmed Atlantic salmon in New Brunswick, Canada, had occurred from 2004 to 2008, and (3) to determine if there was evidence of differences in the temporal development of resistance to <b>emamectin</b> benzoate across L. salmonis life stages using data collected in both Canada and Scotland. Field collected data from New Brunswick salmon farms (2004 to 2008) were examined for temporal and spatial changes in treatment effectiveness in populations of L. salmonis. Data analysis was carried out in two parts: examination of trends in treatment effectiveness and L. salmonis abundance and an examination of multiple factors influencing post-treatment L. salmonis abundance and treatment outcome through the use of statistical models (linear and logistic regression). A reduction in treatment effectiveness was found from 2004 to 2008 and treatment effectiveness was found to vary by location. Further analysis was carried out to examine for possible differences in treatment effectiveness between different sea lice life stages. Life stages were categorized into two groups: adult females (gravid and non-gravid) and other mobile stages (pre-adult female, pre-adult male, and adult male). Sea lice abundance records following <b>emamectin</b> benzoate treatments from the west coast of Scotland (2002 to 2006) and from New Brunswick, Canada (2004 to 2008) were examined. Differences in treatment effectiveness were found between the two groups by year and location. Changes in sea lice sensitivity to <b>emamectin</b> benzoate were not synchronized in all life stages. A difference in the rates of resistance development between locations was noted, with resistance developing more rapidly in New Brunswick than in Scotland. In summary, this research examined methods for the evaluation of <b>emamectin</b> benzoate effectiveness for the control of sea lice. A reduction in <b>emamectin</b> benzoate effectiveness occurred over time and varied by location. In addition, resistance development was not synchronized in all sea lice life stages. These methods could help aid in the detection of resistance development in parasites. However, no single method is likely to suffice for monitoring changes in sea lice sensitivity. In future, coordinated analyses from both laboratory and field studies will likely yield the best results...|$|E

Alguns ácaros da família Phytoseiidae são eficientes predadores associados aos ácaros-praga. Com este trabalho teve-se como objetivo estudar o controle dos ácaros-praga e o impacto do {{abamectin}} e <b>emamectin</b> sobre fitoseídeos. Em laboratório, foram estudados os efeitos ovicida, tópico, residual, tópico mais residual aos ácaros-praga e a seletividade fisiológica aos fitoseídeos. Em semicampo, foi estudada a persistência dos produtos no controle dos ácaros-praga. O efeito ovicida foi avaliado em ovos no início e fim de incubação; os efeitos residual, tópico e tópico mais residual foram avaliados pela mortalidade de larvas, ninfas e adultos após 48 horas da aplicação, enquanto a persistência foi avaliada pela mortalidade até 30 dias após a pulverização. A seletividade aos ácaros fitoseídeos foi avaliada pelo efeito total às fêmeas adultas, em teste residual em superfície de vidro. Pelos resultados, verificou-se que abamectin e <b>emamectin</b> não possuem ação ovicida, para ambas as espécies de ácaros-praga estudadas. Considerando o efeito tópico mais residual, o abamectin e <b>emamectin</b> foram altamente eficientes no controle de larvas, ninfas e adultos de B. phoenicis; apenas abamectin foi eficiente no controle de O. ilicis. Abamectin foi levemente a moderadamente nocivo e <b>emamectin</b> mostrou-se inócuo a levemente nocivo aos fitoseídeos. Devido à eficiência de controle e seletividade a fitoseídeos, conclui-se que abamectin e <b>emamectin</b> podem ser utilizados em programas de manejo integrado do ácaro B. phoenicis, e abamectin para o {{manejo de}} B. phoenicis e O. ilicis em cafeeiro. The mite Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes, 1939) (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) {{is important for}} coffee plants (Coffea spp.) for being the vector of the coffee ringspot virus, {{which is responsible for}} leaf fall and bad quality of the coffee beverage. The red spider mite, Oligonychus ilicis (McGregor, 1917) (Acari: Tetranychidae) is also important, for reducing the areas of photosynthesis in leaves. Some mites of the family Phytoseiidae are efficient predators associated to the pest-mites. This work had as objective to study the control of the pest-mites and the impact of the abamectin and <b>emamectin</b> on phytoseiids. Studies were carried out in laboratory to investigate the ovicidal, topical, residual, topical plus residual effects of the products on the pest-mites and the physiologic selectivity to the phytoseiids. The persistence of the products in the control of pest-mite was studied in semi-field conditions. The ovicidal effect was evaluated in eggs in {{the beginning and end of}} incubation; the residual, topical and topical plus residual effects on larvae, nymphs and adults were assessed through mortality evaluation 48 h after spraying, while the persistence was evaluated until 30 days after spraying. The phytoseiids selectivity was evaluated by the total effect in adult females, in residual test in glass surface. The results showed that abamectin and <b>emamectin</b> do not possess ovicidal action, in both pest-mite species studied. Considering the topical plus residual effect, the abamectin and <b>emamectin</b> was highly efficient in the control of larvae, nymphs and adults of the B. phoenicis; only the abamectin was efficient for O. ilicis control. Abamectin was slightly and moderately noxious and <b>emamectin</b> was shown to be innocuous and slightly noxious to the phytoseiids. Due to efficiency presented in the pest-mites control, and selectivity to the phytoseiids, it is concluded that abamectin and <b>emamectin</b> can be used in integrated pest management programs of B. phoenicis, and abamectin for the management of B. phoenicis and O. ilicis in coffee trees...|$|E
