5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. <b>Keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s Mehldau has experimented with other musical formats in {{addition}} to trio and solo piano. Largo, released in 2002, contains electronics and input from rock and classical musicians; later examples include touring and recording with guitarist Pat Metheny, writing and playing song cycles for classical singers Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter, composing orchestral pieces for 2009's Highway Rider, and playing electronic <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> in a duo with drummer Mark Guiliana.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage {{follows the}} success of earlier <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> from Clavia, and {{contains}} similar emulations of vintage electromechanical keyboards such as the Hammond Organ and electric pianos as found on the Nord Electro 2, with additional functionality including a weighted piano-like keyboard on certain models, a synthesizer section based on the Nord Lead, a more versatile organ section and extended effects processing. The Nord Stage is multitimbral, which means it can play more than one sound at once, either by splitting the internal keyboard or connecting an external MIDI controller.|$|E

50|$|In the Baroque period, a sonata was {{for one or}} more {{instruments}} {{almost always}} with continuo. After the Baroque period most works designated as sonatas specifically are performed by a solo instrument, most often a <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument,</b> or by a solo instrument accompanied by a <b>keyboard</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R
5|$|The group's early {{sound was}} geared more towards {{psychedelic}} rock with only occasional classical influences. Following O'List's departure, Emerson's {{control over the}} band's direction became greater, resulting in more complex music. The absence of a guitar in the band and Emerson's redefining {{of the role of}} <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> in rock set the Nice apart from many of its contemporaries. He used a combination of Marshall Amplification and Leslie speakers in order to project a full sound to compensate for the lack of a guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Following the European and Italian in {{particular}} musical trends, the Renaissance music was developing in Poland, {{centered around the}} royal court patronage and branching from there. Sigismund I kept from 1543 a permanent choir at the Wawel castle, while the Reformation brought large scale group Polish language church singing during the services. Jan of Lublin wrote a comprehensive tablature for the organ and other <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments.</b> Among the composers, who often permeated their music with national and folk elements, were Wacław of Szamotuły, Mikołaj Gomółka, who wrote music to Kochanowski translated psalms, and Mikołaj Zieleński, who enriched the Polish music by adopting the Venetian School polyphonic style.|$|E
5|$|In late 1952, the National Trust {{moved the}} {{collection}} of <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> to Fenton House, and {{the family moved to}} Brondesbury Road, and then, in 1953, to a house they bought in Oxgate Gardens. Robert worked for the BBC as a studio manager for The Goon Show and the BBC World Service, and then for EMI, where he was involved with the development of stereophonic sound and the LP record. Her health deteriorated after Stephen's birth, and she had a hysterectomy. Her aunt Phyl took care of the children while she recovered. In 1955, her husband, unable to reconcile his lifestyle with his homosexuality, returned to the United States, and she became a single mother. She returned to work, initially in a biscuit factory, and then in a series of clerical jobs.|$|E

5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments.</b> In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid bar with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer {{became a}} chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an {{accomplished}} player on <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> and possessed perfect pitch {{and a fine}} treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 {{he was invited to}} sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

25|$|Bach {{wrote for}} the organ and other <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> of his day, mainly the harpsichord, but also the clavichord and his {{personal}} favourite: the lute-harpsichord (the compositions listed as works for the lute, BWV 995-1000 and 1006a were probably written for this instrument).|$|E
25|$|He kept playing concerts for {{historic}} <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments,</b> {{such as a}} program for clavichord on 13 October 2001.

25|$|During the {{remaining}} {{years of the}} 17th century, Cristofori invented two <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> before he began {{his work on the}} piano. These instruments are documented in an inventory, dated 1700, of the many instruments kept by Prince Ferdinando. Stewart Pollens conjectures that this inventory was prepared by a court musician named Giovanni Fuga, who may have referred to it as his own in a 1716 letter.|$|E

25|$|The {{theories}} surrounding equal temperament {{began to}} be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune <b>keyboard</b> <b>instruments.</b> Although Bach did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the meantone system, common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier.|$|E
25|$|Surrey's {{important}} country houses {{include the}} Tudor mansion of Loseley Park, {{built in the}} 1560s and Clandon House, an 18th-century Palladian mansion in West Clandon {{to the east of}} Guildford.

On a smaller scale, Oakhurst Cottage in Hambledon near Godalming is a restored 16th-century worker's home.|$|E
25|$|Despite the name, {{keyboard}} percussion instruments do {{not have}} keyboards as such. <b>Keyboard</b> <b>instruments</b> such as the celesta and keyboard glockenspiel {{are not included in}} the percussion section owing to the very different skills required to play them, but instead are grouped in the keyboard section with instruments that require similar skills. Similarly, the timpani, although they are pitched percussion and are tuned by the player, are not included in the tuned percussion subsection owing to the particular skills expected of the player.|$|E
