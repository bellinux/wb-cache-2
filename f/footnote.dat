50|$|The RTF {{specification}} {{also supports}} <b>footnotes</b> (not {{to be confused}} with annotations), which are widely supported in RTF implementations (e.g. in OpenOffice.org, Abiword, KWord, Ted, but not in Wordpad). Endnotes are implemented as a variation on <b>footnotes</b> such that applications that support <b>footnotes</b> and not endnotes will render endnotes in an RTF document as <b>footnotes.</b> Similar to annotations, due to Microsoft products not supporting <b>footnotes</b> in headers, footers, or comments, including <b>footnotes</b> within those contexts in an RTF document may result in a corrupted document.|$|R
50|$|The author {{includes}} {{a long series}} of <b>footnotes</b> on the psychoanalytic theory of homosexuality. The <b>footnotes</b> act largely as a representation of Puig's political intention in writing the novel: to present an objective view of homosexuality. The <b>footnotes</b> include both factual information and that given by the fictional Anelli Taub. The <b>footnotes</b> tend to appear at moments of misunderstanding between Molina and Valentín.|$|R
60|$|Editorial {{notes are}} placed in square brackets. Notes illustrative of the text are printed {{immediately}} below the variants. Notes illustrative of Byron's notes or <b>footnotes</b> are appended to the originals or printed as <b>footnotes.</b> Byron's own notes to the Fourth Canto are printed as <b>footnotes</b> to the text.|$|R
5|$|In {{the list}} below, works reprinted in the Complete Works of W.H. Auden are {{indicated}} by <b>footnote</b> references.|$|E
5|$|Dugdale both {{transcribed}} the Boulogne {{agreement and}} made a reference to it, in a <b>footnote</b> in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's <b>footnote</b> was mentioned by certain historians, {{but it was not}} until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when Noël Denholm-Young quoted a few lines from it in his History and Heraldry: 12541310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 the U.S. Postal Service {{issued a}} stamp commemorating USS Monitor and CSS Virginia {{depicting}} the two ships while engaged in their famous battle at Hampton Roads. For {{an image of}} the stamp, see <b>footnote</b> link.|$|E
40|$|Ipropose that judges, {{in their}} opinions, put {{citations}} in <b>footnotes</b> and generally abstain from using substantive <b>footnotes.</b> And I propose that courts adopt {{a rule that}} brief writers may single-space <b>footnotes</b> if they contain only citations (or parentheticals coupled with citations) but must double space all <b>footnotes</b> that contain sentences. These simple proposals, if widely adopted, would promote better writing within the legal profession by encouraging legal writers to: • Use shorter sentences. • Compose paragraphs that are more coherent and forceful. • Lead their readers to focus on ideas, not numbers. • Lay bare poor writing and poor thinking. • Discuss the controlling caselaw more thoroughly. • Use string citations with impunity. Before going any further, I must point out that I’m not a proponent of <b>footnotes</b> generally. For a decade I edited the only U. S. law journal that prohibits footnotes—well, substantive <b>footnotes.</b> So please don’t judge my proposal based on your feelings about <b>footnotes</b> generally. I dislike {{them as much as}} anyone reading this journal. But there’s a world of difference between reference notes and so-called “talking” <b>footnotes.</b> I’m championing notes largely for bibliographic material such as volume and page numbers...|$|R
50|$|<b>Footnotes</b> {{stress the}} translators' view of {{revelation of the}} truth, the spiritual light, and the supply of life more than history, geography, and persons. The New Testament <b>footnotes</b> were written by Lee, while those of the Old Testament were {{compiled}} from his literary corpus by the editorial team. <b>Footnotes</b> also indicate more literal (but less readable) translations, valid alternative translations, alternative ways of reading the original text, and alternative translations found in other English versions or in academic scholarship. Often, the clarity forfeited in a literal translation of the original text is addressed and compensated for in the <b>footnotes.</b> The Recovery Version contains over 15,000 <b>footnotes.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the following, all <b>footnotes</b> {{added by}} the {{translator}} will be marked as such. Unmarked <b>footnotes</b> {{are part of}} Magnis Suseno's original piece.|$|R
5|$|In a <b>footnote</b> to Chapter XIII, Poe {{refers to}} the Polly, a wreck which drifted for six months across the Atlantic Ocean in 1811-1812. Poe {{probably}} read this history in an 1836 book by R. Thomas, Remarkable Events and Remarkable Shipwrecks, from which he quotes verbatim.|$|E
5|$|A naval <b>footnote</b> in {{the history}} of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy {{battleship}} HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 1864, the Yavapai raided {{a number}} of ranches that {{supplied}} cattle to the miners in the Prescott and Agua Fria area. As {{a result of this}} and a series of recent killings, a preemptive attack was organized to discourage future depredations. Therefore, a group of well-armed volunteers were quickly outfitted with King S. Woolsey as their leader. Their mission was to track the raiding party back to their rancheria. What followed was an infamous <b>footnote</b> in Arizona history known today as the Bloody Tanks incident.|$|E

5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a <b>footnote</b> to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|There exists no one {{definitive}} English {{translation of}} the decree because of the minor differences between the three original texts, and because modern understanding of the ancient languages continues to develop. An up-to-date translation by R. S. Simpson appears on the British Museum website, based on the demotic text. It can be compared with Edwyn R. Bevan's full translation in The House of Ptolemy (1927), based on the Greek text with <b>footnote</b> comments on variations between this and the two Egyptian texts.|$|E
5|$|Bellingham was immortalized as {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, as {{the brother of}} Ann Hibbins, {{a woman who was}} executed (in real life in 1656, {{as well as in the}} book) for practicing witchcraft. There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham's sister—Hawthorne's formation of this connection appears to be based on a <b>footnote</b> in James Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins' second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The New England Tragedies, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.|$|E
50|$|The footer is also {{sometimes}} the space {{reserved for the}} notes, known as <b>footnotes.</b> These <b>footnotes</b> are distinguished from the notes placed {{at the end of}} a chapter or book. While in some cases the footer space is generally fixed, when <b>footnotes</b> are added, the space will increase or decrease based on the amount and length of the notes.|$|R
50|$|While the book's {{copy and}} most reviews refer to Ibid: A Life {{as being a}} novel made up of <b>footnotes,</b> the novel itself {{identifies}} them as being endnotes. As endnotes are collected together and placed after a manuscript, while <b>footnotes</b> are interspersed throughout the manuscript itself, the novel's framing concept necessitates the notes being endnotes, not <b>footnotes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The main bibliographic {{sources are}} <b>footnoted</b> from this {{paragraph}} and provided {{much of the}} information in the following sections.,,,, [...] Some <b>footnotes</b> annotating specific points are provided at the appropriate places below.|$|R
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} his death, Parsons was well remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently {{amounted to a}} <b>footnote.</b> For instance, English Thelemite Kenneth Grant suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked {{the start of the}} appearance of flying saucers in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the Roswell UFO incident and Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. Cameron postulated that the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident was a spiritual reaction to Parsons' death. In 1954 she portrayed Babalon in American Thelemite Kenneth Anger's short film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome, viewing this cinematic depiction of a Thelemic ritual as aiding the literal invocation of Babalon begun by Parsons' working, and later said that his Book of the AntiChrist prophecies were fulfilled through the manifestation of Babalon in her person.|$|E
5|$|In the {{footnotes}} to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards correlated the subfossil {{species with}} parrots mentioned by Leguat. In 1875, A. Newton analysed Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified {{a description of}} the Rodrigues parrot therein. In a <b>footnote</b> in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in the same sentence, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} a {{commercial}} failure in Japan {{but has been}} successful in the United States. Critical consensus is that Zombiepowder. was a technically proficient manga, but one which lacked the originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to most readers, which accounted for its cancellation. Additionally, the series was heavily focused on battles even by the standards of action manga, though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention. Due to these factors, combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending, critics hold that Zombiepowder. is significant primarily as a chapter in the career of its author, and would otherwise be a <b>footnote</b> which found an audience only among fans of violent action.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his 1996 American Book Award, 2001 Guggenheim Fellowship, and 2001 Eisner Award, Sacco's <b>Footnotes</b> in Gaza was nominated for the 2009 Los Angeles Times Book Prize Graphic Novel award. Sacco was awarded the 2010 Ridenhour Book Prize for <b>Footnotes</b> in Gaza. He was award the 2012 Oregon Book Award for <b>Footnotes</b> in Gaza and 2014 Oregon Book Award Finalist for Journalism.|$|R

5|$|On 23 April, a heavy storm {{swept the}} Eastern Atlantic, {{striking}} Warren's squadron and their prizes. Marengo was seriously damaged, losing all three masts and {{taking on a}} large quantity of water {{that had to be}} pumped overboard by the understrength crew working in shifts. Five men were drowned. Ramilles also suffered in the high winds, losing almost all her masts and rolling for some hours, completely out of control. It was only when the storm had abated that jury masts could be raised and the scattered ships could rejoin the squadron for its journey back to Britain, arriving at Spithead. Willaumez eventually returned to the North Atlantic in the early summer, passing through the Caribbean before being dispersed in a hurricane, his ships scattered across the Western Atlantic. Most eventually reached France, but the campaign had been another disaster for the French Navy, with {{less than half of the}} ships sent out returning to Brest. The loss of Marengo and Belle Poule formed a <b>footnote</b> to the campaign, but the defeat of Linois was widely celebrated in Britain, where both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy under their French names. Linois was praised for his defence of his ship in the face of overwhelming British force, and historian William James, writing in 1827, considered that had Linois faced London alone he might have had the advantage. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from London and Amazon still living in 1847.|$|E
25|$|The Revised Standard Version of the Bible {{suggests}} in a <b>footnote</b> to Job 41:1 that Leviathan {{may be a}} {{name for}} the crocodile, and in a <b>footnote</b> to Job 40:15, that Behemoth may be {{a name for the}} hippopotamus. Young Earth Creationists have also identified Leviathan and Behemoth with dinosaurs.|$|E

5000|$|Flann O'Brien's The Third Policeman {{utilizes}} {{extensive and}} lengthy <b>footnotes</b> for {{the discussion of}} a fictional philosopher, de Selby. These <b>footnotes</b> span several pages and often overtake the main plotline, {{and add to the}} absurdist tone of the book.|$|R
50|$|Rabener is {{especially}} notorious for his parodic dissertation, Hinkmars von Repkow Noten Ohne Text, which levels a snide charge against the futility and bankruptcy {{of the practice}} of <b>footnoting,</b> by consisting entirely of <b>footnotes</b> itself. Rabener cavalierly claimed that since <b>footnotes</b> and endnotes seemed to have become the key to winning lasting authorial fame, he had accordingly composed his dissertation entirely in notes, and left it to others to produce the text he had annotated proleptically.|$|R
