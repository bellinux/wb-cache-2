500|$|By early July, {{refugee camps}} were filled to capacity. The prime {{minister}} made a long-awaited announcement {{saying that it}} was safe to return to the Swat Valley. The Pakistani military had pushed the Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first – to meet with a group of other grassroots activists that had been invited to see United States President Barack Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, [...] "Respected ambassador, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> us in our education, so please help us." [...] When her family finally did return home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{said that}} [...] "We only would cast someone {{if they came}} {{right out of the}} story," [...] while Sarah Noonan, vice {{president}} of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, said that guest star choices come from the writing staff and executive producer. Writer Steven Banks said, [...] "It's not just stunt casting to get publicity," [...] and that the reasoning is [...] " [...] do want to meet them [...] " [...] A number of guest stars have accepted to appear on the show after being persuaded by their children who are SpongeBob SquarePants fans. Some of them include Victoria Beckham, Amy Poehler and David Hasselhoff. Others accept to guest appear because they are fans of the show themselves. Actor Johnny Depp, who appeared as Jack Kahuna Laguna in the sixth-season episode [...] "SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One," [...] accepted the guest role on the show because he and his children are fans. Hillenburg described the process, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was hard to get}} people. Most of the people that allow themselves to be on have kids who like the show. Often, they're kids are fans. They're doing it because they want to please the family." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has a [...] "dream list" [...] of celebrities that the crew would like to appear on the show, which includes actors Michael Caine and Jerry Lewis. Noonan said, [...] "Let us know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> us out with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|King was {{starting}} to think about being an artist, though this was really a second choice. But art was something she could do with minimal resources, so {{long as she could}} support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, an important part of German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870–1938). The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it. King went to see the artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz’ advice to King about a career in art was “Don’t do it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. It is so difficult”. Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: “I haven’t regretted it. I agree with her, it’s difficult.” ...|$|E
6000|$|John {{looked at}} her suspiciously. [...] "If he hasn't, it's all right," [...] he said; [...] "but I think as you're one of them as don't {{complain}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>'elp</b> it." [...] He opened his hand and showed a great jagged flint which he carried. [...] "I'd ha' knocked his other peeper out with this," [...] he said, [...] "blowed if I wouldn't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to play from the word 'go,'" [...] he said. [...] "Sometimes a game is lost or won in the first inning. Don't let them {{get any kind of}} a lead <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>help</b> it." ...|$|R
5000|$|That night, Lawrence says he {{returned}} to his dormitory feeling both [...] "the emptiness in his life and the hunger to seek meaning." [...] He says he cried {{for the first time in}} years. He says he remembers the prayer he made at this turning point, “God I need you but no promises. I’m just a stupid chain smoker but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> me - help me. Here’s my life.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Their primary {{assertion}} {{was that}} the bonds and emotional development made at home with parents during these years produced critical long-term results that were cut short by enrollment in schools, and could neither be replaced nor corrected in an institutional setting afterward. Recognizing a necessity for early out-of-home care for some children, particularly special needs and impoverished children and children from exceptionally inferior homes, they maintained {{that the vast majority}} of children were far better situated at home, even with mediocre parents, than with the most gifted and motivated teachers in a school setting. They described the difference as follows: [...] "This is like saying, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> a child by taking him off the cold street and housing him in a warm tent, then warm tents should be provided for all children – when obviously most children already have even more secure housing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He ain't, Joey. He's {{a wicked}} man. Sometimes I think he's the wickedest {{man in the}} world. But I want you to watch out, and <b>if</b> ever <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> him, or do {{anything}} for him, remember that I wanted you to do it: a boy <b>can</b> often <b>help</b> a man." ...|$|R

6000|$|MILLER: [...] "Well, see quick, please. We {{have plenty}} of time, but we don't want to lose any. Don't alarm Mrs. Miller, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|Never be a stage villain at all <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. The {{life is too}} harassing and the {{remuneration}} altogether disproportionate to the risks and labor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan, {{take care}} of yourself," [...] cried Lieutenant Radbury, who with his son had joined Colonel Milam's division. [...] "Don't run any risks <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not--as yet," [...] {{answers the}} doctor. [...] "So far {{there is no}} {{positive}} brain disease; and there is accordingly no sort of reason for placing him under restraint. It is essentially a difficult and a doubtful case. Have him privately looked after by a competent person, and thwart him in nothing, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> possibly <b>help</b> it. The merest trifle may excite his suspicions; and if that happens, we lose all control over him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let any of {{the folks}} see <b>you</b> <b>if</b> yon <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it," [...] warned Sarah; [...] "and, {{whatever}} happens, don't say anything about that telegram to a living soul. Only--see that it's sent." ...|$|R
60|$|BLUNTSCHLI. No: damn your horse!---thank {{you all the}} same, my dear fellow. (Raina comes in, {{and hears}} the next sentence.) I shall fight you on foot. Horseback's too dangerous: I don't want to kill <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll try it," [...] said Uncle John. [...] "Do your best, my man, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> {{us out of}} this bog {{you shall}} be amply rewarded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Jeff, clap a stopper on your long-winded lectures, and {{go ahead}} wi' the next plan," [...] said the captain, [...] "and don't moralise <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{let them}} {{have a look at}} the ball, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. Now leave me alone. I must get all the rest I can before the last quarter." ...|$|E

"O, {{the devil}} take your gossip, my dear Mick! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> give no <b>help,</b> spare {{drowning}} me with your pother.--Why, man, I was a fresh hand--had my apprentice-fees to pay--and these are no trifles, Mick.--But what of that?--I am {{free of the}} company now, and can trade on my own bottom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Out o' the way, you women!" [...] {{called a}} burly fellow {{who wore a}} green sweater and an oilskin hat; [...] "we don't want to hurt <b>you</b> <b>if</b> we <b>can</b> <b>help.</b> There's the one we're after!" [...] He pointed a finger at Thursday Smith.|$|R
6000|$|Alas, Harry! thought I,--as I stood {{upon the}} {{forecastle}} looking astern where they stood,--that [...] "gallant, gay deceiver" [...] shall not altogether cajole <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> Wellingborough <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it.

6000|$|... “What do you know?” {{questioned}} Dave. “Answer quick. There {{has been}} a big robbery here, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> us to catch the men maybe you’ll get a reward.” ...|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her hands}} in his. [...] "I am trusting you," [...] she said, [...] "with all my life. Don't make a muddle of it, dear, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have. Oh, Nina, pray do {{not speak}} of it. Do not think of it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. Why should {{everything}} be disturbed because I have been a fool?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Mr. Tappitt. I can't say {{anything}} fairer than I have done. It will suit my own views much {{the best to}} start alone, but I {{do not wish to}} oppose <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it.

6000|$|... "Kit," [...] she resumed at length, [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help,</b> {{or if you}} ought. You must decide, dear. I {{just wanted}} to tell you, and I'm comforted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let up!" [...] he said. [...] "Get down, half of you, and see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> {{them with}} the firing. We'll try her again when you have raised more steam." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not {{let them}} see you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it, Porus, or they will follow close behind you, {{although}} they might not overtake you, and that might bring on a fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{any more}} {{visitors}} call to-day," [...] she said, with the profoundest gravity of look and manner, [...] "I am not at home. This {{is a far}} more serious matter than any of you suppose. Go somewhere by yourself, Frank, and read over your part, and don't let your attention wander <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> possibly <b>help</b> it.

6000|$|... 'Let me tell you, {{that the}} other thing, that which you propose to do, {{is by no means}} fine. But I will not quarrel with <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> I <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it.

6000|$|... "Because {{you leave}} me all alone; because you care more for other people than you do for me; because you never like to be at home, never <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>help</b> it. <b>You</b> know you don't.
