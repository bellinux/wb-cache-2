5000|$|Varying {{cultures}} {{of indigenous peoples}} lived intermittently along the Platte {{for thousands of years}} before European exploration. Historical tribes claimed various territories in the region. The Indian tribes typically visited different areas in different seasons, as they followed the bison herds for hunting periods. The introduction of horses, which had escaped from early Spanish explorers in the 1540s, dramatically changed life in the Great Plains. Indian tribes could more easily follow the buffalo herds as they migrated from north to south and back. Before 1870, herds of several hundred thousand bison (buffalo) periodically migrated across the Platte in following seasonal grazing. The animals often waded or swam across the Platte. The first-known European to see the Platte was the French explorer Étienne de Veniard, sieur de Bourgmont in 1714, who named it the Nebraskier, after its Oto name, meaning [...] "flat water". The French later applied the French word plate (meaning <b>flat,</b> and pronounced <b>plat,</b> or platte) to the river.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{determination}} {{of an effective}} method able to estimate the parameters of a photovoltaic panel {{is essential for the}} development and the performance of analysis of such equipment. In this paper, we present a new simple and effective method in order to extract the parameters of the photovoltaic modules by using the standard diode model. This model requires that the five parameters be known, the photocurrent Iph, the reverse saturation current Is, the resistance Rs, the shunt resistance Rsh and the curve fitting parameter A (the ideality factor) or the thermal voltage a. For that we formulated an equation binding only the two losses parameters Rs and Rsh. In order to solve this equation and to determine the shunt resistance and the thermal voltage, we expose the computation models of the series resistance Rs, which give excellent approximations. While the other parameters Iph and Is depend exclusively on the parameters Rs, Rsh, a and the short circuit current Isc and the open circuit voltage Voc. This method is validated experimentally by three different <b>flat</b> <b>plat</b> PV modules of various technologies (Monocrystalline, polycrystalline and thin film panels) and manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} based discharges at atmospheric {{pressures are}} the focus of increased interest in aerodynamics because {{of a wide range of}} potential applications including specifically actuation in flows at moderate speeds. Recent literature describing promising experimental observations, especially on separation control, have spurred efforts in the development of parallel theoretical modeling to alleviate limitations in current understanding of the actuation mechanism. The present effort builds on a recently developed finite element-based one- and two-dimensional multi-fluid formulation of plasma–sheath for atmospheric optical glow discharge in partially ionized gas. The model was relatively straightforward but formed the foundation of a versatile first-principles based methodology. Higher-fidelity models are included to yield a more sophisticated framework to predict discharge-induced momentum exchange. Here, the complete problem of a dielectric barrier discharge based separation control with axially displaced electrodes is simulated in a self-consistent manner. Model predictions for transient evolution of charge densities, the electric field, electrodynamic force and induced gas velocity distributions for helium gas in quiescent condition are shown to mimic trends reported in the experimental literature. For the first time, results also document the decay process of a separation bubble formed due to flow past a <b>flat</b> <b>plat</b> inclined at 12 deg angle of attack. This effort sets the basis for extending the formulation further to include polyphase power input in multi-dimensional settings, and to apply the simulation method to flows past common aerodynamic configurations...|$|E

A precession photograph of A-DNA which gives an undistorted picture of the lattice, showed that the unit cell parameters as given by Fuller Image were not quite correct. The precession photograph showed a strong meridional reflection (R = 0. 00 Å− 1) on the 11 th layer line. But the occurrence of the meridional reflection on the 11 th layer line could not be explained {{on the basis}} of the cell parameters given by Fuller Image; using those cell parameters the reflection which comes closest to the meridian on 11 th layer line is at R = 0. 025 Å− 1. However, a simple interchange of a and b values accounted for the meridional reflection on 11 th layer line. The corrected cell parameter refined against 28 strong spots are A = 40. 75 Å, B = 22. 07 Å, C = 28. 16 Å and β = 97. 5 °.

40|$|In solar air heater, <b>flat</b> <b>plat</b> {{collectors}} are {{the best}} heat transferring devices. But {{the effectiveness of these}} collectorsis very low because of lack of technology. Solar assisted heated air is successfully used for drying applications and space heating under controlled conditions. From the solar flat plate air heater the hot air is transferred to a conventional dryer or to the combined heater and drying chamber directly. Hence, solar assisted air heaters arecheaper and reliable. The important factors affecting these systems are the solar radiation, mechanical loading, temperature and leakage. The air heater efficiency depends on the design of the system as well as the construction materials and the assembly. The solar air heating systems has acceptable life span of 15 to 20 years. The addition ofside mirror enclosures is {{to increase the amount of}} solar radiation absorption at the collector plate so that the collector increases the yield and operate in a higher temperature range.

40|$|Spray coating proccsses are {{characterized}} by their relatively large paint wastage and high energy consumption, especially in car industry. The unavoidable overspray, caused by poor transfer efficiency, has to be removed quickly from the paint booth, {{in order to preserve}} the painting quality on the subject surface. The therefore needed conditioned air stream results in intensive energy requirement for the disposal of the overspray. Against the background of increasing demands on energy-efficient painting processes, a research project has been launched focusing on increasing the efficiency of atomizers in painting processes. This paper summarizes some results of {{the current state of the}} research. The air supported high pressure atomizer, also known as AirCoat or AirMix, is basically an airless atomizer with additional air flow for improved atomization and homogenization of the spray cone. Compared to the well-known air spray painting, the spray transfer efficiency of airless and air-assisted atomizers is relatively high, corresponding to a lower overspray. Therefore, air-assist atomizing is used in the present experimental and numerical investigations. Fraunhofer diffraction and Laser-Doppler Anemometry were used to measure droplet size distributions and the integral droplet velocity in spray cone. Furthermore, the film thickness distribution on a <b>flat</b> <b>plat</b> was also measured. A commercial CFD code (ANSYS-FLUENT) was used in the numerical studies. lnfluences of the additional air flow in air-assist gun on the atomization process, the film thickness distribution and the transfer efficiency were studied.

40|$|Several {{previous}} {{experimental and}} theoretical {{studies have shown}} that a leading edge vortex (LEV) on an airfoil or wing can provide lift enhancement. In this paper, unsteady 2 D potential flow theory is employed to model the flow field of a flapping flat plate wing. A multi-vortices model is developed to model both the leading edge and trailing edge vortices (TEVs), which offers improved accuracy compared with using only single vortex at each separation location. The lift is obtained by integrating the unsteady Blasius equation. It is found that the motion of vortices contributes significantly to the overall aerodynamic force on the flat plate. The shedding of TEVs and the stabilization of LEVs explicitly contributes to lift enhancement. A Kutta-like condition is used to determine the vortex intensity and location at the leading edge for large angle of attack cases; however, it is proposed to relax this condition for small angle of attack cases and apply a 2 D shear layer model to calculate the circulation of the new added vortex. The results of the simulation are then compared with classical numerical, modeled and experimental data for canonical unsteady <b>flat</b> <b>plat</b> problems. Good agreement with these data is observed. Moreover, these results suggested that the leading edge vortex shedding for small angles of attack should be modeled differently than that for large angles of attack. Finally, the results of vortex motion vs. lift indicate that both a motion against the streamwise direction of the LEV and a streamwise motion of the TEV contributes positive lift. This also provides the insights for future active flow control of MAVs that the formation and shedding process of LEVs and TEVs can be manipulated to provide lift enhancement...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. A {{composite}} {{is defined}} as a material that constitutes of at least two constituents, which are bonded together along the interface in the composite. Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) is a composite material in which one constituent is a metal or alloy forming at least one percolating network. The other constituent is embedded in this metal matrix. The particulate metal matrix composites when compared to metal alloys exhibit higher strength, wear resistance and stiffness. Because of their high plastic modulus, they exhibit higher buckling and compressive strength. They have high electrical conductivity, better thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion. More over their isotropic behavior and formability by conventional methods makes them good choice for low cost applications. Optimization of the design of structural joints leads to increase in their load carrying capacity, minimizing weight and cost. Extensive knowledge of multiple parameters that effect the behavior of the structural joints is required for reliable and effective design of joints. The aim of this research is to predict the stress concentration around the hole in the lap joint made of MMC and to investigate the effects of the different parameters on the stress around the hole. A three dimensional finite element model has been developed to study the effects of various design parameters on the structural performance of such joints. The model is validated by comparing the results with a closed form solution for a simple problem of determining the stress around the hole in a <b>flat</b> <b>plat.</b> The present study quantifies relationship between stress concentration around the hole and the bolt diameter; distance between the holes, Young’s modulus, fastener pre-tension and the axial load...|$|E
40|$|Some recent {{considerations}} in three widely {{different aspects of}} high-temperature corrosion are summarized: 1) reactions at the metal/scale interface in support of scale growth; 2) mass transfer effects in the control of evaporation of volatile reaction products; and 3) the codeposition of multiple elements for diffusion coatings using halide-activated cementation packs. The climb of misfit edge dislocations from the metal/scale interface can achieve the annihilation of vacancies associated with scales grown by cation diffusion. For scale growth at the metal/scale interface by anion diffusion, the creation of anion vacancies occurs by the climb of misorientation dislocations. For cation-diffusing scales, a blocking of the vacancy annihilation reaction may be achieved by the specific adsorption of reactive elements at the metal/scale interface. The pinning of the interfacial misfit dislocations by segregated reactive elements can explain the changes in growth mechanism, in growth stresses, and in reaction kinetics associated with the reactive element effect {{for the growth of}} chromia scales on alloys. Although the vapor pressures of volatile species are readily calculated from available thermodynamic data, the use of these values to predict the kinetics of transport-limited evaporation has not been presented specifically for various substrate geometries and differing flow conditions. The empirical mass transfer relations are evaluated and plotted for the <b>flat</b> <b>plat</b> and tube geometries in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes. Acriterion for the stability of a flat interface in selective evaporation from an alloy is still lacking. Despite the inherent difficulty to codeposit two or more elements with greatly differing thermodynamic stabilities for their halide species, cementation coating packs can be designed with selected combinations of powdered masteralloys and halide activator salts whereby elements are codeposited to yield a desirable surface composition. Selected examples for effective aluminizing/chromizing of Ni-base superalloys and for chromizing/siliconizing of steels are presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates room {{acoustic}} diffusers {{based on}} number sequences, exploring their shortcomings and presents improvements. Standard Phase Grating Diffusers display frequencies where they act like flat plates {{and fail to}} diffuse. To overcome this, two new sequences (Luke and power residue) are introduced. The diffusers based on these sequences display extended frequency range compared to standard ones such as Quadratic Residue and Primitive Root Diffusers. Their performance is studied using Boundary Element Modelling which shows that they can avoid flat plate phenomena in the audible frequency range. Furthermore, it is shown that {{by taking advantage of}} their inner symmetries Quadratic Residue and Primitive Root Diffusers can be created from smaller components thus allowing for the <b>flat</b> <b>plat</b> effect to be mitigated. Next, Absorption Grating Diffusers are investigated. They consist of ideally absorbing and reflecting elements. For their implementation heavily damped Helmholtz Resonators are investigated showing that they give an approximation of the required distribution of admittance on the surface. Then the performance of ideal Absorption Grating Diffusers is investigated using Boundary Element Modelling. Even with idealised completely absorbing elements, the performance of the diffuser is shown not to achieve substantial diffusion. This arises because edge diffraction from the reflecting elements weakens at high frequencies. At frequencies where smaller elements are creating substantial scattering, larger elements are producing specular reflections. Furthermore, {{due to the lack of}} cancellation, the specular reflected lobe is insufficiently attenuated, because it can only be changed through absorption. Improvements to the original design are suggested. By changing reflective elements to reactive ones, scattering can be extended to higher frequencies. This allows for a range of frequencies were more reflecting elements display substantial dispersion. Also, implementing the absorbing elements using porous material in a shallow well allows some reflection, resulting in cancellation in the specular reflection lobe due to interference. Measurements of the scattered pressure distribution of absorption grating surfaces are carried out and then compared to Boundary Element Modelling simulations using surface admittance data measured in an impedance tube. The agreement between measurement and simulation is excellent proving the accuracy of this simulation method for these applications. The results show that the samples tested perform as two level Phase Grating Diffusers, with some energy loss, while their diffusion characteristics are shifted to lower frequencies. This arises because of the lower speed of sound in the porous medium. This implementation is shown to absorb 50 % of the incident sound while the rest is scattered uniformly but only over a limited bandwidth.
