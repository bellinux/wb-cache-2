40|$|Main {{memory is}} one of the leading {{hardware}} causes for machine crashes in today’s datacenters. Designing, evaluating and modeling systems that are resilient against memory errors requires a good understanding of the underlying characteristics of errors <b>in</b> <b>DRAM</b> <b>in</b> the field. While there have recently been a few first studies on <b>DRAM</b> errors <b>in</b> production systems, these have been too limited in either the size of the data set or the granularity of the data to conclusively answer many of the open questions on DRAM errors. Such questions include, for example, the prevalence of soft errors compared to hard errors, or the analysis of typical patterns of hard errors. In this paper, we study data on DRAM errors collected on a diverse range of production systems in total covering nearly 300 terabyte-years of main memory. As a first contribution, we provide a detailed analytical study of DRAM error characteristics, including both hard and soft errors. We find that a large fraction of <b>DRAM</b> errors <b>in</b> the field can be attributed to hard errors and we provide a detailed analytical study of their characteristics. As a second contribution, the paper uses the results from the measurement study to identify a number of promising directions for designing more resilient systems and evaluates the potential of different protection mechanisms in the light of realistic error patterns. One of our findings is that simple page retirement policies might be able to mask a large number of <b>DRAM</b> errors <b>in</b> production systems, while sacrificing only a negligible fraction of the total <b>DRAM</b> <b>in</b> the system...|$|R

50|$|The two {{widely used}} forms of modern RAM are static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (<b>DRAM).</b> <b>In</b> SRAM, {{a bit of}} data is stored using the state of a six {{transistor}} memory cell. This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less dynamic power than <b>DRAM.</b> <b>In</b> modern computers, SRAM is often used as cache memory for the CPU. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a DRAM memory cell. The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it. As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.|$|R
