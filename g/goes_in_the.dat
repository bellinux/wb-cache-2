5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of any blood or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever comes and <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E

25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using overhead wire, {{the trolley}} pole {{has given way}} to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> correct direction at junctions.|$|E

She {{stays in the}} car while he <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> facility to find Eckerle {{who is in a}} hysterical, paranoid state, having been unable to escape the roaches that he feels are following him. Eckerle pulls a gun on Mulder, thinking that even he may somehow be a cockroach. Scully arrives on the scene and meets Berenbaum. [...] Scully then <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> facility seeking for Mulder and then phones Mulder, and when Mulder's phone rings, Eckerle believes it to be Mulder making a tone {{like the rest of the}} unusual roaches. Eckerle fires at Mulder, and his shots rupture and ignite pipes containing methane gas. The agents flee, and the facility explodes with Eckerle still inside. The next day, Dr. Ivanov arrives to talk with Mulder at the scene of the explosion and meets Berenbaum. The two leave with one another, discussing their interests in insects and robots. That night Mulder writes his report on the case, wondering how humanity would react if insect-like robots visited Earth. Mulder finds a bizarre looking bug by his food, and crushes it with an X-File.|$|E

500|$|While some {{conflict}} approaches also gained {{popularity in}} the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted {{to a variety of}} empirically oriented middle-range theories with no single overarching, or [...] "grand", theoretical orientation. John Levi Martin refers to this [...] "golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm" [...] as the Pax Wisconsana, as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison: numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention. Omar Lizardo describes the Pax Wisconsana as: [...] "a Midwestern flavored, Mertonian resolution of the theory/method wars in which [...] all agreed on at least two working hypotheses: (1) grand theory' is a waste of time; (2) [...] good theory has to be good to think with or <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trash bin." [...] Despite the aversion to grand theory in the later half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses: structuralism, post-structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory.|$|E

Then, the duo are caught up in a storm that eventually turns into a tornado, and Squidward tells SpongeBob to let the pizza go as it causes them to get sucked into the tornado. However, the pizza saves their lives after SpongeBob turns it into a parachute. Upon landing, Squidward panics when he realizes the road they were following is nowhere in sight. SpongeBob then notices some moss on a rock and claims that they should go in the direction the moss is pointing (another one of SpongeBob's [...] "pioneer tricks"), but Squidward refuses and <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other direction, despite there actually being civilization where the moss was pointing.|$|E

500|$|Let Go {{has earned}} mostly {{positive}} responses from critics, earning 68 points on Metacritic {{based on the}} collated reviews from 7 publications. Rolling Stone magazine's music critic Pat Blashill wrote that the album [...] "comes fully loaded with another dozen infectious hymns of Total Request angst". Blashill complimented Lavigne on having a [...] "great voice", adding she crafted the album with [...] "a qualified staff of hitmakers". [...] Christina Saraceno of AllMusic noted that Lavigne [...] "handles {{a variety of styles}} deftly", while also complimenting her as [...] "a capable songwriter with vocal chops". Nonetheless, Saraceno opined that [...] "at her age, one imagines, she is still finding her feet, borrowing from the music she's grown up listening to". John Perry of Blender magazine summarized Let Go into an [...] "outstanding guitar-pop debut". A review in Q magazine praised Lavigne for displaying [...] "a musical guile way beyond her years". Kaj Roth of Melodic felt that Lavigne [...] "sings lovely and some of the songs <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alanis Morissette [...] vein." [...] For Jon Caramanica of Entertainment Weekly magazine (who gave the album a B−), [...] "Lavigne's monochromatic debut set of unimaginative guitar rock is saved only by the earnestness of her songs." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 19th {{century the}} {{painting}} was at times associated with Quentin Massys and Hugo van der <b>Goes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1930s, based on x-radiographs, art historian Alan Burroughs attributed the Boston painting to Dieric Bouts [...] "under the supervision" [...] of van der Weyden. [...] He later revised his opinion to van der Weyden, but art historians remained unsure as to which of the four panel versions was the original or prime version and which were copies. Infrared reflectography has revealed underdrawing in the Boston version which contains heavy redrafting and re-working. This is absent in the other versions, strong evidence the Boston panel is prime. The approach to the underdrawing {{is very similar to}} the paintings where attribution to van der Weyden is established, such as the Descent from the Cross in Madrid, and the Miraflores Altarpiece in Berlin. They are built up with brush and ink, with the most attention given to the outlines of the figures and draperies. Hatching is used to indicate areas of deep shadow. In each, the underdrawing is a working sketch, subject to constant revisions, which continued even after painting [...] had begun. The drawing of Mary is similar to the Louvre's silverpoint drawing of 1464 attributed to his circle. Both are of a type van der Weyden was preoccupied with, showing [...] "an ongoing refinement and emphasis on [...] youthfulness... traceable throughout his work".|$|E
500|$|An {{immediate}} focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit, with Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions hired {{to create the}} costume. Shinkle noted that [...] "comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique", {{and he tried to}} balance that with reality. Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave the costume a slimmer, [...] "quintessential Deadpool" [...] look. Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume, with Reynolds explaining that [...] "we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That’s hard to accomplish and a feat, but we’re just so happy with how this came out." [...] The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind, with the eye areas on the mask removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without changing the whole mask. The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI, which visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed on its fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to [...] "get into the gutters and the cracks ... the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt." [...] Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.|$|E

2500|$|Proinsulin {{undergoes}} maturation into active insulin {{through the}} action of cellular endopeptidases known as prohormone convertases (PC1 and PC2), {{as well as the}} exoprotease carboxypeptidase E. [...] The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions, releasing a fragment called the C-peptide, and leaving 2 peptide chains, the B- and A- chains, linked by 2 disulfide bonds. [...] The cleavage sites are each located after a pair of basic residues (lysine-64 and arginine-65, and arginine-31 and −32). After cleavage of the C-peptide, these 2 pairs of basic residues are removed by the carboxypeptidase.

2500|$|In 1968 Victor Veselago's paper {{showed that}} the {{opposite}} directions of EM plane waves and the flow of energy {{was derived from the}} individual Maxwell curl equations. In ordinary optical materials, the curl equation for the electric field show a [...] "right hand rule" [...] for the directions of the electric field E, the magnetic induction B, and wave propagation, which <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of [...] wave vector k. However, the direction of energy flow formed by E × H is right-handed only when permeability is greater than zero. This means that when permeability is less than zero, e.g. negative, wave propagation is reversed (determined by k), and contrary to the direction of energy flow. Furthermore, the relations of vectors E, H, and k form a [...] "left-handed" [...] system – and it was Veselago who coined the term [...] "left-handed" [...] (LH) material, which is in wide use today (2011). He contended that an LH material has a negative refractive index and relied on the steady-state solutions of Maxwell's equations as a center for his argument.|$|E
