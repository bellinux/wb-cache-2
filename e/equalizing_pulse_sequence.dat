The double-quantum filtration efficiency for spin pairs with large dipolar coupling interactions is found to be further improved by reducing the Larmor frequency. The double-quantum filtration efficiency for spin pairs with a small dipolar coupling interaction is found to be improved by increasing the duration or the amplitude of the radiofrequency pulses applied during the experiment.

50|$|For analog NTSC {{there are}} a total of 525 {{scanning}} lines of which originally 483 lines were visible (241.5 visible lines + 21 lines of vertical blanking per field) and later 480 (240 complete lines per field). quad video recording systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field. A full frame consists of two fields. One field contains the odd-numbered lines and the other contains the even ones. By convention an NTSC video frame is considered to start with an even field followed by an odd field. The disparity of the line numbering compared to other systems is solved by defining the line numbering to start five <b>equalizing</b> <b>pulses</b> (or 2 and a half lines) earlier than on all other systems (including Systems A and E {{even though they had}} no <b>equalizing</b> <b>pulses)</b> on the first <b>equalizing</b> <b>pulse</b> following an active line or half line. This has the effect of placing a half line of video {{at the end of the}} even (first) field and the beginning of the odd (second field). Thus the line numbers correspond to the real lines of the video frame. On all other systems, the field was considered to start with the falling edge of the first field pulse which gave the confusing position that the odd field (first) had a half a line of video occupying the latter half of a whole line and ended with a whole line of video but half a scanning line (and vice versa for the even field). The NTSC convention solved this confusion.|$|R
