5|$|Alice {{remembers that}} an {{anti-virus}} is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> but {{they find it}} missing. Spence remembers he stole and released the virus. He hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.|$|E
5|$|At {{school the}} next day Peter talks to Liz in the hall; she is complimenting his {{tutoring}} when the popular students approach, making her change her attitude, act rudely, and walk away. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> Dr. Connors picks up a vial of lizard DNA that Electro had electrified, and leaves with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{have their}} termini located close together in 3D space. Because of this, {{it is often}} possible to design circular permutations of proteins. Today, circular permutations are generated routinely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> using standard genetics techniques. Although some permutation sites prevent the protein from folding correctly, many permutants have been created with nearly identical structure and function to the original protein.|$|E

5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|The revamped Library, {{opened in}} 2013, {{features}} dedicated study areas, a small platform to hold forums and press conferences, {{as well as}} three discussion rooms available for student-teacher consultations, projects and group studies. The Nest, a dedicated maker-space which was opened in March 2017, allows students to design, construct or modify meaningful or handy items with specialised tools <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> and supports the school's Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Applied Learning Programme (STEM ALP).|$|E
5|$|These {{molecules}} are rod-shaped, some created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> {{and some}} appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two {{new types of}} LC molecules have been discovered, both man-made: disc-shaped (created by S.

5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Rica Erickson wrote Triggerplants, {{describing}} habitat, distribution, {{and plant}} forms (ephemeral, creeping, leafy-stemmed, rosette, tufted, scale-leaved, and tropical). It was Erickson that began placing certain species into these morphologically-based groups, {{which may or}} may not resemble true taxonomic divergences. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s that research of the trigger physiology was begun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> of Dr. Findlay of Flinders University. Douglas Darnowski added to the growing library of knowledge on Stylidium when he published his book Triggerplants in 2002, describing an overview of habitat, plant morphology, carnivory, and research done to date. Following its publication, he co-founded the International Triggerplant Society.|$|E
5|$|One of Robinson's professors, James E. Boyd, {{convinced}} him {{to give up the}} radio repair business and work as a research assistant at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (then known as the Engineering Experiment Station, or EES). One of his ham radio friends was actually his boss's boss and EES director, Gerald Rosselot. Working after hours at EES, Robinson built a television set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> which he and others claim was the first to be built in the state of Georgia. In 1950, Robinson went to Tennessee to work in nuclear engineering for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, servicing radiology-related equipment at local hospitals.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} running jokes {{throughout}} the series. Established in Goldfinger is Q's continuing disgust at how his equipment is often lost, {{damaged or destroyed}} by Bond during missions. Another is how easily distracted Bond is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> ("Now pay attention") as Q rattles off details {{about the use of}} the equipment which Bond needs to commit to memory. Another part of the customary byplay between Q and Bond is Bond's amused reaction to the latest devices and the Quartermaster's indignant response ("I never joke about my work"). There are also sight gags showing prototype equipment. In the field, however, Bond always remembers the details and takes full advantage of the tools supplied.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E
5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} {{found in the}} Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with no impact to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|When Thomas Hunt Morgan began {{experimenting with}} {{breeding}} the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{he was a}} saltationist who hoped to demonstrate that a new species could be created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> by mutation alone. Instead, the work at his lab between 1910 and 1915 reconfirmed Mendelian genetics and provided solid experimental evidence linking it to chromosomal inheritance. His work also demonstrated that most mutations had relatively small effects, such as a change in eye color, and that rather than creating a new species in a single step, mutations served to increase variation within the existing population.|$|E
5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{the player}} {{character}} discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> the player finds Jill or Chris {{in a cell}} and encounters Wesker programming a Tyrant, a giant humanoid supersoldier. Wesker reveals {{that he is a}} double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant to kill the remaining STARS members. However, in the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is supposedly killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and manages to contact Brad for extraction. The game features multiple endings depending on the player's actions at key points {{over the course of the}} game. In the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter after defeating the Tyrant one last time. In contrast, in the worst possible ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.|$|E

5|$|In Dorchester, {{a damaged}} cargo ship from China washes ashore; {{all of the}} crew members seem to be {{infected}} with squid-like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Boston's Chinatown, only to suffer the same fate {{in the presence of}} a man (Tzi Ma). While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived seasickness, and that another ship is expected in two days. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> Walter (John Noble) posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still-living worms bites Walter, boosting his white blood cell count and making him suddenly feel better.|$|E
5|$|In {{controlled}} studies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> Hodson and Olson {{tried to}} find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did likeHondamore than non-matching brands).They speculated that brand names {{are more likely to}} communicate identity to others than other everyday things.Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a flare gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
