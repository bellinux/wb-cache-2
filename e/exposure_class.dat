40|$|Abstract. The {{durability}} of concrete structures {{is an important}} issue. Eurocode EN 206 - 1 introduces the k-value concept for concretes made with supplementary cementitious materials; a prescriptive concept that recommends limiting water/cement ratio values for a specified <b>exposure</b> <b>class.</b> A more advanced performance-based concept directly requires that concrete be designed in terms of performance-related parameters, an approach {{which seems to be}} more suitable when durability must be achieved. The application of mathematical models in durability assessment is advocated, and an example is shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{reinforced}} steel corrosion {{which is the}} most important problem of reinforced concrete structures durability is generally stipulated for carbonization of concrete surrounding it. Concrete cover calculation at the design stage is predicated one because of the differences in manufacturing conditions and use of constructions. The applying of the probabilistic approaches to the carbonation process modeling allows to get predicated grade of the depth of carbonization of concrete and, thus, to settle minimum concrete cover thickness for a given projected service life of a construction. The procedures for concrete mix design for different strength classes of concrete are described in the article. Current recommendations on assignment of concrete strength class as well as concrete cover are presented. The European Standard EN 206 : 2013 defines the content requirements for the concrete structures operated in the <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 1, including the minimum values of water-cement ratio, minimum cement content, and minimum strength class of concrete. Since the standard does not include any basis or explanations of the requirements, we made an effort to develop a scientific justification for the mentioned requirements. We developed the probabilistic models for the process of carbonation of concrete based on the concrete mix which was designed using the software VTK-Korroziya. The reinforced concrete structures with concrete cover 20 – 35 mm operated in the most unfavorable conditions within the <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 1 were analyzed. The corresponding probabilistic calculations of the depth of carbonated concrete are described in the article.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: High {{television}} {{exposure time}} at young age {{has been described}} as a potential risk factor for developing behavioral problems. However, less is known about the effects of preschool television on subsequent bullying involvement. We examined the association between television viewing time through ages 2 - 5 and bullying involvement in the first grades of elementary school. We hypothesized that high television exposure increases the risk of bullying involvement. Method. TV viewing time was assessed repeatedly in early childhood using parental report. To combine these repeated assessments we used latent class analysis. Four exposure classes were identified and labeled "low", "mid-low", "mid-high" and "high". Bullying involvement was assessed by teacher questionnaire (n = 3423, mean age 6. 8 years). Additionally, peer/self-report of bullying involvement was obtained using a peer nomination procedure (n = 1176, mean age 7. 6 years). We examined child risk of being a bully, victim or a bully-victim (compared to being uninvolved in bullying). Results: High television <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> was associated with elevated risks of bullying and victimization. Also, in both teacher- and child-reported data, children in the high television <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> were more likely to be a bully-victim (OR = 2. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 42 - 3. 13 and OR = 3. 68, 95 % CI: 1. 75 - 7. 74 respectively). However, all univariate effect estimates attenuated and were no longer statistically significant once adjusted for maternal and child covariates. Conclusions: The association between television viewing time through ages 2 - 5 and bullying involvement in early elementary school is confounded by maternal and child socio-demographic characteristics...|$|E

An algorithm-derived local connected fractal dimension (LCFD) frequency measure {{was used in}} this comparative analysis. Canonical variates (CVA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to evaluate the discrimination power of the method among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> (unexposed, Cd exposed, TBA exposed). Misclassification, sensitivity and specificity, both with original and cross-validated cases, were determined. LCFDs frequencies enhanced the differences among classes which were visually selected after their means, respective variances and the differences between Cd and TBA exposed means, with respect to unexposed mean, were analyzed by scatter plots. Selected frequencies were then scanned by means of LDA, stepwise analysis, and Mahalanobis distance to detect the most discriminative frequencies out of ten originally selected. Discrimination resulted in 91. 7 % of cross-validated cases correctly classified (22 out of 24 total cases), with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 95. 5 % (1 false negative with respect to 21 really positive cases) and 75 % (1 false positive with respect to 3 really negative cases). CVA with convex hull polygons ensured prompt, visually intuitive discrimination among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> and graphically supported the false positive case. The combined use of semithin sections, which enhanced the visual evaluation of the overall lamellar structure; of LCFD analysis, which objectively detected local variation in complexity, without the possible bias connected to human personnel; and of CVA/LDA, could be an objective, sensitive and specific approach to study fish gill lamellar pathology.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{durability and}} service life models for reinforced concrete structures {{with regard to}} chloride ingress, carbonation and frost attack. In the past years a number of models for durability design of concrete structures have been suggested by relevant organisations or international committees. It is necessary to validate these models against long-term field data for their applicability with respect to exposure climate in order to satisfactorily use the models in the durability design and redesign of concrete structures. In this study, various potential models for concrete resistance to chloride ingress, carbonation and frost attack were briefly reviewed. Three models including the simple ERFC, the DuraCrete and the ClinConc, for prediction of chloride ingress were evaluated using the infield data collected from both the field exposure site after over 20 years exposure and the real road bridges of about 30 years old. A physicochemical model for prediction of carbonation depth was evaluated using the infield data collected from the field exposure site after 11 years exposure and the limited data from the real structures with the age of 7 - 13 years. For the modelling of frost attack, some problems in measurement of critical saturation degree and actual degree of saturation are discussed. According to the comparison results, the simple ERFC overestimates whilst the DuraCrete model underestimate the chloride ingress in most cases. The ClinConc model {{on the other hand}} gives reasonable good prediction for both the short-term (one year) and the long-term (21 years) exposure. The Papadakis model for carbonation also gives fairly good prediction of carbonation depth when compared with the Norwegian infield data classified as <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 3, but underestimates the carbonation depths when compared with the infield data from Norwegian structures in <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 4. For the frost attack, it is premature to apply the models to the service life prediction so far...|$|E

CUR committee VC 81 {{has developed a}} guideline for service life design based on initiation of corrosion due to chloride penetration for exposure classes XD or XS. A semi-probabilistic simplification of the DuraCrete methodology is introduced with a probability of failure of < 10 % for corrosion initiation. Three options are provided to the designer: (1) a range of concrete cover depths adapted to the binder type and exposure class; (2) a semi-probabilistic approach using a safety margin for the concrete cover depth; (3) full probabilistic calculations based on specified input parameters. The guideline permits optimisation with respect to cover depth and concrete composition. The required concrete performance is the chloride diffusion resistance, measured as Rapid Chloride Migration.

Aim: To investigate the differences between slope and ridge environments in upper montane forests of southern Ecuador in terms of species diversity (richness, abundance), species composition and life forms of terrestrial bryophytes. Methods: We used Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) to group bryophyte releveacutes by study location, habitat type and <b>exposure</b> <b>class.</b> Species indicator values were calculated and compared for different habitats.

Regardless of improvements in repairing materials and methods, several repaired concrete structures still fail prematurely, leading to costly and time consuming repairs of repairs. Studies in the field of concrete repairs showed that almost 50 % of repaired concrete structures had failed in Europe and USA. Simultaneously, numerous existing concrete structures needs to be repaired as they do not meet today's safety standard. As a result, annually billions of EUR will continue to be spent in order to repair deteriorated concrete structures. The need to mitigate premature failure of repaired concrete structures has to inspire many researchers to develop service life prediction model for repaired concrete structures. However, till today, service life of repaired concrete structures is just an estimate which relies on individual's experience. Scientifically developed service life prediction model for repaired concrete structures is highly desired for optimizing selection of repairing materials and techniques in turn diminishing economic loss due to premature repaired concrete failure.

Laser beam was used in single and punctual dose with the parameters: continuous, 688 nm and 785 nm wavelength, tip`s area of 0. 00785 cm(2), power 50 mW, application time 20 s, dose 255 J/cm(2), energy 2 J. Teeth were capped with Ca(OH) (2), Ca(OH) (2) cement and restored with amalgam. All groups presented pulp repair. On 25 (th) day the thickness of the formed dentin barrier was different between the groups GI and GII (p < 0. 05) and between groups GI and GIII (p < 0. 01).

Conventional steel reinforced concrete (RC) elements were dominating the precast market for concrete building envelopes particularly during the 1960 s– 1980 s. One of the main disadvantages of RC, however, is the inherent thickness of the concrete cover. Considering the exposure environment surrounding a building façade in Sweden, <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> of XC 3 /XC 4 and a minimum cover thickness of 30 – 35  mm are recommended as per EN 206 - 1 (2013). This design requirement results in a total minimum thickness of an RC panel of approximately 80  mm, which, in turn, brings about particularly heavy and thick façade elements.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part of the natural hazard’s risk management is the vulnerability assessment. There are many publications proposing different systems of indicators and tools for vulnerability assessment, but very few of them are dealing with the problem on community level. The study for municipality of Lom is carried out on the base of a framework for vulnerability assessment which includes the following important elements: hazard probability, exposure, sensitivity and coping capacity. In this paper we use the spatial dimensions of the areas prone to a particular climate hazard as an indicator for the level of exposure to this hazard. We introduce a measure for the system sensitivity as a function of hazard and <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> assigned to these areas. On the base of a system of indicators and scores for the hazard, exposure, sensitivity and capacity, is estimated a Vulnerability Index for municipality of Lom. The results from this case study show that implementation of the proposed Vulnerability Assessment Method provide reliable information for the level of vulnerability to ten climate hazards. It may be of use for different risk management purposes...|$|R

Typically, representing and replicating the habitat types present within protected areas is used to spread the risk of protecting frequently disturbed sites. This was the approach used during the 2004 re-zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) via the Representative Areas Program. Over 10 years later, we examine whether the risk was spread by mapping exposure of coral reefs in the GBRMP to four disturbances that cause coral mortality: bleaching, tropical cyclones, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and freshwater inundation. Our objectives were to: (1) assess whether no-take areas include a range of disturbance regimes, and (2) identify coral reef areas with lower relative exposure. At least 13 % and an average of 31 % of reef locations in each of 11 <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> are included within no-take areas. A greater proportion of low-exposure areas are within no-take areas than high-exposure areas (34. 2 % vs. 28. 3 %). The results demonstrate the value of risk spreading when exposure data are not available while also showing that regularly assessing exposure increases capacity for adaptive, resilience-based reef management...|$|R
