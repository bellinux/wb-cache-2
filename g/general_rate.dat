5|$|Hanley council made {{a formal}} {{proposal}} in 1902 to the Local Government Board {{for the expansion}} of the County Borough of Hanley to include not only Stoke, Burslem, Longton, Fenton and Tunstall but also Smallthorne Urban District, Wolstanton Rural District, and the parishes of Milton, Goldenhill, Chell, Trentham, Stoke Rural, Caverswall and Stone. Only Longton council supported the idea as concurrently, Sir Hugh Owen, a former secretary to the Local Government Board, presented the six towns committee with a scheme of financial adjustment. Under this proposal, the net assets of each town would be calculated by deducting outstanding debts and liabilities from the values of its various properties. The proportion each town needed to contribute to the overall value of the county borough was then to be calculated. If the value of the net assets to be contributed by a town was less than the proportion calculated as due from that town towards the overall sum, then that town would need to set a higher <b>general</b> <b>rate</b> to be paid by the ratepayers of that town. Conversely, towns contributing a value of net assets greater than their proportion of the overall sum would be able to set a lower <b>general</b> <b>rate.</b> While five of the towns awaited a report from Alderman Frederick Geen of Stoke on the implications of the Owen proposal, Fenton immediately decided that it would impose undue financial hardship on the ratepayers of the district as the net assets of the district would show a deficiency and therefore a higher rate would have to be set. Fenton district council could not accept such a move and withdrew from all discussions on federation forthwith. Geen's July 1903 report increased opposition to the idea of federation while a poll of ratepayers in Burslem came out strongly against federation. Burslem council then withdrew from the scheme to be followed shortly afterwards by Stoke. Faced by such strong opposition, Hanley council felt compelled to withdraw its submission to the Local Government Board bringing the first attempt at federation in the twentieth century to an unsuccessful conclusion.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{foundations}} of the campaign was the knowledge that certain aspects of the law on council budgeting in 1985 were not entirely clear. What was clear was that all local authorities had a duty to set a budget and therefore an annual rate or precept, under sections 2 and 11 of the <b>General</b> <b>Rate</b> Act 1967. Precepting authorities had the additional responsibility to set their budgets and precepts at least 21 days {{before the start of the}} new financial year; as the local government financial year began on 1 April, 21 days before that was 10 March. No such duty applied to rate-making authorities. In practice most set a budget and a rate some weeks before the new financial year, but not all did; some authorities routinely made their rates after the beginning of a financial year. The <b>General</b> <b>Rate</b> Act, section 2(1), also provided that the rate had to be sufficient to meet all estimated expenditure not met by other sources, thereby making any deficit budget illegal.|$|E

Instead of VAT there is a local Sales Tax (IGIC) which has a <b>general</b> <b>rate</b> of 7%, an increased tax rate of 13.5%, a reduced tax rate of 3% and a zero tax rate for certain basic need products and services. Consequently, some products are subject to import tax and VAT if being exported from the islands into mainland Spain or {{the rest of the}} EU.|$|E

The same rate applies to cinema tickets and to the television licence. Financial services, health services, social services and educational services are all outside the scope of the VAT Act. Newspapers, books and periodicals are zero-rated. Svalbard has no VAT because of a clause in the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E
25|$|If it were {{possible}} for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the <b>general</b> <b>rate</b> of wages, it needs hardly be said {{that this would be}} a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.|$|E

The <b>General</b> <b>Rate</b> Act 1967 section 50 and schedule 10 gave ratepayers the right to pay by ten instalments which were to be paid at monthly intervals during the year. With a financial year ending on 31 March, the latest date to start the payment was 1 July; the council had to give ten days' notice of a payment being due, so the latest date for setting a rate without incurring irrecoverable debts was 20 June.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} 219 {{fatalities}} recorded on Mount Everest from the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition {{through the end}} of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a <b>general</b> <b>rate,</b> and includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5%) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent. Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits, with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and 2 on the north face.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} predecessor {{to business}} rates was the <b>general</b> <b>rate,</b> {{established by the}} <b>General</b> <b>Rate</b> Act 1967.

The Local Government Finance Act 1988 repealed the <b>General</b> <b>Rate</b> Act and replaced it with two new taxes from 1 April 1990. The Community Charge, better known as the [...] "poll tax", replaced the rating of domestic property. It was itself later replaced by Council Tax.

2500|$|Business {{rates is}} the {{commonly}} used name in England of non-domestic rates, {{a tax on}} the occupation of non-domestic property (National Non-Domestic Rates – NNDR). Rates are a property tax with ancient roots that was formerly used to fund local services that was formalised with the Poor Law 1572 and superseded by the Poor Law of 1601. The Local Government Finance Act 1988 introduced business rates in England and Wales from 1990, repealing its immediate predecessor, the <b>General</b> <b>Rate</b> Act 1967. The act also introduced business rates in Scotland, but as {{an amendment to the}} existing system which had evolved separately to that in the rest of Great Britain. [...] Since the establishment, in 1997, of a Welsh Assembly Government able to pass secondary legislation, the English and Welsh systems have been able to diverge. In 2015 business rates for Wales were devolved.|$|E
2500|$|Following Michael Heinrich, David Harvey criticized Engels's editing of Capital, Volume III, and {{emphasized}} {{in a conference}} text that Engels himself inserted the sentence [...] "In practice, however, the rate of profit will fall in the long run, as we have already seen." [...] The suggestion is, that in the text preceding Engels's inserted sentence, Marx himself had never said anything about such a long-run falling tendency. Harvey's view contrasts with Marx's preceding text, in which Marx says that as the capitalist mode of production advances, its <b>general</b> <b>rate</b> of profit must steadily decline, [...] "since the mass of living labour applied continuously declines {{in relation to the}} mass of objectified labor [...] that it sets in motion." [...] However, Michael Heinrich argues that Marx in his old age paid no attention anymore to the falling tendency, suggesting it was no longer important to him.|$|E

2500|$|Bortkiewicz's {{analysis}} nevertheless {{raised the}} very important {{question of what}} the point of Marx's value theory is. Is there is any real difference between Marx's [...] "values" [...] and theoretical prices? If {{there is no real}} difference, neo-Ricardians argued, then Marx's value theory is redundant; one could then just as well make all the same sorts of arguments in price terms. The advantage seemed to be, that there exists no [...] "transformation problem" [...] of converting values into prices through a quantitative adjustment anymore, and that value theory could be replaced with equilibrium theory to explain prices, since [...] "value" [...] then simply stood for [...] "equilibrium prices" [...] (such as the Smithian or Ricardian [...] "natural prices"). One could then create a system of equilibrium prices for the critical variables involved in production, to explain price relationships. However, then Marx's theory of the formation of a <b>general</b> <b>rate</b> of profit, and his theory of the TRPF, would no longer be valid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{valuation}} {{assumes that}} a year-to-year (that is, ongoing) lease is being agreed, where the tenant pays all repairs and insurance, {{and that the}} property [...] "is {{in a state of}} reasonable repair". It was intention of the drafters of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 that the assumption of reasonable repair that existed in the <b>general</b> <b>rate</b> would continue in the new system. However, a successful legal challenge at the Lands Tribunal (Benjamin (VO) v Anston Properties Ltd [...] ) showed that they had in fact failed to include it in the legislation. This was rectified by the Rating (Valuation) Act 1999, which amended the 1988 Act to explicitly include the assumption. The repair assumption includes the proviso of [...] "excluding from this assumption any repairs which a reasonable landlord would consider uneconomic." [...] The property is assumed to be vacant and to let; that is, an empty property available to rent.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} problem of rate {{allocation}} in Guaranteed Services networks by assigning a cost corresponding to a rate, and examining least cost allocations. We show that the common algorithm of allocating the same rate to a connection on all links along its path (called the Identical Rates algorithm henceforth) is, indeed, a least cost allocation in many situations of interest. This finding provides theoretical justification for a commonly adopted strategy, and is a contribution of this paper. However, it may happen that the single rate required is not available on some links of the route. The second contribution {{of this paper is}} an explicit expression for the optimal rate vector for the case where Identical Rates is infeasible. This leads to an algorithm called <b>General</b> <b>Rates</b> that can admit a connection by allocating possibly different rates on the links along a route. Finally, we simulate the <b>General</b> <b>Rates</b> algorithm in a dynamic scenario, and observe that it can provide, at best, marginally improved blocking probabilities. Our conclusion is that the performance benefits provided by <b>General</b> <b>Rates</b> are not compelling enough, and the simpler Identical Rates suffices in practice.
