50|$|A {{silent call}} is a {{telephone}} call that is generated by a predictive <b>dialler</b> (or <b>dialler)</b> which {{does not have an}} agent immediately available to handle the call. In this instance the call, may be terminated by the <b>dialler,</b> and the called party receives a silence ("dead air") or a tone from the telephone company which indicates the call has been dropped.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{telecommunication}} industry, a NAD will {{be connected}} to a user's telephone. When the user dials a number, the NAD will 'listen' to the dialled digits and reroute the call through a network that will provide the best rates for the destination of the call. The NAD {{is often referred to}} as a <b>dialler,</b> predictive <b>dialler</b> or least cost routing <b>dialler.</b>|$|E
50|$|A dialer {{management}} platform (DMP) {{is used to}} dynamically {{update the}} information held within a least cost routing <b>dialler.</b> The <b>dialler</b> is programmed to call into the DMP periodically, when it does it can supply the service provider with information such as calling patterns.|$|E

50|$|The <b>DIAL</b> {{protocol}} has two components, <b>DIAL</b> Service Discovery and the <b>DIAL</b> REST Service. The <b>DIAL</b> Service Discovery {{enables a}} <b>DIAL</b> client device to discover <b>DIAL</b> servers on its local network segment and obtain {{access to the}} <b>DIAL</b> REST Service on those devices. The <b>DIAL</b> REST Service enables a <b>DIAL</b> client to query, launch and optionally stop applications on a <b>DIAL</b> Server device.|$|R
50|$|Starting January 1, 2012, fixed lines will {{be allowed}} to <b>dial</b> {{directly}} to other provinces/countries, but still using open <b>dialing</b> plan. To <b>dial</b> to other province, <b>dial</b> area code+phone number (0xx-xxxxxx), and to <b>dial</b> to other countries, <b>dial</b> 00+country code+phone number.|$|R

50|$|TRAC {{was used}} by FTP Software in its PC/TCP product as the modem <b>dialler</b> {{scripting}} language.|$|E
50|$|The DMP at {{the same}} time can {{reprogram}} the <b>dialler</b> with new routing tables in order to supply the end user better calling rates.|$|E
50|$|Historically, not all {{push-button}} telephones used DTMF <b>dialing</b> technology. Some manufacturers implemented pulse <b>dialing</b> with push-button keypads {{and even}} Western Electric produced several telephone models with a push-button keypad that could also emit traditional <b>dial</b> pulses. Sometimes the mode was user-selectable with a {{switch on the}} telephone. Pulse-mode push-button keypads typically stored the <b>dialed</b> number sequence in a digit collector register to permit rapid <b>dialing</b> for the user. Some push button pulse <b>dial</b> phones allow for double-speed pulse <b>dialing.</b> These allow even faster pulse <b>dialing</b> in exchanges that recognize double-speed pulse <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>dial</b> of the Grillo phone employs an {{innovative}} {{solution to the}} design challenge of condensing the <b>dial</b> mechanism into a limited space, while still incorporating a finger-stop. The Grillo phone's <b>dial</b> couldn't employ a conventional finger-stop like the type found on conventional <b>dial</b> phones, but instead has a button {{within each of the}} <b>dial's</b> number holes, which, when depressed, pushes a pin through the back of the <b>dial</b> which stops the <b>dial</b> once it's turned to the <b>dial's</b> end position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{international}} <b>dialing</b> prefix is [...] "8~10" [...] - callers <b>dial</b> '8', {{wait for}} a tone, and then <b>dial</b> '10', followed by the country code, area code and number. The long distance <b>dialing</b> prefix is [...] "8" [...] - callers <b>dial</b> '8', {{wait for a}} tone, and then <b>dial</b> the area code and number.|$|R
50|$|Compuspec {{has also}} {{developed}} enhanced {{versions of this}} <b>dialler</b> technology that support voice prompts for customer-specific feature selection, softcall blocking, alternate network access multiple access <b>dialler</b> and anti-fraud detection and prevention. With softcall blocking, calls to certain destinations are automatically limited in duration or prevented. Alternate network access is useful where network reliability requires fall-back to alternative networks. Payphone anti-fraud diallers (typically used in payphones) detect 12 types of phone fraud. New diallers also allow some call destinations to be routed via low cost VoIP carriers.|$|E
50|$|MS-DOS 3.3 was {{supplied}} with all PPCs, along with 'Organizer' - a memory-resident suite of utilities including a card file, diary, calculator and telephone <b>dialler.</b> In addition, the PPC 640 was {{supplied with}} Mirror II, a communications package {{for use with}} the built-in modem.|$|E
50|$|Silent calls, calls {{which remain}} silent when answered, are often due to callers using an {{automated}} <b>dialler</b> to make multiple calls in rapid succession, anticipating that many {{will not be}} answered; if an operator is not {{available at the time}} a call is answered, it will be silent. Silent calls, while not covered by TPS, can be reported to Ofcom.|$|E
40|$|Seventy-five male college {{students}} and twenty$ve human engineering psychologists were given a question-naire presenting diagrams consisting of three concentrically ganged knobs and three <b>dials</b> which they were told the knobs operate. They were asked which <b>dial</b> they thought should be operated by {{each of the three}} knobs. Knobdial associations were ob taiued with <b>dials</b> in horizontal and vertical arrays above, below, to the left OX and {{to the right of the}} knobs, and wiih <b>dials</b> differing in size, shape and distance from the knob axis. Knob-dial associations were found to be influenced by all of thpse factors except <b>dial</b> shape. Associations which were both strong and relatively unrivaled were found for <b>dial</b> position in a horizontal array (except when the array is to the lefi of the knobs), and for <b>dial</b> size. Subjects associated the spatial knob progression, front knob to back knob with tlze spatial <b>dial</b> progression, left <b>dial</b> to right <b>dial</b> and with the <b>dial</b> size progression, smallest <b>dial</b> to largest <b>dial.</b> Strong, but strongly rivaled, associations were found for <b>dial</b> position in a vertical array and for <b>dial</b> distance from the knob axis...|$|R

50|$|International direct <b>dialing</b> (IDD) or {{international}} subscriber <b>dialling</b> (ISD) is placing an international telephone call that is <b>dialed</b> directly by a telephone subscriber, {{rather than by}} an telephone operator. The term international subscriber <b>dialling</b> {{was used in the}} United Kingdom and Australia until the terminology was changed to international direct <b>dialling.</b> Since the late 20th century, most international calls are <b>dialed</b> directly.|$|R
50|$|Around 10% of <b>dialler</b> {{users in}} the UK {{are members of the}} Direct Marketing Association (DMA) which is an {{industry}} interest group for telemarketing in the UK. The DMA code of conduct rules that no more than 5% of the calls made per day should be silent. Many consumer groups consider this too high, and initially campaigned for this to be lowered to 3%.|$|E
50|$|Such a <b>dialler</b> is {{fitted to}} a phone line and routes each call based on the {{services}} the customer has subscribed to. In some cases, it reports to a central management centre (DMP) to enable the carrier to monitor the quality of service and change the services the user enjoys, based on the current service offerings. The dialled telephone numbers are neither recorded nor reported.|$|E
50|$|Compuspec {{developed}} the world's first line-powered <b>dialler</b> or Network Access Device called Zippy in 1992. The diallers enabled carriers {{to roll out}} customer service very flexibly and cheaply. Traditionally, a carrier must invest massive expense in infrastructure with exchange switching equipment. The diallers allowed alternate telecommunications carriers to better compete with incumbent carriers in newly deregulated telephone marketser. Moreover, it accelerated the deregulation process and provided consumers with more choices of carriers.|$|E

50|$|To <b>dial</b> {{from one}} {{dependent}} exchange {{to another one}} first <b>dialled</b> 9 to access the GSC then <b>dialled</b> the local code to the destination exchange. Thus a caller from Machen to Magor would <b>dial</b> 947 before the subscriber's number and a caller from Risca to Cwmbran would <b>dial</b> 93. A caller to a Newport number in the linked numbering scheme would simply <b>dial</b> 9.|$|R
50|$|The Radium <b>Dial</b> Company, {{was one of}} a few {{now defunct}} United States {{companies}} along with the United States Radium Corporation, involved in the painting of clocks, watches and other instrument <b>dials</b> using radioluminescent paint containing radium. The resulting <b>dials</b> are now collectively known as radium <b>dials.</b> The luminous paint used on the <b>dials</b> contained a mixture of phosphorus and radium, a product that the Radium <b>Dial</b> Company named Luna. However, unlike the US Radium Corporation, Radium <b>Dial</b> Company was specifically set up to only paint <b>dials,</b> no other radium processing took place at the premises.|$|R
50|$|Initially, these smart sockets {{had to be}} {{installed}} by qualified technicians. But eventually they were made so small, smart and simple to use {{that they are now}} mailed to customers, which is much cheaper. When plugged in, they configure themselves based on the customer's geographic areas and the services he or she is subscribed for. If the user moves location, the <b>dialler</b> reconfigures itself. Thus the intelligence in the traditional telephone exchange is moved {{to the end of the}} user's phone line.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, if {{a calling}} party {{being at the}} PSTN network dials a called party ENUM number by touch typing the E.164 called party number, the number will be {{translated}} at the ENUM gateway into the corresponding URI. This URI {{will be used for}} looking-up and fetching the NAPTR record obtaining the called party wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (either on IP or on PSTN terminations) - the so-called access information - which the registrant (the called party) has specified by writing his/her choice at the NAPTR record ("Naming Authority Pointer Resource Records" [...] as defined in RFC 3403), such as e-mail addresses, a fax number, a personal website, a VoIP number, mobile telephone numbers, voice mail systems, IP-telephony addresses, web pages, GPS coordinates, call diversions or instant messaging. Alternatively, when the calling party is at the IP side, the User Agent (UA) piece of software of the <b>dialler</b> will allow to dial a E.164 number, but the <b>dialler</b> UA will convert it into a URI, to be used for looking-up at the ENUM gateway DNS and fetch the NAPTR record obtaining the called party wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (again, either on IP or on PSTN terminations).|$|E
50|$|Duncan never {{possessed a}} watch {{after he left}} Aberdeen, but became an expert <b>dialler,</b> and made himself a pocket sun-dial on James Ferguson's model. From his outdoor habits of astronomical {{observation}} he was nicknamed Johnnie Meen, or Moon, and also 'the Nogman', from his queer pronunciation of the word gnomon, which he often used. For many years {{he lived in the}} Vale of Alford, under Benachie, and devoted himself chiefly to astronomy and botany. He was abstemious, his bed, board, washing, and dress not costing him more than four shillings a week.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>dialing</b> on landlines, calls made within {{cities are}} {{considered}} local calls {{and you just}} <b>dial</b> the local number. Calls to other cities (e.g. Karachi to Lahore) are considered long distance calls, e.g., when <b>dialing</b> to Lahore from Karachi you have to <b>dial</b> the code for Lahore then followed {{by the number of}} the destination, therefore you <b>dial</b> 042-XXXX-XXXX. For international calls, you <b>dial</b> [...] "00" [...] followed by the country code, e.g., for calls to the UK from Pakistan you <b>dial</b> 00 - 44 - XXXXXX.|$|R
50|$|Subscriber trunk <b>dialling</b> (STD, {{also known}} as {{subscriber}} toll <b>dialling)</b> is a telephone system allowing subscribers to <b>dial</b> trunk calls without operator assistance. The term was introduced when it first became possible for long-distance calls to be <b>dialled</b> directly, and is now rarely used where calls to any destination can be <b>dialled.</b>|$|R
50|$|Notice, {{that when}} using older non-digital {{extensions}} for the inter-city, international calls {{as well as}} the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, {{it may be necessary to}} wait for a continuous <b>dial</b> tone after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital <b>dial</b> phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kiev, one needs to <b>dial</b> 0, wait for a <b>dial</b> tone and then <b>dial</b> 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then <b>dial</b> the local number in that city. Similarly, when calling Vancouver, Canada, one needs to <b>dial</b> 0, wait for the <b>dial</b> tone, <b>dial</b> another 0 to access international line, then <b>dial</b> 1 (for Canada and the USA), followed by 778 (one of the area codes for British Columbia), followed by the 7-digit local number.|$|R

50|$|The {{video is}} inter cut with {{particularly}} striking shots; there are white shirted twins who watch the unfolding events {{from the bar}} throughout, and the barman and barmaid who continually flirt across the bar. During the choral middle eight, a stroked black cat, is first seen being stroked, and is seen walking along the bar {{and then when the}} camera cuts away, a Frenchman's closer inspection while on an old fashioned phone, looks though his monacle to see that the black cat has turned white. Additionally, while he is on the phone, a lizard is seen moving across the <b>dialler.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{associated}} <b>dial</b> plan {{requires that}} all numbers, even for local calls, must be <b>dialed</b> with the assigned NDC, {{in contrast to}} previous plans. When <b>dialing</b> from within the country, a prefix 0 must be <b>dialed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sundials are {{sometimes}} combined into multiple <b>dials.</b> If {{two or more}} <b>dials</b> that operate on different principles — say, such as an analemmatic <b>dial</b> and a horizontal or vertical <b>dial</b> — are combined, the resulting multiple <b>dial</b> becomes self-aligning, most of the time. Both <b>dials</b> need to output both time and declination. In other words, the direction of true North need not be determined; the <b>dials</b> are oriented correctly when they read {{the same time and}} declination. However, the most common forms combine <b>dials</b> are based on the same principle and the analemmatic does not normally output the declination of the sun, thus are not self-aligning.|$|R
50|$|Land line {{phone numbers}} in Kenya follow the format Area Code + Phone Number.To <b>dial</b> a number within an Area and/or City, only the Phone Number {{needs to be}} <b>dialled.</b> When <b>dialling</b> from a {{different}} Area/City, the telephone number is <b>dialled</b> in the format 0 + Area Code + Phone Number. When <b>dialling</b> from overseas, the 0 is omitted.|$|R
