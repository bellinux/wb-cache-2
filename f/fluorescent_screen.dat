5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen.</b> Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E
25|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a technique}} for {{the determination of the}} surface structure of single-crystalline materials by bombardment with a collimated beam of low energy electrons (20–200 eV) and observation of diffracted electrons as spots on a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s LEED {{experienced}} a renaissance as ultra high vacuum became widely available and the post acceleration detection method was introduced.

40|$|The beam {{diagnostic}} system for ELETTRA includes some destructive monitors: <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screens</b> and scrapers. In this paper {{a description of}} the mechanical and electronic parts of the destructive monitors is given. There are altogether 19 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screens</b> placed along the Transfer Line and the Storage Ring. Different designs have been adopted ue to the more stringent requirements for the Storage Ring. The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screens</b> have shown to be reliable and accurate instruments to transfer the beam from the linac to the storage ring and to injection conditions. One scraper is located in the Transfer Line dispersive region and il is used for energy spread measurement and for linac energy optimisation.

25|$|The idea of {{an image}} tube was first {{proposed}} by G. Holst and H. De Boer (Netherlands) in 1928 , but early attempts to create one were not successful. It was not until 1934 that Holst, working for Philips, created the first successful infrared converter tube. This tube consisted of a photocathode in proximity to a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen.</b> Using a simple lens, an image {{was focused on the}} photocathode and a potential difference of several thousand volts was maintained across the tube, causing electrons dislodged from the photocathode by photons to strike the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen.</b> This caused the screen to light up with the image of the object focused onto the screen, however the image was non-inverting. With this image converter type tube, it was possible to view infrared light in real time, for the first time.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screens</b> (e. g. YAG screens) and Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) screens for beam profile {{monitors}} {{provides a}} simple and widely used way to obtain detailed two dimensional intensity maps. What makes this possible is the availability of relatively inexpensive CCD cameras. For high precision measurements many possible error contributions {{need to be considered}} {{that have to do with}} properties of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screens</b> and of the CCDs. Saturation effects, reflections within and outside the screen, non-linearities, radiation damage, etc are often mentioned. Here we concentrate on an error source less commonly described, namely erroneous baseline subtraction, which is particularly important when fitting projected images. We show computer simulations as well as measurement results having remarkable sensitivity of the fitted profile widths to even partial suppression of the profile baseline data, which often arises from large pixel-to-pixel variations at low intensity levels. Such inadvertent baseline data suppression is very easy to miss as it is usually not obvious when inspecting projected profiles. In this report we illustrate this effect and discuss possible algorithms to automate the detection of this problem as well as some possible corrective measures...|$|R

25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM, also sometimes conventional transmission {{electron microscopy}} or CTEM) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from {{the interaction of the}} electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen,</b> a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a charge-coupled device.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{image intensifiers}} no longer use a {{separate}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen.</b> Instead, a caesium iodide phosphor is deposited {{directly on the}} photocathode of the intensifier tube. On a typical general purpose system, the output image is approximately 105 times brighter than the input image. This brightness gain comprises a flux gain (amplification of photon number) and minification gain (concentration of photons from a large input screen onto a small output screen) each of approximately 100. This level of gain is sufficient that quantum noise, due to {{the limited number of}} X-ray photons, is a significant factor limiting image quality.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy is an imaging {{technique}} commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} internal structures of a patient {{through the use of}} a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen,</b> between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders).|$|E

It is shown that a recently published argument which claims that such collapses can account for the emergence of determinate outcomes of certain experiments involving <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screens</b> is inadequate, since it is based on an unreasonable speculation about the treatment ofphotons in the GRW theory.

25|$|At Rutherford's behest, Geiger and Marsden {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments where they pointed a beam of alpha particles at a thin foil of metal and measured the scattering pattern by using a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen.</b> They spotted alpha particles bouncing off the metal foil in all directions, some right back at the source. This should have been impossible according to Thomson's model; the alpha particles should have all gone straight through. Obviously, those particles had encountered an electrostatic force far greater than Thomson's model suggested they would, which in turn implied that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a much tinier volume than Thomson imagined.|$|E
25|$|The shown {{images are}} {{examples}} of LEED diffraction patterns. The difference between image 1 and 2 is remarkable; where image 1 is of a clean (100) platinum-rhodium single crystal, and image 2 of the same crystal with CO adsorbed on the surface. The original surface order of the clean crystal is clearly visible in image 1, it shows a C(1x1) structure; the extra spots in image 2 are caused by the CO {{on the surface and}} are an example of a C(2x2) structure. The diffraction spots are generated by acceleration of elastically scattered electrons onto a hemispherical <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen,</b> a retarding field analyzer.

He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.|$|E

In addition, the primary radiation can be scattered coherently (Rayleigh scattering) and incoherently (Compton scattering) which will degrade the image resolution. Scattered radiation produced in Gd 2 O 2 Si:Tb intensifying screens was simulated by using a Monte Carlo radiation transport code – the EGS 4 (Electron- Gamma Shower), which is a general purpose package for Monte Carlo simulation of the coupled transport of electrons and photons.

The size of the Ewald's sphere and hence the number of diffraction spots on the screen is controlled by the incident electron energy. From the knowledge of the reciprocal lattice models for the real space lattice can be constructed and the surface can be characterized at least qualitatively in terms of the surface periodicity and the point group.

25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>screen</b> and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
