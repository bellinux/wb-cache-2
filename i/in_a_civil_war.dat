5|$|Britain's {{remaining}} {{colonies in}} Africa, except for self-governing Southern Rhodesia, were all granted independence by 1968. British {{withdrawal from the}} southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year Mau Mau Uprising. In Rhodesia, the 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the white minority resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> that lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|The Kuomintang (KMT) {{party in}} China {{launched}} a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> against its former Chinese Communist Party allies and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China {{as the first}} step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in Kyrat, a fictional Himalayan country. The main story follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, as he is caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> {{involving}} Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using {{a wide array of}} weapons. The game features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a branching storyline. The game also features a map editor, a co-operative multiplayer mode, and an asymmetrical competitive multiplayer mode.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between humanitarian aid and peace prospects, {{and the differences}} between this {{in the case of}} <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> and <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> is that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> there is <b>a</b> greater need for a specific case approach because proxy <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> are much more complicated. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> <b>a</b> peaceful situation has to been agreed on on the local level and humanitarian aid could contribute to peace prospects, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> humanitarian aid affects peace prospects to a lesser degree because of the multi-layered nature of this type of conflict where on all layers of the proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> peace has to be agreed on. Moreover, aid providers, donors, and other (foreign) involved actors have more influence on <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> and therefore humanitarian aid could adversely affect peace prospects...|$|R

5|$|In 1531, the ikki {{control of}} Kaga was of such {{dominance}} that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war,</b> {{often called the}} Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, {{came to power in}} the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were backed by the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was backed by many of the smaller temples and emerged victorious from the conflict when he brought in an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province. Togashi Taneyasu was exiled, as were the other opposition leaders, and the position of shugo abolished.|$|E

This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend, Rosemary, would not work.

Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what people tell him but to rely on himself to face his problems.|$|E
5|$|A {{council of}} the army convened in Babylon {{immediately}} after Alexander's death, naming PhilipIII as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to {{no effect on the}} outcome of the 321BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent (since PhilipIII was considered mentally unstable), in effect bypassing the {{council of the}} army as well.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in April, Atlanta was {{decommissioned}} in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 {{and placed}} in reserve at League Island. She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, a lawyer who had received an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President of Haiti, who was embroiled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war.</b> Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.|$|E
5|$|Hostilities between Rome and Parthia were renewed when Osroes I of Parthia (r. c.109–128AD) deposed the Armenian king Tiridates and {{replaced}} him with Axidares, son of Pacorus II, without consulting Rome. The Roman emperor Trajan (r.98–117AD) had the next Parthian nominee for the throne, Parthamasiris, killed in 114AD, instead making Armenia a Roman province. His forces, led by Lusius Quietus, also captured Nisibis; its occupation {{was essential to}} securing all the major routes across the northern Mesopotamian plain. The following year, Trajan invaded Mesopotamia and met little resistance from only Meharaspes of Adiabene, since Osroes was engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> to the east with Vologases III of Parthia. Trajan spent the winter of 115–116 at Antioch, but resumed his campaign in the spring. Marching down the Euphrates, he captured Dura-Europos, the capital Ctesiphon and Seleucia, and even subjugated Characene, where he watched ships depart to India from the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{signed a}} {{military}} pact with Egypt just before Israel launched {{a preemptive strike}} on Egypt to begin the Six-Day War in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war. The Arab states were defeated and Jordan {{lost control of the}} West Bank to Israel. The War of Attrition with Israel followed, which included the 1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on the Jordanian border with the West Bank. Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the fedayeen) within Jordan from other Arab countries. The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to Jordan's rule of law. In September 1970, the Jordanian army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> that became known as Black September.|$|E

5|$|Kantakouzenos {{responded by}} having himself {{declared}} emperor at Didymoteicho in October 1341, while his opponents followed with the coronation of John V in November. The two coronations finalized the split, and ushered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> that would embroil the Byzantine Empire {{and all of}} its neighbours until 1347 with Kantakouzenos's victory. In its course, it would devastate the remaining imperial possessions, and create a deep rift in Byzantine society: the aristocracy and the propertied classes generally supported Kantakouzenos, while the lower and middle classes, primarily urban, as well as the merchants and sailors, supported Apokaukos and the regency. This gave the dynastic dispute and civil war strong social overtones: during the war, the excessive wealth and perceived indifference of Kantakouzenos and the aristocracy towards the common people became a standard fixture of Apokaukos's propaganda. In addition, the conflict acquired religious significance as well: the Hesychast controversy divided the pious Byzantines, and, despite some important exceptions, the supporters of Hesychasm also supported Kantakouzenos.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Venizelists {{during the}} battle has been {{intensely}} contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units. Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report {{that he had been}} involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war.</b> The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next day, when they capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists were led to prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens. Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: Pavlos Karolidis, a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow citizens and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.|$|E
5|$|Rebellions {{can occur}} if {{the loyalty of}} a {{particular}} province falls too low, with a rebel army appearing in the province to attempt to assume control from the owners. Civil wars may also take place if several generals commanding large armies have sufficiently low loyalty. In {{the event of a}} civil war, the player is given the choice to back either the current rulers or the rebels. It had been planned to allow other factions who had established a prior claim to the throne by marriage to princesses to join <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> to claim the throne for themselves; however, this was never implemented. Naval warfare is carried out upon the campaign map, where ships can be built and organised into fleets. These fleets can be used to control the game's sea regions and form sea lanes, allowing trade and troop movement between provinces that have constructed a port. Fleets can engage in sea battles with foreign fleets, although unlike land battles these are resolved by the computer. Religion plays an important aspect in Medieval: Total War, with religious differences between the Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim factions affecting diplomacy and population loyalty. Catholic factions must also respond to the wishes of the Papal States; factions gain favour by refraining from hostilities with other Catholic nations and responding to Crusades, else they run the risk of excommunication. The option to launch a holy war {{in the form of a}} Crusade or Jihad is open to both Catholic and Muslim factions.|$|E

5|$|When {{news of the}} RPF {{offensive}} broke, Habyarimana requested {{assistance from}} France in fighting the invasion. The French president's son, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, {{was head of the}} government's Africa Cell, and promised to send troops. On the night of 4 October, the Rwandan government staged a fake RPF attack on Kigali with gunfire and explosions around the city, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger. The deception worked, and 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, double the number initially pledged. The French operation was code-named Noroît, and its official purpose was to protect French nationals. In reality, the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime, and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and Kigali International Airport. In addition to the French, Belgium and Zaire sent troops to Kigali in early October. The Belgian presence was short-lived, its troops withdrawing within two weeks because of laws preventing the army from intervening <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war.</b> Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko's contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP). Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF, but their discipline was poor. The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes, prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival.|$|E
