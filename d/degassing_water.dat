How do these bubbles form, and what is their gas composition? In this paper, the growth dynamics of nucleating bubbles around laser-irradiated, water-immersed Au plasmonic nanoparticles are studied to determine the exact origin of the occurrence and growth of these bubbles. The microbubbles' contact angle, footprint diameter, and radius of curvature were measured in air-equilibrated <b>water</b> (AEW) and <b>degassed</b> <b>water</b> (DGW) with fast imaging. Our experimental data reveals that the growth dynamics can be divided into two regimes: an initial bubble nucleation phase (regime I, < 10 ms) and, subsequently a bubble growth phase (regime II). The explosive growth in regime I is identical for AEW and DGW due to the vaporization of water. However, the slower growth in regime II is distinctly different for AEW and DGW, which is attributed to the uptake of dissolved gas expelled from the water around the hot nanoparticle. Our scaling analysis reveals that the bubble radius scales with time as R(t) alpha t(1 / 6) for both AEW and DGW in the initial regime I, whereas in the later regime II it scales as R(t) alpha t(1 / 3) for AEW and is constant for perfectly <b>degassed.</b> <b>water.</b> These scaling relations are consistent with the experiments...|$|R

Controlled cavitation might be used to optimise HIFU treatments, but such control requires a greater understanding of its role in lesion formation, and the provision of appropriate techniques to monitor cavitation in tissue. During HIFU exposure various forms of cavitation can occur: acoustic cavitation (both non-inertial and inertial), and bubble formation due to two thermally-driven effects (the vaporisation of liquid into vapour, and the exsolution of formerly dissolved permanent gas out of the liquid and into gas spaces). Different forms of cavitation gives rise to characteristic signals that can be monitored during HIFU. Furthermore, the character of the signal can change depending on the stage of the cavitation in question (nucleation, established cavitation, population effects etc.).

An artificially prepared heterogeneous sample composed of coarse quartz sand (representing pathways of preferential flow) and fine porous ceramic (representing soil matrix) was investigated. The sample was 34. 5 mm high and 29. 0 mm in diameter. Sequences of neutron radiography images (RI) of pixel size 0. 045 × 0. 045 mm were taken at one angle during particular transient {{phases of the}} flow process. During quasi-steady state flow stages of the experiment radiography images were acquired in range of angles 0 - 180 ° in 0. 9 ° step and. 3 D neutron tomograms (TI) were then developed. Using the data a quantitative evaluation of the spatial and temporal distribution of water content within the sample was conducted. For every RI and TI {{the amount of water}} in particular pixels and voxels, respectively, was calculated by subtracting the image of dry sample. The accuracy of the water content estimates derived from the images was checked by comparing them to the corresponding gravimetrically determined water content data. Heavy water with equilibrium air saturation was introduced into the sample during two recurrent infiltrations. Thirty five hours later, during second infiltration, the inflow was switched to <b>degassed</b> heavy <b>water</b> in order to remove residual air present in the sample. During the first twelve hours of first infiltration run flow rate through the sample decreased from 3. 7 cm/hour to 1. 0 cm/hour {{at the end of the}} “steady state flow” stage.

Careful flushing of the catheter with <b>degassed</b> <b>water</b> or saline consid-erably improves the performance of these systems. The operating temperature, number of cathe-ter uses, and average transmural pressure difference do not have a significant effect. The error due to catheter distortion in commonly used left ventricular performance indices (end diastolic pressure, peak systolic pressure, maximum dp/dt and Vma,) was assessed. On the basis of these results, it is shown that the natural frequency of the catheter system must be greater than 40 Hz to produce results accurate to 10 %. The experimental data were used to develop a semi-empirical model for the catheter transducer system. This model was used in the design of an analog compensator to further improve the dynamic {{characteristics of}} the catheter transducer system. The compensator requires only two parameter settings, catheter natural frequency and damping ratio...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound {{contrast}} agents (UCAs) {{are tiny}} microbubbles used clinically {{to enhance the}} contrast of B-mode images. Recently, UCAs have been combined with therapeutic ultrasound techniques to increase their effectiveness. These therapeutic techniques often require high concentrations of UCAs at varying pressure amplitudes, which {{increases the risk of}} adverse bioeffects. Therefore, the quantification of UCA concentration at a target location inside the body is necessary {{to reduce the risk of}} unwanted bioeffects and to determine the in vivo concentration of UCAs as a result of their injection. In this work, a method for extracting estimates of UCA concentration using backscatter coefficients (BSCs) was developed and verified in vitro. Experiments to verify the method were performed with both UCAs and glass bead microspheres in <b>degassed</b> <b>water</b> using a beaker setup and a flow system setup. Experimentally obtained estimates of the BSC were fit to ultrasound scattering models to extract concentration estimates of either the UCAs or the glass beads. The fitting was accomplished with a Levenberg-Marquardt regression algorithm, which resulted in UCA concentration and size estimates. In order to verify the estimates of UCA concentration, a sample of the UCA and <b>degassed</b> <b>water</b> mixture was extracted after the ultrasonic data were acquired, and the sample was inserted into a hemacytometer. Concentration estimates with the hemacytometer were acquired by counting the number of UCAs in a known volume of the mixture. Initial experiments with the flow system and UCAs in porcine whole blood were also conducted. The experimental BSCs of the blood by itself were compared to a calculated theoretical BSC for blood, and the experimental BSCs of the UCAs in blood were compared to experimental BSC estimates of UCAs in water. A summary of the results is as follows. First, the estimated concentration of glass beads was within 4 % of the concentration of beads flowing through the experimental flow chamber. Next, an optimal peak rarefactional pressure (PRP) amplitude range of 140 - 390 kPa was determined for extracting UCA concentration estimates within one standard deviation of the hemacytometer based estimates and with the UCA scattering model that was used. Finally, future investigation must focus on improving the quantification technique with UCAs in blood to be able to extract accurate concentration estimates of UCAs in blood...|$|R
