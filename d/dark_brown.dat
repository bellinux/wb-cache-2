5|$|The {{juvenile}} pied butcherbird has <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> {{instead of}} black plumage, lacks the pale collar {{and has a}} cream to buff lores, chin, and upper throat, becoming more brown on the lower throat and breast. Its underparts are off-white to cream. The bill is <b>dark</b> <b>brown.</b> In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> throat. Its bill is blue-grey with a <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> or blackish tip.|$|E
5|$|The buds are {{produced}} in opposite pairs, ovoid (approximately oval in shape) and pointed, with the bud scales (the modified leaves that enclose {{and protect the}} bud) green, edged in <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> and with <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> tips, 0.5–1cm (0.2-0.4in). When the leaves are shed they leave horseshoe shaped marks called leaf scars on the stem.|$|E
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is <b>dark</b> <b>brown.</b> The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
50|$|The {{forewings}} and hindwings {{are very}} pale greyish brown. The forewings are crossed by three waved <b>darker</b> <b>brown</b> {{lines from the}} costal to the inner margin. The hindwings are crossed by two fine waved <b>darker</b> <b>brown</b> lines.|$|R

5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely <b>dark</b> <b>brown.</b> The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> palps with white hairs, and <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> abdomens with white spots on the upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium trichloride is a {{well-known}} compound, existing in a black α-form and a <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> β-form: the trihydrate is red. Of the known trihalides, trifluoride is <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> and decomposes above 650°C, tetrabromide is dark-brown and decomposes above 400°C, and triiodide is black. Of the dihalides, difluoride is not known, dichloride is brown, dibromide is black, and diiodide is blue. The only known oxyhalide is the pale green ruthenium(VI) oxyfluoride, RuOF4.|$|E
5|$|Blackbuck bear a close {{resemblance}} to gazelles, and are distinguished mainly {{by the fact}} that while gazelles are brown in the dorsal parts, blackbuck develop a <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> or black colour in these parts.|$|E
5|$|Eleven main colours are {{recognised}} by {{the breed}} association (most including many different shades): light grey, grey, white, emsket (dusky bluish-grey), musket (light greyish-brown), shaela (dark steely-grey), black, fawn, moorit (reddish brown), mioget (honey-toned, yellowish-brown), and <b>dark</b> <b>brown.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 4 mm for males and 5 mm for females. The forewings are grey-brown with a broad, contrasting <b>darker</b> <b>brown</b> longitudinal stripe from the base to the apex. The hindwings of the males are white with <b>darker</b> <b>brown</b> dorsal and costal streaks in the basal half. The female hindwings are white, without darker scales.|$|R
5|$|Hindfoot {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the hallux (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) from the tip and then whitish at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> tuft.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian hamster on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to <b>dark</b> <b>brown,</b> or {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white.|$|E
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E
50|$|The tadpoles are {{brown and}} have some <b>darker</b> <b>brown</b> {{markings}} on the tail.|$|R
50|$|The fore- and hindwings are pale greyish-brown, each crossed by fine <b>darker</b> <b>brown</b> lines.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are <b>dark</b> grey <b>brown.</b> The tips of {{the scales}} in the distal two-thirds of the wings are pale grey and slightly grey in the basal one-third of the wing. The hindwings are <b>darker</b> <b>brown</b> than the forewings.|$|R
5|$|The {{upper parts}} are {{generally}} light greyish brown with <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> centres to the feathers, giving {{the appearance of}} stripes. These stripes are marked {{on the head and}} nape, less distinct on the rump and almost absent from the upper tail coverts. The underparts are whitish with faint streaks on the belly. The feathers of the upper breast and throat are long and pointed, giving the head a spiky appearance. The wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips. The bill is short, with a sharp pointed appearance, dark blue-grey grading to a grey-black at the tip and around the nostrils. Legs and feet are blue-grey with black claws. The bare skin around the eye is <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> and the iris a dark black-brown.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus bernardii {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> spore print. The spores are smooth, broadly elliptical, and have dimensions of 6–7.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring 14–25 by 4–7μm; the sterigmata are 4–5μm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are broadly club-shaped to cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 17–30 by 4–8μm.|$|E
5|$|Also {{found on}} {{calcareous}} (chalky) soils, Rubroboletus satanas is larger {{and has a}} pale cap, and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of S.luridus. Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising or cutting. It has a more globular overall shape, and young mushrooms carry a smell of decay. The edible Neoboletus luridiformis can be distinguished from S.luridus by its <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> cap; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers. In North America, it can {{be confused with the}} poisonous Rubroboletus pulcherrimus, which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores. Initially collected in Michigan under oak, Boletus vinaceobasis resembles S.luridus but has shorter spores and its cystidia are <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> in Melzer's reagent. Boletus species that share a similar appearance with S.luridus but lack reticulation in their stems include B.subvelutipes (found in North America and Asia) and B.hypocarycinus (United States).|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to <b>dark</b> <b>brown.</b> They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of the}} head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
