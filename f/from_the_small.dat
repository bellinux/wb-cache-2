5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E

5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> loft in the high choir of the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other movements of the Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat major version of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform {{the first version of}} his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E

5|$|By 1916, most of Western Armenia was {{occupied}} by the Russian Empire {{as part of the}} Caucasian Campaign of World War I. In parts of the occupied areas, especially around Van, an Armenian autonomy was briefly set up. The Russian army left the region due to the Revolution of 1917. The Ottoman Empire quickly regained the territories <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> number of irregular Armenian units. In the Caucasus, the Special Transcaucasian Committee was set up after the February Revolution.|$|E
5|$|More {{recently}} still, Trollope {{scholars have}} looked upon it with increasing favour, describing it {{as a powerful}} work that has suffered undeserved neglect. Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, {{supported in part by}} the similarity of passages from The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Small</b> House at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that some aspects of her portrayal are based on the novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E

5|$|The British Museum {{announced}} in January 2010 that two inscribed clay fragments, {{which had been}} in the Museum's collection since 1881, had been identified as part of a cuneiform tablet that was inscribed with the same text as the Cyrus Cylinder. The fragments had come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> site of Dailem near Babylon and the identification was made by Professor Wilfred Lambert, formerly of the University of Birmingham, and Irving Finkel, curator in charge of the Museum's Department of the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|According to Francis Buchanan, 15,000 of them {{returned}} to Mangalore and its environs, whilst 10,000 of them migrated to Malabar. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1883) mentions that 15,000 persons returned, of whom 12,000 were from South Canara and 3,000 from North Canara. According to the Mangalorean Catholic genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group of survivors who {{returned to}} South Canara. Soon {{after the death of}} Tipu, a detachment from the Bombay army under Lieutenant-Colonel Wiseman took possession of Mangalore on 4 June 1799, as well as the entire province of Canara, {{with the exception of the}} fortress of Jamalabad.|$|E

5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E
5|$|Brooks' first {{venture into}} wrestling was {{a stint in}} a {{backyard}} wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation with his friends and brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s. He first started using the ring name CM Punk when he was put into a tag team named The Chick Magnets with CM Venom after another performer skipped out on the card. Unlike his friends, Punk genuinely {{wanted to be a}} wrestler and saw it as more than simple fun. When the promotion started taking off, doing shows out of a warehouse in Mokena, Illinois, Punk found out that his brother Mike had embezzled thousands of dollars <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> company, causing them to become estranged. They have not spoken since.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{declaration}} from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee {{that neither the}} harbour nor its ships {{would be used for}} military purposes, the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping in the port must nevertheless be neutralised. The Germans had pre-emptively scuttled a blockship in the port's entrance channel, with the intention of preventing Goliath and the other heavy British warships from entering the harbour to shell the undefended city. With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in the port, thus denying its use to the Germans as well. Command of the assault was given to Commander Ritchie as the second most senior officer present, and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats, Dupleix and Helmuth, to carry his raiding parties.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Wright {{was elected}} to his old seat in Congress as a Democrat, but with support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Greenback movement. In 1878, the {{situation}} was reversed: Wright ran as a Greenbacker, but was reelected with support by Democrats. He attracted attention in Congress with his proposal to amend the Homestead Act of 1862 to establish government loans to would-be settlers of the West, {{making it easier for}} landless Easterners to claim homesteads there. Congress was, on the whole, not receptive to Wright's proposal. Wright proposed it again in 1879 and emphasized the conservatism of his proposal, that it was a loan secured by the homestead, not a gift from the state; even so, the bill went down to overwhelming defeat. Despite his failure, Wright, like Weaver, had raised his profile as a potential presidential nominee by attempting to advance Greenback ideas in Congress.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, the Royal Navy's {{response}} to the French campaign was heavily criticised: both fleets assigned to intercept the invasion fleet had failed, the only losses inflicted on the French coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Cork squadron or Pellew's independent frigates. White was rewarded for his service on shore with the title Baron Bantry. At sea, Colpoys was replaced {{in command of the}} blockade of Brest by Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, and extensive deployments to the Bay of Biscay were made in February and March to prevent any further French operations. In addition, reinforcements were also sent to the fleet off Cadiz under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, who had won the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February. These extended deployments were unpopular with the regular seamen and in April the Spithead Mutiny broke out, paralysing the Channel Fleet. The French, still recovering from their losses in the winter campaign, were unable to respond.|$|E
5|$|In the North, the Wons Position {{formed a}} {{bridgehead}} {{at the eastern}} end of the Enclosure Dike; it had a long perimeter of about nine kilometres to envelop enough land to receive a large number of retreating troops without making them too vulnerable to air attack. On 12 May units with a combined strength of only two battalions were still present, so the line was weakly held. This was exploited by the first German unit to arrive, the single bicycle battalion of 1. Kavalleriedivision. At noon it quickly penetrated the line in a concentrated attack, forcing the defenders to withdraw to the Enclosure Dike. For some the German advance cut off their escape route by land; they sailed away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> port of Makkum, taking the last remaining vessels on the eastern side of Lake IJssel. This denied the Germans any craft for a crossing attempt, which plan was now abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{forces had}} landed on Bougainville in early 1942, {{capturing}} it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> force of Australians garrisoning the island. They had subsequently developed several airbases on the island, {{using it to}} conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area. These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea; throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|On November26, the Government of Mexico {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for Baja California Sur between Todos los Santos and Los Barriles; this was discontinued less than 24hours later. The State Council of Civil Protection of Baja California Sur opened four shelters in both Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo; school officials cancelled classes for November27. In La Paz, the Federal Electricity Commission deployed 96trucks to handle potential power outages. On November27, {{a tropical storm}} warning was raised for mainland Mexico between Altata and San Blas {{as well as the}} Islas Marías; the warning was discontinued the following day as Sandra rapidly dissipated. Alerts were raised across portions of Sinaloa and Nayarit in advance of the hurricane. The port of Mazatlán suspended operations on November28 and public shelters were opened in the city. Water pumps, generators, and relief crews were mobilized at the port. About 180people <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> community of Boca Camichin, Nayarit, evacuated inland.
