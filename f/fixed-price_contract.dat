These recommendations were to comply with procurement regulations by identifying recurring tasks that were susceptible to <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracting,</b> preparing definitive statements of work that would permit <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracting,</b> and awarding <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracts.</b> Procurement recognized the benefits of <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracting</b> and agreed to work closely with the EIA to identify work susceptible to <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracting.</b> These efforts resulted in the award of two labor hour contracts but no firm-fixed-price contracts.

The audit objective was to determine what progress Procurement and EIA have made in utilizing firm-fixed-price contracts.

25|$|The Lockheed P-3 Orion, a {{turboprop}} ASW aircraft, {{has been}} in service with the United States Navy since 1962. In the 1980s, the Navy began studies for a P-3 replacement, the range and endurance of which were reduced due to increasing weight and airframe fatigue life limitations. The specification required a new aircraft to have reduced operating and support costs. In 1989, the Navy awarded Lockheed a <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contract</b> to develop the P-7, but this was canceled the following year. A second competition for a replacement began in 2000. Lockheed Martin submitted the Orion 21, an updated new-build version of the P-3. Boeing's proposal was based on its 737-800 airliner. BAE Systems offered a new-build version of the Nimrod MRA4, a British jet-powered maritime patrol aircraft. BAE withdrew from the competition in October 2002, recognizing that without a production partner based in the United States, the bid was politically unrealistic.

40|$|In {{a variety}} of {{industries}} ranging from agriculture to electronics and oil, procurement takes place through a combination of bilateral <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracts</b> and open market trading among supply chain participants, which allows them to improve supply chain performance by utilizing new demand and cost information. The strategic behavior of the participants in these markets interacts with the way <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracts</b> are formulated and significantly affects supply chain efficiency. In this paper, we develop a strategic model that allows endogenous price formation in an industrial spot market where supply chain participants have private information. Utilizing the model, we analyze the equilibrium of a dynamic game between a single supplier and multiple manufacturers who first contract with the supplier at a fixed price and then trade on a spot market. We study how such trading affects supply chain performance and show that it does not eliminate <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracting</b> even though the fixed price is determined under inferior information. We find that it reduces prices, increases the quantities produced, and improves supply chain profits and consumer surplus. However, depending on the information structure of the supply chain, spot trading may make either the supplier or the manufacturers worse off. Our results show how the informational regime affects the profitability of supply chain participants and the allocation of quantities between the procurement venues. We show that beyond a threshold level, the effect of increasing supply uncertainty, or decreasing either the demand uncertainty or the information asymmetry among the manufacturers, is to increase the percentage procured on the spot market as well as the overall quantity procured and sold, and to decrease prices. As the number of manufacturers increases, procurement shifts from <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracting</b> to spot trading and in the limit, the supply chain is both fully coordinated and informationally efficient. We also show that in many cases, the supplier may gain strategic advantage by sharing some of her cost information with the manufacturers. spot trading, demand and cost information, procurement and supply chain, <b>fixed-price</b> <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
