5|$|Tyrone {{were one}} of the favourites for the 2002 All-Ireland, having won their first National Football League in the spring, but ended up losing a {{qualifying}} match to Sligo, even though Canavan scored six points on the day. That particular defeat stunned <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> he considered retiring Inter County football.|$|E
5|$|In this way, much to Metternich's {{disappointment}} and to Franz Josef's embarrassment, Austria began the Second Italian War of Independence against the combined forces of Piedmont-Sardinia and its ally France. Though Metternich {{was able to}} secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg, who had helped <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in 1848, involvement in the war itself was now beyond his capacity. Even a special task given him by Franz Josef in June 1859—to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef's death—was now too taxing. Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859, aged 86, and the last great figure of his generation. Almost everyone of note in Vienna came to pay tribute; in the foreign press his death went virtually unnoticed.|$|E
60|$|He {{shut the}} door. In the gallery {{he was as}} elate as a king. He had never been engaged in an {{adventure}} he liked so well, for no adventure had ever invested <b>him</b> with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> importance or inspired <b>him</b> with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> interest.|$|R

5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner {{proved to}} be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> they burned him in effigy and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E
5|$|Skelton was a Freemason, {{a member}} of Vincennes Lodge No. 1, in Indiana. He also was {{a member of}} both the Scottish and York Rite. He was a {{recipient}} of the Gold Medal of the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, for Distinguished Service in the Arts and Sciences. On September 24, 1969, he received the honorary 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite and was a Gourgas Medal recipient in 1995. Skelton became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a five dollar bill and told him to keep the change. The young Skelton asked his benefactor why he had given <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money; the man explained that he was a Mason and Masons are taught to give. Skelton decided to become one also when he was grown. He was also member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, as well as a Shriner in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get {{a place in the}} dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

25|$|His parents {{divorced}} {{when he was}} 11 years old. The abuse and situation at home affected <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he felt the urge to kill people and run away. To comfort himself, he drew pictures and wrote poetry and songs.|$|E
25|$|Goddard was {{appointed}} captain of South Africa on its five-month tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1963–64. His employer {{was unable to}} give <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> leave, and he was only able to tour because the cricket-loving director of a large Durban store offered him a public relations position and time off to play cricket.|$|E
25|$|Gunnhild, the Queen, loved <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{that she}} held {{there was not}} his equal within the guard, either in talking or in {{anything}} else.

Laker retired from bowling in one match, missed the next due to sunstroke and the Fourth Test because of arthritis, but played in the Fifth Test despite having a sore throat and high temperature.|$|E
25|$|The bank's {{high level}} contact in Tehran was general Albert Houtum-Schindler who was, like Reuter, a British subject of German origin. Schindler lived in Persia {{for many years}} and was the most {{informed}} member of the European community in Persia at the time. Henry Drummond Wolff liked <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the foreign office to engage him as a member of Legation staff. Reuter employed him instead.Schindler and Rabino were instrumental in increasing the Bank's reputation.|$|E
25|$|Ulrich Wessel (9 January 1946 – 24 April 1975) {{was the son}} of a rich Hamburg businessman. Wessel was {{described}} as a dandy, and he was a millionaire by inheritance. He was involved with the SPK and took part in the West German embassy siege in Stockholm. He died during the siege when the TNT was accidentally exploded; the force of the explosion startled <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he dropped a grenade he was holding and it exploded on him. He died soon afterwards.|$|E

25|$|When their colonel {{reached the}} remains of their company, this display of courage and loyalty {{impressed}} <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that Lamarck was promoted to officer on the spot. However, {{when one of his}} comrades playfully lifted him by the head, he sustained an inflammation in the lymphatic glands of the neck, and he was sent to Paris to receive treatment. He underwent a complicated operation, and continued his treatment for a year. He was awarded a commission and settled at his post in Monaco. It was there that he encountered Traité des plantes usuelles, a botany book by James Francis Chomel.|$|E
25|$|Later, Asagiri gets mad at {{him because}} he also gave one to Lady Shimoni and gives the {{bracelet}} back to Ukyo saying she don't want it. He asks her why she hates <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> and she admits that she loved him {{and that he was}} kind to every else. He then kisses her on the lips and promises to give Asagiri a moonstone necklace for their wedding. Before he gets killed by Enju, he presents her with the necklace. Being a snow spirit like Asagiri, he also had the power of snow. Soul Symbol: Purity.|$|E
25|$|From 1865 until 1868, the 99th {{served in}} South Africa. While there, Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, {{inspected}} the regiment {{as part of}} a tour of the colony. The regiment impressed <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he took a continued interest in the regiment {{for the rest of his}} life. This culminated in permission being granted to re-title the regiment. In 1874, the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot became the 99th (Duke of Edinburgh's) Regiment. After returning to England in 1868, the regiment returned to South Africa in 1878 in time to take part in the Anglo-Zulu War.|$|E

25|$|Roly is {{the first}} to find Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) in Albert Square gardens when she'd been savaged by the Walford ripper. Pat later demands that he be kicked out of The Vic when the Butchers moved in in 1988. Roly then runs away but is found by Junior Roberts (Aaron Carrington) who returns him to the Butchers. Fortunately for Roly, Diane (Sophie Lawrence) and Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) change Pat's mind and Mo (Edna Doré), who at first {{suggests}} they get a kennel for Roly, warms to <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that he goes to live with her at her flat for a while.|$|E
25|$|Hatton {{became very}} wealthy {{as a result}} of his {{progressing}} career and the Queen's fondness for <b>him,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> so that in 1583 he embarked on the construction of a magnificent house in Holdenby, Northamptonshire. It was, at the time, the largest privately owned Elizabethan house in England. It contained 123 huge glass windows, in the days when glass was very expensive (indeed, a good show of wealth was how many windows you could afford in your house). It had two great courts and was as large as the palace of Hampton Court. It was three storeys high and had two large state rooms, one for himself and another for the queen should she ever come and stay, which she never did.|$|E
25|$|The Rome branch {{was always}} busy. The Papal court was {{attended}} by hundreds of minor officials, both ecclesiastical and secular, along with their attendants. The needs of the Papal court were such {{that there was a}} measurable rise in the frequency of money shortages wherever the court went. This led to a need for banking services that the Medici could provide. The various bishops, cardinals, and prelates often held Church or private estates in far-flung states in and beyond Italy. The revenues from these estates needed to be transferred to wherever the Court was residing. A more practical reason was that alternate investments generally took the form of real estate, and any cardinal or bishop who invested overly much in real estate (which they were not supposed to) or relied on income from Church lands might see his investments confiscated under a new Pope who might not favor <b>him</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> or even turned over to a replacement. Accounts with the Medici were kept secret and generally free from prying, ecclesiastical eyes, {{especially in the case of}} discretionary deposits.|$|E

60|$|M. le Contrôleur seemed satisfied, {{and there}} was little else to say. Louis XV began to regret that he had offered <b>him</b> quite <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> Apparently five hundred {{thousand}} would have been enough.|$|R
