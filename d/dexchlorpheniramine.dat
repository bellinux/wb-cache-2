A, Milan, 2 Department of Surgical Sciences and Integrated Diagnostics, School of Medicine, Genova University, Genoa, 3 Abich Srl, Verbania, 4 San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, ItalyBackground: We {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} quercetin, a natural antioxidant formulated in a specific delivery system, to reduce skin inflammation induced {{by a variety of}} stimuli, including UV radiation, stimulation with a histamine solution, or contact with chemical irritants. In particular, we tested the soothing and anti-itch effect of Quercevita®, 1 % cream for external use, a formulation characterized by a phospholipids-based delivery system. Patients and methods: The study was a monocentric, single blind trial that enrolled a group of 30 healthy volunteers. The back of each subject was examined to identify four quadrants with no previous skin damage or naevi that were treated in order to induce a controlled and reversible form of skin stress. The areas were treated as follows: no product; Quercevita® 1 % cream, 2 mg/cm 2; placebo; positive control (a commercially available topical formulation containing 1 % <b>dexchlorpheniramine).</b> Results: Only quercetin phospholipids 1 % and <b>dexchlorpheniramine</b> 1 % achieved a significant reduction in erythema with comparable results: (– 10. 05 % [P= 0. 00329] for quercetin phospholipids 1 % vs – 14. 05 % [P= 0. 00046] for the positive control). Moreover, quercetin phospholipids 1 % and <b>dexchlorpheniramine</b> 1 % were both associated with a significant decrease in mean wheal diameter: (– 13. 25 % and – 12. 23 % for <b>dexchlorpheniramine</b> 1 %, respectively).

The aim of {{the present}} study was to further elucidate the scarcely studied subprocesses involved in sensorimotor performance, which may be affected by H- 1 receptor blockade. Better knowledge about the cognitive deficits associated with histamine dysfunction can contribute to better treatment of clinical disorders in which histamine hypofunction may be a contributing factor, such as in schizophrenia. Interactions of <b>dexchlorpheniramine</b> with specific task manipulations in a choice reaction time task were studied. Task demands were increased at the level of sensory subprocesses by decreasing stimulus quality, and at the level of motor subprocesses by increasing response complexity. A total of 18 healthy volunteers (9 female) aged between 18 and 45 years participated in a three-way, double-blind, crossover design. Treatments were single oral doses of 4 mg <b>dexchlorpheniramine,</b> 1 mg lorazepam and placebo. Behavioural effects were assessed by measuring reaction times and effects on brain activity by event-related potentials. <b>Dexchlorpheniramine</b> significantly slowed reaction times, but did not significantly interact with task manipulations. However, it did significantly interact with stimulus quality, as measured by event-related potentials. Lorazepam slowed reaction times and interacted with perceptual manipulations, as shown by effects on reaction times.

40|$|The histaminergic {{involvement}} in selective processes underlying {{its role in}} human sensori-motor performance is largely unknown. Recently, selective effects of central H 1 -inverse agonism on sensory visual processes were observed in electrophysiological-but not behavioral data; a discrepancy suggested to result from speeded response-choice related processes. This study attempts to establish the effects on visual processes and identify putative compensatory mechanisms related to increased visual and response-choice task demands by assessing H 1 -inverse agonism induced changes in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response. Twelve participants received oral doses of <b>dexchlorpheniramine</b> 4 mg, lorazepam 1 mg, and placebo in a three-way crossover designed study. Brain activity was assessed for choice reaction time task performance in a 3 T magnetic resonance scanner 2 h after drug administration.

40|$|In {{the present}} study a fast, {{sensitive}} and robust validated method to quantify chlorpheniramine in human plasma using brompheniramine as internal standard (IS) is described. The analyte and the IS were extracted from plasma by LLE (diethyl ether-dichloromethane, 80 : 20, v/v) and analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Chromatographic separation was performed using a gradient of methanol from 35 to 90 % with 2. 5 mm NH(4) OH on a Gemini Phenomenex C(8) 5 mu m column (50 x 4. 6 mm i. d.) in 5. 0 min/run. The method fitted to a linear calibration curve (0. 05 - 10 ng/mL, R > 0. 9991). The precision (%CV) and accuracy ranged, respectively: intra-batch from 1. 5 to 6. 8 % and 99. 1 to 106. 6 %, and inter-batch from 2. 4 to 9. 0 %, and 99. 9 to 103. 1 %.

40|$|Background: Since all antihistamines {{are capable}} of {{crossing}} the blood-brain barrier, they may also cause sedation which may impair daily activities such as driving a car. The purpose of this review {{was to examine the}} effects of antihistamines on driving ability. Method: A literature search revealed 18 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that applied the on-road highway driving test. In this test, subjects are instructed to drive 100 -km on a public highway with a steady lateral position and a constant speed (95 km/h). Primary outcome measure is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP, cm), i. e. the weaving of the car. Results: The literature search yielded 18 clinical trials. At therapeutic doses, a single dose of diphenhydramine, emedastine and hydroxizine impaired driving comparable or greater than the effects of BAC 0. 08 %. Clemastine, triprolidine, mizolastine, acrivastine, <b>dexchlorpheniramine</b> CR and mequitazine impaired driving performance to the same extent as BAC 0. 05 %. For mizolastine significant impairment was only seen after higher than therapeutic doses. Results for cetirizine were mixed, illustrating the drug has the potential to impair driving performance, especially in sensitive subjects. Terfenadine, loratadine levocetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, bilastine fexofenadine and rupatadine showed no driving impairment in the standard driving test after acute administration of their recommended dose. Several studies examined subchronic effects of antihistamines on driving performance. After 4 days of daily treatment significant driving impairment was found for emedastine (2 and 4 mg bid), diphenhydramine (50 mg), clemastine (2 mg bid), triprolidine (5 mg bid), after 5 days of ebastine (30 mg), and after 8 days of hydroxyzine (50 mg). Mixed results were found for cetirizine (10 mg), terfenadine (120 mg) and loratadine (20 mg). No significant differences from placebo were observed after 4 days of subchronic treatment with triprolidine (10 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg), fexofenadine (up to 120 mg), and after 8 days of daily treatment with <b>dexchlorpheniramine</b> (6 mg), bilastine (20 and 40 mg), and mequitazine (10 mg).

40|$|Abstract Purpose Long-term {{continuous}} imatinib {{is recommended}} for adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic KIT+ gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) {{as long as the}} patient continues to benefit. In the adjuvant setting, recent findings indicate that patients at considerable risk of recurrence should receive at least 3 years of imatinib. Because imatinib is often administered for prolonged periods, proper management of imatinib-associated adverse events is crucial. Case report We report a 56 -year-old man with metastatic KIT+ GIST of the liver who had Grade 3 imatinib intolerance (skin rash) when treatment was started. The rash was managed with antihistamine treatment (<b>Dexchlorpheniramine</b> maleate 4 mg per day) and several temporary (up to 2 weeks) dose interruptions. The patient’s skin rash partially improved, and he tolerated gradual reintroduction of imatinib over several months. The patient maintained imatinib 400 mg/d, and tolerated it during the 2 years when he was on antihistamine treatment. After 2 years, the patient continued imatinib therapy without having to take antihistamines. The patient responded according to RECIST 1. 1 and Choi to imatinib treatment for his metastatic GIST (partial response). As of September, 2012, the patient has been on imatinib therapy for 131 months and remains progression free. Conclusions The results of this case report demonstrated that a patient with metastatic KIT+ GIST who was initially intolerant to imatinib maintained, and responded to imatinib therapy after treatment of an imatinib-associated adverse effect. These results suggest that initial intolerance to imatinib should not necessarily result in treatment discontinuation, as these adverse effects, when managed properly, may be tolerated and may decrease over time. </p...|$|E

To investigate the pro-arrhythmic potential of antihistamines by combining safety reports of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) with drug utilization data from 13 European Countries. We identified signals of antihistamine arrhythmogenic potential by analyzing FAERS database for all cases of Torsades de Pointes (TdP), QT abnormalities (QTabn), ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and sudden cardiac death/cardiac arrest (SCD/CA). Number of cases ≥ 3 and disproportionality were used to define alert signals: TdP and QTabn identified stronger signals, whereas SCD/CA identified weaker signals.

40|$|SummaryBackground and purpose: Histamine is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{present in}} the brain of mammals which produces its physiological effects on target cells by stimulation of three types of receptors H 1, H 2 and H 3. Various reports nowadays indicate the role of histamine in reduction of pain transmission. This {{study was designed to}} determine the role of histamine receptors in reduction of pain. Materials and Methods: In this study, effects of different histamine receptor agonists and antagonists on the nociceptive threshold were investigated in mice by thermal (hot plate) and chemical (acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing) stimuli. Results: Intracerebroventricular (I. C. V.) injection of the histamine H 1 receptor agonist HTMT (50 μ g per mouse) produced a significant hypernociceptive response in the hot plate and writhing tests. This dose of HTMT had no significant effect on the motor coordination on rota rod test. Intra peritoneal(I. P) injection of histamine H 1 receptor antagonist, dexchloropheniramine (30 and 40 mg/kg) and diphenhydramine (20 and 40 mg/kg) caused a dose dependent antinociception in both tests. But since all the doses of dephenhydramine in this experiment caused motor impairment in rota rod, it seems that diphenhydramine is not a real pain antagonist. Combined injection of HTMT with <b>dexchlorpheniramine</b> (20 mg/kh, i. p) did not change pain threshold in hot plate teat. The histamine H 2 receptor agonist, dimaprit (50 and 100 μ gm per mouse, I. C. V) and ranitidine, histamine H 2 receptor antagonist (50 and 100 μ gm per mouse, I. C. V) raised the pain threshold in both hot plate and writhing tests. Histamine H 2 receptor agonist, imetit(25 - 50 mg/kg, I. P.) and histamine H 3 receptor antagonist, thioperamide (25 and 50 mg/kg, I. P.) decreased or increased pain threshold in hot plate, respectively. The dose of 25 mg/kg, I. P. of thioperamide significantly antagonized hyper nociceptive response induced by imetit. Conclusion: These results suggest that histamine receptor mechanisms have a retrogative effect on the pain caused by hot plate...|$|E
