5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E

This move brought the roster down to only 13players, which is the league minimum for players allowed on a team's roster. On February 27, the Celtics signed center P.J. Brown {{for the remainder of}} the season, in order to bolster their front court. His decision to come to Boston was strongly aided by a conversation with future teammates Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, who convinced him to sign with the Celtics during the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend. On March 4, 2008, the Celtics officially announced that they had signed guard Sam Cassell. After the signing, Cassell immediately flew back to his hometown of Baltimore to attend funeral services for a deceased family member. This signing ultimately put the roster up to the league maximum of 15players.|$|E
25|$|Plumer {{planned to}} capture Gheluvelt Plateau in four steps at six day intervals, for {{time to bring}} forward {{artillery}} and supplies, a faster tempo of operations than that envisaged by Gough before 31 July. Each step was to <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> limited geographical objectives, with infantry units attacking on narrower fronts in greater depth. The practice of attacking the first objective with two battalions and the following objectives with a battalion each was reversed, {{in view of the}} greater density of German defences the further the attack penetrated; double the medium and heavy artillery was available than for on 31 July. Reorganisation in this manner had been recommended in a report of 25 August, by the Fifth Army General Officer Commanding RA (GOCRA) Major-General H. Uniacke. The evolution in organisation and method was to ensure that more infantry were on tactically advantageous ground, having had time to consolidate and regain contact with their artillery before German counter-attacks.|$|E
25|$|DJ mixers {{are small}} audio mixing {{consoles}} specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer {{used by a}} record producer or audio engineer; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard recording studio mixers <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have {{many of the same}} features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, effects units, etc), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the crossfader. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a DJ controller instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.|$|E

2500|$|Their primary {{assertion}} {{was that}} the bonds and emotional development made at home with parents during these years produced critical long-term results that were cut short by enrollment in schools, and could neither be replaced nor corrected in an institutional setting afterward.

They described the difference as follows: [...] "This is like saying, if you can help a child by taking him off the cold street and housing him in a warm tent, then warm tents should be provided for all children – when obviously most children already <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> secure housing." ...|$|E

Interactivity is prominent in these online video games such as World of Warcraft, The Sims Online and Second Life. These games, which are developments of [...] "new media," [...] allow for users to establish relationships and experience a sense of belonging that transcends traditional temporal and spatial boundaries (such as when gamers logging in from {{different parts of the world}} interact). These games can be used as an escape or to act out a desired life. Will Wright, creator of The Sims, [...] "is fascinated by the way gamers have become so attached to his invention-with some even living their lives through it". New media have created virtual realities that are becoming virtual extensions of the world we live in.

2500|$|There are, however, {{important}} {{cases where}} Webern may <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> profoundly influenced Schoenberg. Haimo marks the swift, radical influence in 1909 of Webern's novel and arresting Five Pieces for String Quartet, op. 5, on Schoenberg's subsequent piano piece op. 11 no. 3; Five Pieces for Orchestra, op. 16; and monodrama Erwartung, op. 17. This shift is distinctly pronounced {{in a letter}} Schoenberg wrote to Busoni, which describes a rather Webernian aesthetic: [...] "Harmony is expression and nothing else. [...] Away with Pathos! Away with protracted ten-ton scores [...] My music must be brief. Concise! In two notes: not built, but [...] "expressed"!! And the results I wish for: no stylized and sterile protracted emotion. People are not like that: {{it is impossible for}} a person to have only one sensation at a time. One has thousands simultaneously. [...] And this variegation, this multifariousness, this illogicality which our senses demonstrate, the illogicality presented by their interactions, set forth by some mounting rush of blood, by some reaction of the senses or the nerves, this I should like to have in my music." [...] In 1949 Schoenberg still remembered being [...] "intoxicated by the enthusiasm of having freed music from the shackles of tonality" [...] and believing with his pupils [...] "that now music could renounce motivic features and remain coherent and comprehensible nonetheless".|$|E

On the record's theme he said [...] " [...] is obviously is gonna have tempo to it, but I think it's gonna <b>have</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> substance than the last record. She dances and we always want to bring out what she does that other people don't." [...] Additionally the trio said that they intended the album to contain no features except for one collaboration with The-Dream, although there would features on remixes. They had wanted to release the album in 2009 but accepted that a 2010 release was more realistic. Later in an interview with Rap-Up magazine, two songs were name dropped, [...] "Speechless" [...] which was the aforementioned feature with The-Dream and [...] "Gifted." [...] Both songs where tipped to appear on the album, though on the final track listing only [...] "Speechless" [...] made the album without The-Dream's vocals. In December 2009, Digital Spy reported that Ciara had begun working Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, someone she had previously collaborated with for Fantasy Ride (2009).
