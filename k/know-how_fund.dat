50|$|Despite the government's {{establishment}} of the State Committee for Chernobyl, the enactment of laws limiting who may stay in contaminated areas, and the institution of a national program for research on the effects, little progress was made in coping {{with the consequences of}} the disaster, owing to the lack of money and the government's sluggish attitude. In 1994, a resettlement program for 170,000 residents was woefully underbudgeted and far behind schedule. To assist victims of Chernobyl, a Western organization called the <b>Know-How</b> <b>Fund</b> provided many Belarusian doctors with training in the latest bone-marrow techniques of Europe and the United States.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{security}} threats concerning RFID and other wireless devices. We focus on eavesdropping and introduce a portable setup for monitoring the communication of active RFIDs in practice. We then investigate an active RFID tag operating at 433 MHz {{in order to}} determine how much its specified coverage can be extended in the context of attacks. Assuming an adversary with limited <b>know-how</b> and <b>funds,</b> we conduct all analyses solely with commercially available low-cost and easy-to-use equipment. By performing practical experiments we demonstrate that the ranges can be increased up to a factor of eight and thereby prove that this type of RFID is vulnerable to certain attacks from a distance. Our results can be applied to other wireless devices, e. g, remote controls for remote keyless entry systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSecuring {{public funding}} to conduct {{research}} and leading it by being a principal investigator (PI) is seen as significant career development step. Such a role brings professional prestige but also new responsibilities beyond research leadership to research management. If public funding brings financial and infrastructure support, little is understood about the inhibiting factors that publicly funded PIs face given the research autonomy offered by publicly funded research. Our study finds {{that there are three}} key PI inhibiting factors 1) political and environmental, 2) institutional and 3) project based. Traditional knowledge, skills and technical <b>know-how</b> of publicly <b>funded</b> PIs are insufficient to deal with the increasing managerial demands and expectations i. e. growing external bureaucracy of public funding agencies. Public funding is no longer the 'freest form of support' as suggested by Hackett (1990) and the inhibiting factors experienced by publicly funded PIs limits their research autonomy. We also argue that PIs have little influence in overcoming these inhibiting factors despite their central role in conducting publicly funded research...|$|R
50|$|Lydec's 30-year {{investment}} plan totals 30 billion Moroccan Dirham. According to one source 21 billion of this sum {{will come from}} connection fees paid by new customers into a fund, 8.2 billion would come from Bank loans and internal cash generation, and 0.8 billion {{would be in the}} form of equity to be raised by the subsidiary running the concession. According to another source the concessionnaire will not provide any significant equity, nor will it borrow significant debt. Instead it will generate 87.8% of its contribution of 6.3 billion Dirham by using its technical and commercial <b>know-how</b> to mobilize <b>funding</b> from its customers. The remainder would be mobilized through connection fees. According to Lydec, the company invested 7.7 billion Dirham between 1997 and 2008, of which the company financed 4.4 billion. 33% of the investment was for sanitation, 23% for water supply, 34% for electricity and 10% were investments that benefited all three sectors. A substantial share of the investments in sanitation were dedicated to storm water management.|$|R
50|$|The {{many foreign}} {{advisers}} from, principally, the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden were often {{under contract to}} the international financial institutions and bilateral or multilateral technical assistance programmes. They favoured free trade and exchange rate convertibility rather than trade protection and capital controls, which might have checked capital flight. They tended to support privatization without prior industrial restructuring; an exception was {{to be found in}} Eastern Germany where the Treuhand (Trust Agency) prepared state-owned enterprises for the market at considerable cost to the government. Western technical assistance programmes were established by European Union - through the Phare and TACIS programmes - and other donors (including the US AID, the UK <b>Know-how</b> <b>Fund</b> and UNDP) and by the IMF, the World Bank, EBRD and KfW, which also advanced loans for stabilization, structural adjustment, industrial restructuring and social protection. Technical assistance was delivered through the exchange of civil servants and by management consultants, including Agriconsulting, Atos, COWI, Ernst & Young, GOPA, GTZ, Human Dynamics, Idom, IMC Consulting, Louis Berger, NIRAS, PA Consulting, PE International, Pohl Consulting, PwC, and SOFRECO.|$|E

40|$|Small Scale Foundries (SSFs) {{have been}} in {{existence}} for several years in Ghana. The industry has created several jobs {{for the people of}} Ghana and has minimized the burden on government to find ways of disposing scrap metals generated within the country. While scrap metals are still being exported, the quantity exported has decreased as a result of recycling by foundrymen in producing various parts. The government of Ghana has not paid special attention to this industry. Nevertheless, individuals and private investors are heavily involved in producing several thousands of tonnes of castings annually generating revenue for the government through taxation as well as helping with metal waste disposal. Metal cast products are sold both locally and internationally to neighbouring countries. The industry is however faced with numerous challenges. These include quality issues due to lack of technical <b>know-how,</b> access to <b>funding</b> from both government and private financial institutions and foundry waste management. To promote this industry, government and private financial institutions must be encouraged to come on board. Policies must be established and proper training programme developed to improve and promote this technology. This could {{go a long way in}} reducing the high unemployment rate in Ghana...|$|R
40|$|The International Monetary Fund {{spends most}} of its time {{monitoring}} its member states' economic performance and advising on institutional change. While {{much of the literature}} sees the Fund as a policy enforcer in "emerging market" and "frontier" economies, little {{attention has been paid to}} exploring the Fund’s bilateral surveillance of its Western member states. This article proposes that "seeing like the IMF" provides a dynamic view of how the Fund frames its advice for institutional change. It does so through "associational templates" that do not blindly promote institutional convergence, but appeal for change on the basis of like-characteristics among economies. Many Western states, particularly small open economies, consider the Fund's advice as important not only for technical <b>know-how,</b> but because <b>Fund</b> assessments are significant to international and domestic political audiences. This article traces the Fund's advice on taxation and monetary reform to two coordinated market economies, Denmark and Sweden, and two liberal market economies, Australia and New Zealand from 1975 to 2004. It maps how the Fund advocated "policy revolutions" and "policy recombinations" during this period, advice that coincided with important institutional changes within these small open economies...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} PhD {{research}} {{is to examine the}} effectiveness of drawing common elements of regional synergy development into an overall framework, generally used for the implementation of cleaner production, to assist industries in heavy industrial areas with the further development of regional synergy opportunities. The literature review revealed an absence of practical methodologies to support industry with the development of promising synergy opportunities. An assessment of existing synergies in the case-study region (the Kwinana Industrial Area) has confirmed the close collaboration and integration which already exists in the region. These existing synergies provide a range of sustainability benefits. The research resulted in customised methodologies to assist in the advancement of regional synergies, focussed on the priority themes of: inorganic by-products, water, and energy. The trial application of the methodologies demonstrated their effectiveness in delivering valuable outcomes for the stakeholders involved (e. g. feasible synergy opportunities for industry uptake). Overall, the cleaner production framework is not a driver for synergy development perse, but rather should be regarded as a flexible framework to advance synergy development – targeted towards specific local research needs. Strengths of the novel methodologies include added-value to stakeholders, stakeholder participation, transparency and flexibility. The principal weakness concerned the time investment to apply the methodologies. However, it is anticipated that the trialled methodologies could be performed in other regions in a significantly shorter time period (by learning from the experiences here). A set of parameters must be understood before applying the customised methodologies in industrial regions elsewhere in the world. These include: distances between industries, number and diversity of industries, industry interest, industry champions, presence and functioning of an industry organisation, relevant regulations, community support, availability of <b>know-how</b> and expertise, <b>funding,</b> and corporate culture...|$|R

40|$|The {{thematic}} {{background of}} learning regions {{is based on}} the concept of learning organisations and on the paradigm of the innovative milieu. The frame of reference of the learning regions {{can be seen as a}} synthesis of regional and organisational based definitions, which involve the process of learning. Compared to the theory of learning organisations, the most challenging question is to find the collective mission among a heterogeneous group of actors, which involves individuals, organisations, enterprises etc. The key processes of learning regions can be divided in the three categories. The first element in the concept of learning regions is producing and enhancing human capital in individual, organisational and regional level. The formation of new human capital plays an important role in innovation process and it is also closely linked to learning process, which can be realized through new technological and scientific innovations. The second element is the cooperation of regional actors and the diffusion of human capital and know-how in and between the organisations. This can be seen as an opportunity to gain agglomeration benefits. The third - and perhaps the most important - issue in the framework of learning regions is how human capital and new know-how can be transferred to practise. From regional point of view this means growing GDP, employment, better quality of services and welfare. The basic pillars of the European social fund are based on education, employment and <b>know-how.</b> Presumably, structural <b>fund</b> based acts on regional level have a catalytic influence on the key processes of learning regions. The basic processes which can be affected by ESF are the producing new human capital, subdividing the know-how and transferring it to practice. It is also clear that sustainable regional competitiveness needs social inclusion as a basement. The social inclusion is important part of ESF acts, and in that way the projects funded by ESF are also closely related to the concept of learning regions. In this paper, we explore what is the role of ESF interventions in developing regional competitiveness. The study {{is based on the}} concept of learning regions, and it is based on dissection of register based sample of ESF-projects, which covers over 30 % of projects of ongoing ESF period 2000 - 2006 in Finland. Main purpose of this paper is to find out, how projects are integrated to the processes of learning region (enhancing human capital, the diffusion of human capital and transferring it to practise) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2005. The Vaal Triangle has {{a higher}} than average level of {{unemployment}} and poverty. This is mainly due to globalization {{on the one hand}} and the availability of land for housing on the other. The researcher has been prompted to do this study after returning to the Vaal Triangle after a period of absence, during which the visible deterioration of the main business areas in both Vanderbijlpark and Vereeniging prompted into to attempt and establish what could be done to improve the situation. The literature study exposed various reasons for unemployment in South Africa and in particular, in the Vaal Triangle. It further highlights the levels of poverty in the area. In addition the literature study explored some of the successful measures taken by various countries globally. The only sustainable method of creating jobs, is through profitable business, and the method of establishing a good core of growing businesses that can employ vast numbers of a country's citizens, is to ensure a good foundation of small new businesses in a country or area. The research shows that government both nationally and locally, should take various steps to promote and encourage business and to make it very easy to start businesses. The research explores some of the problems experienced by small business managers or owners and highlights the need for information, management <b>know-how</b> and adequate <b>funding</b> as the main stumbling blocks. The research concentrates on the various services or incentives available from government to small business and which are available through local service centres. The empirical study consists of a structured questionnaire, as well as interviews with service providers and small business owners. The questionnaire was distributed to small businesses randomly selected h m the population of small businesses in the Vaal Triangle in order to investigate whether these are aware of all the organisations that could assist them with incentive services, and to find out of they were using these services. This included a section that allowed the small business owner to comment on h i s k needs. The main findings were that small business owners were not aware of the organisations that supply incentive services; consequently they were not using these services. Unfortunately no comments were forthcoming or feedback given on the questionnaires in reference of the owner's opinions. Doctora...|$|R
