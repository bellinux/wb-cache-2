40|$|Abstract Background Mandatory generic {{substitution}} (GS) {{was introduced}} in Finland on 1 April 2003. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore and compare the impacts of GS on the activities of pharmaceutical companies representing mainly original or <b>generic</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> in Finland. The self-reported impact of GS from pharmaceutical companies' perspective was explored with a focus on the number of employees, the range of sales packages on the market, the marketing activities, the research and development of new <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> and storage of pharmaceuticals. Methods A cross-sectional postal survey was conducted among pharmaceutical companies with an office in Finland and substitutable medicines in the Finnish pharmaceutical market one year (2004) and five years (2008) after the introduction of GS. Completed questionnaires were returned by 16 original and 7 generic product companies in 2004 (response rate 56 %, n = 41) and by 16 original and 6 generic product companies in 2008 (response rate 56 %, n = 39). Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results The number of employees (2004 : n = 6 / 16, 2008 : n = 7 / 16) and the amount of prescription medicine marketing (2004 : n = 7 / 16, 2008 : n = 8 / 16) decreased in many of the original product companies after the introduction of GS. GS resulted in problems related to the storage of pharmaceuticals in the original product companies shortly after GS was introduced (p = 0. 032 between 2004 and 2008). In the generic product companies, the prescription medicine representatives' visits to pharmacies increased at the beginning of GS (p = 0. 021 between 2004 and 2008). In addition, GS caused problems with the storage of pharmaceuticals one year and five years after the reform (2004 : n = 4 / 7, 2008 : n = 3 / 6). The differences between original and generic product companies regarding the impacts of GS were not, however, statistically significant. GS did not affect on the range of sales packages on the market or the research activities of the majority of companies. Conclusions The study suggests that GS has had impacts on the activities of pharmaceutical companies in Finland. There were also some differences, although not statistically significant, between the surveyed original and generic product companies regarding the self-reported impacts of GS. More investigations are needed in this field. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{a number}} of government policies related to competition or intellectual property and affecting innovation for their welfare effects. Its premise is that the enhancement of social welfare is included among the purposes of competition and intellectual-property laws. It also assumes that innovation is a major contribution to long-run welfare. The paper then considers whether the policy initiatives under review furthered that purpose. First it considers U. S. and Canadian legislation designed to promote the entry of <b>generic</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> into {{the market and the}} response (or lack thereof) of both governments to the issue of regulatory delay eroding some period of patent protection. Second, the paper considers the impact of the principle of free movement of goods within the European Union on the incentive structure of the patent system. It then draws from U. S. experience to consider how the political goal of furthering national autonomy for member states could be pursued without undercutting the effective operation of the patent system. The paper suggests that such a reconciliation might be possible in a way that could be more welfare enhancing than the present regime. Third, the paper considers comparatively the U. S. and European approaches to patent protection in the biotech industry where organic structures on both the dna and protein levels are exceedingly complex. The paper tentatively concludes that the EU may be avoiding the potentially welfare-reducing results of the Federal Circuit’s enhanced description requirement. It notes that the potential remedial role of the doctrine of equivalents in this setting is as yet uncertain. Fourth, the paper examines U. S. patent and copyright approaches to the protection of computer programs, considering especially whether protection is overbroad and thus reduces welfare by impeding innovation. The paper concludes that the structure of those laws and developments under them are likely to minimize this danger. Fifth, the paper examines the U. S. misuse doctrines, with emphasis {{on the development of the}} copyright misuse doctrine during the past decade. It also examines related antitrust developments in the U. S. and EU that lie on the edge of the intellectual-property/antitrust interface. The paper concludes that the courts have taken an approach to copyright misuse that is likely to reduce welfare, but that the U. S. courts may be approaching a welfare-enhancing synthesis on their approach to the intellectual-property/antitrust interface. This developing synthesis may well ultimately correct the welfare-reducing aspects of the newly emergent and aggressively applied copyright misuse doctrine. By contrast, the relation between intellectual property and competition law is still being worked out in the EU and it is not yet clear whether the authorities will ultimately formulate a welfare enhancing approach to the resolution of issues arising out of that relationship...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{great need}} for a {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturer to provide its customers with the right product at the right time, place and price and also to deliver the product in the right quantity and quality. Should pharmaceutical customers not receive their orders on time from the pharmaceutical manufacturer, the customers might face out-of-stock situations. As a result, the patients or customers might turn to an alternative product from a different pharmaceutical manufacturer, which has the required stock readily available. This could lead to loss in sales and even death amongst its customers. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the key factors that form part of the demand and operations planning strategies to ensure that these factors are in place to effectively manage and execute the supply chain and logistics processes to reduce possible out-of-stock situations amongst its customers. As a starting point to the study, an analysis was performed based on the review of relevant research and literature from various text books, journals, publications, as well as internet sources. The literature study covered various aspects such as demand planning, production planning, the use of different demand and operations planning strategies, as well as the importance of continuous internal and external customer service levels to ensure that customer orders are delivered on time. The analysis of the literature review was used to establish a theoretical basis for the design and structure of the questionnaire that was used as a research instrument in this study. A survey was conducted amongst the employees that are responsible for executing the supply chain and logistics processes within Aspen Pharmacare. These employees resided within the three main departments of the pharmaceutical manufacturer, namely, the Demand and Operations Planning, Production and Packing, as well as the Warehouse and Distribution departments. Each question posed in the questionnaire related to the role of each employee within these departments that are responsible for the logistics processes within Aspen Pharmacare. The empirical results from the study indicated that the respondents were in support that specific key factors are important for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to manage incoming customer orders efficiently and effectively to reduce possible out-of-stock situations amongst its end customers. However, the respondents also highlighted that there were a number of obstacles preventing them from implementing the key factors that are required to manage incoming customer orders more efficiently within the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Some of these obstacles include: the lack of pro- activeness; lack of accountability; and the lack of constant communication between the employees from the three main departments. Furthermore, incomplete hand-over information during shift changes amongst the employees of the Production and Packing department created unnecessary down-time. Also, the employees from the Warehouse and Distribution department were not informed timeously when changes to the production schedule were made. These obstacles will have a negative impact on the ultimate customer delivery dates and need to be addressed. The empirical results highlighted some recommendations to assist pharmaceutical manufacturing companies to more effectively and efficiently manage their incoming customer orders to reduce or eliminate any possible out-of-stock situations amongst its end customers. Some recommendations include: improved communication between the three main departments; to react immediately to out-of-stock products; and to ensure that internal and external customer service levels are adhered to at all times. The implementation of the recommendations based on the empirical findings of the study will assist the pharmaceutical manufacturing company to achieve excellence and to become a world-class supplier of <b>generic</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> In this way, all incoming customer orders can be fulfilled on time...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{a new type of}} settlements, {{commonly}} referred to as “reversed payment settlements” or simply “reverse settlements,” emerged in litigation over patents covering <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> What differentiates these new settlements from their traditional counterparts is that whereas traditionally, the alleged trespasser on someone else 2 ̆ 7 s rights pays the rights-holder to settle the litigation, in these new settlements it is the rights holder that pays the alleged trespasser. These settlements are a direct consequence of the various incentives provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act - an Act designed to increase competition between brand name and <b>generic</b> manufactures of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> In this Article, I propose a new approach and argue the proper way to police these agreements is not by subjecting them to an antitrust analysis, but by ordering a reexamination of any patent involved in a reverse settlement. The question of whether any reverse settlement is pro- or anti-competitive, turns on the strength of the patent and the likely conclusion of the litigation. The antitrust analysis is simply not designed to address the patent scope and validity issues, and therefore cannot properly differentiate between pro- and anti-competitive settlements. The patent law, on the other hand, is designed to evaluate the strength of the patent, and is therefore an obvious candidate to police reverse settlements. By employing the Patent Office 2 ̆ 7 s existing (but broadened) reexamination authority, weak patents can be invalidated and removed from the marketplace, thus opening up the market for new generic entrants. Additionally, if patentees know that their patents may be subject to reexamination, they will be less likely to enter into anti-competitive settlements. By expanding the scope of Patent Office 2 ̆ 7 s reexamination authority, and by assigning the task of evaluating the ultimate validity of questionable patents to the agency with expertise in patent law, the ability of parties to enter into beneficial and legitimate settlements, as well as consumer access to lower cost drugs and medical devices will both be preserved...|$|R
