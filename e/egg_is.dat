5|$|The {{top of the}} <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> {{depressed}} and forms a small central cavity called micropyle through which the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> fertilised. The micropyle is situated on top in eggs which are globular, conical, or cylindrical; in those eggs which are flattened or lenticular, the micropyle {{is located on the}} outer margin or rim.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} from the ovary, the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> swept into the fallopian tube by the fimbria, which is a fringe of tissue {{at the end of}} each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.|$|E
5|$|Dragon's <b>Egg</b> <b>is</b> a 1980 {{hard science}} fiction novel by Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's <b>Egg</b> <b>is</b> {{a neutron star}} with a surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth, and {{inhabited}} by cheela, intelligent creatures {{the size of a}} sesame seed who live, think and develop a million times faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first face-to-face contact with humans, who are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's Egg.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{deposited}} in heaps of coconut leaves or in silt over stony substratum. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> soft-shelled, measuring 6.4 × 15.9 mm, and two <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> produced {{at a time}} around March.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> usually first {{scrambled}} in a bowl, {{and tomatoes}} are sliced into wedges. Tomatoes are fried first {{for about a}} minute, salt <b>is</b> added then <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> added last. Cook until <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> done.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} in Czech cuisine because many {{families}} outside of cities breed hens. Scrambled <b>eggs</b> (...) <b>are</b> common. Fried <b>eggs</b> ( [...] , literally [...] "bulls eye") are often served with bread or potatoes and spinach. Boiled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> also popular. Stuffed <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> made from halved, shelled, hard-boiled <b>eggs.</b> The yolk <b>is</b> carefully removed into a separate bowl, mixed with salt, mustard and spices and stuffed back. It can be decorated.|$|R
5|$|Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> fertilised, the ant {{becomes a}} female; if not, {{it will become}} a male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through a larval and pupal stage before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an egg. If the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through larval and pupal stages before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|No nesting {{material}} {{is used in}} the breeding cavity. One white <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> laid each day until the typical clutch of about five eggs is complete. Incubation starts soon after the first <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> laid, with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young defecate in the nest, and their pellets are trodden underfoot, making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are in the nest for about 30 days.|$|E
50|$|A {{clutch can}} {{comprise}} {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with four being the commonest number. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> quite variable and cannot be reliably identified as to which Australian corvid laid them, however the colouration of the two crow species <b>eggs</b> <b>is</b> different to the three ravens. Ravens' <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a light turquoise with brown blotches, but crows' <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a dirty white with brown speckles.|$|R
50|$|Deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{a common}} dish in the United States. In the Midwestern and Southern U.S., they are {{commonly}} served as hors d'oeuvres before a full meal is served, often during the Christmas season. Deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> so {{popular in the}} United States that special trays are sold specifically for serving them. Prepared and packaged deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> now available in some U.S. supermarkets. While deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes sprinkled with Old Bay seasoning on the east coast, paprika is more commonly used in the south. Deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> commonly served at Derby parties in Kentucky.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to}} Lymantria dispar dispar; {{they range from}} yellow to a dark brown or {{chocolate}} brown. The location of eggs varies by region. In the Tonko region of Honshu, <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> commonly laid on white birch trees. In the Nara prefecture, <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> commonly laid {{high up in the}} trees, while in the Gumma prefecture, <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> typically laid within 60 cm from the ground. On a larch plantation in Tamayama, Iwate Prefecture, <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> commonly laid below 1 m on the trunk of the tree in positions of low illumination and lower temperatures.|$|R
5|$|The fate of {{the first}} <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> mostly unknown, but studies on the related royal penguin and erect-crested penguin show the female tips the egg out when the larger second <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> laid. The task of {{incubating}} the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> divided into three roughly equal sessions of around 12days each over a five-week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning to sea, leaving the female alone to tend the egg. Upon the male's return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched. Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37days after arrival until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36days, and the female fasts for 42days from her arrival after the male {{until late in the}} incubation period. Both adults lose 36–40% of their body weight during this period. The second egg hatches around 34days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} were once intensively hunted for their meat and eggs; {{consumption}} has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed {{in countries where}} regulations are not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> an aphrodisiac. Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, {{and high levels of}} toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 a Pterodaustro embryo in an <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> reported, {{specimen}} MHIN-UNSL-GEO-V246. The <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> elongated, six centimetres {{long and}} 22 millimetres across and its mainly flexible shell {{was covered with}} a thin layer, 0.3 mm thick, of calcite. Three-dimensionally preserved <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> reported in 2014.|$|R
40|$|ACT: Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus (L.) <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> sampled using a Tucker trawl and a MOCNESS-sampler at 3 {{selected}} localities in North Norway. The {{specific density}} of the <b>eggs</b> <b>was</b> determined in a density-gradient column. The <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> found to achieve higher specific density with increasing age. In areas with a horizontally stable, clearly defined pycnocline (Andfjord and Seraysund), the vertical distribution of <b>eggs</b> <b>was</b> characterized by a unimodal egg distribution. Furthermore, the older <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> found at higher average capture salinities than younger eggs, i. e. they were distributed {{in relation to their}} neutral buoyancy. In an area with a horizontally more variable and less defined pycnocline (Malangen), the pattern of vertical distribution of <b>eggs</b> <b>was</b> less distinct, often with polymodal egg distributions. In this hydrographically variable system, no heterogeneity in the distribution of the various egg developmental stages could be discerned. In Malangen, thus, it is proposed that the vertical distribution of halibut <b>eggs</b> <b>is</b> most strongly influenced by physical factors...|$|R

5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.|$|E
50|$|In Britain {{copulation}} {{takes place}} {{during the period from}} spring to autumn. During copulation both slugs cling together so closely that no everted genitalia are visible. Under laboratory conditions, the first <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid 5-15 days after copulation. At one time approximately 15 <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid. This can be repeated several times, but in total not more than 100 <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid by one individual. The dimensions of the <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> 2 × 1.5 mm. Self-fertilization is also possible.|$|R
5000|$|Steaming: <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> taken {{straight}} from the refrigerator {{and placed in the}} steamer at full steam. The eggs will not crack due to sudden change in temperatures. At full steam, [...] "soft-boiled" [...] <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> ready in 6 minutes, [...] "hard-boiled" [...] eggs at 8 minutes. As the <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> cooked by a steam source, there is no variation of water temperature and hence cooking time, no matter how many <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> placed in the steamer.|$|R
50|$|Clutches of two <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{laid in the}} summer. These <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> large, with {{dimensions}} of 27 mm long by 12 mm wide.|$|R
5|$|The first <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> often laid {{when the}} nest {{is little more}} than a pad of grass, and a further <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, {{involves}} the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed {{by the emergence of}} a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{immediately}} after the events of Sonic 3, where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death <b>Egg,</b> <b>is</b> damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death <b>Egg</b> <b>is</b> relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid {{in batches}} of {{anywhere}} between 20 and 100. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> yellow and slightly elongated and tall and display shallow transverse ribbing.|$|R
50|$|The female lays two <b>eggs</b> that <b>are</b> {{approximately}} 1.14 × 0.94 inches (29 × 24 mm) in size. The <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{white in}} colour {{and have an}} oval shape. The incubation period for the <b>eggs</b> <b>is</b> between 20 and 25 days.|$|R
5|$|The {{scene of}} Kane {{inspecting}} the <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> shot in post-production. A fiberglass <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light {{on it and}} see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves. The top of the <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of the <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason {{the image of a}} hen's <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> used on the poster, and has become emblematic of the franchise as a whole—as opposed to the Alien egg that appears in the finished film.|$|R
5|$|This kiwi {{is highly}} aggressive, and pairs will defend their large territories (49 acres) against other kiwi. Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal, and will sleep {{during the day}} in burrows. At night, they feed on {{invertebrates}} and will also eat plants. Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March. The <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> the largest of all birds {{in proportion to the}} size of the bird. Chicks take 75 to 85 days to hatch, and after hatching, they are abandoned by their parents.|$|E
5|$|This species mates for life, and pairs {{return to}} the same burrow year after year. The single <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> not {{replaced}} if lost. This is a long-lived species: one bird has returned to its burrow for ten consecutive years, and the lifespan {{is estimated to be}} about 16years. The age of first breeding is unknown, but assumed to be four or more years. Despite the proximity of the breeding sites, Zino's and Fea's petrels have never been found at each other's nesting areas, and Zino's is not known to hybridise with any other species.|$|E
5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond {{is very difficult to}} sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|E
