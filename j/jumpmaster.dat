25|$|By {{the time}} the C-130 landed, the F-16 had hit Green Ramp heading west. The {{aircraft}} struck the ground in an empty parking place between two Air Force C-130s with crews on board preparing the aircraft for departure.

No. 66-0173 of the 438th Airlift Wing, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey) parked on the ramp. The C-141B crew was preparing the aircraft for joint Army-Air Force operations, however, no Army troops besides the <b>jumpmaster</b> team had yet boarded it. The wreckage of the F-16 punctured the fuel tanks in the C-141's right wing, causing a large fireball, which combined with the F-16 wreckage and continued on a path taking it between Building 900 and the pax shed, directly into the area where the mass of Army paratroopers were sitting and standing. Twenty-three men died and more than eighty were injured; one severely burned paratrooper died more than nine months later, on 3 January 1995.|$|E

2500|$|The first fully {{operational}} MC-130H Combat Talon II (87-0024) was {{received by the}} 8th SOS on June 29, 1991, with three others delivered over the summer. The official acceptance ceremony for the Talon II was held at Hurlburt in October, and by December 1991 the 8th SOS was equipped with six. The Combat Talon II features a stronger airframe and modifications to the rear and aft cargo doors. The electronics suite has been upgraded, and includes Global Positioning System navigation, special radars for navigating in adverse weather, and night vision goggles (NVG) capability. These new technologies allow the Combat Talon II to fly as low as [...] above ground level (AGL) in inclement weather, and make faster, more accurate airdrops. The MC-130H Combat Talon II, like the MC-130E Combat Talon I, can perform a variety of mission profiles, from daytime mid-level overwater flight and <b>Jumpmaster</b> Directed (JMD) personnel airdrop to night-time adverse weather terrain-following flight in mountainous terrain supporting airdrop and airland to covert and clandestine objectives. [...] However, the MC-103H is ideally suited for a high to mid-level, daytime VMC overwater run-in to an easily identifiable dropzone, typically a runway, culminating in a JMD airdrop. [...] The MC-130H’s weight, speed, and fuel capacity preclude it from being a viable asset for performing {{any other type of}} tactical mission. [...] Increases in automation reduced the aircrew by two and allowed the Combat Talon II to carry an additional pallet of cargo when compared to the Combat Talon I. Initial Operational capability was reached on June 30, 1993.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of Jumpmasters within the US Army; Military Free Fall and Static Line. This {{explanation}} will be focused on Static Line Jumpmasters, who are generally just referred to as <b>Jumpmaster.</b> Jumpmasters are easily identifiable in Army formations by their ability to earn an advanced rating for their Parachutist Badge. Senior Parachutists are entitled to a Star atop their wings while Master Parachutists wear a Star and Wreath. In some units Jumpmasters identify themselves to jumpers by wearing a bright red or yellow armband indicating that these Jumpmasters are both qualified (trained in the parachute system being used) and current (within regulations to perform duties as a <b>Jumpmaster).</b> Personnel may be qualified as a <b>Jumpmaster</b> but if they are not current (having pulled duties as a <b>jumpmaster</b> within 180 days) they may not assist the <b>Jumpmaster</b> team or perform duties as a <b>Jumpmaster</b> until completing refresher training. Red is worn by the active <b>Jumpmaster</b> Team. Yellow is worn by any Jumpmasters who are jumping, but not actively participating on the <b>Jumpmaster</b> Team. In addition to this armband, each member of the <b>Jumpmaster</b> Team may wear a fixed-blade knife on their lower leg. The <b>Jumpmaster</b> wears this knife in case a jumper somehow becomes entangled during the exiting process, becoming a towed parachutist, and must be immediately cut free. Other units simply nominate the <b>Jumpmaster</b> team and they are introduced to the jumpers at initial manifest.|$|E
