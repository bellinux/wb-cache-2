[...] The explanation given for why the soluble compounds fall into any of these three categories is based on how accessible they are. The instantly soluble compounds are likely to be right {{on the surface of the}} leaf, which is why they are the first to be obtained. The rapidly soluble components are thought to be from the inside of the leaves, where broken cell structures slow both the rate of solvent entering as well as solute leaving. The slowest soluble compounds are expected to have either high molecular mass, which would take longer to move through the cell matrices of the leaves, or products formed during hydrolysis over the course of the extraction. There are a variety of methods and machinery that can be used to perform extraction, but the general concept is that the leaves are treated with a solvent in order to extract the compounds within them. In the aforementioned study, it was stated that the maximum yield of solids that could be extracted was 35%. Over time, other chemical methods of increasing extraction yields have been discovered, such as using hydrogen peroxide on extracted leaves to obtain a yield of 42% solids. [...] After the extraction step, the solution is clarified by passing through a decanter, centrifuge, or filter press.|$|E

To investigate how natural substances influence these two processes, we examined the effects of lotus leaf extract (Nelumbo nucifera -extract solution obtained from Silab, France) and L-carnitine on human preadipocytes and adipocytes. Methods For our in vitro studies, we used a lotus leaf <b>extract</b> <b>solution</b> alone or in combination with L-carnitine.

To further characterize lotus leaf extract solution-mediated effects, we determined the expression of the transcription factor adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD 1 /SREBP- 1 c) on the RNA- and protein level utilizing qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis. Additionally, the effect of L-carnitine on beta-oxidation was analyzed using human preadipocytes and mature adipocytes. Finally, we investigated additive effects of a combination of lotus leaf <b>extract</b> <b>solution</b> and L-carnitine on triglyceride accumulation during preadipocyte/adipocyte differentiation. Results Our data showed that incubation of preadipocytes with lotus leaf <b>extract</b> <b>solution</b> significantly decreased triglyceride accumulation during adipogenesis without affecting cell viability. Compared to controls, adipocytes incubated with lotus leaf <b>extract</b> <b>solution</b> exhibited a significant increase in lipolysis-activity. Moreover, cell populations cultivated in the presence of lotus leaf <b>extract</b> <b>solution</b> showed a decrease in adipocyte differentiation capacity as indicated by a decrease in the ADD 1 /SREBP- 1 c signal.

The mutual relationships of components in the <b>extracted</b> <b>solution</b> were discussed. These results are summarized as fellow: The treatment of diammonium phosphate to the Cd absorbed soil clearly depressed the dissolution of absorbed Cd by every kind of <b>extracted</b> <b>solution.</b> Relation between phosphate, ammonium and cadmium ion in each <b>extracted</b> <b>solution</b> of the used soil did not indicate lack of a unified tendency. In the no phosphate treatment to each soil {{as well as the}} treatment of diammonium phosphate, the humus content in soil had a great influence of the Cd absorbed strength by soil. In the less humus content soil, regardless of less dissoluble phosphate of each extract, a large quantity of dissoluble Cd from the phosphate treated soil had been observed. These results were suggested that the phosphate treatment to the soil directly did not take part in absorption of Cd by soil. Dissoluble Cd contents from soil are closely related with the pH of each <b>extracted</b> <b>solution.</b> There are most contents of Cd at the region of low pH values of every used soil, and its contents reduced rapidly with the consequence of higher pH region of <b>extracted</b> <b>solution.</b> The least Cd contents were exhibited at pH 6 ～ 7. In the treatment of diammonium phosphate solution to the Cd absorbed soil, the pH values of the each <b>extracted</b> <b>solution</b> preserved higher pH region.

40|$|A key to {{developing}} a real time, automated soil nutrient sensor depends {{on the ability to}} effectively extract soil nutrients from a soil sample and precisely detect them {{in a very short time}} period. An ion-selective field effect transistor (ISFET) chip has proven to be a good candidate for use in real-time soil nutrient sensing because of its rapid response and low sample volume. This paper describes the evaluation of nitrate ionselective membranes and the investigation of the interaction between the ion-selective membranes and soil <b>extracting</b> <b>solutions.</b> The response characteristics of the membranes and their suitability for use for real-time soil nutrient sensing were investigated through evaluation of their sensitivity and selectivity using 16 ion selective electrodes (ISEs) in a computer-controlled system. All membranes showed an approximately linear Nernstian response when nitrate concentrations were above 10 - 3 M, irrespective of <b>extracting</b> <b>solution</b> type. At low nitrate concentrations, below 10 - 4 M, both the <b>extracting</b> <b>solution</b> and ligand types significantly affected the sensitivity and selectivity of each membrane. A TDDA-NPOE membrane showed greater sensitivity to nitrate than did the MTDA-NPOE and MTDA-TOTM membranes. In addition, the selectivity of the TDDA membrane was superior to that of the MTDA membranes when bicarbonate, chloride, and bromide were considered as the interfering ions...|$|R
40|$|Numerous sites exist where low {{permeability}} clayey soils have been contaminated with both {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and heavy metals. To remediate these sites, innovative treatment methods are urgently required. Electrokinetically enhanced in situ flushing offers great potential to remediate {{low permeability}} soils, but this method is highly dependent {{on the type of}} <b>extracting</b> <b>solution</b> used. This study investigated the feasibility of using different <b>extracting</b> <b>solutions</b> at various concentrations to remove PAHs as well as heavy metals from low permeability clayey soils. The most efficient <b>extracting</b> <b>solutions</b> could be used as purging/extracting solutions in electrokinetic remediation and other technologies such as soil washing. For the present study, kaolin was selected as a model clayey soil, and it was spiked with phenan-threne as well as nickel at concentrations of 500 mg/kg each to simulate typical field contamination. Sev-eral batch tests were conducted using a known amount of the spiked kaolin mixed with different extract-ing solutions at various concentrations to enhance the removal efficiency and to optimize the concentration of each extractant. The extraction solutions selected were surfactants, cosolvents, chealting agents, organic acids, and cyclodextrins. Based on the test results, surfactants and cosolvents were effective for the re-moval of phenanthrene, but they were inefficient for the removal of nickel. On the other hand, chelatin...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{evaluate}} the influence of extractives parameters on tannin content of solutions obtained from leaves of P. guajava and the antimicrobial activity of the best <b>extract</b> <b>solution.</b> The type of extraction, drug proportion and alcohol concentration were studied following a factorial design and the responses evaluated were tannin content and dry residue. The tannins content was assayed by spectrophotometric method at 271 nm using casein as precipitant agent and the dry residue was determined by gravimetric method. The statistical analysis demonstrated that only the alcohol concentrations have significant influence on tannins content, but on the dry residue both factors (drug and alcohol proportion) were important. In accordance of the results, the best extractive method was decoction on reflux during 15 min using alcohol concentration 50 % (v/v) as solvent and this <b>extract</b> <b>solution</b> shows a promising antimicrobial activity...|$|E

40|$|It is here {{described}} {{the comparison of}} extraction efficiency of some solutions (acetate buffer, deionized water, diluted HNO(3) and EDTA) frequently adopted in literature for evaluating the elemental solubility in airborne particulate matter. This comparison was performed considering the distribution of As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb. S, Si, Sb, Sn, Sr, Ti, V. Zn between the extractable and mineralized residual fractions on the NIST 1648 certified material, PM(10) real samples and size-segregated samples, collected by a 13 -stage impactor. The <b>extracting</b> <b>solutions</b> were evaluated by comparing extractive efficiencies and robustness towards some factors, such as acidity and concentration of complexing species, that have great environmental variability {{and that could be}} able to modify the extractive efficiency. Furthermore, extraction methods application to size-segregated samples allowed estimating the selectivity of <b>extracting</b> <b>solutions</b> towards dimensionally characterized emission sources, as dusts originated from abrasion and road dust re-suspension. On the basis of the obtained results, it was possible to define the main advantages and disadvantages resulting from the use of different <b>extracting</b> <b>solutions,</b> necessary to make possible the comparison of environmental studies carried out in different extractive conditions and to start up a proper study for harmonizing extracting procedures.

40|$|The {{effects of}} peat <b>extract</b> <b>solutions</b> on spore {{germination}} and hyphal {{growth of the}} arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Gigaspora margarita Becker & Hall were investigated. Spores were incubated in <b>extract</b> <b>solutions</b> of peat from China and peat moss from Canada, which were prepared at a weight ratio of 1 : 10, 1 : 20, 1 : 30, 1 : 50 and 1 : 100 for each substrate according to the weight ratio of water. Compared with peat and peat moss solutions, solutions of KH_ 2 PO_ 4 and (NH_ 4) _ 2 SO_ 4 at various concentrations were used as media to investigate the effect of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). Spores in the peat solutions {{showed the highest values}} for germination percentage, hyphal length and number of auxiliary cells, and these values were significantly higher than the values recorded for the other treatments. In contrast, in the peat moss <b>extract</b> <b>solutions,</b> which had a lower content of N and higher content of P than the peat solutions, the germination and hyphal growth of spores decreased. Spore growth was promoted with increased concentrations of the N solutions. However, P solutions exerted an inhibitory effect on spore germination and hyphal growth.
