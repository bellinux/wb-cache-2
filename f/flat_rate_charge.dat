40|$|Abstract: While {{time-varying}} retail electricity pricing is {{very popular}} with economists, that support is not matched among regulators and consumers. Many papers have been written estimating and extolling the societal benefits of time-varying rates – especially dynamic rates that change on a day’s notice or less. Yet, such tariffs have been almost completely absent in the residential sector. In this paper, I present a potential approach to implementing an opt-in dynamic pricing plan that would be equitable to both customers who choose the rate and to those who choose to remain on a default flat-rate tariff. The approach bases the dynamic and the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> on the same underlying cost structure, and minimizes cross-subsidies between the two groups. I study the potential distributional impact of such a tariff structure using hourly consumption data for stratified random samples of customers from California’s two largest utilities. I find that low-income households would, on average, see almost no change in their bills, while low-consumption households would see their bills decline somewhat and high-consumption households would see their bills rise. I also show that the opt-in approach is unlikely to increase the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>charged</b> to other customers {{by more than a}} few percentage points.

50|$|Some {{types of}} calls are not charged, such as local calls (and {{internal}} calls) dialed directly by a telephone subscriber in Canada, the United States, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Ireland or New Zealand (Residential subscribers only).

40|$|The {{recently}} established Cumulus Pricing Scheme (CPS) {{has turned}} out to be a novel approach for efficiently charging differentiated Internet services, based on integrating different time-scales into one edge-pricing mechanism. Depending on an initial specification of expected resource requirements, customer and provider negotiate a contract fixing a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>charge</b> for QoS delivery. As soon as the scheme has started, the customer receives a continuous coarse-grained feedback about her real resource consumption. To this end, over- or underutilization are expressed in terms of Cumulus Points CP, whose accumulation may indicate an imbalance between specified and actually monitored traffic and eventually requires to adapt the contract accordingly. This paper extends the original CPS for services that are characterized not only by their bandwidth or volume requirements, but by general QoS parameters. Starting with a discussion on CPS for different one-dimensional QoS parameters, consequences for the basic CPS mechanism are investigated, covering especially the determination of relevant thresholds for CPs. These investigations deliver crucial input for the specification of multi-dimensional QoS vectors within the initial contract. Suitable metrics are introduced and applied in order to reduce the complexity of the contract as well as of the different monitoring methods. Finally, the implementation of the extended scheme within an Internet Charging System is discussed.

40|$|In {{the post-war}} period, {{there were several}} largely {{unsuccessful}} attempts in England to introduce workable methods to directly tax land value uplifts. Since the 1970 s a system of negotiated project-specific agreements between local planning authorities and developers/landowners has evolved into the sole mechanism by which part of land value uplift ‘released’ by the grant of planning permission is captured by government. In 2010, {{in an attempt to}} simplify and speed up the planning process – negotiated planning obligations were regarded as time-consuming and a brake on development – the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) was introduced. After a slow start, CIL has now been adopted by approximately one third of local authorities. Originally intended as a simple <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>charge</b> to replace planning obligations, CIL now sits alongside that mechanism so that developers pay CIL to help fund infrastructure provision in the locality, whilst planning obligations help mitigate the impact of their development (including the provision of affordable housing). Over the last five years, for political as well as administrative reasons, a series of amendments to CIL and s 106 planning obligations have led to what many regard as a complicated set of regulations. Payment instalment policies, exemptions for small developments and self-build schemes, reliefs for exceptional circumstances and social housing, restrictions on the pooling of planning obligations, the award of credit for re-using vacant buildings, and revenue allocations to neighbourhood groups have been introduced by central government. At the local government level, planning authorities have been adopting more and more nuanced CIL charging schedules with differential rates depending on land use and location to an extent where, in some cases, CIL is more analogous to a development value tax than an infrastructure levy. The experience of running a system of negotiated planning obligations alongside a non-negotiable infrastructure levy offers an opportunity to evaluate these policy shifts in order to assess their strengths and weaknesses and whether there are any wider lessons for international discussions of best practice in land value capture. Drawing on reviews of planning obligations and CIL the paper will consider: how much revenue has been raised and how is it being used; whether developer contributions vary depending on where and when development takes place; the types of development that generate developer contributions and how the amount of developer contributions is assessed...|$|E

This paper attempts to analyze factors promoting Japanese mobile phone, focusing on 3 G technologies. Factors promoting it can be summarized as follows: (1) deregulations by government, such as MNP (Mobile Number Portability) and collocation; (2) competition among carriers, such as introduction of new charge plans; (3) technological development, such as connection speed; and (4) contents and applications. This paper utilizes the panel data of three main carriers of the mobile phone market, namely, NTTdocomo, au (KDDI), and Softbank. As for a model for estimation, we apply that of Madden and Coble-Neal [2004] which studied the relationship between fixed and mobile phone with the panel data by the dynamic random effects estimation. Dynamic models are based {{not only on the}} assumption such that carriers do not instantaneously adjust to satisfy their long-term demand but also on network externalities. Besides, the paper applies a dynamic panel data model in order {{to take care of the}} endogeneity problem. This paper deals with this problem rigorously by applying Arellano-Bond estimator (Arellano and Bond [1991] and Arellano and Bover [1995]) which estimates exogeneous or predetermined variables, in addition to instrumental variables, using the two-step generalized method of moments (GMM).

40|$|Hobart is {{the only}} capital city in Australia where water is {{supplied}} to the consumers unmetered. A <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> is <b>charged</b> annually in return for which consumers may take virtually unlimited water. There {{seems to be a}} prevalent belief that water should not be sold to the community of Hobart on the basis of consumption because of the natural abundance of water in Tasmania. This view is reflected in the 'requirements approach' used by the Metropolitan Water Board in planning supply expansions. What is little realised is that the source of Hobart's water (although virtually inexhaustible) is situated a fairly great distance away from the metropolitan area. Transporting water through pipelines over long distances is not a cost-less affair and by virtue of this fact, water must be looked upon and treated as an economic good. This study has a three-fold objective. Firstly, it is to examine the efficacy of the present investment criteria used by the Metropolitan Water Board. The potential of the requirements approoch to allocate society's resources efficiently is assessed. The price variable is suggested as a means of exercising water demand management and the second objective is to compare the efficiency of a marginal cost pricing approach with the requirements approach in 0 tel s of resource allocation. Finally, no matter how superior a marginal cost pricing policy may be to the present flat-rate policy theoretically, it needs to be proven that the costs involved in implementing such a scheme do not outweigh the benefits. To this end, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted to determine whether or-not universal metering should be introduced in Hobart.
