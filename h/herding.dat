5|$|An {{argument}} against <b>herding</b> is that juvenile remains are very uncommon at this site, unlike modern cases with herd mortality. They more likely were the periodic victims of flash floods whose carcasses accumulated {{in a lake}} or marshy setting. The Nehden find, however, with its greater span of individual ages, more even mix of Dollodon or Mantellisaurus to Iguanodon bernissartensis, and confined geographic nature, may record mortality of <b>herding</b> animals migrating through rivers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the changes in production, <b>herd</b> health and {{veterinary}} treatments in Danish organic dairy <b>herds</b> during approximately eleven years based on historic data from <b>herds</b> converted to organic milk production before 1990 (old organic <b>herds)</b> compared to <b>herds</b> converted in 1995 and 1999 - 2000 and <b>herds</b> that are still conventional. <b>Herd</b> size, milk production, {{the shape of the}} lactation curve, somatic cell counts and veterinary treatments for mastitis, retained placenta and ketosis are compared over time and between <b>herd</b> groups. The old organic <b>herds</b> differed from the other three <b>herd</b> groups by having lower milk production per cow, lower somatic cell counts and fewer treatments of mastitis. <b>Herds</b> converted in 1995 and 1999 - 2000 were comparable to the conventional <b>herds</b> before conversion for all analyzed parameters. However, <b>herd</b> size was larger than both the older organic <b>herds</b> and the conventional <b>herds</b> after conversion. Production was about 2 kg energy corrected milk lower per cow per day than before conversion and compared to the conventional <b>herds.</b> In the <b>herds</b> converted in 1999 - 2000 little difference could be seen in relation to udder health after conversion when compared to conventional <b>herds.</b> The organic <b>herds</b> had fewer treatments for retained placenta and ketosis than the conventional <b>herds.</b> The shape of the lactation curves changed over the 11 year period with better persistency from day 60 to day 305 in all <b>herd</b> groups except for the old organic <b>herds,</b> which had the best persistency in 1990. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the dynamics and control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) in the pig population of Great Britain (GB). The roles of the metapopulation of pig <b>herds</b> (metaherd) and individual <b>herd</b> characteristics are examined, and different control and intervention strategies assessed. A novel stochastic model of a metaherd was created, incorporating the births, deaths, slaughter, culls and movement of pigs within and between <b>herds.</b> The metaherd was structured to have characteristics representative of the GB metaherd: the distribution of <b>herd</b> sizes, ‘source’ <b>herds</b> per <b>herd,</b> and numbers of pigs moved per movement. The metaherd was arranged into a typical pyramidal structure. A stochastic infectious process of PRRSV was included. <b>Herd</b> size {{was found to be}} key to within <b>herd</b> persistence of PRRSV, with infection failing to persist in smaller (250 sow) <b>herds.</b> Fadeout did not occur in larger <b>herds</b> once infection established in the rearing <b>herd.</b> PRRSV reduces productivity of <b>herds</b> and the metaherd. There was variability in productivity both between <b>herds</b> and within <b>herds</b> over time. The number of source <b>herds</b> did not influence the dynamics, persistence or prevalence of infection within a <b>herd.</b> Breeding <b>herd</b> production was further decreased by PRRSV when the <b>herd</b> also had a rearing <b>herd</b> (breeder finisher). The model was extended to test the effects of control and intervention strategies. Vaccination effect increased with <b>herd</b> size, and reduced variability in production. Vaccination in small <b>herds</b> was ineffective in increasing production due to PRRSV failing to persist regardless of vaccination. Vaccination of the breeding <b>herd</b> produced higher gains per vaccine dose than vaccination of the rearing <b>herd</b> only. Vaccination of the rearing <b>herd</b> only resulted in higher total <b>herd</b> and metaherd gains, with less variability. Partial de-population combined with vaccination increased the probability of increasing <b>herd</b> performance unless the <b>herd</b> was small (1000 sows). Results highlighted the value of modelling to support the decisions of individual farmers to vaccinate and partially depopulate, showing that the optimal decision is influenced by the <b>herd</b> size. Results also demonstrated that the decision to introduce interventions is different for individual farmers...|$|R

5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use <b>herding</b> dogs in this effort, with a highly bred <b>herding</b> ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E
5|$|The Sami peoples {{were subject}} to forced collectivization, {{with more than half}} of their {{reindeer}} herds collectivized in 1928–1930. In addition, the traditional Sami <b>herding</b> practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free <b>herding.</b> Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the <b>herding</b> practices, this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional <b>herding</b> knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero, which became the cultural center of the Sami people in Russia. Those Sami resisting the collectivization {{were subject to}} forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin's death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in urbanized areas, although some herd reindeer across much of the region.|$|E

40|$|The {{results from}} the Danish {{serological}} Salmonella surveillance on meat juice from slaughter pigs in the <b>herd</b> types: conventional <b>herds,</b> organic <b>herds,</b> free-range <b>herds</b> and breeder <b>herds</b> were compared. Seropositive samples were found in all <b>herd</b> types. The relative risk for a sample to be seropositive in free-range <b>herds</b> was 1. 7 compared to conventional <b>herds</b> (p=O,OOOI) when confounder control for <b>herd</b> size was applied. An apparent increased risk in organic <b>herds</b> and reduced risk in breeder <b>herds</b> were not statistically significant. The analysis of results from organic <b>herds</b> was based on relatively few samples. Due to the expected increase in number of alternative production systems and difficulties in application of the full panel of recommendations for reduction of the Salmonella infection in these <b>herds,</b> future studies should focus on identification of specific Salmonella risk factors within alternative production systems and develop new tools based on this knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Successful {{management}} of <b>herds</b> of captive wildlife (small populations) requires monitoring of <b>herd</b> size over years. In many zoos, <b>herd</b> size is {{documented in the}} course of annual inventories without considering other epidemiological parameters. Here, the concept of the ‘anti-clockwise cycle’ of the relation between mortality and population size is introduced for <b>herd</b> management. Four different phases of this cycle can be distinguished: (I) <b>herd</b> size increases while mortality decreases; (II) <b>herd</b> size and mortality increase; (III) <b>herd</b> size decreases and mortality still increases; (IV) <b>herd</b> size and mortality decrease. Consequently, a <b>herd</b> can still prosper in size (I, II) while an increase in mortality rates (II) already indicates that it is heading towards collapse (III). All four phases of the cycle of <b>herd</b> development could be observed in 28 small, closed ruminant breeding groups at the Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation, Qatar. Applications of the concept presented here to evaluate <b>herd</b> development in captivity may help to stabilize or even increase the size of a <b>herd</b> in care, which is particularly important for breeding <b>herds</b> of threatened species. The ‘anti-clockwise cycle’ shows that a simple monitoring of the <b>herd</b> size in numbers is not enough to evaluate the sustainability and quality of the <b>herd...</b>|$|R

In total, 280 cattle had been introduced into 22 <b>herds</b> at an average rate of 0. 33 animals per year per 100 cattle present in the 206 <b>herds.</b> Assuming a random herd-contact structure, the observed rate of cattle transfers between certified 'Map-free' <b>herds</b> was sufficiently low to relax the surveillance scheme to biennial <b>herd</b> examinations by pooled fecal culture of all cattle > or = 2 years of age.
