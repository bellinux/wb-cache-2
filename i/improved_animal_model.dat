40|$|Epilepsy {{in women}} is {{influenced}} by endocrine status and antiepileptic drugs, but without an animal model, the effects of endocrine variables and antiepileptic drugs cannot be easily dissociated from the influence of epilepsy itself. Animal models have had limited utility because experimentally induced seizures typically result in reproductive failure. This {{study was conducted to}} develop an <b>improved</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model.</b> The muscarinic convulsant pilocarpine was used to elicit status epilepticus (SE) in adult female Sprague Dawley rats. The selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene was administered 30 min before pilocarpine. An anticonvulsant barbiturate, pentobarbital, was injected 5 – 10 min after the onset of SE and at least once thereafter to minimize acute convulsions. Mortality, morbidity, estrous cyclicity, and the ultimate success of the procedure (i. e. induction of recurrent, spontaneous seizures) were monitored. The combination of raloxifene and pentobarbital led to significantly improved estrous cyclicity compared with previous methods. Animals treated with raloxifene and pentobarbital became epileptic, as defined by the recurrence of spontaneous convulsions in the weeks after SE. The results of this study provide an <b>improved</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> to examine the interactions between seizures and ovarian hormone secretion. The results also suggest that treatment of SE with raloxifene may benefit women with SE...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Development of an <b>improved</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> for {{studying}} skin burns in rats. METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar rats {{were randomly assigned}} to four groups (n= 6) : G 1 -Control, G 2 - T 100 °C, G 3 -T 150 °C and G 4 -T 200 °C. Two 10 x 10 mm squares were outlined with a sterile surgical marker on each side and along the vertebral column using a prepared template positioned between the anterior and posterior limbs. G 2 -G 4 rats were subjected to 100 °C, 150 °C and 200 ºC thermal burns, respectively. G 1 rats served as controls. Burns were inflicted by applying a copper plate connected to an electronic temperature controlling device to the dorsal skin of anesthetized rats. Four burns were produced on each animal (total area: 4 cm²/animal) leaving about 1 cm of undamaged skin between burn areas. Analgesia was administered during 24 h after burn injury by adding 30 mg codeine phosphate hemihydrate to 500 ml tap water. RESULTS: The application of 100 °C and 150 ºC resulted in partial thickness skin burns with central reepithelialization of the burned area only at 100 °C. In G 4 group the whole thickness of the skin was injured without central reepithelialization. However, there was marginal reepithelialization in all groups. CONCLUSION: The model studied is inexpensive and easily reproducible, enabling the achievement of controlled burns with partial or total impairment of the skin in experimental animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{dysfunction}} of the apical myocardium {{is observed}} following chronic exposure to catecholamines, or after acutely stressful scenarios, in the syndrome of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The physiological {{functions of the}} β 2 AR were assessed via measurement of cell shortening; β 2 AR-cAMP signalling was assessed by FRET microscopy, comparing cells from the apical and basal myocardium. The effects of pre-stimulation of the β 2 AR {{with high levels of}} endogenous catecholamines were investigated to simulate pathological scenarios. The structure of the cellular membranes of cells from different myocardial regions was assessed and manipulated to investigate their role in β 2 AR signalling. An <b>improved</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> of the regional pathology in Takotsubo was investigated using ovariectomized female rats. Apical cardiomyocytes are sensitized to β 2 AR stimulation, displaying larger increases in inotropy and lusitropy in comparison to basal cells. This was not due to differences in cAMP levels induced by β 2 AR within the cell cytosol. Differences were apparent in the amount of cAMP reaching the RII-PKA domains (the main arbiters of cellular inotropy and lusitropy). β 2 AR-cAMP signalling was discovered to be more persistent in the apical cardiomyocytes. Basal cardiomyocytes were found to have a larger number of caveolae within their membranes, caveolae have been demonstrated to modulate β 2 AR. Following the disruption of caveolar domains via chelation of cholesterol, apical and basal responses to β 2 AR stimulation were equalized; inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 had the same effect. Catecholamine pre-stimulation reduced β 2 AR responses; adrenaline pre-stimulation exerts a more Gi-dependent desensitization than noradrenaline. Female rats are shown to be relatively protected from the effects of adrenergic overstimulation and ovariectomized female rats suffer acutely high mortality. Cells from different regions of the myocardium may control their receptor signalling in different ways to produce desirable physiological activity. In settings of pathology this phenomena may leave certain regions vulnerable to damage. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmacology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is {{an anxiety}} {{disorder}} precipitated {{by exposure to}} a severe traumatic event. Given the socio-economic impact of the disorder, and the increasing rates of trauma worldwide, PTSD is set to become a major global health problem. There exists a clear need {{for the development of}} drug treatments specifically for PTSD, yet the neurobiology of the disorder remains to be completely elucidated. In this regard, animal models are critical tools {{in the study of the}} pathophysiological mechanisms of stress, as well as in the testing of potential drug treatments. These animal models should be well-validated, reliable and generalisable (factors that are often overlooked in validation studies) to ensure that findings from the models will be meaningful and that research animals are not used unnecessarily. Earlier behavioural, endocrine and pharmacological studies in our laboratory had established that the time-dependent sensitisation (TDS) model (single prolonged stress + re-stress) presents with noteworthy construct-, face- and predictive validity. However, subsequent studies in our laboratory and elsewhere have yielded contrasting or inconclusive results, especially with regard to behavioural changes. The primary aim of the current study was therefore to re-investigate the TDS model as analogous PTSD model, with regard to cognitive performance, anxiety-like behaviour and endocrine function. The original validation was also extended by examining arousal behaviour and the influence of chronic fluoxetine administration on TDS-induced endocrine changes. Furthermore, the robustness of the model was investigated by subjecting it to more stringent testing, using a greater range of parameters and criteria provided by computerised behavioural monitoring with powerful software. The reliability and generalisability of the TDS model was also studied by comparing results obtained from the current study with those from the original validation study. Finally, with the increasing importance of neuronal plasticity and resilience in stress-related disorders and antidepressant action, the effects of TDS stress on a broad range of cellular plasticity and resilience proteins was studied in selected limbic brain regions, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats were left undisturbed (controls) or subjected to the TDS model consisting of a single prolonged stress (SPS) (2 hours restraint, 15 minutes forced swim, halothane exposure) and a re-stress (RS) (20 minutes forced swim) 7 days later. Seven days after the re-stress, animals were tested for spatial learning and memory, anxiety-like behaviour or arousal in the Morris Water maze (MWM), elevated plus maze (EPM) or acoustic startle response (ASR), respectively. The activity of endocrine function as measured by plasma corticosterone was also investigated in control and TDS behavioural test exposed (Sprague-Dawley and Wistar), test naive (Sprague-Dawley and Wistar) and test naive saline or fluoxetine treated (Wistar) rats. Finally, the expression of selected cellular plasticity and resilience proteins was determined by Western blot in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of test naive Wistar rats. In contrast to the findings of the original validation studies, TDS stress failed to have a marked effect on spatial learning and memory and anxiety-like behaviour, suggesting a lack of reliability and generalisability of the TDS model. In the extended characterisation of the model, TDS stress also did not induce any significant changes in arousal. Data from the behavioural studies indicate a lack of robustness of the TDS model, which may be due to habituation to the re-stress procedure. TDS stress was, however, able to significantly (bidirectionally) alter endocrine function, while TDS stress induced suppression of corticosterone was prevented by chronic fluoxetine administration. These data suggest face validity, as well as possible construct- and predictive validity for the TDS model with regard to endocrine function. Finally, while fluoxetine had notable effects on the expression, phosphorylation and/or relative activation of cellular plasticity and resilience proteins tested, TDS stress failed to have a marked effect on these same proteins. However, the latter negative findings may not necessarily be an indication of a lack in validity or robustness of the TDS model. Although the TDS model demonstrated face validity, as well as possible construct- and predictive validity in terms of endocrine function, data from the behavioural studies suggest that the model lacks reliability and generalisibility and hence, relevance. The current data suggest that improvements to the model include omission of the re-stress procedure, or alternatively, replacement of the re-stress with a situational reminder of the SPS. The effects of stress on cellular plasticity and resilience proteins warrant further investigation with such an <b>improved</b> <b>animal</b> <b>model.</b> In conclusion, the current study therefore serves to highlight the importance of thorough validation of any behavioural animal model, especially confirmation by investigators other than those involved in the original studies.

In this study, we compared the standard acute TMA-induced CHS in Balb/c mice with subacute and chronic models of TMA-induced ear inflammation. Compared to the acute model, the chronic CHS model more closely reflects characteristics of AD, such as typical morphological changes of the inflamed skin, strong infiltration with T cells, major histocompatibility complex II-positive cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, a T-helper cell-type (Th) 2 cytokine profile and a strong increase of serum IgE levels. Moreover, a strong lymph node involvement with T-helper cell dominance and a mixed Th 1 /Th 2 T-cell differentiation and activation pattern was demonstrated. Importantly, as demonstrated by successful therapy with prednisolone, the chronic TMA-induced CHS model, in contrast to acute and subacute models, made prolonged therapeutic treatment of a pre-established skin inflammation possible.

Lack of thymosin β 4 in nephrotoxic nephritis led to the redistribution of podocytes from the glomerular tuft toward the Bowman capsule suggesting a role for thymosin β 4 in the migration of these cells. Thymosin β 4 knockdown in cultured podocytes also increased migration in a wound-healing assay, accompanied by F-actin rearrangement and increased RhoA activity.

40|$|Abstract <b>Animal</b> <b>models</b> play {{a central}} role in all areas of {{biomedical}} research. The process of <b>animal</b> <b>model</b> building, development and evaluation has rarely been addressed systematically, despite the long history of using <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioral dysfunctions. An iterative, multi-stage trajectory for developing <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> and assessing their quality is proposed. The process starts with defining the purpose(s) of the model, preferentially based on hypotheses about brain-behavior relationships. Then, the model is developed and tested. The evaluation of the model takes scientific and ethical criteria into consideration. Model development requires a multidisciplinary approach. Preclinical and clinical experts should establish a set of scientific criteria, which a model must meet. The scientific evaluation consists of assessing the replicability/reliability, predictive, construct and external validity/generalizability, and relevance of the model. We emphasize the role of (systematic and extended) replications in the course of the validation process. One may apply a multiple-tiered 'replication battery' to estimate the reliability/replicability, validity, and generalizability of result. Compromised welfare is inherent in many deficiency <b>models</b> in <b>animals.</b> Unfortunately, 'animal welfare' is a vaguely defined concept, making it difficult to establish exact evaluation criteria. Weighing the animal's welfare and considerations as to whether action is indicated to reduce the discomfort must accompany the scientific evaluation at any stage of the model building and evaluation process. <b>Animal</b> <b>model</b> building should be discontinued if the model does not meet the preset scientific criteria, or when animal welfare is severely compromised. The application of the evaluation procedure is exemplified using the rat with neonatal hippocampal lesion as a proposed model of schizophrenia. In a manner congruent to that for <b>improving</b> <b>animal</b> <b>models,</b> guided by the procedure expounded upon in this paper, the developmental and evaluation procedure itself may be improved by careful definition of the purpose(s) of a model and by defining better evaluation criteria, based on the proposed use of the model. </p...|$|R

Serum resistance of gonococci is restored in these sera by human C 4 BP and/or fH Direct binding specificity of human and chimpanzee C 4 BP and human fH to gonococci may explain, in part, species-specific restriction of natural gonococcal infection and address why Por 1 B, but not Por 1 A containing gonococcal strains, {{have been successful in}} experimental chimpanzee infection. Our findings may help to <b>improve</b> <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> for gonorrhea while also having implications in the choice of complement sources to evaluate neisserial vaccine candidates.

Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million people in the world. The present article reviews the scientific rationale, brief pathophysiology of epilepsy and newer antiepileptic drugs which are presently under clinical development. We have searched the investigational drugs using the key words ‘antiepileptic drugs,’ ‘epilepsy,’ ‘Phase I,’ ‘Phase II’ and ‘Phase III’ in American clinical trial registers (clinicaltrials. gov), the relevant published articles using National Library of Medicine's PubMed database, company websites and supplemented results with a manual search of cross-references and conference abstracts. This review provides a brief description about the antiepileptic drugs which are targeting different mechanisms and the clinical development status of these drugs. Besides the presence of old as well as new AEDs, still there is a need of new drugs or the modified version of old drugs in order to make affected people free of seizures. An optimistic approach should be used to translate the success of preclinical testing to clinical practice. There is an urgent need to <b>improve</b> <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> and to explore new targets with better understanding in order to develop the novel drugs with more efficacy and safety...|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{developed}} an experimental canine {{model in which}} four types of aneurysm—bifurcation, side-wall, small branch-artery, and arterial-stump—were surgically created in the same animal. These experimental aneurysms are exposed to simultaneous but different hemodynamic stresses correlating to human intracranial aneurysms in different locations. Because this model allowed {{for the creation of}} four aneurysms, each with different hemody-namic features, it seems to offer advantages from ones previously described. This model may foster investigation of new and current endovascular devices. <b>Improved</b> experimental <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of current and new endovascular devices to treat intracranial aneurysms. Experimental aneurysms have been created to simu...|$|R
40|$|A new {{tuberculosis}} vaccine {{is needed to}} replace or enhance BCG, which induces variable protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis pulmonary infections in adults. Development of new TB vaccine candidates is severely hampered {{by the lack of}} a correlate of immunity, unproven <b>animal</b> <b>models,</b> and limited funding opportunities. One candidate, MVA 85 A, recently failed to meet its efficacy endpoint goals despite promising early-phase trial data. As a result, some in the field believe we should now shift our focus away from product development and toward a research-oriented approach. Here, we outline our suggestions for this research-oriented strategy including diversification of the candidate pipeline, expanding measurements of immunity, <b>improving</b> pre-clinical <b>animal</b> <b>models,</b> and investing in combination pre-clinical/experimental medicine studies. As with any evolution, this change in strategy comes at a cost but may also represent an opportunity for advancing the field...|$|R
40|$|In 1993, several groups, working independently, {{reported}} the successful generation of transgenic mice with yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) using standard techniques. The transfer of these large fragments of cloned genomic DNA correlated with optimal expression {{levels of the}} transgenes, irrespective of their location in the host gen-ome. Thereafter, other groups confirmed the advantages of YAC transgenesis and position-independent and copy number-dependent transgene expression were demonstrated in most cases. The transfer of YACs to the germ line of mice has become popular in many transgenic facilities to guarantee faithful expression of transgenes. This tech-nique was rapidly exported to livestock and soon transgenic rabbits, pigs and other mammals were produced with YACs. Transgenic animals were also produced with bacterial or P 1 -derived artificial chromosomes (BACs/PACs) with similar success. The use of YACs, BACs and PACs in transgenesis has allowed the discovery of new genes by complementation of mutations, the identification of key regulatory sequences within genomic loci that are crucial for the proper expression of genes and the design of <b>improved</b> <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> of human genetic diseases. Transgenesis with artificial chromosomes has proven useful {{in a variety of}} biological, medical and biotechnological applications and is considered a major breakthrough in the generation of transgenic animals. In this report, we will review the recent history of YAC/BAC/PAC-transgenic animals indicating their benefits and the potential problem...|$|R
40|$|A {{tetracycline}} resistant Campylobacter jejuni clone, C. jejuni clone SA (SA {{for sheep}} abortion) has replaced C. fetus as the predominant Campylobacter species causing sheep abortion in the United States. The pathogenesis of placental infection caused by this agent and {{the mechanism of}} abortion induction are unknown. A primary objective of these studies (chapters 2 - 5) was to attempt to elucidate {{important aspects of the}} pathogenesis of C. jejuni clone SA on the pregnant uterus. Towards this end, several components of this research attempted to characterize aspects of the cellular and molecular pathology of C. jejuni clone SA in the fetoplacental unit and to <b>improve</b> <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> used to study the pathogenesis of this disease. It was found that pregnant laboratory mice {{can be used as a}} model to study the reproductive pathology of C. jejuni IA 3902, a representative isolate of clone SA, using the endpoint of positive microbial culture of the organism from the fetoplacental unit. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were produced from the C. jejuni infected murine placenta and these could be quantitated in the maternal serum and semi-quantitated in infected reproductive tissues using in situ hybridization. Fetoplacental infection in sheep was established and abortion was induced following intravenous inoculation of C. jejuni IA 3902. Sheep placenta infected with C. jejuni IA 3902 demonstrated increased caspase 3 expression from stromal cells and trophoblasts and increased expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) from trophoblasts of the chorioallantoic membranes...|$|R
40|$|Sperm tests {{provide a}} direct and {{effective}} way of identifying chemical agents that induce spermatogenic damage in man. Four human sperm tests are available: sperm count, motility, morphology (seminal cytology) and the Y-body test. These sperm tests have numerous advantages over other approaches for assessing spermatogenic damage, and they have already been {{used to assess the}} effects of at least 85 different occupational, environmental, and drug-related chemical exposures. When carefully controlled, seminal cytology appears to be statistically more sensitive than the other human sperm tests and should be considered an integral part of semen analysis when assessing induced spermatogenic damage. Human sperm studies have complex requirements and, before sampling, careful consideration should be given to exposure details, group size and makeup, as well as animal and human data that indicate spermatogenic effects. Several study designs are possible and should include questionnaires covering medical and reproductive histories as well as known confounding factors. Animal sperm tests, such as the mouse morphology test, may be used to identify the toxic components of a complex mixture. Animal tests may also help assess the chemical effects on fertility and reproductive outcome in cases when human data are incomplete. Further efforts are needed in these areas to develop improved human sperm tests sensitive to induced spermatogenic damage, to develop <b>improved</b> <b>animal</b> <b>models</b> of induced spermatogenic damage, to understand the relationships among sperm changes, fertility, and reproductive outcome, and to develop sperm tests with express mutational end points...|$|R
