40|$|Due to {{the high}} level of {{investment}} needed in countries such as e. g. Europe and Asia, there is an increasing demand for machines for the manufacture of rails, railway wheels and railway axles. At the moment railway axles are in most cases forged in a series of different forming processes. In an initial rolling process for example possible defects in the starting material are closed {{in order to get a}} homogenous microstructure. In a subsequent forging process, due to the low depth penetration capacity of the plants used, only the contouring of the axle is carried out. The SMS Meer presentation shows that using the SMX hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> <b>machine</b> from SMS Meer it is possible to produce railway axles in a single forming process. This means that pore-free railway axles with an excellent microstructure can be produced from conventional continuous cast material without any upstream rolling process being required. Using the hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> <b>machine,</b> continuous cast carbon steel with defects running in an axial direction can be forged into a railway twin axle in only one heat. The high forming potential of the hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> <b>machine</b> makes this possible. The analyses with regard to microstructure, grain size and pore detection will show very good results. In the zone with the least degree of forming, a homogeneous microstructure evenly distributed across the radius was achieved. The average grain size of 8. 5 (ASTM) is likewise evenly distributed across the radius. An ultrasonic analysis of the forged axles showed that there are no pores larger than 3 mm. As these results are very promising, the forging time will be optimized in subsequent tests and the forged axles will be finish machined for a final analysis in accordance with the railway standard...|$|E

40|$|Rotary forging process, {{in spite}} of its various advantages, has still not reached {{industrial}} production scale owing to its complex nature. With the advent of sophisticated finite-element modelling capabilities, it is now possible to make rotary forging more predictable and optimise it for industrial production standards.

40|$|The {{quality of}} forged {{components}} is strictly {{dependent on the}} micro-structural phenomena occurring during the manufacturing chain that may cause {{significant changes in the}} physical and mechanical features of the final product. Some of these changes take place during the deformation phase and depend on the forming machine characteristics in term of machine kinematics, total elastic deflections of the press system and contact-time. The press stiffness influences the velocity-versus-time curve under load, varying the contact pressure and the heat transfer between the tools and the workpiece and, consequently, the global process conditions.

Initially, some important forging terms that are widely used in this field are discussed. A brief description about classification of forging process on the basis of temperature of work piece (hot, cold, and warm forging) and on the basis of arrangement of dies (open, impression and closed-die forging) is given. Die design parameters, die material requirements and selection of proper die materials are briefly discussed. Also, briefly described the forging equipments (hammer and press). Factors for selection of <b>forging</b> <b>machine,</b> characteristics and common applications of forging are given. Forging defects those are repeatedly occurring are discussed along with their causes and remedies. Then the fish-bone diagram is used to explore the possible causes of defects like unfilling, mismatch and scale pits through a brainstorming session and to determine the causes, which may has the greatest effect. Finally, it is concluded that the forging process gives better quality product than the part produced by any other processes with implementation of preventive actions to reduce the rejection rate...|$|E
5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was marked with the {{appearance}} of hydraulic forging presses that started to replace hammers at forging works. Forging in forging presses is carried out by two dies of which one makes reciprocal movements and the other one remains stationary. This is the reason for relatively low productivity and high labour intensity of conventional forging in presses. The forging of low-ductility and hard-to-deform steels and alloys by two dies using conventional forging methods is very difficult and sometimes is practically impossible because of high tensile stresses in deformation zone leading to various forging defects and high percentage of rejected products.In the 1970s the mechanical radial <b>forging</b> <b>machines</b> (RFM) started to be used for the large-scale production of long-axis forgings where a work piece is reduced in radial directions simultaneously by several pairs of dies. The process of radial forging in mechanical RFM features high productivity of forging. However small single reductions of a work piece restricted by the design of these machines lead to localization of strains mainly in surface zones of the work piece while metal in the core zone remains unworked. [...] In 80-90s hydro-mechanical and hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> <b>machines</b> appeared that do not have the disadvantages inherent to mechanical RFM. Nevertheless, radial <b>forging</b> <b>machines</b> are very specific and very expensive equipment in comparison with multipurpose forging presses. The application of such machines at enterprises {{with a wide range of}} forgings manufactured is economically disadvantageous and inexpedient.The problem of manufacturing long-axis forgings by radial forging method in open-die hydraulic forging presses can be solved with use of multi-die forging devices. First such devices different in design and principle of operation appeared in the 1980s. At present, the most widespread and famous is the four-die forging device of the above described design engineered by Ukrainian and Russian scientists. The four-die forging devices have no analogues in the world now. They are successfully used at works in Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China and Germany.|$|R
