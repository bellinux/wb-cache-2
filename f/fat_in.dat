5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight at}} Phou Pha Thi, which {{was part of}} a larger {{military}} campaign waged by the North Vietnamese and their Pathet Lao allies, marked the beginning of the Communist dry-season offensive against Laotian Government forces in northeastern Laos. By September 1968, the strength of North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in the Sam Neua area were estimated to have numbered more than 20 battalions. Against such heavy odds, General Vang Pao insisted on recapturing Phou Pha Thi, which the U.S. Embassy believed unnecessary. On 1November1968, Pao launched Operation Pig <b>Fat</b> <b>in</b> attempt to retake Phou Pha Thi, but the operation quickly turned into a rout of the Royal Laos Army and the Hmong guerrillas and Phou Pha Thi was never retaken.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or <b>fat,</b> <b>in</b> which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

25|$|Unhomogenized {{milk and}} cream contain {{butterfat}} in microscopic globules. These globules are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids (fatty acid emulsifiers) and proteins, which prevent the <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> milk from pooling together into a single mass.

Variations in the production method will create butters with different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the finished product. Butter contains <b>fat</b> <b>in</b> three separate forms: free butterfat, butterfat crystals, and undamaged fat globules.

40|$|Background: The {{observation}} of <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> different organs at pediatric autopsy may {{help determine the}} cause of death. However, a comprehensive study on fat accumulation and related etiologies is still lacking. Aim: To investigate the incidence of <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> different organs in pediatric autopsies and their relevance to the cause of death. Methods: From February 2004 until March 2015, fat accumulation was assessed in 561 routinely performed pediatric autopsies in our center. Age at death ranged from 14 weeks of gestation for fetuses to 16 years. Samples of liver, heart, kidney, and muscle were stained with Oil-Red-O and scored for fat accumulation by one pediatric pathologist. Results: <b>Fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> > 1 organ(s) was present in 132 (39. 8 %) of 332 prenatal cases. Only 3 (0. 9 %) had <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> all 4 organs. For postnatal cases, <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> > 1 organ(s) was present in 106 (46. 3 %) of 229 postnatal cases. Only 12 (5. 2 %) had <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> all 4 organs. Fat accumulation was mostly seen in liver, both in prenatal and postnatal cases. Fatty acid oxidation disorders were the only cause of death associated with severe <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> all 4 organs. No other etiologies could be linked directly to distribution or severity of fat accumulation. Conclusion: Severe <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> at least 4 organs is a rare finding in pediatric autopsies, whereas <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> only the liver is relatively common. Severe <b>fat</b> accumulation <b>in</b> both liver, muscle, kidney, and heart was only seen in cases with fatty acid oxidation disorders...|$|R
