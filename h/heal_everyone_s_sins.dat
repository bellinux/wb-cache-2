40|$|Abstract Background The 11 <b>S</b> {{globulin}} <b>Sin</b> a 2 is {{a marker}} to predict severity of symptoms in mustard allergic patients. The potential implication of Sin a 2 in cross-reactivity with tree nuts and peanut {{has not been}} investigated so far. In this work, we studied at the IgG and IgE level {{the involvement of the}} 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>Sin</b> a 2 in cross-reactivity among mustard, tree nuts and peanut. Methods Eleven well-characterized mustard-allergic patients sensitized to Sin a 2 were included in the study. A specific anti-Sin a 2 serum was obtained in rabbit. Skin prick tests (SPT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting and IgG or IgE-inhibition immunoblotting experiments using purified Sin a 2, Sin a 1, Sin a 3, mustard, almond, hazelnut, pistachio, walnut or peanut extracts were performed. Results The rabbit anti-Sin a 2 serum showed high affinity and specificity to Sin a 2, which allowed us to demonstrate that Sin a 2 shares IgG epitopes with allergenic 11 S globulins from tree nuts (almond, hazelnut, pistachio and walnut) but not from peanut. All the patients included in the study had positive skin prick test to tree nuts and/or peanut and we subdivided them into two different groups according to their clinical symptoms after ingestion of such allergenic sources. We showed that 11 S globulins contain conserved IgE epitopes involved in cross-reactivity among mustard, tree nuts and peanut as well as species-specific IgE epitopes. Conclusions The allergenic 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>Sin</b> a 2 from mustard is involved in cross-reactivity at the IgE level with tree nuts and peanut. Although the clinical relevance of the cross-reactive IgE epitopes present in 11 S globulins needs to be investigated in further detail, our results contribute to improve the diagnosis and management of mustard allergic patients sensitized to Sin a 2. </p...|$|R

Os mesmo foram inseridos perpendicularmente em osso cortical suíno e levados à máquina universal de ensaios mecânicos Emic DL 10. 000, a uma velocidade de 0, 5 mm por minuto. Foi avaliada a força necessária para deformar os mini-implantes em 0, 5, 1, 1, 5, 2 mm e para fratura. Os dados foram analisados pela análise da variância (ANOVA) e teste de Tukey. RESULTADOS: os mini-implantes do grupo S necessitaram força maior para que ocorresse deformação e fratura, esses resultados foram estatisticamente significativos em relação aos demais (p 0, 05). Para fraturar, o grupo T apresentou os menores valores, com diferença estatística com os grupos M, S e I. CONCLUSÕES: pode-se concluir que o formato do mini-implante está diretamente relacionado com sua resistência. Apesar de diferenças existentes quanto à resistência entre eles, todos se mostraram aptos para a utilização clínica. OBJECTIVE: The {{objective of}} the present study is to assess both deformation and fracture of orthodontic mini-implants of different trade marks by submitting them to loads perpendicularly applied along their lengths. METHODS: A total of 75 mini-implants were divided into five groups (n = 15) according to their manufacturers: group M (Mondeal, Tuttlingen, Germany), group N (Neodent, Curitiba, Brazil), group I (INP, São Paulo, Brazil), group <b>S</b> (<b>SIN,</b> São Paulo, Brazil), and group F (Titanium Fix, São José dos Campos, Brazil). The mini-implants were perpendicularly inserted into swine cortical bones and then submitted to mechanical tests by using a universal testing machine (Emic DL 10. 000) at cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The force required for deforming and fracturing the mini-implants at 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mm was assessed. Data were assessed by using variance analysis (ANOVA) and Tukey's test. RESULTS: Mini-implants of group S were found to need higher forces to be deformed and fractured in comparison with other groups whose mini-implants were submitted to lower forces, a result that is statistically significant (p 0. 05), whereas group T had the lowest values regarding fracture with statistical differences compared to groups M, S, and I. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present study, one can conclude that the shape of the mini-implants is directly related to their flexural strength.

40|$|Prior to Protestant {{reforms of}} {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries, Catholic clerics {{frequently}} preached about the necessity of confessing one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sins</b> to a priest through the sacrament of penance. After the passage of laws in the 1570 s making it a criminal offense to be a Catholic priest in England, Catholics residing in Protestant England possessed limited opportunities to make confession to a priest. Many laypersons feared for their souls. This article examines literature written by English Catholic clerics to comfort such laypersons. These authors re-interpreted traditional Catholic understandings of how sacramental penance delivers grace to allow English Catholics to confess when priests were not present. These authors—clerics themselves—used the printed word to stand in for the usual parish priest to whom a Catholic would confess. They legitimized their efforts by appealing to the church 2 ̆ 7 s modus operandi of allowing alternative means to receive grace in cases of extreme emergency. Although suggestions to confess without a priest 2 ̆ 7 s mediation sound similar to Protestant views on penitence, these authors 2 ̆ 7 prescriptions differ from Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican, and post-Tridentine Catholic positions on penance in the Reformation era.
