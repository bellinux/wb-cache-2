5|$|In Kathmandu, Nepal, {{the sorcerer}} Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret {{compound}} Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal a <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> from an ancient, mystical text {{belonging to the}} Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.|$|E
5|$|Meyer found {{writing the}} script to be a smooth process. He would write a <b>few</b> <b>pages,</b> {{show it to}} Nimoy and Bennett for consultation, and return to his office to write some more. Once Nimoy, Bennett, and Meyer were happy, they showed the script to Shatner, who offered his own notes for another round of rewrites. The {{completed}} script was shown to Paramount executives, who were very pleased.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he never}} {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} composing a full opera, and considered many subjects– including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny– he never wrote more than a <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn's last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare's The Tempest on a libretto by Eugène Scribe, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn's death. The libretto was eventually set by Fromental Halévy. At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera {{on the story of}} the Lorelei.|$|E

Among the scenes created for the show, there are the conversations between Theon and Tyrion, Sansa and Septa Mordane, Doreah and Viserys, Jory Cassel and Jaime, Jon and Samwell and Eddard Stark and Cersei. The character of Alliser Thorne is given some more depth by justifying his harshness towards the new recruits, and a more subdued version of Bran's dream is included.|$|E
5|$|The pair's latest book, The Body Shape Bible, was {{published}} on 18 September 2007. Through a survey about different body shapes conducted amongst women, Constantine and Woodall {{were able to}} discover the twelve most common women's body shapes. They used this information to write The Body Shape Bible which highlights these twelve shapes which have all been named in ways such as 'cornet' or 'brick'. In the fashion advice book, women can interpret which shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual shape. A <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> in the book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall's own fashion disasters.|$|E
5|$|Around Storybrooke, {{residents}} {{notice the}} clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Lana Parrilla) {{looks through the}} book of fairy tales and discovers that the last <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> are torn out. She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing {{because it is an}} old book. Regina learns Emma is still in town when the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified {{by means of the}} leather holster of his pistol and a <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of Bhagavad Gita in his breast pocket.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
5|$|Vice {{president}} of programming {{and production of}} Cartoon Network, Mike Lazzo, showed high interest in the series and requested a show bible, which came through by fax, a <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> at a time, {{over a period of}} the next few months. After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce Ed, Edd n Eddy, the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's Hanna-Barbera. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series had ever done this.|$|E

5|$|In another story, Stowe and Calvin {{meet a man}} on a Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E

25|$|This story arc {{concentrates}} on the last days and death of Oscar Wilde (who is attended to by his trusted companion Robbie Ross) rather than on Cerebus himself, who appears in only a <b>few</b> <b>pages.</b> (The title refers to the gothic novel Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Robert Maturin, a relative of Wilde's. Wilde adopted this alias {{during this period of}} his life.) Meanwhile, a catatonic Cerebus, believing Jaka to be dead, spends his days mourning on the patio of a café. In the last <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of the story, after the main action had concluded, Cerebus overhears a conversation by two Cirinist jailers insulting Jaka. Enraged, Cerebus murders one of the guards and then springs into action.|$|E

He modified it without consulting the composer, and gave the Paris premiere in 1888. It was published in this form, dedicated to Brandukov.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{development}} of a new algorithm to develop a mobile application software that can compress and decompress multiple pages short message service (SMS) into <b>fewer</b> <b>pages.</b> This compressor/decompressor software (SMS Zipper) is programmed with Java 2 nd Micro Edition (J 2 ME) language and implemented on Nokia Series 40 mobile phone. A novel compression/decompression algorithm has been developed to handle short text compression with twice the capacity compared to a standard message and can save the SMS cost of the users by compressing multiple <b>pages</b> SMS into <b>fewer</b> <b>pages.</b> Therefore, the compression of short messages to be conveyed over the wireless medium is very promising in terms of costs, time, capacity and bandwidth savings. It also may bring a new beneficial social impact to the development of linguistic by encouraging proper English usage in SMS messaging...|$|R

This amendment, only a <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> long, would replace hundreds of pages of statutory language (although most statutory language in taxation statutes is not directed at specifying graduated tax rates).|$|E
25|$|A notable {{controversy}} in Canadian magazine publishing {{in recent years}} has been the existence of split run magazines, where a title published in another country, such as TIME or Sports Illustrated, is republished in Canada with a <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of special Canadian content, in order to take advantage of Canadian advertising sales revenues. The government of Canada imposed a special excise tax on split run publications in 1995 to discourage the practice, although this continues to be controversial.|$|E
