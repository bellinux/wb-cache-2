This study was under-taken {{to examine the effects}} of <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> (AG), which is commonly used in processed foods, on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Mice were given <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> orally (100 g l− 1) 5 days before a hepatotoxic dose of acetaminophen (500 mg kg− 1) intraperitoneally. <b>Arabic</b> <b>gum</b> administration dramatically reduced acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity as evidenced by reduced serum alanine (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities. Acetaminophen-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation was reduced significantly by <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> pretreatment. The protection offered by <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> does not appear to be caused by a decrease in the formation of toxic acetaminophen metabolites, which consumes glutathione, because <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> did not alter acetaminophen-induced hepatic glutathione depletion. Ac-etaminophen increased nitric oxide synthesis as measured by serum nitrate plus nitrite at 4 and 6 h after administration and <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> pretreatment significantly reduced their formation. In conclusion, <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> is effective in protecting mice against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. This protection may involve the reduction of oxidative stress...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the addition of commercial lipase in various forms on the acceleration of the ripening of UF-Feta cheese. Commercial lipase from Aspergillus niger was encapsulated by using silica composition based on Sol-Gel method. Lipase was then added to cheeses in three forms, namely, free lipase, encapsulated lipase, and encapsulated lipase with <b>Arabic</b> <b>gum.</b> Lipase was added to the retentate in the ratio of 4 g: 100 kg. The effects of free lipase, encapsulated lipase, and encapsulated lipase with <b>Arabic</b> <b>gum</b> on lipolysis, quantity of free water, bounded water, and chemical compounds were studied during the 60 days of ripening. Based on FTIR analysis, encapsulated lipases were completely released from the capsules during the first 15 days of ripening period. The greatest amount of lipolysis was detected in free lipase samples, compared to encapsulated and encapsulated with <b>Arabic</b> <b>gum</b> treatments. Thermal analysis of all treatments indicated that lipolysis could affect the free and bounded water content by decreasing both of them from the 15 th to 60 th days of ripening. The amount of salt, moisture, and fat changed during the first 15 days of ripening significantly (P< 0. 05). In comparison with free or encapsulated lipase, the encapsulated lipase with <b>Arabic</b> <b>gum</b> caused more changes in types of water and chemical compositions because the produced emulsions were uniform...|$|R
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), <b>gum</b> <b>arabic,</b> ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E

40|$|World {{consumption}} of <b>arabic</b> <b>gum</b> (see also {{the article on}} restorative trees) has risen fast in the last decade. Between 1991 and 1998 it rose by more than 25 %, reaching 44, 000 tonnes. <b>Arabic</b> <b>gum</b> {{is used in the}} food processing and pharmaceuticals industries and, using the code E 414, as a replacement for animal gelatine (see Spore 85). Prices have also risen slightly and, depending on quality, vary between USD 700 and USD 1250 a tonne (Euro 803 to Euro 1433). It is to be hoped, though, that prices do not rise much further for fear of the processors switching to starch substitutes. In any case, most of the profits in any price rise will not accrue to producing countries since most processing takes place in Europe where the value-added factor is between 100 % and 180 %. At present only the initial steps of processing crushing and grinding are performed in Africa, leading to an added value factor of 10 %.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical GC-MS procedure {{to study the}} chemical composition of plant gums, determining aldoses and uronic acids in one step.

Using this method only one peak for each compound is obtained, thus providing simple and highly reproducible chromatograms. The analytical procedure was optimised using reference samples of raw plant <b>gums</b> (<b>arabic,</b> karaya, ghatti, guar, locust bean and tragacanth, cherry, plum and peach gums), commercial watercolours and paint layers prepared according to ancient recipes at the Opificio delle Pietre Dure of Florence (Italy). To identify gum media in samples of unknown composition, a decisional schema for the gum identification and the principal component analysis of the relative sugar percentage contents were employed. The procedure was used to study samples collected from wall paintings from Macedonian tombs (4 th- 3 rd centuries Bc) and from the Mycenaean "Palace of Nestor" (13 th century BC) in Pylos, Greece. The presence of carbohydrates was ascertained and plant gum binders (fruit and a mixture of tragacanth and fruit tree gums) were identified in some of the samples. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
