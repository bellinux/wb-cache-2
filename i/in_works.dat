40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to introduce the concept of meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and to provide evidence for why the concept is important in nursing. The specific aims were to: (1) develop and test an instrument to measure meaning <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> (2) explore direct relationships between meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and nursing outcomes (job satisfaction, burnout), and (3) explore indirect relationships among meaning <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> the nursing work environment, and nursing outcomes (job satisfaction, burnout). Data were collected from surveys mailed to {{a convenience sample of}} 500 registered nurses (RNs) randomly selected from an RN list from the North Carolina Board of Nursing. To develop an instrument to measure theoretical constructs of meaning <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> items from four instruments used to measure meaning in the workplace were selected. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test construct validity of the new instrument. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was performed to explore relationships among meaning <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> the nursing work environment, job satisfaction, and burnout. A total of 158 RNs were included in data analysis. The newly developed instrument of meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> consisted of 25 items in four sub-scales. CFA supported construct validity (CFI=. 907, RMSEA=. 080) and internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=. 95) of the instrument. SEM supported (1) a positive relationship between meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and job satisfaction (β =. 67, SE=. 05), (2) an inverse relationship between meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and burnout (β =-. 55, SE=. 06), and (3) indirect relationships of meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> to job satisfaction (β =. 35, SE=. 11) and burnout (β =-. 49, SE=. 13), mediated by the nursing work environment. The results of this study supported hypothesized models, showing (1) significant direct relationships between meaning <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> job satisfaction, and burnout, and (2) an indirect positive relationship between meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and job satisfaction, mediated by the nursing work environment and an indirect inverse relationship between meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and burnout, mediated by the nursing <b>work</b> environment. Meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> is a positive personal attribute that provides a motivational force to work, and moreover has a possible role in positively influencing nurses’ perceptions of the nursing work environment and creating healthy nursing work environments...|$|R

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{reconsideration}} {{of the current}} discussion concerning the relationship between meaning and meaningfulness <b>in</b> <b>work.</b> Studies <b>in</b> the scientific literature focus either on meaning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> as a collective production or on meaningfulness <b>in</b> <b>work</b> as an individual production. Neither perspective considers other forms of mediation between meaning and meaningfulness. This article proposes moving past this limitation by repositioning the interactions between meaning and meaningfulness <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> situating studies about meaning in the philosophical, sociological, and psychological traditions and specifically recasting the contributions of phenomenology and comprehensive sociology. It also discusses {{the concept of the}} psychological function of work as currently analyzed within the theories of activity. The psychological function of work is proposed as an alternative framework for thinking about the interactions between meaning and meaningfulness <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> with the psychological function of <b>work,</b> the meaning <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> and the meaningfulness <b>in</b> <b>work</b> compounding a triad. The paper ends with an analysis of some methodological challenges that researchers will need to address in order to investigate this triad...|$|R

Despite the importance of facilitating manager learning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> there is limited research addressing this specific question. In this study, manager learning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> conceptualised as being distinct from the concepts of workplace learning and learning at work, as these concepts imply learning in a bounded, identifiable place whereas learning <b>in</b> <b>work</b> is considered as spatially and temporally fluid (Fenwick, 2008).

A qualitative study was conducted among a sample of ten managers based in an innovative and successful entrepreneurial organisation in Ireland, engaged in the financial services sector.
