50|$|Nitrofural (INN, {{trade name}} <b>Furacin)</b> is a {{bactericidal}} compound {{used as an}} antibiotic most commonly {{in the form of}} ointments. Its use in medicine has become less frequent as safer and more effective products have become available, and it has been discontinued in the US. The substance is pale yellow and crystalline.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the surface tension of calcium hydroxide (CH) associated with different substances (deionized distilled water, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, 2 % chlorhexidine digluconate, Otosporin, 3 % sodium lauryl ether sulphate; <b>Furacin,</b> PMC <b>Furacin)</b> using tensiometer. The action of the substances studied on the dentinal structure enhances the property of surface tension. This method consists in the application of force to separate a platinum ring immersed in the substances. Thus, torsion was applied to the screw until the platinum ring separated during substances testing. Considering the methodology applied, the following can be concluded: distilled water alone or associated with CH presented a high surface tension (70. 00 and 68. 40 dynes/cm); calcium hydroxide in association with anionic detergent showed low surface tension (31. 60 dynes/cm); camphorated paramonochlorophenol plus CH presented low surface tension (37. 50 dynes/cm); 2 % chlorhexidine associated with calcium hydroxide showed high surface tension values (58. 00 dynes/cm); Otosporin plus calcium hydroxide showed low surface tension (35. 40 dynes/cm); paramonochlorophenol <b>Furacin</b> mixed with calcium hydroxide presented surface tension equal to 45. 50 dynes/cm; sodium hypochlorite presented high surface tension (75. 00 dynes/cm). Antimicrobial agents more indicated in endodontics, i. e. CH, chlorhexidine and hypochlorite, presented the highest surface tension. Estudou-se a tensão superficial do hidróxido de cálcio associado a diferentes substâncias (água destilada deionizada, paramonoclorofenol canforado, digluconato de clorexidina 2 %, Otosporin, sulfato éter lauril sódio 3 %, <b>furacin,</b> PMC <b>furacin)</b> usando tensiômetro. O modelo experimental consistiu na aplicação de uma força para separar um anel de platina imerso na superfície das substâncias, exercido por um tensiômetro. Considerando a metodologia aplicada, pode-se concluir: a água destilada isolada ou associada com o hidróxido de cálcio apresenta alta tensão superficial (70, 00 e 68, 40 dinas/cm); hidróxido de cálcio associado ao detergente aniônico mostrou baixa tensão superficial (31, 60 dinas/cm); paramonoclorofenol canforado mais hidróxido de cálcio apresentou baixa tensão superficial (37, 50 dinas/cm); clorexidina 2 % associada com hidróxido de cálcio mostrou um alto valor de tensão superficial (58, 00 dinas/cm); Otosporin mais hidróxido de cálcio mostrou baixa tensão superficial (35, 40 dinas/cm); paramonoclorofenol <b>furacin</b> misturado com hidróxido de cálcio apresentou tensão superficial igual a 45, 50 dinas/cm; hipoclorito de sódio apresentou alta tensão superficial (75, 00 dinas/cm) ...|$|E

40|$|Nitrofurazone (<b>Furacin)</b> is {{well known}} for its {{antibacterial}} activity. Its topical application although quite effective, is often alleged to be associated with local irritation and sensitization. Hence a new product ′Furacin-s′ incorporating hydrocortisone 1 %, in <b>Furacin,</b> is tested in a clinical trial in impetigo, folliculitis, pompholyx, eczematoid, and seborrhoeic dermatitis with 3 other preparations, (Framycetin sulphate + Dexamethasone acetate - 0. 1 % and Neomycin, Bacitracin, Polymyxin B sulf + Hydrocortisone 1 % in a control study. A total of 190 cases divided into variable of number was studied. Results showed Furacin-s to be more effective and acceptable for treating impetigo and folliculitis. Pompholyx lesions with possible microbic background responded very satisfactory, the product gave comparatively poor result in cases of seborrhoeic and eczematoid dermatitis. No side effect was observed with Furacin-s. A routine bacteriological culture done in all the cases of and folliculitis showed that coagulase-positive staph aureus was the major pathogen in both these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{vascular}} {{changes in}} the subcutaneous connective tissue of rats induced by dentin bonding systems (one step) was studied and compared to those induced by saline solution (negative control) and <b>Furacin</b> (positive control), during the exudative phase of the inflammatory process. Twenty mg/kg of Evan's blue were injected intravenously in the vein of the rats' penises; 0. 1 ml of each substance tested was inoculated in the subcutaneous tissue. After a 3 hour period the animals were sacrificed and their skins were excised and punched out with a standard steel 2. 5 cm in diameter. The specimens were immediately immersed in 8 ml of formamide and taken to a double boiler for 72 hours at 37 ºC, to remove the dye. The liquid containing the overflowed dye was filtered, analyzed in the spectrophotometer (620 nm) and classified according to the criteria established by Nagem-Filho, Pereira (1976). After statistical analysis, the irritative potential of the substances was ranked as follows: <b>Furacin</b> (severe) > Single Bond and Bond 1 (moderate - {{no significant differences between}} the dentin bonding systems tested) > saline solution (not significant as regards the irritation degree) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} twelve ultraviolet-sensitive mutants has been {{isolated}} after U. V. irradiation of Escherichia coli strain B. The use of crystal violet during irradiation and subsequent growth appears {{to increase the}} frequency of such mutants among colonies formed by surviving cells. This effect {{may be due to}} post-irradiation selection. Eleven of the mutants were more crystal violet resistant than their parent. The mutants were compared by determining their U. V. survival curves, the extent of elongation after U. V. irradiation, their ability to repair U. V. induced damage to bacteriophage Tl, and their resistance to <b>furacin.</b> They comprised nine different phenotypes. In all but one case, the mutants differed from the parent in more than one property...|$|E
40|$|The minimum {{inhibitory}} concentrations (MICs) {{and minimum}} bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of 24 drugs for luminous bacteria Vibrio harveyi and V. splendidus were determined. Only chloramphenicol, sodium nifurstyrenate and the nitrofurans (furazolidone, nitrofurazone, nitrofurantoin and Prefuran) showed relatively low MICs and MBCs (- 1). The bacteria showed varied responses to chloramphenicol and Prefuran and low sensitivity to oxytetracycline. Chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline and Prefuran {{are commonly used}} in shrimp hatcheries. Shrimp larvae showed high survival rates and active swimming movement after 24 h exposure to in vivo bactericidal doses of chloramphenicol, <b>Furacin,</b> nitrofurantoin (protozoa only), oxytetracycline (nauplius only), Prefuran (mysis only) and sodium nifurstyrenate, but the drugs caused deformities in the carapace, rostrum, and setae. Chemical control of luminous vibriosis among shrimp larvae appears limited, based on the efficacy of existing and readily available drugs, because of the possible development of resistant strains of bacteria and the limited tolerance of the shrimp larvae to the drugs...|$|E
40|$|To {{find out}} the {{incidence}} of contact hypersensitivity due to various antibacterial agents, patch tests were performed with these medications in 101 patients suspected to havek developed contact dermatitis due to some such agent. Positive patch tests were obtained with nitrofurazone, (<b>furacin)</b> in 56 cases, neomycin in 28 cases penicillin in 12 cases, tyrothricin (tyroderm), gentamicin (genticyn), framycitin (soframycin) and oxytetracycline (terramycin) in 13 cases each, triple sulfa, and mercurochrome in 9 cases each and acriflavine in 4 cases. Two cases showed patch tests with brilliant green, but none with gentian violet. Twenty eight patients were negative with all drugs tested. Many patients showed positive patch tests {{with more than one}} antibacterial agent. Neomycin 20 % in petrolatum gave more frequent positive patch tests compared to the commericial 0. 35 % neomycin ointment or 20 % aqueous neomycin, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the commercial 0. 2 % nitrofurazone ointment, 2 % nitrofurazone in petrolatum of 22 controls, 6 patients showed positive patch tests with the commercial neomycin ointment as well as 20 % neomycin in petrolatum, 1 patient with 0. 2 % nitrofurazone ointment and 5 patients with 200 % nitrofurzone in petrolatum...|$|E
