5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked <b>down</b> <b>if</b> their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E
5|$|Following Governor Madison's death, Secretary of State Charles Stewart Todd {{offered to}} step <b>down</b> <b>if</b> Slaughter {{preferred}} to appoint {{someone else to}} the post. The letter was not an explicit resignation, as Todd emphatically declared his intention to work with Slaughter should the governor choose to retain him. Slaughter did replace Todd with former Senator John Pope, however, apparently as a political favor. This move proved disastrous for Slaughter's political career. Todd was very popular {{by virtue of being}} the son-in-law of twice-governor Shelby. By contrast, Pope was extremely unpopular for his vote in the U.S. Senate against declaring war in the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it <b>down</b> <b>if</b> {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{offense is}} given a series of four plays, known as <b>downs.</b> <b>If</b> the offense {{advances}} ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded {{a new set of}} four <b>downs.</b> <b>If</b> they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further <b>down</b> the field; <b>if</b> they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.|$|R

50|$|In Canadian football, {{the team}} that is in {{possession}} of the ball, the offence, has three downs to advance the ball 10 yards towards the opponent's end zone. If the offence gains 10 yards, it gets another set of four <b>downs.</b> <b>If</b> the offence fails to gain 10 yards after 3 downs, it loses possession of the ball.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the 2010 NBA Draft, Rolle hired Fletcher Cockrell {{to be his}} agent. ESPN, NBADraft.net, and DraftExpress.com {{projected}} him to be {{a possible}} mid-to-late second-round selection. He worked out with the Washington Wizards, Phoenix Suns, Milwaukee Bucks, Charlotte Bobcats, and Indiana Pacers. Dave-Te' Thomas of CBS Sports said that Rolle had a good wingspan and was very athletic. He added while larger NBA forwards might push him around, he was an intense player and would not back <b>down</b> <b>if</b> challenged. Thomas compared Rolle to former LSU teammate Tyrus Thomas.|$|E
5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, {{at an age}} of about eight days, the young birds get their first <b>down.</b> <b>If</b> both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves. All the young in the nest leave it {{during the same period}} of a few hours. At this stage, they are normally able to fly. They start feeding themselves partly after one or two days, and sustain themselves completely after 7 to 10 days, 14 at the latest.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{theory is that}} Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get away. If all the troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks <b>down.</b> <b>If</b> they had all {{remained}} at the pass, {{they would have been}} encircled and would eventually have all been killed. By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.|$|E

5|$|Dunderdale {{announced}} her candidacy for the PC Party leadership on December 30, 2010, and {{was endorsed by}} her entire caucus. While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step <b>down</b> <b>if</b> someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's credentials committee announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by the credentials committee. With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as leader at the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her <b>down.</b> <b>If</b> Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them <b>down</b> <b>if</b> Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed <b>down</b> <b>if</b> things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E
5|$|Players {{control the}} player {{character}} Kid Klown as {{he attempts to}} rescue Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. The game's graphics are presented in an isometric view as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Black Jack's plans of blowing up one of his spade bombs in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow <b>down</b> <b>if</b> they collide with him; if Kid Klown {{does not make it}} to the bomb in time or if he is hit too many times, the level is lost. The game consists of 5 stages. In each stage, Kid Klown must find all 4 card suit orbs and stop the bomb to complete the level. At the end of each stage Kid Klown gets a key which in turn at the ending could be of use to unlock Honey's cage. If the player gets all 4 orbs in the very first turn, Kid Klown also gets a Honey heart. After the fifth stage Kid Klown must find the correct lock out of the 10 locks to unlock Honey's cage.|$|E
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted <b>down.</b> <b>If</b> the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E

5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} <b>down.</b> <b>If</b> the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E
5|$|To {{successfully}} complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills {{and how many}} uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings. There are eight skills that can be assigned: 'Climbers' climb vertically though fall <b>down</b> <b>if</b> they hit an overhang. 'Floaters' use a parachute to fall safely from heights. 'Bombers' explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. 'Blockers' stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. 'Builders' build a stairway of 12 steps. 'Bashers', 'Miners' and 'Diggers' dig horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively.|$|E
5|$|With the {{appointment}} of Zinsou as a civilian leader of the country, Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga tried {{to return to the}} country but were informed that their plane would be shot <b>down</b> <b>if</b> they entered Dahomey airspace; they instead flew to neighboring Togo. Zinsou, who had a history of advocacy against the policies of the military, quickly drew the ire of the military leaders by pursuing a host of policies without consultation with them. In addition, to control continued deficits, Zinsou instituted a number of austerity measures and as a result alienated unions and the urban population. The result was that on 10 December 1969, Zinsou was taken into custody by military officers organized by Kouandété and Zinsou was sent to a remote military garrison near Natitingou. Following the coup, Kouandété found {{that he did not have}} the support to rule throughout the entire military, and so instead Paul-Emile de Souza (the director of military affairs for Zinsou's government) was named the provisional head of state as the head of a three person Military directorate (with Kouandété and Colonel Benoît Sinzogan holding the other seats). The military directorate decided to release Zinsou and hold new presidential elections in 1970 without the restrictions of the 1968 elections, thus allowing Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga to run.|$|E
