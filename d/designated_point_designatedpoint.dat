50|$|Since Vollick weighed a mere 89 {{pounds and}} was only 5 feet 1 inch tall, she used pillows to prop herself up to see out of the cockpit of the Curtiss JN-4. On 13 March 1928, Vollick {{received}} time off from {{her job at the}} Hamilton Cotton Co. in order to take her federal aviation test. She demonstrated her knowledge of take-offs and landings on the frozen bay. In order to pass the test, the applicant had to make four landings from 1,500 feet and land within 150 feet of a <b>designated</b> <b>point</b> on the ground. An additional landing had to be executed with the motor off and the pilot had to land within 5,000 feet of a <b>designated</b> <b>point.</b> Other requirements of the test included performing five figure-eight turns between two <b>designated</b> <b>points</b> and completing a 175-mile cross-country trip.|$|R

The front and rear jacking points are required to be raised to heights of 198 1 / 4 in. (502. 9 0. 6 cm) and 120. 6 1 / 4 in. (306. 4 0. 6 cm), respectively...|$|R

40|$|It {{was shown}} {{previously}} that semi-global practical pressure regulation at <b>designated</b> <b>points</b> of a large-scale nonlinear hydraulic network is guaranteed by distributed proportional controllers. For a correct {{implementation of the}} control laws, each controller, which is located at these <b>designated</b> <b>points</b> and which computes the control law based on local information only (measured pressure drop), is required to transmit the control values to neighbor pumps, i. e. auxiliary pumps which are found along the same fundamental circuit. In this paper we show that quantized controllers can serve well to this purpose. Besides a theoretical analysis of the closed-loop system, we provide experimental results obtained in a laboratory district heating system. This approach is fully compatible with plug-and-play control strategies. ...|$|R
