40|$|International audienceThe {{selection}} {{and implementation of}} good <b>operations</b> <b>practice</b> cannot be undertaken in isolation; it must consider the enterprise context. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe a robust process for the development of specific environment good <b>operations</b> <b>practice</b> role profiles for supervisors, and illustrate this through a case study within a complex cell-centric manufacturing environment. The approach identifies the activities undertaken by a cell leader and team leader in a given manufacturing organisation, and also by a good <b>operations</b> <b>practice</b> cell leader and team leader in a relevant external organisation. Then via a survey of operations managers and functional managers, those activities that a cell leader and team leader should do within the given manufacturing organisation are identified. The approach enables the contextual adoption of good <b>operations</b> <b>practice,</b> develops supervisor role profiles which allows them to be proficient within their task domains, contributes to attaining agreement amongst operational and functional management, and has applications across cell-centric manufacturing. The potentially significant impacts available across cell-centric manufacturing are illustrated by the finding that following this examination of <b>operations</b> <b>practice</b> in the case study company two-thirds were classified as requiring change...|$|R
