5|$|The spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (Aetobatus narinari) is a {{cartilaginous}} fish of the <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> family, Myliobatidae. As traditionally recognized, it {{is found}} globally in tropical regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Recent authorities have restricted it to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with other populations recognized as the ocellated <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. ocellatus) and Pacific white-spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. laticeps). Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen alone, but occasionally swim in groups. They are ovoviviparous, the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent.|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> {{has many}} {{different}} common names, including white-spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray,</b> bonnet skate, bonnet ray, duckbill ray and spotted duck-billed ray.|$|E
5|$|Within these regions, {{there are}} {{significant}} variations in genetics and morphology. As a consequence, recent authorities have split it into three: This restricts the true spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. narinari) to the Atlantic, while the Indo-Pacific population is the ocellated <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. ocellatus) and the East Pacific is the Pacific white-spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> (A. laticeps).|$|E

5|$|The dorsal spots {{make the}} spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> an {{aquarium}} attraction, although {{because of its}} large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums. There are no target fisheries for the spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray,</b> but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch. There have been several reported incidents of spotted eagle rays leaping {{out of the water}} onto boats and landing on people. Nevertheless, spotted eagle rays do not pose a significant threat to humans, as they are shy and generally avoid human contact. Interactions with an individual snorkeler in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one, two and even three spotted eagle rays. The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the snorkeler to observe the <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to the spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> preys mainly upon bivalves, crabs, whelks, benthic infauna {{they also}} feed on mollusks, crustaceans, {{particularly}} malacostracans. and also upon hermit crabs, shrimp, octopuses, and some small fish.|$|E
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a lesser degree, morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} tested {{different}} sounds that could disturb <b>eagle</b> <b>rays</b> (Aetobatus ocellatus) during their foraging activities at Moorea, French Polynesia. Results showed that artificial white sound and single-frequency tones (40 Hz, 600 Hz or 1 kHz) {{did not have}} an effect on rays (at least 90 % of rays continued to forage over sand), while playbacks of boat motor sound significantly disturbed rays during foraging activity (60 % exhibited an escape behaviour). Overall, our study highlighted the negative effect of boat noises on the foraging activity of <b>eagle</b> <b>rays.</b> These noises produced by boat traffic could, however, have some positive effects for marine aquaculture if they {{could be used as a}} deterrent to repel the <b>eagle</b> <b>rays,</b> main predators of the pearl oysters...|$|R

5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed stingers. Spotted eagle rays commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans, and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These rays are commonly observed leaping out of the water, and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E

500|$|The spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> is {{included}} in the IUCN's Red List as [...] "near threatened". The rays are caught mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa. [...] They are also common in commercial marine life trade and are displayed in aquariums. Among the many efforts to help protect this species, South Africa's decision to deploy fewer protective shark nets has reduced the number of deaths caused by entanglement. South Africa has also placed restrictions on the number of rays that can be bought per person per day. In the state of Florida in the United States, the fishing, landing, purchasing and trading of spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> is outlawed. [...] The spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> is also protected in the Great Barrier Reef on the eastern coast of Australia.|$|E
500|$|The spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Swedish botanist Bengt Anders Euphrasén as Raja narinari in 1790 from a specimen collected at an unknown location (possibly {{the coast of}} Brazil) during a trip he made to the Antilles, and was later classified as Stoasodon narinari. Its current genus name is Aetobatus, derived from the Greek words aetos (eagle) and batis (ray). The spotted <b>eagle</b> <b>ray</b> belongs to the Myliobatidae family, which includes the well known manta ray. [...] Most rays in the Myliobatidae swim in the open ocean rather than close to the sea floor.|$|E
