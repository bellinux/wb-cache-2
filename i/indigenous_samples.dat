This article focuses on two such collections-one established and maintained in the United States {{and the other in}} Australia. Through historical and ethnographic analysis, we show how scientific knowledge about the human species and ethical knowledge about human experimentation are coproduced differently in each national context over time. Through a series of vignettes, we trace the attempts of scientists and indigenous people to assemble and reassemble blood samples, ethical regimes, human biological knowledge, and personhood. In including ourselves-a U.

Sample selection proved to be important because differences were found in the similarly selected indigenous Manx population - between donors and non-donors. In addition to a study of phenotype distributions and gene frequencies in the three selected populations, a regional analysis of the Manx data, though on a limited level, was effected. Though great difficulties were encountered obtaining <b>indigenous</b> <b>samples,</b> comparisons were performed between the Manx and population samples from selected regions of the mainland of the British Isles as well as certain north-west European populations.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} composition of Ficus carica {{commonly known as}} fig is of great interest as it is considered {{a good source of}} energy and minerals. Seven samples of fig, cultivated in Pakistan were studied for their physico-chemical properties. All samples had little moisture, less amounts of ash and high volatile matters. Low moisture is favorable in preventing the fermentation of the fruit while high volatiles are responsible for its unique taste. The energy content of the samples ranged between 337. 60 - 364. 70 kcal/ 100 g. The samples were found to be a good source of potassium (3. 82 - 6. 11 g/kg), magnesium (0. 11 - 0. 20 g/kg), calcium (78. 72 - 132. 80 mg/kg) and sodium (5. 58 - 17. 69 mg/kg).

40|$|Indigenous Australians {{have been}} known to be {{disadvantaged}} in many ways although higher art and physical self-concepts have been reported with <b>Indigenous</b> <b>samples.</b> Given recent research demonstrating the reciprocal effects of achievement and self-concept in academic domains, Indigenous students may experience further disadvantages in both academic performance and self-concept. A sample of Indigenous and non-Indigenous students (N = 1, 342) from schools in New South Wales (NSW), Australia {{were asked to respond to}} a survey measuring: 5 domains of self-concept (i. e., school, reading, maths, art, and physical abilities), 2 learning-related factors (enjoyment and participation), and a self-assessment of their school work. Their scores in a NSW state-wide assessment of students’ literacy and numeracy were also obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis established the self-concept and learning-related factors. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) using a 2 (identity: Indigenous vs. Non-Indigenous) x 2 (region: urban vs. rural) design found significant effects of identity for all variables except for art self-concept. That is, non-Indigenous students scored higher than Indigenous students in literacy and numeracy tests, self-concepts, learning-related factors, and self-ratings of school work, irrespective of region. The results did not support previous research demonstrating a relatively higher art self-concept for Indigenous children based on stereotypical perspectives. These results imply, that educators would be well advised to not assume stereotypic differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian students or assume a great difference between Indigenous students from urban and rural school settings. However, there seems to be a need for improving the school environment so as to promote Indigenous students’ performance and enjoyment of school life...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} {{study was to identify}} the predominant beliefs that employed Tongan people hold about work, and to investigate the relationship between beliefs about work and selected demographic variables. The first step was to determine whether the instrument used to measure beliefs about work in the Tongan cultural context is a valid and appropriate measure. The sample consisted of 804 employed Tongans from Tongatapu, Vava'u, Ha'apai, 'Eua and Niuatoputapu islands. The sample was limited to Tongans employed mainly by government sector organisations that have an identifiable personnel function within paid employment in the formal economy of Tonga. Buchholz's Beliefs About Work Scale was used as the measure of employee attitude in the present study, using the same scales that have been developed in previous studies. This study attempted to replicate the five dimensions of the Beliefs About Work Scale and extend findings concerning beliefs about work in the Tongan context. It was concluded that the measurement of beliefs using the five dimensions from the Belief About Work Scale was not a valid and appropriate measure in Tonga. The results of the analysis revealed three factors of beliefs about work in Tonga. This suggests the need to sort out appropriate definitions and measurement in favour of research on <b>indigenous</b> <b>samples,</b> rather than simply applying results from countries of different cultural settings. Of the three factors of beliefs about work in Tonga, the highest mean scores were obtained on the humanistic belief system, then the work ethic, and the lowest mean scores were obtained on the leisure ethic.

With {{the help of}} several Indigenous Australian research assistants, a survey was conducted at a 2011 Indigenous arts and cultural event, capturing responses from 277 Indigenous Australian adults. While about one-quarter of respondents gambled on card games in the previous 12 months, nearly three-quarters had gambled on commercial forms of gambling, especially poker machines.

This paper contributes to this literature by studying adolescents &# 039;at-risk&# 039; of disengaging, {{or who have}} already disengaged, from school, their families or society. A three-group cross-sectional comparative design was employed, comparing Indigenous (N = 3, 187) and non-Indigenous (N = 14, 522) &# 039;at-risk&# 039; adolescents with a mainstream sample of Victorian high-school students (N = 1, 105). Age and gender differences in SWB within the three groups were also explored. All participants completed the Personal Wellbeing Index-School Children (PWI-SC), which measures SWB. Mean SWB was significantly higher in the mainstream sample than in both the Indigenous and non-Indigenous &# 039;at-risk&# 039; groups. However, within the at-risk adolescents, the <b>Indigenous</b> <b>sample</b> scored higher than the non-Indigenous. In the mainstream sample, male and female SWB did not significantly differ, whereas males scored higher than females in both at-risk groups-with males scoring higher on all seven PWI-SC domains.

40|$|Abstract The {{gambling}} {{activities of}} minority groups such as Indigenous peoples are usually culturally complex and poorly understood. To redress the scarcity of information and contribute {{to a better understanding}} of gambling by Indigenous people, this paper presents quantitative evidence gathered at three Australian Indigenous festivals, online and in several Indigenous communities. With support from Indigenous communities, the study collected and analyzed surveys from 1, 259 self-selected Indigenous adults. Approximately 33 % of respondents gambled on card games while 80 % gambled on commercial gam-bling forms in the previous year. Gambling participation and involvement are high, par-ticularly on electronic gaming machines (EGMs), the favorite and most regular form of gambling. Men are significantly more likely to participate in gambling and to gamble more frequently on EGMs, horse/dog races, sports betting and instant scratch tickets. This ele-vated participation and frequency of gambling on continuous forms would appear to heighten gambling risks for Indigenous men. This is particularly the case for younger Indigenous men, who are more likely than their older counterparts to gamble on EGMs, table games and poker. While distinct differences between the gambling behaviors of our <b>Indigenous</b> <b>sample</b> and non-Indigenous Australians are apparent, Australian Indigenous behavior appears similar to that of some Indigenous and First Nations populations in other countries. Although this study represents the largest survey of Indigenous Australian gambling ever conducted in New South Wales and Queensland, further research is needed to extend our knowledge of Indigenous gambling and to limit the risks from gambling for Indigenous peoples...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND - Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} musculo-skeletal condition in rural and remote Australian Aboriginal communities. Smoking, physical inactivity and obesity are also prevalent amongst Indigenous people contributing to lifestyle diseases and concurrently to the high burden of low back pain. OBJECTIVES - This paper aims to examine the association between LBP and modifiable risk factors in a large rural Indigenous community {{as a basis for}} informing a musculo-skeletal and related health promotion program. [METHODS] A community Advisory Group (CAG) comprising Elders, Aboriginal Health Workers, academics, nurses, a general practitioner and chiropractors assisted in the development of measures to assess self-reported musculo-skeletal conditions including LBP risk factors. The Kempsey survey included a community-based survey administered by Aboriginal Health Workers followed by a clinical assessment conducted by chiropractors. RESULTS - Age and gender characteristics of this <b>Indigenous</b> <b>sample</b> (n = 189) were comparable to those reported in previous Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) studies of the broader Indigenous population. A history of traumatic events was highly prevalent in the community, as were occupational risk factors. Thirty-four percent of participants reported a previous history of LBP. Sporting injuries were associated with multiple musculo-skeletal conditions, including LBP. Those reporting high levels of pain were often overweight or obese and obesity was associated with self-reported low back strain. Common barriers to medical management of LBP included an attitude of being able to cope with pain, poor health, and the lack of affordable and appropriate health care services. Though many of the modifiable risk factors known to be associated with LBP were highly prevalent in this study, none of these were statistically associated with LBP. [CONCLUSION] Addressing particular modifiable risk factors associated with LBP such as smoking, physical inactivity and obesity may also present a wider opportunity to prevent and manage the high burden of illness imposed by co-morbidities such as heart disease and type- 2 diabetes...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these Indigenous traditions and musical heritage, ever since the 18th-century European colonisation of Australia began Indigenous Australian musicians and performers have adopted and interpreted many of the imported Western musical styles, often informed by and in combination with traditional instruments and sensibilities. Similarly, non-Indigenous artists and performers have adapted, used and <b>sampled</b> <b>Indigenous</b> Australian styles and instruments in their works. Contemporary musical styles such as rock and roll, country, rap and reggae have all featured a variety of notable Indigenous Australian performers.|$|R
30|$|BS {{producing}} LAB {{was isolated}} from <b>indigenous</b> buttermilk <b>sample</b> by enrichment in 100  ml of sterile minimal media (MM) in Erlenmeyer flask with 1 % paraffin oil as carbon source. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 48  h. After incubation the inoculum from the culture flasks was sub cultured on deMan Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar medium contains (20  g D-Glucose l- 1, 10  g Peptone l- 1, 10  g Beef extract l- 1, 5  g Yeast extract l- 1, 2  g Di-potassium phosphate l- 1, 2  g Tri-ammonium hydrogen citrate l- 1, 5  g Sodium acetate l- 1, 0.2  g Magnesium sulphate l- 1, Manganese sulphate l- 1 and 1  g Tween- 80  l- 1). LAB were stored at - 20 °C in MRS broth containing 20 % (v/v) glycerol stock as master stock {{until they were}} used in current study.|$|R
40|$|Pesticides are {{increasingly}} used in Pakistan, including in remote Northern {{areas in the}} country, for several reasons. A study in Swat Valley investigated the use of pesticides and associated problems, and identified possible remedial measures of an <b>indigenous</b> nature. Soil <b>samples</b> were analyzed and a detailed survey was done in 12 villages, {{based on interviews with}} 216 farmers and several in-depth interviews with other stakeholders such as the agriculture department and various pesticide dealers. All the soil samples contained residues of pesticides, two of which are known to be highly toxic [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Probiotic {{microorganisms}} {{are naturally}} present in milk and fermented milk {{products such as}} different kinds of cheese, yogurt, butter etc. The aim {{of the present study}} was isolation and taxonomic determination of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from cheese (wild type). Lactobacillus sp. was isolated from <b>indigenous</b> cheese <b>sample,</b> identified and characterized on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics at genus level. The pure isolated Lactobacillus was assessed for various probiotic properties such as tolerance to acidic pH, bile salt, antibiotic susceptibility, antibacterial activity and hemolytic activity. They showed better tolerance to pH 2 and pH 3 and 2 % bile salt; resistant to antibiotics viz. chloramphenicol, oxacillin and vancomycin. It was found active against test bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and found to be non-hemolytic when compared to the positive control strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Probiotic ice-cream was prepared, its safety and keeping quality was determined by significant total bacterial count, coliform count and the presence of yeast and moulds...|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} report indicated that prototype chlorovirus PBCV- 1 replicated in two Chlorella variabilis algal strains, NC 64 A and Syngen 2 – 3, that are ex-endosymbionts {{isolated from the}} protozoan Paramecium bursaria. Surprisingly, plaque-forming viruses on Syngen 2 – 3 lawns were often higher than on NC 64 A lawns from <b>indigenous</b> water <b>samples.</b> These differences led {{to the discovery of}} viruses that exclusively replicate in Syngen 2 – 3 cells, named Only Syngen (OSy) viruses. OSy-NE 5, the prototype virus for the proposed new species, had a linear dsDNA genome of 327 kb with 44 -nucleotide-long, incompletely base-paired, covalently closed hairpin ends. Each hairpin structure was followed by an identical 2612 base-paired inverted sequence after which the DNA sequence diverged. OSy-NE 5 encoded 357 predicted CDSs and 13 tRNAs. Interestingly, OSy-NE 5 attached to and initiated infection in NC 64 A cells but infectious progeny viruses were not produced; thus OSy-NE 5 replication in NC 64 A is blocked at some later stage of replication...|$|R
40|$|CDATA[A {{serological}} {{survey was}} conducted to determine the prevalence of Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD), using the quantitative Agar Gel Precipitin Test (AGPT), in flocks of apparently healthy, unvaccinated adult indigenous Nigerian ducks in Oyo and Osun states of Nigeria. Of the 126 sera tested, 24 (19. 1 %) were positive for IBDV precipitins. None of the 15 samples from Farm A was positive but 9 (30. 0 %) from Farm B and 15 (18. 5 %) from backyard flocks were positive for IBDV antibodies. 15 of the positive samples had a titre of 1 : 16, 6 had titre of 1 : 32 while 3 had titre of 1 : 64. The Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) for the Farm B and <b>indigenous</b> duck <b>samples</b> were 21 and 23, respectively. This range of antibody titres detected in unvaccinated ducks {{is an indication of}} previous exposure to IBDV and is sufficiently high to suggest that indigenous Nigerian ducks have {{an important role in the}} natural history of IBD and could serve as carriers of the virus, thereby complicating IBD control measures. ]]...|$|R
