5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds <b>from</b> <b>corporations</b> and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received {{were not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E

The university manages by far the largest annual research budget of any university in Canada, with sponsored direct-cost expenditures of $878 million in 2010. The federal government was the largest source of funding, with grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council amounting to about one-third of the research budget. About eight percent of research funding came <b>from</b> <b>corporations,</b> mostly in the healthcare industry.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee {{attempted}} {{to raise more}} individual contributions in smaller dollar amounts compared with the second inauguration of GeorgeW. Bush in 2005. The 2009 contribution limit was set at $50,000for donations by individuals, whereas individuals and companies were able to give a maximum of $250,000 apiece for the 2005 event. As of January 30, 2009, the presidential committee raised more than $53million, with at least 458people giving the committee-imposed maximum of $50,000, including celebrity donors such as George Soros, Halle Berry, Jamie Foxx and George Lucas. Emphasizing a change from business as usual, the committee set stringent guidelines for campaign contributions, barring donations <b>from</b> <b>corporations,</b> political action committees, registered federal lobbyists, labor and trade unions, registered foreign agents and non-U.S.citizens. The committee did accept donations from people with active lobbying interests before the federal government, but not registered as federal lobbyists, such as Google executive Eric Schmidt and Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{directed}} Chairman of Finance, Henry Morgenthau not {{to accept}} contributions <b>from</b> <b>corporations</b> and to prioritize smaller donations from the widest possible quarters of the public, and Morgenthau did this. In order to further embolden Democrats, especially in New Jersey and New York, Wilson set out to ensure the defeat of local incumbent candidates supported by political machines: James Smith Jr. (U.S. Senate in New Jersey) and John Dix (Governor of New York). He succeeded {{in both of these}} efforts and thereby weakened arguments that party control resided with political bosses.|$|E

Bowser said she was {{not in favor of}} banning corporations from making political donations altogether, saying that doing so would {{make it more difficult to}} track where campaign donations come from. She also said that corporations are banned from donating to federal elections, but that corporations still find ways to give to campaigns.|$|E

500|$|Minton {{tried again}} to expose what he {{believed}} to be Republican control of the media. He led the committee to target a newspaper with national circulation, Rural Progress. Minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting {{large sums of money}} <b>from</b> <b>corporations</b> and the editors of undue influence from this money. The owner of the paper, Maurive V. Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money <b>from</b> <b>corporations.</b> When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him answer the questions, Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As he was saying that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, [...] "This committee doesn't intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your Republican views." ...|$|E

The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing as well as 59 training centres. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center. Almost 85% of {{the construction}} budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1billion (RMB¥17.4billion) in corporate bids and tenders. Investments were expected <b>from</b> <b>corporations</b> seeking ownership rights after the Olympics. Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the [...] "uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a disease-free zone", the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{attacked}} {{what he saw}} as the corrupting {{influence of}} large political contributions– <b>from</b> <b>corporations,</b> labor unions, other organizations, and wealthy individuals– and he made this his signature issue. Starting in 1994, he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform; their McCain–Feingold bill attempted to put limits on [...] "soft money". The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well, and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias. Despite sympathetic coverage in the media, initial versions of the McCain–Feingold Act were filibustered and never came to a vote.|$|E
500|$|When McKinley {{heard that}} Bryan {{was likely to}} be the nominee, he called the report [...] "rot" [...] and hung up the phone. The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination, stating his view that the silver {{sentiment}} would be gone in a month. When McKinley and his advisers, such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna, realized that the views were more than transitory, they began intensive fundraising <b>from</b> <b>corporations</b> and the wealthy. The money went for speakers, pamphlets, and other means of conveying their [...] "sound money" [...] campaign to the voter. With far less money than McKinley, Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then-unprecedented scale. [...] McKinley on the other hand, opted for a front porch campaign. Both men spoke to {{hundreds of thousands of people}} from their chosen venues.|$|E

500|$|Tenure {{outcomes}} have vaulted MIT {{into the}} national spotlight on several occasions. The 1984 dismissal of David F. Noble, a historian of technology, became a [...] {{about the extent to}} which academics are granted freedom of speech after he published several books and papers critical of MIT's and other research universities' reliance upon financial support <b>from</b> <b>corporations</b> and the military. Former materials science professor Gretchen Kalonji sued MIT in 1994 alleging that she was denied tenure because of sexual discrimination. Several years later, the lawsuit was settled with undisclosed payments, and establishment of a project to encourage women and minorities to seek faculty positions. In 1997, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination issued a probable cause finding supporting UMass Boston Professor James Jennings' allegations of racial discrimination after a senior faculty search committee in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning did not offer him reciprocal tenure.|$|E
500|$|The Workshop had a {{reorganization}} during 1995, {{and dismissed}} about 12 {{percent of its}} staff. During 1998, {{for the first time}} in the series' history, they accepted funds <b>from</b> <b>corporations</b> for Sesame Street and its other programs, a policy criticized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. [...] The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies and financial assistance by PBS. Also during 1998, the Workshop invested $25 million in the cable channel Noggin, initiated during 1999 by the Workshop and Viacom's Nickelodeon. During 2000, the profit the CTW earned from the deal, along with its 1998 revenue caused partly by the [...] "Tickle Me Elmo" [...] craze, enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company's rights to the Sesame Street Muppets from the German media company EM.TV, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, [...] "Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home. It protected Sesame Street and allowed our international expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential. We are now in control of our own destiny".|$|E
500|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds <b>from</b> <b>corporations</b> and businesses under the committee's purview, but responded by saying that, [...] "Literally every business in America falls under the Commerce Committee" [...] and that he restricted those contributions to $1,000 and thus {{was not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. [...] In that year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the [...] "25 Most Influential People in America". [...] McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers, increase research money on health studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. [...] The industry spent some $40–50million in national advertising in response; while McCain's bill had the support of the Clinton administration and many public health groups, most Republican senators opposed it, stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy. The bill failed to gain cloture twice and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain. [...] During 1998 a revised version of the McCain-Feingold Act came up for Senate consideration; in addition to banning soft money, it sought to restrict [...] "issue ads" [...] run by independent groups within 60 days of an election. While having majority support, it was fiercely opposed by Senator Mitch McConnell on free speech and partisan threat grounds, and it again fell victim to a filibuster and failed to gain cloture.|$|E
