40|$|The {{conjecture}} is {{made and}} supported that many (probably all) of the algebraic relations which {{appear in the}} study of vector, tensor, and linear algebra are derivable from the contractions of one of the <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensor</b> identities with a suitably chosen factor. While dwelling largely on the three-dimensional case, five <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensor</b> identities are presented which are then used to produce several algebraic results. Among these results are the well-known triple vector product identity and the expression which is embodied in the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem. Traditionally, these results have been derived along ad hoc lines, but now they can be achieved through the union of an <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensor</b> identity and a factor. Formulas for the two versions of the scalar invariants of a second-order tensor are presented and are illustrated by a numerical example.

40|$|We {{define and}} {{characterize}} weakly isotropic tensors {{in terms of}} properties of invariance with respect to some sets of rotations, for instance, those in the cubic group. Hence, in particular, we characterize weakly isotropic tensors which are isotropic or skew-isotropic, depending on whether their order is even or odd, respectively. Restricting our attention to tensors of order {{less than or equal}} to 7, we characterize a minimal set of rotations such that invariance with respect to it implies the property of weak isotropy. Then we show that any weakly <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensor</b> of order 7 can be represented in terms of 36 independent arbitrary scalars. This number of independent scalars is minimal, in the sense that any representation for such a tensor involves at least 36 scalars. We produce two such minimal representations, first by finding a suitable choice of independent components in terms of which we express the remaining tensor components. Second, we find 36 linearly independent weakly isotropic tensors which are products of a Ricci symbol with two Kronecker symbols and are such that any other weakly <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensor</b> can be expressed as a linear combination of the...|$|E

The main derivation is given in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.

40|$|Fractional {{anisotropy}} (FA), {{defined as}} the distance of a diffusion tensor from its closest <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensor,</b> has been extensively studied as quantitative anisotropy measure for diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images (DT-MRI). It {{has been used to}} reveal the white matter profile of brain images, as guiding feature for seeding and stopping in fiber tractography and for the diagnosis and assessment of degenerative brain diseases. Despite its extensive use in DT-MRI community, however, not much attention has been given to the mathematical correctness of its derivation from diffusion tensors which is achieved using Euclidean dot product in 9 D space. But, recent progress in DT-MRI have shown that the space of diffusion tensors does not form a Euclidean vector space and thus Euclidean dot product is not appropriate for tensors. In this paper, we propose a novel and robust rotationally invariant diffusion anisotropy measure derived using the recently proposed Log-Euclidean and J-divergence tensor distance measures. An interesting finding of our work is that given a diffusion tensor, its closest <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensor</b> is different for different tensor distance used.

For anisotropic tensors the linearized approaches of the literature are adequate, however geophysical applications require the analysis of nearly <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensors,</b> too. Our paper is devoted to introduce new statistical methods for these, seemingly rare cases {{which turns out to}} be a regular problem in practice. We point out that the well-known behavior of deterministic tensors, namely that the multiplicity of the eigenvalues unambiguously refers to the spatial distribution of the eigenvectors, does not hold for matrices with random variable elements. In this way the published methods focusing only on the eigenvalues are not satisfactory. The latter statement is also confirmed by examples from geophysics. Our method can be used to analyse closeness of tensor state parameters or directional differences between a vector and one of the eigenvectors in a statistical framework. ...|$|R

40|$|Different {{sequences}} of ellipsoids are {{represented on the}} ellipticity-rotation plane. The rotation parameter {{is defined as the}} ratio of kinetic energy related to the mean tangential equatorial velocity component to kinetic energy related to tangential equatorial component velocity dispersion and residual motions. Systems with <b>isotropic</b> stress <b>tensor</b> are considered as adjoint configurations to their counterparts with anisotropic stress tensor, different angular momentum, and equal remaining parameters. Both nonequilibrium figures and figures elongated by imaginary rotation are represented on the ellipticity-rotation plane. An application is made to a reduced sample of elliptical galaxies. The position on the ellipticity-rotation plane of both sample objects and related adjoint configurations with <b>isotropic</b> stress <b>tensor</b> is inferred from existing observations within the SAURON project. With a single exception, slow rotators are characterized by low ellipticities, low anisotropy parameters, and low rotation parameters, while the contrary holds for fast rotators. A possible interpretation of slow rotators as nonrotating at all and elongated due to negative anisotropy parameters, is exploited. Finally, the elliptical side of the Hubble sequence is interpreted as a sequence of equilibrium (adjoint) configurations where the ellipticity is an increasing function of the rotation parameter, slow rotators correspond to early classes and fast rotators to late classes. In this view, boundaries are rotationally distorted regardless of angular momentum and stress tensor, where rotation has to be intended as due to additional kinetic energy of tangential equatorial velocity components, with respect to spherical configurations with <b>isotropic</b> stress <b>tensor.</b> Comment: 30 pages, 3 tables, 3 figures; submitted to SA...|$|R

40|$|In {{continuum}} mechanics, the non-centrosymmetric micropolar {{theory is}} usually used {{to capture the}} chirality inherent in materials. However when reduced to a two dimensional (2 D) isotropic problem, the resulting model becomes non-chiral. Therefore, influence of the chiral effect cannot be properly characterized by existing theories for 2 D chiral solids. To circumvent this difficulty, based on reinterpretation of <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensors</b> in a 2 D case, we propose a continuum theory to model the chiral effect for 2 D isotropic chiral solids. A single material parameter related to chirality is introduced to characterize the coupling between the bulk deformation and the internal rotation which is a fundamental feature of 2 D chiral solids. Coherently, the proposed continuum theory is also derived for a triangular chiral lattice from a homogenization procedure, from which the effective material constants of the lattice are analytically determined. The unique behavior in the chiral lattice is demonstrated through the analyses of a static tension problem and a plane wave propagation problem. The results, which cannot be predicted by the non-chiral model, are validated by the exact solution of the discrete model. Comment: 33 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

More specifically, we address both {{the construction of a}} stochastic model and the definition of a methodology allowing the numerical simulation (and consequently, the inverse experimental identification) of random elasticity tensors whose mean distance (in a sense to be defined) to a given class of material symmetry is specified. Following the eigensystem characterization of the material symmetries, the proposed approach relies on the probabilistic model derived in Mignolet and Soize (2008), allowing the variance of selected eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor to be partially prescribed. In this context, a new methodology (regarding in particular the parametrization of the model) is defined and illustrated in the case of transversely isotropic materials. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated by computing the mean distance of the random elasticity tensor to a given material symmetry class, the distance and projection onto the space of transversely <b>isotropic</b> <b>tensors</b> being defined by considering the Riemmanian metric and the Euclidean projection, respectively. It is shown that the methodology allows the above distance to be (partially) reduced as the overall level of statistical fluctuations increases, no matter the initial distance of the mean model used in the simulations.
