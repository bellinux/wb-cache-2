It is defined by a loss of {{function}} of about 75 percent of the filtration system of the kidney and characterized by azotemia and low specific gravity of the urine. Acute renal failure can be caused by loss of blood supply, hypercalcemia, or toxins such as ethylene glycol (antifreeze) or aminoglycoside antibiotics (see: ethylene glycol poisoning). Chronic renal failure can be congenital and/or inherited or caused by cancer, infection, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis, progressive <b>interstitial</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> or any of the causes of acute renal failure.|$|E

Absence of cMyBP-C (Mybpc3-targeted knock-out mice) results in severe cardiac hypertrophy, increased heart-weight-to-body-weight-ratios, enlargement of ventricles, increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and depressed diastolic and systolic function. Histologically, Mybpc3-targeted knock-out hearts display structural rearrangements with cardiac myocyte disarray and increased <b>interstitial</b> <b>fibrosis</b> similar to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, without obvious alterations in shape or size of single cardiac myocytes.

The mean right ventricular weight of patients with <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> and those with emphysema and chronic bronchitis was 85. 5 g (SD 23. 2) and 88. 8 g (34. 3), respectively. Thirty five patients (81 %) with <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> had a right ventricular weight over 65 g compared with 124 (72 %) of those with emphysema. Fifty three per cent of both those with <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> and those with chronic bronchitis and emphysema had a right ventricular weight greater than 80 g.

40|$|<b>Interstitial</b> {{pulmonary}} <b>fibrosis</b> {{induced by}} intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BL) involves an excess production of reactive oxygen species, unavailability of adequate levels of NAD and ATP {{to repair the}} injured pulmonary epithelium, and an overexuberant lung collagen reactivity followed by deposition of highly cross-linked mature collagen fibrils resistant to enzymatic degradation. In the present study, we have demonstrated that dietary supplementation with taurine and niacin offered almost complete protection against the lung fibrosis in a multidose BL hamster model. The mechanisms for the protective effect of taurine and niacin are multifaceted. These include the ability of taurine to scavenge HOCI and stabilize the biomembrane; niacin's ability to replenish the BL-induced depletion of NAD and ATP; and the combined effect of taurine and niacin to suppress all aspects of BL-induced increases in the lung collagen reactivity, a hallmark of <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis.</b> It was concluded from the data presented at this Conference that the combined treatment with taurine and niacin, which offers a multipronged approach, will have great therapeutic potential in {{the intervention of the}} development of chemically induced <b>interstitial</b> lung <b>fibrosis</b> in animals and humans. - Environ Health Perspect 102 (Suppl 10) : 137 - 148 (1994) Key words: bleomycin, <b>interstitial</b> lung <b>fibrosis,</b> taurine, niaci...|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} of activin A, {{one of the}} transforming growth factor-beta supergene family, was studied in various pulmonary conditions associated with <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> (3 cases with diffuse alveolar damage, 6 cases with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 1 case with pulmonary fibrosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis) using immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin-embedded sections. Controls consisted of 10 cases with normal pulmonary parenchyma, and 2 cases with primary pulmonary hypertension and 1 case with secondary pulmonary hypertension were also studied. The lung specimens from normal parenchyma weakly expressed immunoreactive activin A on the bronchiolar epithelium. In marked contrast, all of the specimens from cases with diffuse alveolar damage and <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> demonstrated strong {{expression of}} activin A on metaplastic epithelium, hyperplastic smooth muscle cells, desquamated cells, and alveolar macrophages.

40|$|Several {{children}} presenting {{with mild}} symptoms of respiratory tract infection {{were diagnosed with}} unclassified <b>interstitial</b> pneumonia with <b>fibrosis.</b> Their clinical and radiological findings {{were similar to those}} of acute interstitial pneumonia, but there were some differences in the pathological findings. Unclassified <b>interstitial</b> pneumonia with <b>fibrosis</b> is characterized by histological findings of centrilobular distribution of alveolar damage and bronchiolar destruction with bronchiolar obliteration. This report describes two different series of familial cases of unclassified <b>interstitial</b> pneumonia with <b>fibrosis,</b> which developed almost simultaneously in the spring. Some of the individual cases showed rapidly progressive respiratory failure of unknown cause, with comparable clinical courses and similar radiological and pathological features, including lung fibrosis. Each family member was affected almost simultaneously in the spring, different kinds of viruses were detected in two patients, and all members were negative for bacterial infection, environmental and occupational agents, drugs, and radiation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the therapeutic effect of Angelica sinensis on a rat model of diffuse <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> induced by bleomycin A 5. The mechanism by which A. sinensis exerts its effect is also discussed. A diffuse <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis</b> model was established in 36 male Wistar rats by an endotracheal injection of bleomycin A 5 (5 mg/kg). Then, these rats were randomly divided into the model group (n D 18) and the treatment group (treated with A. sinensis after modelling, n D 18). Control rats (n D 6) received an equal volume of saline. Hematoxylineosin (HE) staining was performed to analyse alveolitis and Masson staining, to observe pulmonary fibrosis. Collagen content was determined by hydroxyproline assay. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activity was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) expression at mRNA level was detected by northern blotting and at protein level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results obtained showed that the alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis of the rats treated with A. sinensis was significantly alleviated compared with that of the rats in the model group. Treatment with A. sinensis also lowered the content of collagen, decreased NF-kB activity in alveolar macrophages and reduced the TGF-b expression at the mRNA and protein level. These results indicated that A. sinensis is effective in treating and alleviating <b>interstitial</b> pulmonary <b>fibrosis,</b> possibly by lowering collagen, inhibiting the activity of NF-kB and reducing the TGF-b expression...|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to define}} the {{prevalence}} of <b>interstitial</b> lung <b>fibrosis</b> in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and {{its relationship with the}} different clinical forms of disease and ANA specificities. Methods: fifty patients with SSc were submitted to pulmonary high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Lung abnormalities were evaluated according to Warrick’s score that considers both the severity and the extent of fibrotic lesions. Results: pulmonary HRCT abnormalities were observed in 84 % of SSc patients. Ground glass aspects (60 %), irregular pleural margins (56 %) and septal/subpleural lines (68 %) were the most common lesions. The distribution of these abnormalities favoured the posterior basilar segments of both lungs. HRCT findings were significantly more frequent in males and in patients with the cutaneous diffuse form of SSc and with the specific antibody anti-Scl 70. Conclusions: HRCT is a very useful method for the diagnosis of <b>interstitial</b> lung <b>fibrosis</b> in SSc.
