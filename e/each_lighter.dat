By working with it carefully as soon as there was daylight enough to see, Decoud could loosen a mass of earth and stones overhanging the cavity in which they had deposited the treasure, so that it would look as if it had fallen naturally. It would cover up not only the cavity, but even all traces of their work, the footsteps, the displaced stones, and even the broken bushes.|$|E
5000|$|Hollywood Weekly {{featured}} Liza Fox on {{the cover}} of its September 2015 issue (health and wellness edition). The magazine praised the [...] "I Am Not I" [...] album:Liza Fox makes a smash with her new album [...] "I Am Not I" [...] which brings a hypnotic beat and mesmerizing music... Undoubtedly, Liza's raw talent results in an album with songs that take you on a journey of the senses; one which tantalizes the mind with mixed feelings. Like Liza's colorful personality, her songs also exhibit each distinctive color shining in the rainbow; <b>each</b> <b>lighter</b> and darker hue. One embarks on a zealous dancing-dynamic disposition with her single [...] "Unlimited" [...] to an imperious sort of trance while deciphering the complex meaning behind [...] "I Am Not I." [...] Think of her album as perfect for both a high-intensity workout and for setting a sultry mood. Rarely does an artist grasp so many diverse sentiments within only one album. And {{this is just one of}} the reasons Liza Fox is so far distinguished from other singers and songwriters.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, the {{lighting}} programmer {{has relied on}} their memory, {{the reliability of the}} lights or the services of an assistant, often called a lighting tracker, to document <b>each</b> position <b>each</b> <b>light</b> is used in. FocusTrack automates this process by importing {{the lighting}} console showfile (from Strand 500-series, ETC Eos-family and MA grandMA consoles) to create a list of each position (called a 'focus') used by <b>each</b> <b>light</b> in the show. The programmer can then add a written description of the purpose of each position. To precisely document the light's position on stage, the programmer can use a digital camera to take a picture of each position in turn. FocusTrack can aid in this process by controlling the <b>lighting</b> console, turning <b>each</b> <b>light</b> on in <b>each</b> position as required; it can then import the photographs to give a complete record of the work of the automated lights during the show.|$|R

By purely geometric arguments we show that the only possible case of such imaging is the trivial one where the image of any point {{is identical to the}} point itself and the surface does not perform any change of the ray direction at all. We also discuss an example of a curved surface which performs indirect stigmatic imaging after twice intersecting <b>each</b> <b>light</b> ray...|$|R

40|$|Lighting {{design is}} an {{essential}} element of visual storytelling. In cinematic theory, lighting design {{plays an important role in}} illumination, directing viewer's gaze to important locations, and portraying visual tension. However, lighting design is a complex process, and is especially problematic for interactive entertainment systems, since important design parameters such as spatial configuration, dramatic focus, and dramatic intensity, cannot be determined in advance. Indeed, they often change dramatically during interaction. Additionally, manually adjusting colors, positions, and angles of <b>each</b> <b>light</b> in a scene is a time consuming and tedious process. In this paper, we describe a system developed based on cinematic and theatrical lighting design theory to automatically adjust positions, colors, and angles of <b>each</b> <b>light</b> in real-time to accommodate the continually evolving dramatic situation, while maintaining the desired style, and ensuring visual continuity...|$|R
50|$|Deferred shading is {{a recent}} {{development}} in per-pixel lighting notable for its use in the Frostbite Engine and Battlefield 3.
