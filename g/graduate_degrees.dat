40|$|Existing {{studies on}} the returns to college {{selectivity}} have mixed results, mainly due {{to the difficulty of}} controlling for selection into more-selective colleges based on unobserved ability. Moreover, researchers have not considered <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> attainment in the analysis of labour market returns to college selectivity. In this paper, I estimate the effect of a U. S. four-year undergraduate program's selectivity on wages, including <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> attainment. I control for both observed and unobserved selection by extending the model of Carneiro, Hansen and Heckman (2003). There are two channels through which college selectivity affects future labour market outcomes. The first is the wage returns to college selectivity conditional on <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> attainment. The second is the effect of college selectivity on the probability of <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> attainment and the wage returns to <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> attainment. The results show that the former effects dominate the latter, but both are small in magnitude...|$|R

40|$|I {{study the}} size and sources of the {{monetary}} return to college achievement as measured by cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). I first present evidence that the return to achievement is large and statistically significant. I find, however, that this masks variation in the return across different groups of people. In particular, there is no relationship between GPA and earnings for <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> holders but a large and positive relationship for people without a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree.</b> To reconcile these results, I develop a model where students of differing and initially uncertain ability levels choose effort level in college and whether to earn a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree.</b> College achievement and graduate attainment are allowed to increase human capital and be used by employers to screen workers. In the separating equilibrium studied, workers who earn a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> can effectively signal high productivity to employers. As a result, employers use undergraduate GPA-a noisy signal of productivity-to screen only the workers who do not hold a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree.</b> Viewing the empirical results {{through the lens of}} this equilibrium, the zero GPA-earnings relationship for <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> holders and the positive and large relationship for people without a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> suggests that most of the reutrn to achievement net of graduate educational attainment is driven by sorting.

A survey of naval officers {{who have received}} a Navy sponsored <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> was conducted by a questionnaire to determine their opinions concerning numerous topics related to obtaining a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> and the utilization of their graduate education. Results showed that obtaining a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> was perceived as having {{a positive influence on}} officer retention. Most officers think a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> should be obtained during the five to eight year point in their career. Approximately 70 % of the officers who have received a <b>graduate</b> <b>degree</b> have been assigned to a P- coded billet.
