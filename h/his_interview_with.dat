5|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Thomson noted {{a continued}} media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson {{said he was}} contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths he advised them to avoid and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide. He noted when Jackson's FBI file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence. He noted how Gene Simmons' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than <b>his</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> Jackson's long-time guitarist, Jennifer Batten, who rebutted Simmons' claims.|$|E

5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During <b>his</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E
