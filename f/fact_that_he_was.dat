5|$|Despite his aristocratic birth, Ramarayaningar {{was known}} for his egalitarian views. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{regarded}} as a communalist and anti-Brahmin, he nominated a Brahmin, T. Sadasiva Iyer as the Commissioner of the Hindu Religious Endowment Board.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{marked a}} whole era and {{inspired}} conflicting judgments about his significant decisions. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{at the same}} time a vigorous statesman, general and orator makes more complex the objective assessment of his actions.|$|E

5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{able to recover}} from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, {{as well as the}} remarkable shape he was in for a man of his age.|$|E
5|$|His {{appearance}} in the final was remarkable for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the top scorer of the day with five points, despite having suffered an ankle injury in the previous match, and was not expected (or advised) to play. He started the final and was taken off before half time. During the break, and even some way into the second half, he was receiving treatment to his ankle, including pain-killing injections.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine emperor {{was said}} to have been infuriated with the answer and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> outsmarted.

5|$|They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott {{had sent}} Zelda his mother's ring, {{and the two}} had become engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and {{members of her family}} were wary of the relationship, as they did not approve of Scott's {{excessive}} drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains to be transported back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a heretic {{to the fact that he}} is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.|$|E

5|$|Andrzej Zahorski {{dedicated}} {{a book to}} {{the discussion}} of Poniatowski, The Dispute over Stanisław August (Spór o Stanisława Augusta, Warsaw, 1988). He notes that the discourse concerning Poniatowski is significantly colored by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the last king of Poland – the king who failed to save the country. This failure, and his prominent position, made him a convenient scapegoat for many. Zahorski argues that Poniatowski made an error by joining the Targowica Confederation; he wanted to preserve the Polish state, {{but it was too}} late for that – he only succeeded in damaging his reputation for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> suffering from cancer, {{and that he had}} decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, Melvin {{was elected}} as the Commonwealth's {{attorney}} of Hancock County, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under the required minimum age of 21 to hold public office. He was twice reelected for full terms {{to the position}} in 1856 and 1860. Melvin continued to serve as Hancock County's prosecuting attorney notwithstanding his relocation to Wheeling in 1857. Following his move to Wheeling, he established a law practice known as Pendleton & Melvin with Joseph H. Pendleton, {{who was one of}} the city's preeminent lawyers. During this period, Melvin was affiliated with the Whig Party.|$|E

But Mazhar's mom makes him {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should <b>be</b> proud of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> working so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can bear the expenses of his education. Gradually everyone including Kiran understands him. Kiran and Mazhar sort out their misunderstandings. Everyone is worried because of Manjeet's sudden change in behavior.|$|R
5|$|Jaws {{won three}} Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery and John Carter). It was also {{nominated}} for Best Picture, losing to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Spielberg greatly resented the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not nominated for Best Director. Along with the Oscar, John Williams's score won the Grammy Award, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music, and the Golden Globe Award. To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the American Cinema Editors' Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film.|$|E
5|$|Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took {{rooms at}} The Shannon Hotel, {{near the river}} and set about trying to {{capture the essence of}} the town which had {{inspired}} Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair. Pope Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work. They sold the hotel in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not wanted on stage.|$|E

5|$|Quackenbush was an {{offensive}} defenceman who carried the puck up the ice, {{making use of}} his stick handling, passing skills and ability to read the play. Over {{the course of his}} career, he was considered one of the elite rushing defenceman in the NHL. He was a solid checker, but relied more on positioning and discipline than physical play. This is evident by his low yearly average of penalty minutes and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> assessed only one major penalty throughout his NHL career.|$|E
5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents {{to leave the country}} to Romania, and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers. His plans to leave the country, along with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E
5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as {{is evidenced by}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E
