5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the mechanisms of dynamic recrystallization in dolomite, single grain orientation measurements on a mantled porphyroclast {{have been carried out}} by means of electron back-scattered patterns (EBSPs). The local orientations in the grain fabric were analysed to establish meaningful orientation families. In addition to a twinned grain, the porphyroclast consists of two domains, each with a specific orientation pattern. Both domains are polygonized by subgrain rotation, which gives great- and small-circle <b>dispersion</b> <b>patterns</b> of the crystal orientation data in the pole figures. However, even the simple and well-defined <b>dispersion</b> <b>patterns</b> for which one can assume a single slip system are not consistent with any of the theoretical <b>dispersion</b> <b>patterns</b> of the known slip systems. Additional mechanisms like rigid body rotation, nucleation and/or combinations of different slip systems are the likely explanation. No definitive orientation relationship has been found between the porphyroclast and the mantle. The lack of such a relationship, together with the shape of the grain boundary, point to grain boundary migration. The texture of the mantle agrees with the global texture of the sample, indicating that mechanisms of crystal plasticity were active during flow around the clast. The results demonstrate the potential of EBSP data for the deduction of active mechanisms, but a proper interpretation requires a better theoretical foundation. This could be achieved by modelling <b>dispersion</b> <b>patterns</b> for different mechanisms and different combinations, and by including orientation correlations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

Vehicular emissions, especially combustion of lubricants and lead-gasoline, mechanical abrasion of vehicle tyres and brakes, are the major source of heavy metals such as Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd in road dusts and roadside soils. Particulates containing heavy metals may deposit in road dusts directly or in roadside soils via aerial deposition, which brings about the accumulation of heavy metals in road dusts and roadside soils. Numerous studies have indicated that heavy metals such as Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd have accumulated in road dusts and roadside soils of China and some other countries, which may cause adverse effects on human health and environmental quality. Generally, the concentrations of heavy metals in roadside soils decrease exponentially with increasing distance from the road edge. <b>Dispersion</b> <b>patterns</b> of heavy metal contents vary greatly in different regions, and the differences are attributed mainly to the effects of traffic intensity, topographic profiles (up-down hill), road surface and greenbelts in local region, in addition to micrometeorological factors, such as wind power and speed, direction of dominant winds and rainfall...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical modeling {{estimation of the}} sediment <b>dispersion</b> <b>patterns</b> caused by waves inciding through four distinct coastline contours of the delta plain of the Doce River during the Late Holocene. For this, a wave climate model based {{on the construction of}} wave refraction diagrams, as a function of current boundary conditions, was defined and was assumed to be valid for the four coastlines. The numerical modeling was carried out on basis of the refraction diagrams, taking into account the angle of approximation and the wave height along the coastline. The results are shown to be comparable with existing data regarding the directions of net longshore drift of sediments estimated from the integration of sediment cores, interpretation of aerial photographs and C 14 datings. This fact apparently suggests that, on average, current boundary conditions appear to have remained with the same general characteristics since 5600 cal yr BP to the present.

50|$|Their main {{armament}} of nine 16 in {{guns were}} mounted in triple turrets, the only RN battleships designed in this manner. The guns themselves deviated from standard British designs. Where previous RN weapons fired heavy shells {{at a moderate}} velocity, the Nelsons weapons followed the German practice of a lighter shell at a higher velocity. This change in Director of Naval Ordnance policy was due to British testing of surrendered German equipment after World War I, although much later, subsequent testing proved contradictory. Two different rifling rates were tried, and for some {{time there was a}} mixture of barrel types in different turrets, even sometimes within the same turret. The guns suffered considerable barrel wear and had a fairly large <b>dispersion</b> <b>pattern,</b> due mainly to the different riflings that each barrel had as they were refurbished over their lifespan. To compensate for barrel wear, muzzle velocities were reduced and a heavier (longer) shell was tried to offset this; but the cost of producing new shells, modifying shell handling and storage equipment came at a time when RN funding had been heavily reduced. Nevertheless, these weapons were not generally considered by the RN to be as successful as the previous BL 15 inch Mark I, although they were considered more successful than the BL 14-inch Mark VII fitted to the subsequent King George V-class battleships. The need to reduce displacement led to the use of triple mount turrets, which had early problems with the ammunition handling and loading machinery. The heavier weight of the triple in comparison to a twin turret meant increased stresses on the roller bearings when training the turrets. This was solved by the incorporation of spring-loaded vertical as well as conventional horizontal roller bearings. The triple mount turret proved itself when, in October 1929, a turret crew with two years' experience loaded and fired 33 consecutive rounds without mishap. The incorporation of many safety features, achieved with lighter materials, meant that the complex and relatively fragile equipment had to be serviced regularly over the ships' lifetime. These ships were fitted with the HACS AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk I for surface fire control of the main armament.|$|E
