40|$|A {{prototype}} 3 Â kW horizontal upwind type {{wind turbine}} generator of 4 Â m in diameter has been designed and examined under real wind conditions. The machine was designed based on the concept that even small wind turbines should have a variable pitch control system just as large wind turbines, especially in Japan where typhoons occur {{at least once a}} year. A characteristic of the machine is the use of a worm and gear system with a stepping motor installed {{in the center of the}} hub, and the rotational main shaft. The machine is constructed with no mechanical breaking system so as to avoid damage from strong winds. In a storm, the wind turbine is slowed down by adjusting the pitch angle and the maximum electrical load. Usually the machine is controlled at several stages depending on the rotational speed of the blades. Two control methods have been applied: the variable pitch angle, and regulation of the generator field current. The characteristics of the generator under each rotational speed and field current are first investigated in the laboratory. This paper describes the performances of the wind turbine in terms of the functions of wind turbine rotational speed, generated outputs, and its stability for wind speed changes. The expected performances of the machine have been confirmed under real wind conditions and compared with numerical simulation results. The wind turbine showed a power coefficient of 0. 257 under the average wind speed of 7. 3 Â m/s.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the design and control of {{a new class of}} brushless machine known as the flux switching machine for high speed and high power application. This machine is a hybrid of the inductor alternator and the switched reluctance machine. The characteristic of this machine determined from an experimental generator shows that the power delivery capability of the machine is limited by the synchronous inductance of the machine especially at high speeds. Various power factor control techniques are proposed and evaluated as possible solutions to the attendant problems with the uncontrolled flux switching generator. This involves the use of series compensation and shunt compensation techniques. For the series compensator technique, a new class of series line compensation delivering controlled power factor using pulse width modulation is identified and tested on an experimental flux switching generator system. The shunt compensation technique for the flux switching generator system is a controlled rectifier, which uses phase angle pulse width modulation to deliver controlled power factor. The power factor control of the flux switching generator system shows that significant improvement in power delivery for the flux switching generator system can be achieved. Matlab/Simulink models are developed for each of the proposed technique and the results compared with experimental data shows reasonable agreement. These Matlab/Simulink models can now be effectively used for rapid design and prototyping of the flux switching generator system. Closed loop control of the output voltage of the flux switching generator system can be achieved. This is done using <b>field</b> <b>current</b> <b>control</b> and/or armature current control.

40|$|Direct {{torque control}} (DTC) {{is a new}} control method for {{rotating}} field electrical machines. DTC controls directly the motor stator flux linkage with the stator voltage, and no stator current controllers are used. With the DTC method very good torque dynamics can be achieved. Until now, DTC {{has been applied to}} asynchronous motor drives. The purpose of this work is to analyse the applicability of DTC to electrically excited synchronous motor drives. Compared with asynchronous motor drives, electrically excited synchronous motor drives require an additional control for the rotor field current. The <b>field</b> <b>current</b> <b>control</b> is called excitation control in this study. The dependence of the static and dynamic performance of DTC synchronous motor drives on the excitation control has been analysed and a straightforward excitation control method has been developed and tested. In the field weakening range the stator flux linkage modulus must be reduced {{in order to keep the}} electro motive force of the synchronous motor smaller than the stator voltage and in order to maintain a sufficient voltage reserve. The dynamic performance of the DTC synchronous motor drive depends on the stator flux linkage modulus. Another important factor for the dynamic performance in the field weakening range is the excitation control. The field weakening analysis considers both dependencies. A modified excitation control method, which maximises the dynamic performance in the field weakening range, has been developed. In synchronous motor drives the load angle must be kept in a stabile working area in order to avoid loss of synchronism. The traditional vector control methods allow to adjust the load angle of the synchronous motor directly by the stator current control. In the DTC synchronous motor drive the load angle is not a directly controllable variable, but it is formed freely according to the motor’s electromagnetic state and load. The load angle can be limited indirectly by limiting the torque reference. This method is however parameter sensitive and requires a safety margin between the theoretical torque maximum and the actual torque limit. The DTC modulation principle allows however a direct load angle adjustment without any current control. In this work a direct load angle control method has been developed. The method keeps the drive stabile and allows the maximal utilisation of the drive without a safety margin in the torque limitation...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This {{thesis is}} about the dynamic control of a {{permanent}} magnet assisted reluctance synchronous machine (PMA RSM). The PMA RSM in this thesis is a 110 kW traction machine and is ideal for the use in electrical rail vehicles. An application of the dynamic control of the PMA RSM in electrical rail vehicles is to reduce wheel slip. The mathematical model of the PMA RSM is derived and explained in physical terms. Two methods of current control for the PMA RSM are investigated, namely constant <b>field</b> <b>current</b> <b>control</b> (CFCC) and constant current angle control (CCAC). It is shown that CCAC is more appropriate for the PMA RSM. A current controller for the PMA RSM that guarantees stability is derived and given as an analytic formula. This current controller {{can be used for}} any method of current control, i. e. CFCC or CCAC. An accurate simulation model for the PMA RSM is obtained using results from finite element analysis (FEA). The accurate model is used in a simulation to verify CCAC. A normal proportional integral speed controller for the PMA RSM is designed and the design is also verified by simulation. Practical implementation of the current and speed controllers is considered along with a general description of the entire drive system. The operation of the resolver (for position measurement) is given in detail. Important safety measures and the design of the electronic circuitry to give protection are shown. Practical results concerning current and speed control are then shown. To improve the dynamic performance of the PMA RSM, a load torque observer with compensation current feedback is investigated. Two observer structures are considered, namely the reduced state observer and the full state observer. The derivation of the full state observer and the detail designs of the observer elements are given. The accurate simulation model of the PMA RSM is used to verify the operation of the observer structures and to evaluate the dynamic performance. Both observer structures are implemented practically and practical results are shown. One method of position sensorless control, namely the high frequency voltage injection method, is discussed in terms of the PMA RSM. This work is additional to the thesis but it is shown, because it raises some interesting questions regarding the dynamic control of the PMA RSM...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{objective was to}} investigate the generation and collection of power generated in a distributed tidal generation site, and realise the most economic grid connection methodology for a practical installation. Current tidal steam prototype designs utilise variable speed gear boxes, power frequency converters and variable pitch blades in the nacelle, thus requiring complicated, heavy and expensive equipment in the nacelle. Moreover the variable blade pitch mechanism has a large power demand, and has to operate day after day submerged in water at depths between 30 m – 80 m. The approach taken in this research is to replace major cost components with much cheaper ones, as well as locating as many components as possible onshore where costs are less. This thesis investigates a novel tidal stream power generation system referred to as “passive rectification to a common DC-bus” where an array of 3 -phase synchronous generators operating at diverse speeds are connected to a common DC bus via passive diode rectifiers. The proposed tidal stream topology shows that variable pitched blades, variable speed gearboxes and frequency converters in the nacelle can be replaced by a much simpler system that uses fixed pitch blades, a fixed ratio gearbox, generator excitation control system, and a diode bridge rectifier. These components are generally cheaper, lighter, have a lower power demand and are more reliable than the components they replace. Also some of the voltage and frequency conversion is carried out ashore where costs are less, in addition to the overall {{reduction in the number of}} components required as some of the components are shared by multiple devices. As a result system efficiency is maximised, in addition to facilitating a reduction in capital, installation and operational costs. Power conversion from the tidal generation power system to shore is achieved via passive rectification to a common DC-bus, thus system power regulation is achieved by individual generator <b>field</b> <b>current</b> <b>control,</b> to attain optimum system operation including, maximum power extraction, power limitation and stall control, in turn improving system reliability and controllability. Furthermore passive stall control via generator field current regulation eliminates the need for mechanical brakes which reduces cost and improves reliability.

The findings are also investigated according to theory and comparing with simulations. This project work has been done for the fulfillment of master's degree under Electric Power Engineering department starting from 22 nd September 2010. In this master’s thesis work three control schemes for an induction machine are implemented on the dSPACE DS 1103 real time control system, through which a converter operated induction machine is controlled. Both open loop control and closed loop <b>Field</b> Oriented <b>Current</b> <b>control</b> are implemented on the system. The controllers are implemented by writing c-programs and all the control commands are given from the ControlDesk software using a real time environment. With the sensors used by the controllsystem, real time measurements are taken with the Controldesk software and the data from the experiments are saved and compared with simulations. The open loop control (V/Hz control) has been implemented successfully and the output is almost similar to the theory. From the open loop experiments it is found that the hardware is working well and that the measuring system is working, even though there are some offsets in the signals and some measurement noise in the signals from the switching. For the <b>field</b> oriented <b>current</b> <b>control</b> system the low current step of 0. 33 A has been successful and it matches with the simulations. The rise time of the current is 2. 2 ms, as designed, and the current follows the reference without any overshoot. But the responses for the larger steps of 0. 833 A and 1. 7 A do not match with the simulated step responses. The rise time of the measured current is faster due to the second order response and that the control system is implemented digitally. For the speed controller the measured step response matches with the simulated one, except for that the measured response has oscillations, which are not present in the simulations. The second order response comes partly from the low pass filter which is used to remove the noise in the speed signal is not included in the controller design. The selected cut off frequency of 10 Hz affected the speed controller with a bandwidth of 20 rad/s. The flexible rubber coupling that connects the two machines in the experimental setup could also contribute to the second order response. From simulations it could be observed that increasing the cut off frequency to 200 rad/s or lowering the bandwidth of the speed controller to 10 rad/s the second order behavior could be efficiently removed. By reducing the speed controller bandwidth to 10 rad/s in the experimental setup the oscillations in the step response could be damped...|$|R
50|$|For large, {{commercial}} size horizontal-axis wind turbines, the electrical generator is mounted in a nacelle {{at the top}} of a tower, behind the hub of the turbine rotor. Typically wind turbines generate electricity through asynchronous machines that are directly connected with the electricity grid. Usually the rotational speed of the wind turbine is slower than the equivalent rotation speed of the electrical network: typical rotation speeds for wind generators are 5-20 rpm while a directly connected machine will have an electrical speed between 750 and 3600 rpm. Therefore, a gearbox is inserted between the rotor hub and the generator. This also reduces the generator cost and weight. Commercial size generators have a rotor carrying a field winding so that a rotating magnetic field is produced inside a set of windings called the stator.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the torque {{production}} and control strategies of variable flux reluctance machines (VFRMs). Based on energy conservation, an instantaneous torque equation is developed and analysed, which reveals the contributions of harmonic currents and inductances to the torque production. By using Fourier series, all of the harmonics in the phase currents and winding inductances are considered. It was found that the average torque of a 6 / 4 VFRM is mainly produced by the dc, fundamental and second harmonic components of the phase currents. Based on the derived torque equation, magnitudes and phases of the current harmonics are optimised so that the average torque is maximised under a given rms current. Undesirable level of torque ripple was found, due to the inductance harmonics. The third harmonic torque ripple is dominant in the 6 / 4 VFRM, whilst the 6 / 7 VFRM has a lower magnitude sixth harmonic component. In order to reduce the torque ripple, a harmonic <b>field</b> <b>current</b> is injected. Since the torque ripple reduction method utilises the machine parameters, the influence of the parameter mismatch is investigated. The torque waveforms predicted by the derived torque equation are compared with the results directly calculated by 2 D-finite element analysis (FEA). Additionally, the experimental results verify that the derived torque equations can predict the torque production of the VFRMs to a good degree of accuracy. In order to improve the machine efficiency and extend the operating speed range, an integrated <b>field</b> and armature <b>current</b> <b>control</b> strategy has been proposed. The <b>field</b> and armature <b>currents</b> are injected into a single coil as a sinusoidal current biased by a dc offset, rather than a separate field and armature winding. In the integrated <b>current</b> <b>control</b> scheme, a zero sequence current generates a virtual rotor flux as the <b>field</b> <b>current,</b> whilst the three-phase sinusoidal currents produce a rotating stator field. The zero sequence current is generated by adjusting the on-time of zero vectors between two inverters. In the case of the 6 / 4 VFRM, an open winding configuration is utilised since the field and armature windings have the same polarity in each tooth winding. In contrast, a dual three-phase winding configuration having a neutral point is adopted for the 6 / 7 VFRM, due to the opposite polarity between the field and armature windings. For the vector control, the voltage and torque equations are derived in the synchronous dq-axis frame. With the aid of MATLAB/Simulink, these equations are also utilised for the dynamic simulation. The simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed strategy can effectively increase the efficiency and extend the operating speed range of the VFRMs. As an extended work, a torque ripple reduction method is also applied to the integrated <b>current</b> <b>control</b> by injecting harmonic components into the zero sequence current...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} highly dynamic {{electrical}} drives, characterized by high quality torque control, {{in a wide}} variety of applications has grown tremendously during the past decades. Direct torque control (DTC) for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) can provide this accurate and fast torque control. When applying DTC the change of the stator flux linkage vector is controlled, based on torque and flux errors. As such the estimation of the stator flux linkage is essential. In the literature several possible solutions for the estimation of the stator flux linkage are proposed. In order to overcome problems associated with the integration of the back-emf, the use of state observers has been advocated in the literature. Several types of state observers have been conceived and implemented for PMSMs, especially the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has received much attention. In most reported applications however the EKF is only used to estimate the speed and rotor position of the PMSM in order to realize <b>field</b> oriented <b>current</b> <b>control</b> in a rotor reference frame. Far fewer publications mention the use of an EKF to estimate the stator flux linkage vector in order to apply DTC. Still the performance of the EKF in the estimation of the stator flux linkage vector has not yet been thoroughly investigated.

The possibilities to improve the estimation by augmenting the state vector and the consequences of these alterations are explored.

This study {{focuses on}} the drive control system of a novel direct <b>field</b> and torque <b>current</b> <b>control</b> applied to a six-phase {{induction}} motor. Special phase current waveforms that {{make it possible to}} have separate field and torque windings and currents in the motor are proposed. In this thesis the control of these field and torque windings to control directly the flux and torque of the motor is investigated. With the special phase current waveforms the performance of the six-phase induction motor is evaluated through theoretical and finite element analysis. In the analysis the air gap resultant field intensity and flux density produced by the stator field, stator torque and rotor currents are investigated. It is shown that with the special current waveforms a quasi-square shaped, smooth rotating air gap flux density is generated. This smooth rotating flux is important for proper induction motor operation. An equation for the electromagnetic torque is derived and used in the theoretical calculations. The ease of the torque performance calculations is conspicuous. An approximate magnetic circuit calculation method is developed to calculate the air gap flux density versus <b>field</b> <b>current</b> relationship taking magnetic saturation into account. The air gap MMF harmonics and the per phase self and mutual inductances are analysed and calculated using, amongst other things, winding functions. In the finite element analysis specific attention is given to the MMF balanced condition (zero quadrature flux condition) in the motor {{and the development of a}} per phase equivalent model.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{two types of}} <b>current</b> <b>control</b> techniques, namely, direct and {{indirect}} <b>current</b> <b>control</b> techniques are employed to a three phase shunt active power filter for the compensation of the harmonics in the current caused by the non-linear loads. The {{difference between these two}} types of <b>current</b> <b>control</b> technique is in the number of current sensors used. In direct <b>current</b> <b>control</b> technique both load and filter currents are sensed whereas indirect <b>current</b> <b>control</b> technique is based up on sensing source side current only. For both the schemes a simple PI-controller is used to obtain reference current templates. Also, a novel fuzzy logic based controller is developed to replace the conventional PIcontroller. The advantages of fuzzy controllers over conventional controllers are that they do not require an accurate mathematical model, they can work with imprecise inputs, can handle non-linearity and they are more robust. Various simulations are presented for direct and indirect <b>current</b> <b>control</b> techniques along with PI-controller and Fuzzy Logic Controller under both steady state and transient conditions...|$|R

The hysteresis <b>current</b> <b>control,</b> the delta modulation {{control and the}} carrier-based PWM control are considered in the paper. The synchronous detection method {{is used to calculate}} the reference currents for shunt active power filter. The simulation results show that the carrier-based PWM control technique provides the minimum %THD value of the source currents compared with other comparable techniques after compensation. However, the %THD values of all three techniques can follow the IEEE std. 519 - 1992.
