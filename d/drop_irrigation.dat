40|$|Growing {{demand for}} water for {{industry}} and municipalities, combined with environmental problems results in less water for {{agriculture in the}} future. One of the approaches to meet the future water shortages will be increasing water productivity which means raising crop yields per unit of water consumed. Over the past three decades, this has been achieved largely through higher crop yields per hectare. In its broadest sense, it means getting more value or benefit from each drop of water used for crops, fish, forests and livestock while maintaining or improving ecosystems and the services they provide. Within agriculture, this means obtaining more production or value from every drop. Water productivity or yield per unit of water, like yield per unit of land, is partial productivity of just one factor. Further, the definition of water productivity is scale-dependent. For a farmer, it means getting more crop per <b>drop</b> of <b>irrigation</b> water. But, for society as a whole, concerned with a basin or country’s water resource, this means getting more value per unit of water resource used.

After fruit set, the water needs for the vine <b>drop</b> and <b>irrigation</b> is often withheld till the period of veraison when the grapes begin to change color. This period of [...] "water stress" [...] encourages the vine to concentrate its limited resources into lower yields of smaller berries creating a favorable skin to juice ratio that is often desirable in quality wine production. The benefits or disadvantages of irrigation during the ripening period itself is a matter of debate and continuing research in the wine growing community. The only area of mostly agreement is the disadvantages of water close to harvest after a prolonged dry period. Grapevines that have been subjected to prolonged water stress have a tendency to rapidly absorb large amounts of water if its provided. This will dramatically swell the berries, potentially causing to them crack or burst which will make the prone to various grape diseases. Even if the berries do not crack or burst, the rapid swelling of water will cause a reduce concentration in sugars and phenolic compounds in the grape producing wines with diluted flavors and aromas.|$|R

ABSTRACT: Irrigation water quality has significant importance in dry region that have high temperature and low humidity. Mechanical properties and physical properties are stability, porous, soil structure and hydraulic directing relative to exchange ion in irrigation. We can control problem due to pollution in environment level and water resources and can increase products performance. Eatable vegetable are in border with respect to consumption process and should be evaluate because of gathering different elements such as heavy metal like sorb, calcium, corm, Niche, Mercury, Arsenic, cobalt. Model output is depending on application method and reuse method of effluent. Also filterable effluent volume, weather situation, cost and investment level and each value are other effective factors. Recommendation are filtration, Earth filter and soon. We can attribute part of filter to irrigation system trend. Also we can avoid of effluent mix apply or effluent alternative application.

Even the idea of automated irrigation is not new, mankind has figured out how to irrigate large areas of foliage through the use of automated and <b>drop</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems. Efficient, automated irrigation systems, which can irrigate plants to a desired level and supply those plants with just the amount of water required for normal an uptake plant growth, are currently not available. These systems, if developed, could reduce waste of irrigated water. The irrigation controller is the "brain " of an entire irrigation system.

Disease severity means were 5.8 and 2.8 in fields with overhead sprinkler irrigation and furrow irrigation, respectively using the standard {{system for the}} evaluation of bean germplasm with 1 as “no visible disease symptoms” and 9 as “very severe disease symptoms”(Schoonhoven and Pastor-Corrales 1994; Akhavan et al. 2009 a). In addition to dispersing bacterial cells and helping them to reach healthy plants as the key factor, and promoting release of leaf nutrients to the microbial community, overhead sprinkler irrigation can generate a film of water over the leaf surface including stomata, providing the symptomless epiphytic populations with a bridge to enter the plant resulting in disease symptoms development (Carvalho et al. 2011). Previously, it has also been shown that Asiatic citrus canker was more severe when applying overhead irrigation system which also increased the incidence of this disease caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (Pruvost et al. 1999).

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  4, the {{probability}} of Cl−, Na+, SAR and EC exceeding their corresponding critical thresholds is higher in {{lower half of the}} study area. Based on probability maps and using the probability threshold, which is assumed to be equal to the marginal probability of each parameter, groundwater quality is classified as suitable and unsuitable for sprinkler irrigation purposes (Fig.  4). According to the maps generated (Fig.  4), the unsuitable groundwater for irrigation in terms of high amounts of Cl−, Na+, SAR and EC are located in southern parts of the study area. These areas are supposed to be inappropriate for the implementation of sprinkler irrigation. However, the suitability of irrigation water regarding salinity management should be assessed considering salt tolerance of the cultivated crops and soil characteristics. This means in areas with slightly high levels of salinity and sodium, groundwater can still be used for irrigating certain crops e.g. barley, sugar beet and wheat because different crops have different tolerance levels of salinity/sodium hazard (Bauder 2007). Also to reduce leaf burn under sprinkler irrigation from both sodium and chloride, irrigation on cool, cloudy days or overnight would be beneficial. Moreover to avoid direct contact of saline water with leaf surfaces in sprinkler <b>irrigation,</b> <b>drop</b> nozzles and drag hoses are recommended (Bauder 2007).|$|R
40|$|When a {{raindrop}} hits a sand bed, {{it leaves}} behind a small crater {{with a mixture}} of liquid and grains located at the center. This event is frequently observed in nature, but when absent, sprinklers may artificially produce these impacting <b>drops</b> to facilitate <b>irrigation.</b> Also in industry, the interaction between liquid and grains is important in for instance, a pharmaceutical production process called wet granulation. In order to understand and influence this interplay between liquid and sand, we investigate the physics of this subtle and complex phenomenon, by studying experimentally the early stage of rain impacting on sand, i. e., the impact of a single drop on a still dry bed of grains. As soon as a drop impacts on a granular bed, both the drop and the target start to deform, and for wettable grains mixing occurs. In this thesis we succeeded in disentangling these three processes by using high-speed laser profilometry in combination with traditional high-speed imaging, such {{that we were able to}} capture both the deformation of the sand bed and the droplet.

The results indicate that the three larger financial programs were having some impact to agricultural production. These programs were the Less Favored Areas program, the Farming Investment Plans program and the New Farmers' program. All this programs were funded in Greece by Measure 1. 1 of the 2 nd Community Support Framework (CSF) for Greece. The main field of environmental investment for the Farming Investment Plans was <b>drop</b> <b>irrigation</b> but this amounted only to 2 % of the total investment plans for the whole of the country. On the other hand, no direct linkage with the agricultural production of the three Accompanying Measures of the EU CAP was observed. These Measures were the Organic production program, the Rare Animal Breeds Preservation program and the Reduction of Nitrates Pollution program. Although these programs are more directed towards environmental protection, their limited impact is hardly surprising since these three programs have a narrow scope with regard to areas affected as well as funds provided. The results confirm that the link between the CAP and the agricultural sector size exists but the actual impact of the environmental reform of the CAP during the 90 s had hardly any effect in Greece since it was largely underfunded. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|A partir da década de 1990, em função da valorização da fruta no mercado interno e do aumento das exportações da fruta in natura, observou-se aumento da importância da lima ácida Tahiti (Citrus latifolia (Yu. Tanaka) Tanaka) sob os aspectos econômico e social no agronegócio brasileiro. A diversidade genética da espécie é pequena e os cultivos comerciais são baseados, predominantemente, nos clones IAC 5 e Quebra-galho. Atualmente, existem novos clones para a diversificação de copas. Entretanto, a baixa disponibilidade de informações sobre os mesmos dificulta a diversificação dos pomares. Além da baixa diversificação de copas, grande parte dos pomares utilizam o limão Cravo (Citrus limonia Osbeck) como porta-enxerto, por induzir maior produtividade e tolerância à deficiência hídrica. Por outro lado, a combinação dos clones IAC 5 e Quebra-galho com o limoeiro Cravo tem levado à produção de plantas de porte elevado e baixa longevidade devido às elevadas taxas de mortalidade causadas por gomose de Phytophthora (Phytophthora spp.) e à presença de estirpes severas do vírus da {{tristeza}} dos citros e do viróide da exocorte. Dessa forma, este trabalho avaliou o desempenho horticultural de clones de limeira ácida Tahiti enxertados em citrumelo Swingle [Citrus paradisi Macfad. cv. Duncan x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. ] em Bebedouro, SP. Tendo em vista as restrições do uso comercial do citrumelo Swingle em ambientes que apresentam deficiência hídrica prolongada, os clones foram avaliados em duas áreas distintas, diferenciadas pelo uso da irrigação. Foram avaliados os clones IAC 5, IAC 5 - 1, CNPMF/EECB, CNPMF 2000 e CNPMF 2001. O experimento foi instalado em março de 2005 e as avaliações foram realizadas entre 2007 e 2011. Foram avaliados o crescimento vegetativo, produção, eficiência produtiva, qualidade dos frutos, fotossíntese e potencial da água na folha em ambas as áreas. Adicionalmente, na área não irrigada, a tolerância à deficiência hídrica, condutância estomática e transpiração foram avaliados visando à seleção de clones mais adequados para cultivos não irrigados. A análise de variância dos dados obtidos na área irrigada e não irrigada foi realizada conjuntamente e as médias foram comparadas pelo teste de Duncan (P< 0, 05). O clone CNPMF/EECB apresentou maior produção acumulada de frutos e maior eficiência produtiva, independentemente da condição de cultivo. Sob cultivo irrigado, o clone CNPMF/EECB apresentou maior produção de frutos na entressafra. Os clones IAC 5 - 1, CNPMF/EECB, CNPMF 2000 e CNPMF 2001 apresentaram maior crescimento vegetativo em relação ao clone IAC 5, independentemente da condição de cultivo. O clone IAC 5 - 1 induziu maior porcentagem de frutos adequados à exportação, maior tolerância à deficiência hídrica e maior suscetibilidade à podridão floral dos citros. A irrigação induziu maior crescimento vegetativo, maior precocidade de produção, maior produção de frutos na safra e entressafra, maior eficiência produtiva, maior rendimento de suco, maior acidez e maior porcentagem de frutos exportáveis. Since the 90 s, Tahiti lime (Citrus latifolia (Yu. Tanaka) Tanaka) {{has increased}} its importance in the Brazilian agribusiness with economic and social impacts, due to higher fruit value recorded both on domestic and international markets. Genetic diversity of this species is restricted, and in Brazil, most of the commercial orchards are predominantly based on IAC 5 and Quebra-galho selections. Currently, new selections are available for scion diversification. Nonetheless, technical information about these materials is very limited, thus restricting the studies on scion diversification. Besides the low diversification of scions, most of the orchards are established onto the Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia Osbeck), because of higher yield and tolerance to water deficit induced by this rootstock. IAC 5 and Quebra-galho selections grafted onto the Rangpur lime result in large-sized plants of low longevity, because of their high susceptibility to Phytophthora gummosis (Phytophthora spp.), and the endemic presence of severe Citrus Tristeza Virus strains and the Exocortis Citrus Viroid. Restricted scion and rootstocks diversification increase {{the risks associated with}} outbreaks of new and more severe diseases and pests that threaten the whole Tahiti lime production chain. This study evaluated the horticultural performance of five Tahitiĺime selections grafted on Swingle citrumelo [Citrus paradisi Macfad. cv. Duncan x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. ], in Bebedouro, São Paulo State, Brazil. Due to constraints for the commercial use of Swingle citrumelo as rootstock in environments under prolonged water deficit conditions, two trials were conducted for evaluation of Tahiti lime selections under irrigated and non irrigated conditions. The following Tahiti lime selections were studied: IAC 5, IAC 5 - 1, CNPMF/EECB, CNPMF 2000 and CNPMF 2001. The experiment was installed in March 2005 and the evaluations were performed between 2007 and 2011, involving the following variables: plant growth, yield, yield efficiency, fruit quality, photosynthesis rate and leaf water potential in both irrigated and non-irrigated trials. In addition, plant water deficit tolerance, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and water use efficiency were evaluated in the non-irrigated trial for selecting suitable selections for non-irrigated plantings. Data obtained in the irrigated and non-irrigated trials were submitted to individual and joint analyses of variance, and the comparisons among means were performed by Duncan test (P< 0. 05). The CNPMF/EECB selection had larger cumulative fruit yield and yield efficiency both in the irrigated and non-irrigated plantings. In the irrigated trial, the CNPMF/EECB selection presented larger offseason fruit yield. The IAC 5 - 1, CNPMF/EECB, CNPMF 2000 and CNPMF 2001 selections had larger tree size than the IAC 5 selection, both in the irrigated and non-irrigated plantings. The IAC 5 - 1 selection induced larger percentage of fresh fruit for export under irrigated and non-irrigated plantings, conferring higher water deficit tolerance and lower tolerance to postbloom fruit <b>drop.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> increased plant growth, early bearing, main-season and off-season fruit production, yield efficiency, juice percentage, juice acidity and the percentage of fresh fruit classified for export...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJeffrey M. PetersonThe High Plains aquifer is {{a primary}} source of {{irrigation}} in western Kansas. Since World War II, producers increased irrigation and the irrigated acreage with the widespread adoption of newer irrigation technologies, causing {{a reduction in the}} saturated thickness of the High Plains aquifer. In an effort to conserve water and reduce further decline of the aquifer, the state of Kansas administered cost-share programs to producers who upgraded to an efficient irrigation system. But evidence suggests that the efforts to reduce water consumption have been undermined by producers, who under certain conditions have increased irrigation and irrigated acreage of high-valued and water-intensive crops. The state of Kansas is in a quandary to reduce water consumption and stabilize the saturated thickness of the aquifer while maintaining the economic viability of irrigated agriculture. A producer is faced with the choice of crop, irrigation timing and irrigation technology {{at the start of the}} season. This research identifies the conditions for risk-efficient crop choices and estimates the effect of an irrigation technology upgrade on the aquifer. Simulation models based on data from Tribune, Kansas were executed under various scenarios, varying by crop (corn or sorghum), irrigation system (conventional center-pivot or center-pivot with drop nozzles) and well capacity (190, 285 or 570 gallons per minute). Each well capacity was associated with a pre-season soil moisture level (0. 40, 0. 60 or 0. 80 of field capacity). Each scenario was simulated over weather data observed during the 36 -year period (1971 - 2006). Results indicate that producers with slower wells could maximize their net returns while conserving water by choosing less water-intensive crops like sorghum, while irrigating with a conventional center-pivot irrigation system. Producers with faster wells could maximize net returns by choosing water-intensive crops like corn and irrigate with the more efficient center-pivot with <b>drop</b> nozzle <b>irrigation</b> system. In order to reduce groundwater consumption and maintain the saturated thickness of the aquifer, water policies should internalize the interests of all stakeholders and be a combination of irrigation technology, economic factors, hydrological conditions, agronomic practices, conservation practices and local dynamics of the region...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Bulb {{syringes}} can be {{used for}} the self-clearance of earwax and, in the short term, appear effective. We compared the long-term effectiveness of self-irrigation using a bulb syringe with routine care in United Kingdom (UK) family practice clinics where irrigating ears to remove wax is a common procedure. Methods: We assessed the impact on health service utilization as a follow-up to a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial of 237 patients attending 7 UK family practice clinics with symptomatic, occluding earwax who were randomized to an intervention group (ear drops, bulb syringe, instructions on its use and reuse) or a control group (ear <b>drops,</b> then clinic <b>irrigation).</b> After 2 years, a retrospective notes search for earwax-related consultations was carried out. We used an intention-to-treat analysis to assess differences in dichotomous outcomes between groups. Results: In the 2 -year trial follow-up, more control group patients returned with episodes of earwax: 85 of 117 (73 %) control vs 70 of 117 (60 %) intervention, 2 = 4. 30; P =. 038; risk ratio 1. 21 (95 % CI, 1. 01 – 1. 37). The numbers of consultations amounted to 1. 15 (control) vs 0. 64 (intervention) (incidence rate ratio 1. 79; 95 % CI, 1. 05 – 3. 04, P =. 032), ie, a difference of 0. 50 consultations, thus saving a consultation on average for every 2 people. Conclusion: For patients who have not already tried bulb syringes, self-irrigation using a bulb syringe significantly reduces subsequent demand for ear irrigation by health professionals. Advocating the initial use of bulb syringes could reduce demand for ear irrigation in family practice clinics. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Water {{users in}} the Lower Rio Grande Basin of Texas have {{depended}} on {{the flow of the}} Rio Grande to supply water for agricultural as well as municipal and industrial purposes. Although the area is a major agricultural production region, it faces continuing problems associated with use of irrigation water from the Rio Grande. Periodic water shortages threaten to limit the potential growth and economic well-being of the area. Inefficient use of available water supplies as a result of inadequate and/or antiquated distribution facilities and inefficient management of water on farms contributes to the depletion of available water supplies for irrigation and other uses. The objectives of this study were: (1) to study the effects of water rights as allocative devices for water; to determine the impact on cropping patterns and water use efficiency of a change which would make rights negotiable, and (2) to study the influence of Water Control and Improvement Districts on the distribution and use of water; to determine whether the ways in which these districts are organized and operated may cause them to act as facilitating or obstructing elements in the efficient development and use of water resources in the Valley. To meet the first objective, parametric linear programming was used to analyze the impact of negotiable water rights on cropping patterns and enterprise combinations. If the institution of water rights were changed so as to make annual allotments negotiable, market forces could be expected to move the resource into uses in which it has a higher value. Water price was varied from $ 9. 60 per acre foot to $ 96. 00 per acre foot. At a price of $ 9. 60, which is approximately the present cost of irrigation water delivered at the farm gate, producers could profitably use almost 2, 000, 000 acre feet of water per year. At this price, 83 percent of the irrigable lands and 77 percent of the water used in the Valley would be devoted to the production of cotton and grain sorghum. At a water price of $ 18. 65 per acre foot or higher, grain sorghum production in the Valley reverts dryland and water use for <b>irrigation</b> <b>drops</b> to 1, 363, 300 acre feet per year. At a price of $ 32. 45 or above, the land devoted to cotton would be switched to dryland grain sorghum production and water use would decline to 407, 900 acre feet annually. The use of parametric programming with variable water pricing allowed the derivation of a value-in-use or "conditional demand" curve for water. To meet the second objective of the study, data on the Valley Water Control and Improvement Districts were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The dependent variable was delivery cost per acre irrigated. Size of district, acre feet pumped per acre irrigated, and percent of operating revenues derived from water deliveries were the independent variables. It was found that the optimum size district, from a least-cost standpoint, was 42, 355 acres. However, other institutional problems associated with District policy and organization would seem to more than offset cost advantages of reorganization and consolidation. Therefore, it does not seem likely that local water users would seek changes in the organizational structure of districts simply to take advantage of economies of size associated with consolidation. iii Rehabilitation of district facilities was analyzed using data from the parametric programming model for five levels of development. It was found that rehabilitation of district facilities is economically feasible, at least to the present level of water use in the Valley...|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the findings of}} the Echo Meadows Project (BPA Project 2001 - 015 - 00). The main purpose of this project is to artificially recharge an alluvial aquifer, WITH water from Umatilla River during the winter high flow period. In turn, this recharged aquifer will discharge an increased flow of cool groundwater back to the river, thereby improving Umatilla River water quality and temperature. A considerable side benefit is that the Umatilla River should improve as a habitat for migration, spanning, and rearing of anadromous and resident fish. The scope of this project is to provide critical baseline information about the Echo Meadows and the associated reach of the Umatilla River. Key elements of information that has been gathered include: (1) Annual and seasonal groundwater levels in the aquifer with an emphasis on the irrigation season, (2) Groundwater hydraulic properties, particularly hydraulic conductivity and specific yield, and (3) Groundwater and Umatilla River water quality including temperature, nutrients and other indicator parameters. One of the major purposes of this data gathering was to develop input to a groundwater model of the area. The purpose of the model is to estimate our ability to recharge this aquifer using water that is only available outside of the irrigation season (December through the end of February) and to estimate the timing of groundwater return flow back to the river. We have found through the data collection and modeling efforts that this reach of the river had historically returned as much as 45 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water to the Umatilla River during the summer and early fall. However, this return flow was reduced to as low as 10 cfs primarily due to reduced quantities of irrigation application, gain in irrigation efficiencies and increased groundwater pumping. Our modeling indicated {{that it is possible to}} restore these critical return flows using applied water outside of the irrigation season. We further found that this water can be timed to return to the river during the desired time of the year (summer to early fall). This is because the river stage, which remains relatively high until this time, <b>drops</b> during the <b>irrigation</b> season-thereby releasing the stored groundwater and increasing river flows. A significant side benefit is that these enhanced groundwater return flows will be clean and cold, particularly as compared to the Umatilla River. We also believe that this same type of application of water could be done and the resulting stream flows could be realized in other watersheds throughout the Pacific Northwest. This means that it is critical to compare the results from this baseline report to the full implementation of the project in the next phase. As previously stated, this report only {{discusses the}} results of data gathered during the baseline phase of this project. We have attempted to make the data that has been gathered accessible with the enclosed databases and spreadsheets. We provide computer links in this report to the databases so that interested parties can fully evaluate the data that has been gathered. However, we cannot emphasize too strongly that the real value of this project is to implement the phases to come, compare the results of these future phases to this baseline and develop the science and strategies to successfully implement this concept to other rivers in the Pacific Northwest. The results from our verified and calibrated groundwater model matches the observed groundwater data and trends collected during the baseline phase. The modeling results indicate that the return flows may increase to their historic values with the addition of 1 acre-ft/acre of recharge water to the groundwater system (about 9, 600 acre-feet total). What this means is that through continued recharge project, you can double to quadruple the annual baseflow of the Umatilla River during the low summer and fall flow periods as compared to the present base-flow. The cool and high quality recharge water is a significant beneficial impact to the river system...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{review is}} one of six looking at the primary medical {{management}} options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of {{the lining of the}} nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Nasal saline irrigation is commonly used to improve patient symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of saline irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials. gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 30 October 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing saline delivered to the nose by any means (douche, <b>irrigation,</b> <b>drops,</b> spray or nebuliser) with (a) placebo, (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of local irritation and discomfort. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. MAIN RESULTS: We included two RCTs (116 adult participants). One compared large-volume (150 ml) hypertonic (2 %) saline irrigation with usual treatment over a six-month period; the other compared 5 ml nebulised saline twice a day with intranasal corticosteroids, treating participants for three months and evaluating them on completion of treatment and three months later. Large-volume, hypertonic nasal saline versus usual care One trial included 76 adult participants (52 intervention, 24 control) with or without polyps. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI; 0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). At the end of three months of treatment, patients in the saline group were better than those in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 6. 3 points, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 89 to 11. 71) and at six months there was a greater effect (MD 13. 5 points, 95 % CI 9. 63 to 17. 37). We assessed the evidence to be of low quality for the three months follow-up and very low quality for the six months follow-up. Patient-reported disease severity was evaluated using a "single-item sinus symptom severity assessment" but the range of scores is not stated, making it impossible for us to determine the meaning of the data presented. No adverse effects data were collected in the control group but 23 % of participants in the saline group experienced side effects including epistaxis. General HRQL was measured using SF- 12 (0 to 100, 100 = best quality of life). No difference was found after three months of treatment (low quality evidence) but at six months there was a small difference favouring the saline group, which may not be of clinical significance and has high uncertainty (MD 10. 5 points, 95 % CI 0. 66 to 20. 34) (very low quality evidence). Low-volume, nebulised saline versus intranasal corticosteroids One trial included 40 adult participants with polyps. Our primary outcome of disease-specific HRQL was not reported. At the end of treatment (three months) the patients who had intranasal corticosteroids had less severe symptoms (MD - 13. 50, 95 % CI - 14. 44 to - 12. 56); this corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be of very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The two studies were very different in terms of included populations, interventions and comparisons and so it is therefore difficult to draw conclusions for practice. The evidence suggests that there is no benefit of a low-volume (5 ml) nebulised saline spray over intranasal steroids. There is some benefit of daily, large-volume (150 ml) saline irrigation with a hypertonic solution when compared with placebo, but the quality of the evidence is low for three months and very low for six months of treatment...|$|R
