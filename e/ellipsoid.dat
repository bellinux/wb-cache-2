5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. The spores are {{typically}} 7.5–9 by 7.5–9µm, spherical to broadly <b>ellipsoid</b> to <b>ellipsoid,</b> and thin-walled.

The basidia are 30.5–57 by 8–16µm, four-spored, and not clamped at the base. The margin {{cells of the}} gills are plentiful, spherical, club-shaped or swollen spherically at the tip, hyaline, and measure 13–58 by 8–33µm. The cap cuticle consists of a 130–220µm wide, strongly gelatinised suprapellis (upper layer) and a dense, non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap are made of abundant spherical, elliptic and club-shaped cells that are 21–119 by 14.5–115µm, intermixed with hyphae 4–9µm wide and pale umber in colour, and either arranged irregularly, or with a vertical orientation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} an exact method for detecting collision between two moving <b>ellipsoids</b> under pre-specified rational motions. Our method {{is based on}} an algebraic condition that determines the separation status of two static <b>ellipsoids</b> – the condition itself is described by the signs of roots of the characteristic equation of the two <b>ellipsoids.</b> To deal with moving <b>ellipsoids,</b> we derive a bivariate function whose zero-set possesses a special topological structure. By analyzing the zero-set of this function, we are able to tell whether or not two moving <b>ellipsoids</b> under prespecified rational motions are collision-free; and if not, we can determine the intervals in which they overlap.

In our work, we simulate the dynamics of oblate <b>ellipsoids</b> under gravity. We study the settling velocity and the average orientation of the <b>ellipsoids</b> {{as a function of}} volume fraction. We see that the settling velocity shows a local maximum at the intermmediate densities unlike the spheres. The average orientation of the <b>ellipsoids</b> also shows a similar local maximum and we observe that this local maximum disappears as the Reynolds number is increased. Also, at small volume fractions, we observe that the oblate <b>ellipsoids</b> exhibit an orientational clustering effect in alignment with gravity accompanied by strong density fluctuations.
