5|$|Maximus {{continues}} to be the guard's greatest steed in arresting criminals in all of Corona. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have feelings for a female horse named Fidel.|$|E
5|$|A {{character}} named Michael {{was introduced}} in Sister Location, whose identity and motives are currently unknown. The character {{was introduced in}} a cutscene, in which <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be speaking to his father.|$|E
5|$|Gebeachan (died 937), {{also known}} as Gébennach, and Gebechán, was a tenth-century King of the Isles. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been a {{subordinate}} to Amlaíb mac Gofraid, King of Dublin, and is recorded to have fought and died at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} the suggestion with perfect seriousness.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> troubled. The more {{he inquired}} into our electioneering habits, the less <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} them.|$|R
60|$|With {{that the}} {{curtains}} closed, and <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> snore immediately.|$|R
5|$|Whatever {{the cause}} of Themistocles's unpopularity in 479BC, it {{obviously}} did not last long. Both Diodorus and Plutarch suggest he was quickly restored to the favour of the Athenians. Indeed, after 479 BC, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have enjoyed a relatively long period of popularity.|$|E
5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor {{voice is a}} permitted alternative in the score.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{is found}} {{some time later}} by the police, {{clutching}} Miles's dead body, but she refuses to speak of what happened until meeting Dr Fisher. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> accept Ann's story, unconvinced by his own psychosexual explanations of her visions. Fisher is dismayed to see Ann led away by the police, accused of Miles's murder, and he sees Quint's face {{on one of the}} officers. The film closes with a new governess arriving at Bly.|$|E
60|$|Then Tavernake {{rose to his}} feet. In {{the shabby}} little room <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have grown {{suddenly}} taller. He struck the crazy table with his clenched fist so that the crockery upon it rattled. Pritchard was used to seeing men--strong men, too--moved by various passions, but in Tavernake's face <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> see new things.|$|R
60|$|That was the {{one thing}} {{calculated}} to rouse Red Gilbat. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> flare, to bristle, and he paced for the bleachers.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be {{carrying}} out the joke pretty thoroughly, I thought.|$|R
5|$|Gurnemanz {{knows that}} the Grail draws only the pious to Monsalvat and invites the boy to observe the Grail rite. The youth {{does not know what}} the Grail is, but remarks that as they walk <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{scarcely}} move, yet feels as if he is traveling far. Gurnemanz says that in this realm time becomes space ("").|$|E
5|$|Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or {{possibly}} both, {{he had been}} struck by paralysis, and after this <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in the disputes between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did agree with his fellow bishops who opposed the king's attempt to reduce clerical benefits. He may have been buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.|$|E
5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other New Testament writings <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have considered valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected {{the authority of the}} Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead, and organ music.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> force {{himself to}} finish. His voice was very low.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> muse, profoundly silent, {{very still}} in his mournful pose.|$|R
60|$|He trembled violently. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be labouring {{under some}} great excitement.|$|R
5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
5|$|When Histiaeus {{heard of}} the fall of Miletus, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have {{appointed}} himself as leader of the resistance against Persia. Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to Chios. The Chians refused to receive him, so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus's leadership.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its desire to avoid expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E
60|$|Hunterleys made no {{immediate}} reply. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be considering the name.|$|R
60|$|I {{remarked that}} <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have carried them out once before.|$|R
60|$|Then came a pause while <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be {{struggling}} with himself.|$|R
5|$|Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal {{household}} was not monastic in character. As {{he settled}} {{into the role of}} archbishop, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter's household in around 1172.|$|E
5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
60|$|He patted Aaron affectionately; <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be {{the older}} of the two.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be {{measuring}} the distance across {{the park with}} his eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> come to himself, {{though he}} {{was too weak to}} start.|$|R
5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|During the 1640s and 1650s, Velázquez {{served as}} both court painter and curator of PhilipIV's {{expanding}} collection of European art. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{have been given}} an unusual degree of freedom in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design of the rooms holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the sourcing, attribution, hanging and inventory {{of many of the}} Spanish king's paintings. By the early 1650s, Velázquez was widely respected in Spain as a connoisseur. Much of the collection of the Prado today—including works by Titian, Raphael, and Rubens—were acquired and assembled under Velázquez's curatorship.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{returns to}} Earth {{in time for}} the launch of the second NX class starship, Columbia, and Commander Tucker prepares for his transfer. Meanwhile, Ensign Sato and Doctor Phlox are {{attacked}} in San Francisco, and Phlox is kidnapped. Captain Archer and Lieutenant Reed investigate the scene, and Reed is given a secret assignment by a secretive agent that <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> know. Commander T'Pol, seeking information from Sato, conducts her first mind-meld, and the two realize that the attackers spoke Rigelian. They discover that a Rigelian freighter recently left orbit and head off in pursuit.|$|E
60|$|The Chief read it. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> grasp its {{contents}} in a flash.|$|R
60|$|Arthur gave Susie a long look. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} her words deliberately.|$|R
