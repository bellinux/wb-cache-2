50|$|Kanizsa Figures (a.k.a. Pac-Man Configurations):Perhaps {{the most}} famous example of an <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> is the Pac-Man {{configuration}} popularized by Gaetano Kanizsa. Kanizsa figurers trigger the percept of an <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> by aligning Pac-Man-shaped inducers in the visual field such that the edges form a shape. Though not explicitly part of the image, Kanizsa figures evoke the percept of a shape, defined by a sharp <b>illusory</b> <b>contour.</b> Typically, the shape seems brighter than the background though luminance is in reality homogeneous. Additionally, the illusory shape seem {{to be closer to}} the viewer than the inducers. Kanizsa figures involve modal completion of the illusory shape and amodal completion of the inducers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Illusory</b> <b>contours</b> or {{subjective}} contours are visual illusions that {{evoke the}} perception of an edge without a luminance or color change across that edge.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in form perception {{is how the}} visual system can link together spatially separated contour fragments to form the percept of a unitary shape. <b>Illusory</b> <b>contours</b> and amodal completion are two phenomena that demonstrate this linking process. In the present study we investigate these phenomena in the divided hemispheres of two callosotomy (“split-brain”) patients. The data suggest that dissociable neural mechanisms {{are responsible for the}} genera-tion of <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> and amodal completion. Although both cerebral hemispheres appear to be equally capable of perceiving <b>illusory</b> <b>contours,</b> amodal completion is more read-ily utilized by the right hemisphere. These results suggest that <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> may be attributable to low-level visual proc-esses common to both hemispheres, whereas amodal comple-tion reºects a higher-level, lateralized process...|$|R
40|$|Previous research, {{in which}} static figures were used, {{showed that the}} ability to {{perceive}} <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> emerges around 7 months of age. However, recently, evidence has suggested that 2 – 3 -month-old infants are able to perceive <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> when motion information is available (Johnson & Mason, 2002; Otsuka & Yamaguchi, 2003). The present study was aimed at investigating whether even newborns might perceive kinetic <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> when a motion easily detected by the immature newborn’s visual system (i. e. stroboscopic motion) is used. In Experiment 1, using a preference looking technique, newborns’ perception of kinetic <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> was explored using a Kanizsa figure in a static and in a kinetic display. The results showed that newborns manifest a preference for the <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> only in the kinetic, but not in the static, condition. In Experiment 2, using an habituation technique, newborns were habituated to a moving shape that was matched with the background in terms of random-texture-surface; thus the recovery of the shape was possible relying only on kinetic information. The results showed that infants manifested a novelty preference when presented with luminance-defined familiar and novel shapes. Altogether these findings provide evidence that motion enhances (Experiment 1) and sometimes is sufficient (Experiment 2) to induce newborns’ perception of <b>illusory</b> <b>contours...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Illusory</b> <b>contours</b> are {{specific}} class of visual stimuli that represent stimuli configurations perceived as integral {{irrespective of the}} fact that they are given in fragmented uncompleted wholes. Due to their specific features, <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> gained much attention in last decade representing prototype of stimuli used in investigations focused on binding problem. On the other side, investigations of <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> are related to problem of the level of their visual processing. Neurophysiologic studies show that processing of <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> proceed relatively early, on the V 2 level, on the other hand most of experimental studies claim that <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> are perceived with engagement of visual attention, binding their elements to whole percept. This research is focused on two experiments in which visual search of <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> are based on shape and orientation. The main experimental procedure evolved the task proposed by Bravo and Nakayama where instead of detection, subjects were performing identification of one among two possible targets. In the first experiment subjects detected the presence of illusory square or illusory triangle, while in the second experiment subject were detecting two different orientations of illusory triangle. The results are interpreted in terms of visual search and feature integration theory.

40|$|Stimulus {{reduction}} {{is an effective}} way to study visual performance. Cues such as surface characteristics, colour and inner lines can be removed from stimuli, revealing how the change affects recognition and neural processing. An extreme {{reduction is}} the removal of the very stimulus, defining it with illusory lines. Perceived boundaries without physical differences between shape and background are called <b>illusory</b> (or subjective) <b>contours.</b> <b>Illusory</b> and real <b>contours</b> activate early stages of the macaque visual pathway in similar ways. However, data relating to the processing of <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> in higher visual areas are scarce. We recently reported how <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> based on abutting-line gratings affect neurones in the monkey inferotemporal cortex, an area essential for object and shape vision. We now present data on how inferotemporal cortical neurones of monkeys react to another type of shapes, the Kanizsa figures. A set of line drawings, silhouettes, their illusory contour-based counterparts, and control shapes have been presented to awake, fixating rhesus monkeys while single-cell activity was recorded in the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex. Most of the recorded neurones were responsive and selective to shapes presented as <b>illusory</b> <b>contours.</b> Shape selectivity was proved to be different for line drawings and <b>illusory</b> <b>contours,</b> and also for silhouettes and <b>illusory</b> <b>contours.</b> Neuronal response latencies for Kanizsa figures were significantly longer than those for line drawings and silhouettes.

50|$|In {{ambiguous}} images, {{an illusion}} is often produced from illusory contours. An <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> is a perceived contour without {{the presence of}} a physical gradient. In examples where a white shape appears to occlude black objects on a white background, the white shape appears to be brighter than the background, and the edges of this shape produce the illusory contours. These illusory contours are processed by the brain in a similar way as real contours. The visual system accomplishes this by making inferences beyond the information that is presented {{in much the same way}} as the luminance gradient.|$|E
50|$|Presentation of {{collinear}} stimuli flanking {{a target}} can enhance {{responses to the}} target in cortex, an effect known as flanker or collinear facilitation, which {{has been shown to}} be weaker in schizophrenia subjects than in healthy adults or those with bipolar disorder. Publications from multiple research groups indicate that schizophrenia patients perform more poorly than healthy adults when asked to identify contours composed of separated line segments embedded in backgrounds made up of randomly oriented segments. This includes evidence from an fMRI experiment indicating abnormally reduced activation in visual areas V2-4. Another group used EEG to examine <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> processing deficits in schizophrenia. They found decreased amplitude and altered source location for the P1 component in patients, which they claim reflects abnormal dorsal stream processing in this disorder.|$|E
50|$|Skottun and Skoyles also {{question}} whether the perception of phantom contours is specifically related to luminance. Our inability to process color at high temporal frequencies may be more related to how the parvocellular system functions, rather than being a defining difference between the parvo- and magnocellular systems. Further, they surmise that detection of surface characteristics at low temporal frequencies {{may be due to}} processing further on in the visual system, {{based on the fact that}} cortical neurons have longer integration times, compared to the subcortical neurons found in the magno- and parvocellular systems. Quaid and Flanagan recommend looking to the dorsal stream for <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> processing, claiming that motion-defined-forms may be detected, even with a magnocellular deficit. They also point out that the dorsal stream mediates low contrast, high temporal frequency stimuli, as well as motion, making it a viable candidate for processing this illusion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ninety-six 4 -month-old infants were habituated to one {{of three}} computer-generated {{displays}} depicting two rod parts above and below an occluding box. In the first display, the surfaces and boundaries of the rod and box were specified by dense surface texture. Their depth segregation was specified by accretion and deletion of background texture and motion shear. In the second display, the unity of the rod parts and box, and their depth segregation, were specified only by <b>illusory</b> <b>contours.</b> In the third display, the boundaries of the rod and box were specified by <b>illusory</b> <b>contours,</b> perceptible only via spatiotemporal integration of accretion and deletion of sparse-background-texture elements. Infants appeared to perceive object unity, and segregate the rod and box surfaces, in all three displays, indicating use of <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> to perceive bounded surfaces in depth. The results suggest a cognitive contribution to perception of some <b>illusory</b> <b>contours,</b> abilities which seem to be present by at least 4 months of age. ...|$|R

40|$|Real and <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> cues {{are used}} under {{different}} contexts and {{can interfere with}} one another. We have shown that <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> percepts are degraded {{by the presence of}} real lines (DillenburgerRoe 2004). Optical imaging and single unit data in the primate suggest suppressive feedback interactions from <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> cells in V 2 to similarly oriented cells in V 1 (Ramsden etal 2001). We hypothesize that interference of <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> percepts occurs via competition between feedforward (real) vs feedback (illusory) influences. We further test this hypothesis by examining the timing of this interference using psychophysical methods. We expect an early (feedforward) enhancement and a late (feedback) interference of illusory percept by real lines. We measured the perceptual strength of Kanizsa-type illusory contours in a 2 AFC shape discrimination task using real contours as backward masking stimuli. Illusory contours were presented for 50 msec followed by a real line superimposed and parallel to the <b>illusory</b> <b>contour.</b> Masks were presented for 100 msec with varying SOAs at different super- and sub-threshold contrasts. We used a blank and orthogonally oriented real lines as comparison masks. We found that the influence of real lines on <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> perception changes over 0 - 150 msec post-stimulus onset. Early in <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> perception, real lines parallel to the <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> enhance the perceptibility of the <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> (SOA 50 - 100 msec). At later times (SOA 125 - 150 msec), parallel real lines interfere with <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> percept. Our results support an early feedforward-driven enhancement of illusory contours by real lines, perhaps mediated by enhancing <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> cell response in V 2. Stimulation by real lines (feedforward) at a later time point of <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> processing competes with the feedback-driven suppression normally needed for illusory percept consolidation...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that neurons in area V 2 (the second visual area) can signal the {{orientation}} of illusory contours in the primate. Whether area V 1 (primary visual cortex) can signal <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> orientation is more controversial. While some electrophysiology studies have ruled out illusory signaling in V 1, other reports suggest that V 1 shows some illusory-specific response. Here, using optical imaging and single unit electrophysiology, we report that primate V 1 does show an orientation-specific response to the ‘abutting line grating ’ <b>illusory</b> <b>contour.</b> However, this response does not signal an <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> in the conventional sense. Rather, we find that <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> stimulation leads to an activation map that, after appropriate subtraction of real line signal, is inversely related to the real orientation map. The <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> orientation is thus negatively signaled or de-emphasized in V 1. This ‘activation reversal’ is robust, is not due merely to presence of line ends, is not dependent on inducer orientation, and is not due to precise position of line end stimulation of V 1 cells. These data suggest a resolution for previous apparently contradictory experimental findings. We propose that the de-emphasis of <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> orientation in V 1 {{may be an important}} signal of contour identity and may, together with illusory signal from V 2, provide a unique signature for <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> representation...|$|E
40|$|Human {{electrophysiological}} studies {{support a}} model whereby sensitivity to so-called <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> stimuli is first seen within the lateral occipital complex. A challenge to this model posits that the lateral occipital complex {{is a general}} site for crude region-based segmentation, based on findings of equivalent hemodynamic activations in the lateral occipital complex to <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> and so-called salient region stimuli, a stimulus class that lacks the classic bounding contours of illusory contours. Using high-density electrical mapping of visual evoked potentials, we show that early lateral occipital cortex activity is substantially stronger to <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> than to salient region stimuli, whereas later lateral occipital complex activity is stronger to salient region than to <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> stimuli. Our results suggest that equivalent hemodynamic activity to <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> and salient region stimuli probably reflects temporally integrated responses, {{a result of the}} poor temporal resolution of hemodynamic imaging. The temporal precision of visual evoked potentials is critical for establishing viable models of completion processes and visual scene analysis. We propose that crude spatial segmentation analyses, which are insensitive to illusory contours, occur first within dorsal visual regions, not the lateral occipital complex, and that initial <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> sensitivity {{is a function of the}} lateral occipital complex...|$|E

The most striking result, however, is that threshold elevations are considerably lower or even absent when the target is located on the <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> itself.

We generated preferential-looking stimuli containing sinusoidal lines whose oscillating, abutting terminators give a strong <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> in adult perception. Our experiments demonstrated a preference in infants 8 weeks old and above for an oscillating <b>illusory</b> <b>contour</b> compared with a stimulus containing equal terminator density and movement. Control experiments excluded local line density, or attention to alignment in general, as the basis for this result. In the youngest age group (8 - 10 weeks) stimulus velocity appears to be critical in determining the visibility of illusory contours, which is consistent with other data on motion processing at this age.

In a series of experiments, we show that the velocity of contour terminations and the direction of motion of a partially occluded figure regulate the perceived shape and apparent movement of illusory contours formed from moving image sequences.

40|$|We {{have created}} {{patterns}} in which illusory Kanizsa squares are positioned {{on top of}} a background grid of bars. When the <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> and physical contours are misaligned, the resulting percept appears to be rather confusing (van Lier et al, 2004 Perception 33 Supplement, 77). Observers often perceive a shift of the part of the grid that falls inside the illusory square, leaving the impression that the physical grid is indented at the positions of the <b>illusory</b> <b>contours.</b> All in all, these displays have a remarkably unstable and restless appearance. We have performed two experiments to study the strength and the direction of the illusory shifts. In the first experiment, an illusory square, induced by a pacmen configuration, was positioned at various positions on a grid of straight bars. After briefly flashing these stimuli, observers frequently reported illusory shifts (or indentations) of the background bars for those cases in which physical and <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> were slightly misaligned. In a control condition, the pacmen were replaced by crosses (that did not induce an illusory square). As expected, this time, no illusory shifts were reported. In the second experiment, observers had to judge the direction of the illusory shift. The results show that the perceived shifts, in fact, reflect a tendency to cancel the misalignment between physical and <b>illusory</b> <b>contours</b> in the display.
