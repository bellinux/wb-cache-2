50|$|In August 2011 Westwood's company Vivienne Westwood Ltd {{agreed to}} pay almost £350,000 in tax to HM Revenue & Customs for {{significantly}} underestimating the value of her brand. Her UK business had sold the rights to <b>her</b> <b>trademarks</b> to Luxembourg-based Latimo, which she controls, for £840,000 in 2002. After examining the deal HMRC argued that Westwood's brand had been undervalued, and, after negotiation, the two sides agreed that <b>her</b> <b>trademarks</b> were worth more than double that amount. The £2m valuation triggered an additional tax bill of £348,463 plus interest of £144,112, which fell due in 2009.|$|R

The following year she made her first Hollywood film, Down Argentine Way with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Latin accent became <b>her</b> <b>trademark.</b> That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943 Miranda starred in Busby Berkley's The Gang's All Here, which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became <b>her</b> <b>trademark.</b> By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Lake changed <b>her</b> <b>trademark</b> peek-a-boo hairstyle at {{the urging}} of the {{government}} to encourage women working in war industry factories to adopt more practical, safer hairstyles. Although the change helped to decrease accidents involving women getting their hair caught in machinery, doing so may have damaged Lake's career. She also became a popular pin-up girl for soldiers during World War II and traveled throughout the United States to raise money for war bonds.|$|E
25|$|In 1877 Lillie's brother Clement Le Breton {{had married}} Alice, an illegitimate {{daughter}} of Thomas Heron Jones, 7th Viscount Ranelagh, {{a friend of}} their father, and Ranelagh invited Lillie Langtry to a high-society reception {{at the home of}} Lord and Lady Sebright in Belgravia, at which she attracted notice for her beauty and wit. Langtry was in mourning for her youngest brother, who had been killed in a riding accident, so in contrast to most women's more elaborate clothing, she wore a simple black dress (which was to become <b>her</b> <b>trademark)</b> and no jewellery.|$|E
25|$|She and Heine are opposites {{in terms}} of ideals, and almost always clash heads. Despite their disagreements, their {{contrasting}} fighting styles compliment each other numerous times. They are almost always teamed up later on as the manga progresses, and have developed a very shaky (but mutual) understanding of each other. She is the only other woman aside from Nill that Heine has willingly been in physical contact with without suffering from a mental breakdown. Of the four protagonists, she and Mihai are the most level-headed ones, but she often falls victim to her own emotions. She is exceptionally skilled in combat, but because of her conscience and lack of killing intent, she is sometimes put at a disadvantage. <b>Her</b> <b>trademark</b> black katana, if wielded correctly, {{has the ability to}} kill anyone with a Kerberos Spine implant.|$|E
5000|$|Conn {{provided}} the voice for Raggedy Ann in the animated feature Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure (1977) directed by Richard Williams.

5000|$|Musson was {{considered}} to be a [...] "flamboyant and eccentric" [...] woman. She was overweight (over 300 lb at her peak), and always wore a flower-patterned muumuu. <b>Her</b> <b>trademarks</b> were <b>her</b> muumuu and verbal assaults. Journalist Alice Yarish remarked [...] "She was rough and tumble and cussed a lot, but it was always funny. She was mean to everybody, and you liked it." ...|$|R
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished {{all she had to}} do was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through in the setting of her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread that she was going to do extended scenes without <b>her</b> <b>trademark</b> curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E
25|$|Upon Starr's {{retirement}} in 2000, he was succeeded by Daily News writer Jay Maeder and artist Andrew Pepoy, beginning Monday, June 5, 2000. Pepoy was eventually succeeded by Alan Kupperberg (2001–2004) and Ted Slampyak (2004–2010). The new creators updated the strip's settings and characters {{for a modern}} audience, giving Annie a new hairdo and jeans rather than <b>her</b> <b>trademark</b> dress. However, Maeder's new stories never managed {{to live up to}} the pathos and emotional engagement of the stories by Gray and Starr. Annie herself was often reduced to a supporting role and was a far less complex character than the girl readers had known for seven decades. Maeder's writing style tended to make the stories feel like tongue-in-cheek adventures compared to the serious, heartfelt tales Gray and Starr favored. Annie gradually lost subscribers during the 2000s, and by 2010, it was running in fewer than 20 U.S. newspapers.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Googoosh began a {{meteoric}} rise to {{fame and}} success {{as she drove}} the edge of Iranian pop music further and further. Known for her flamboyant outfits and fashion sense, Googoosh wowed her pop culture hungry fans in Iran and abroad with <b>her</b> <b>trademark</b> hairdos and hip-elegant style. Iranian women changed hairdos with Googoosh and she was always {{one step ahead of}} them with a new look. Her music ranged from upbeat 1960s and 1970s pop, given an Arabic-tinged edge, to declamatory, emotional ballads dealing with love and loss, which at times edged towards chanson and Édith Piaf territory. She starred in over 25 movies, one of which was to be the most commercially successful Iranian motion picture of all time. Googoosh performed many times for the royal family and was a favorite of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's wife and children. She performed at the party given for the 1977 birthday of Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{at the age}} of 15, she started playing the guitar, using a flamenco guitar that her sister had left behind. She removed the {{remaining}} strings and added four bass strings, (tuned to an open A). This gave it a fuller tone than a conventional acoustic guitar while not sounding as deep as a bass. This tuning became one of <b>her</b> <b>trademarks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Heiss {{was known}} as a very {{athletic}} skater for her time. In 1953, she became the first female skater to land a double axel jump. Another one of <b>her</b> <b>trademarks</b> was doing a series of alternating clockwise and counterclockwise single axels. [...] Heiss normally rotated her jumps clockwise and spins counterclockwise; it is much more common for skaters to do both in the same direction (usually counterclockwise).|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Love won {{the use of}} her domain name, lexilove.com, for her website from Texas Property Associates, a cybersquatter. The {{company had}} {{registered}} the domain in 2005, a year after Love started in the adult industry with her name. Even though Love did not register <b>her</b> <b>trademarked</b> name until 2008, the World Intellectual Property Organization ruled that Love had established a common law <b>trademark</b> to <b>her</b> name.|$|R
25|$|In 1984, the teenaged Canaan—under {{the stage}} name Angel—joined the heavy metal band Equation, who until then had been intent on finding a male lead singer. Canaan's talent, personality, and stage {{presence}} gained her national popularity among Lebanese youth. The same year, she donned {{what would become}} <b>her</b> <b>trademark,</b> trend-setting look: revealing, studded leather outfits with dramatic capes and hip-length blonde-streaked hair. Off stage, Canaan's Alma Mater, Brummana High School (BHS), voted her “Best Dressed”. On stage, her provocative costumes contributed to the perception {{of her as a}} sex symbol. The Daily Star wrote: “On stage, with her daring looks and style, Canaan became a role model”. At the height of their success the band drew a crowd of over 15,000. Canaan's first original composition, “Why All The Hurt”, a tribute to a deceased friend that she wrote as a teenager, was a No. 1 hit on the radio charts in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 {{she was one}} of {{the editors}} who was {{involved}} in setting up RIAS-TV where she presented the evening news program Abendschau and later the breakfast TV show Frühstückfernsehen. Several times during her career she took the risk to leave established shows for new productions where she had more influence, like her move from the well established heute journal to the heute nacht news show. Her daily lifestyle magazine Leute heute became very successful after it was at first less popular than expected and in 1995 the 2000th episode was shown. Ruge finished nearly every edition of her show Leute heute with the quote Alles wird gut (Everything will turn out fine) which became <b>her</b> <b>trademark</b> and which she also used for some of her book titles. In November 2006 Ruge announced to end her work for Leute heute on 3 February 2007 in order to have more time for her private life.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, {{she became}} artistic {{director}} for Condé Nast, Vogues publisher.

50|$|Jessie Tarbox Beals (December 23, 1870 - May 30, 1942) was an American photographer, {{the first}} {{published}} female photojournalist in the United States {{and the first}} female night photographer.
