40|$|A {{one piece}} {{reusable}} fastener capable of joining materials together {{from one side}} (blind backside) comprises a screw driven pin ending in a wedge-shaped expander cone. The cone cooperates within a slotted collar end which {{has a number of}} tangs on a cylindrical body. The fastener is set by inserting it through aligned holes in the workpieces to be joined. Turning the pin in one direction draws the cone into the collar, deforming the tangs radially outward to mate with tapered back-tapered hold in the workpiece, thus fastening the two pieces together. Reversing the direction of the pin withdraws the cone from the collar, and allows the tangs to resume their contracted configuration without withdrawing the fastener from the <b>insertion</b> <b>hole.</b> The fastener is capable of joining materials together from only one side with substantial strength in tension and shear over many resue attachment cycles, with no special operations on the main assembly parts other than the tapering of the back end of the <b>insertion</b> <b>hole...</b>|$|E

Design. Alternative designs of the construct are considered, and the use of a slotted upper lag screw <b>insertion</b> <b>hole</b> is analysed. Background. Intramedullary fixation devices with a single lag screw have been known to fail at the lag screw <b>insertion</b> <b>hole.</b> Using two lag screws is considered. It has also been proposed to use a slot in the nail for the upper lag screw to prevent the upper lag screw from sticking. Methods. Bending and torsion load cases are analysed using finite element method. Consideration of both load conditions is essential. Results. The results present the overall stiffness of the assembly, the load sharing between lag screws, and the possibility for cut-out to occur. Conclusions. While the slot for the upper lag screw might be advantageous with regard to the stresses in the lag screws, it could be detrimental for cut-out occurring adjacent to the lag screws...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine factors affecting accurate drill sleeve insertion. HypothesisTilting and shallow locking screw holes and combination-type holes make it difficult to insert the drill sleeve in the LCP. Materials and methodsTwenty-seven 3. 5 mm LCP metaphyseal <b>insertion</b> <b>holes</b> were selected (Philos®, LPHP®, DMTP®, low-band DMTP® [Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland]). Two orthopedic surgeons checked the time taken for accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the plate. Variables relating to LCP drill sleeve insertion time were analyzed.

40|$|An {{intramedullary}} nail is {{a trauma}} treatment device used for fracture fixation of long bones. These devices {{are subject to}} failure, including lag screw cut-out and failure at the lag screw <b>insertion</b> <b>hole</b> from high stress concentrations in that region. Clinical developments for such devices are frequently based on a trial and error method, which often results in failure before improvement. However, the finite element method {{can be used for}} the development of trauma treatment devices, and their interaction with bone, by providing a large data set at a relatively low cost. Also, parameters can be changed to assess the relative benefits of one device to another. A novel finite element model has been developed {{that can be used for}} the analysis of intramedullary nails inserted into long bones. A commercially available finite element package, ANSYS, has been used to implement the modelling strategy. The finite element modelling technique has been applied to fractures of the proximal femur, but the model is generic, and can be developed to deal with any form of intramedullary device where contact between the bone and implant is important. The finite element strategy can be used in pre-clinical trials to test a new device, or for the design optimisation of existing devices. The finite element model consists of the device surrounded by a thin layer of bone, which forms a 'base' model component that is re-usable. This 'base' component can be mathematically connected to any long bone model, forming an integrated implant and bone construct. The construct can be used to assess which device is best suited to a particular fracture, for example. Contact elements have been used to allow stresses to develop as contact is achieved within the implant and bone construct. Pre-assignment of contact points is not required. Verification of the finite element model is achieved by comparison to available data from experiments carried out on constructs of bone and device that use intramedullary femoral nails. In this thesis the finite element model has been applied to two areas of proximal femoral nailing. The finite element model is used to analyse the distal end of a Gamma nail, and shows that analyses that do not consider contact may not lead to accurate predictions of stresses. The model has been developed for using configurations with one and two distal locking screws. The most distal locking screw is more critical under axial loading, and the more proximal screw is more important for bending loads. The use of 'softer' screws distributes the load more evenly between them. The finite element model has been used to investigate the mechanical environment of a fracture callus for a femoral neck fracture, and a subtrochanteric fracture. The use of one and two lag screws, fracture gap size and material properties of the nail have been investigated for a stiffening callus. Results show that the use of two lag screws for a neck fracture provides a more rigid support at the early stages of fracture healing, and minimises stress-shielding once the callus has healed. For subtrochanteric fractures there is a critical point at which the fracture callus is able to carry any load. A Titanium nail significantly reduces the peak stress at the lag screw <b>insertion</b> <b>hole,</b> and titanium lag screws share the load more evenly between them. Each two-lag-screw configuration used transfers a similar load into the fracture callus. A configuration using a larger lag screw above a smaller has a significantly higher stress at the upper lag screw <b>insertion</b> <b>hole.</b> Critically, the load shared between two lag screws changes as the fracture callus stiffens and an assessment should be made at different stages of fracture healing to optimise the use of a device.

40|$|A {{thermal probe}} method, called REKA (Rapid Evaluation of K and Alpha) {{has been used}} for {{determining}} thermal conductivity (K) and diffusivity (Alpha) at both the Large Heated Block Tests and in the ESF. The REKA method involves a single borehole probe with a heater and temperature measurement section. An elliptical temperature field is generated by the heater, and the temperature distribution {{along the length of the}} probe is recorded at several locations and at given time intervals for a period of 6 to 24 hours. A trial-and-error evaluation procedure is used to determine the unknown thermophysical properties by minimizing the RMS error between the measured and calculated temperature fields. If a conduction-only thermal model is used in the evaluation, the thermophysical properties will include the rockmass and the moisture effects, and the values will represent effective properties. If a hydrothermal model is also used, the difference between the effective and the rock matrix thermophysical properties can be related to hydrothermal characteristics. A reusable REKA probe can be applied to measure in situ rock properties in a short, open hole, e. g., in a rockbolt borehole, at low cost. A permanent REKA probe has to be grouted in the <b>insertion</b> <b>hole,</b> if an open hole is not acceptable due to the disturbance it may cause to other site characterization activities...|$|E

Methods: Forty self-tapping screws and 20 self-drilling screws were inserted into 10 models of artificial bone and 10 cervical vertebrae of sheep.

The following groups were created: Group I-self-tapping screw <b>insertion</b> after pilot <b>hole</b> drilling and tapping; Group II-self-tapping screw <b>insertion</b> after pilot <b>hole</b> drilling without tapping; Group III-self-drilling screw insertion without drilling and tapping.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis {{is related to the}} development of structural optimisation algorithms based on the boundary element and level set methods for two and three-dimensional linear elastic problems. In the initial implementation, a stress based evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) approach has been used to add and remove material simultaneously for the solution of two-dimensional optimisation problems. The level set method (LSM) is used to provide an implicit description of the structural geometry, which is also capable of automatically handling topological changes, i. e. holes merging with each other or with the boundary. The classical level set based optimisation methods are dependent on initial designs with pre-existing holes. However, the proposed method automatically introduces internal cavities utilising a stress based <b>hole</b> <b>insertion</b> criteria, and thereby eliminates the use of initial designs with pre-existing holes. A detailed study has also been carried out to investigate the relationship between a stress and topological derivative based <b>hole</b> <b>insertion</b> criteria within a boundary element method (BEM) and LSM framework. The evolving structural geometry (i. e. the zero level set contours) is represented by non-uniform rational b-splines (NURBS), providing a smooth geometry throughout the optimisation process and completely eliminating jagged edges. The BEM and LSM are further combined with a shape sensitivity approach for the solution of minimum compliance problems in two-dimensions. The proposed sensitivity based method is capable of automatically inserting holes during the optimisation process using a topological derivative approach. In order to investigate the associated advantages and disadvantages of the evolutionary and sensitivity based optimisation methods a comparative study has also been carried out. There are two advantages {{associated with the use of}} LSM in three-dimensional topology optimisation. Firstly, the LSM may readily be applied to three-dimensional space, and it is shown how this can be linked to a 3 D BEM solver. Secondly, the holes appear automatically through the intersection of two surfaces moving towards each other. Therefore, the use of LSM eliminates the need for an additional <b>hole</b> <b>insertion</b> mechanism as both shape and topology optimisation can be performed at the same time. A complete algorithm is proposed and tested for BEM and LSM based topology optimisation in three-dimensions. Optimal geometries compare well against those in the literature for a range of benchmark examples. ...|$|R
40|$|Level set {{method is}} a {{boundary}} tracking method that uses an implicit function {{to define the}} boundary location. By using the implicit function to define the structural boundary the level set method {{can be used for}} topology optimisation. The level set method has previously been used to solve a range of structural optimisation problems. The aim of this thesis is to extend the application of the level set method to additional applications of structural optimisation. A robust method of 3 D level set topology optimisation is developed and tested. The use of a <b>hole</b> <b>insertion</b> method was found to be advantageous, but not vital, for 3 D level set topology optimisation. The level set method is used to optimise the internal structure of a proximal femur. Similarities between the optimal structure and real internal trabecular bone architecture suggest that the internal bone structure may be mechanically optimal. Stress constrained level set topology optimisation is performed in 2 D. Stress shape sensitivities are derived and interpolated to obtain smooth boundary sensitivity, resulting in feasible stress constrained solution in numerical examples. A new generic objective <b>hole</b> <b>insertion</b> method is used to reduce dependence on the initial solution.

For the sake of completeness, the topological asymptotic analysis of the total potential energy with respect to the nucleation of a small circular inclusion is developed in all details. Since we are dealing with multiple load-cases, a multi-objective optimization problem is proposed and the topological sensitivity is obtained as a sum of the topological derivatives associated with each load-case. The volume constraint is imposed through the Augmented Lagrangian Method. The obtained result is used to devise a topology optimization algorithm based on the topological derivative together with a level-set domain representation method. Finally, several finite element-based examples of structural optimization are presented...|$|R

With a 1. 5  mm drill, a ZCD of 580. 2  ±  124  μm was produced which increased to 637. 0  ±  44  μm following insertion of a 2  mm cortical screw although this was not significant (P >  0. 05). The ZCD from insertion of the variable pitch headless screws (diam. 3. 5  mm) was lower for the metallic compared to the bioabsorbable design (800. 9  ±  159 vs 1, 236. 4  ±  212  μm, respectively; P <  0. 01). The ZCD from drilling was reduced ∼ 50 % (P <  0. 001) by saline irrigation. ConclusionsCartilage injury during intra-articular screw fixation caused a ZCD around the hole irrespective of screw design. Saline irrigation significantly reduced the ZCD from drilling into cartilage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe topological {{derivative}} {{provides the}} sensitivity of a given cost function {{with respect to the}} <b>insertion</b> of a <b>hole</b> at an arbitrary point of the domain. Classically, this derivative comes from the second term of the topological asymptotic expansion, dealing only with infinitesimal holes. However, for practical applications, we need to insert holes of finite size. Therefore, we consider one more term in the expansion which is defined as the second order topological derivative. In order to present these ideas, in this work we apply the topological-shape sensitivity method as a systematic approach to calculate first as well as second order topological derivative for the Poisson’s equations, taking the total potential energy as cost function and the state equation as constraint. Furthermore, we also study the effects of different boundary conditions on the hole: Neumann and Dirichlet (both homogeneous). Finally, we present some numerical experiments showing the influence of the second order topological derivative in the topological asymptotic expansion, which has two main features: it allows us to deal with hole of finite size and provides a better descent direction in optimization process...|$|R
40|$|Successful peg and <b>hole</b> <b>insertion</b> systems {{allow the}} peg to {{translate}} and rotate to accommodate contact forces that arise from different contact states between the peg and hole during assembly. Typically, a position or force controlled robotic insertion system is fitted with a specialized mechanically compliant wrist, known as a remote center compliance (RCC) device, to allow the system to accommodate the forces. Using design principles similar to those developed for the RCC, a variable compliance control system is produced in this thesis. This control system allows a dual seven degree of freedom robotic arm system to cooperatively perform rigid peg and hole assembly with human-like performance at a 100 % success rate {{without the use of}} mechanically compliant attachments. Additionally, a novel finite state machine with visual feedback is developed to improve the positional accuracy of the robots’ impedance controllers and boost the reliability and performance of the entire system. Finally, a unique design process is developed to obtain the optimum variable compliance controller control law equations with respect to task success, reliability, and coupled robotic arm stability.
