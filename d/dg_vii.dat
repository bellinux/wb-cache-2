40|$|As {{part of the}} ATOMOS project (Funded by EU, <b>DG</b> <b>VII)</b> a {{reliable}} communication system with predictable behaviour has been designed. The selected solution is a network based on redundant ARCnet segments extended with an EN 50170 compliant fieldbus based layer {{on top of an}} ARCnet SAP (service access point) layer. An important characteristic of the communication system is that the functionality and timing must be verifiable in order to satisfy requirements from classification companies like Lloyds and Norsk Veritas. By including Service Categories, Traffic Descriptors and Quality of Service concepts in the system it is made possible to measure network performance and hereby obtain verifiable methods for traffic planning and network surveillance. This paper describes the design of a simulation system to be used for testing and verifying the communication on a single ARCnet segment throughout the development phase and to verify real-world integration of the communication system and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{final report}} of the European PROMISING {{research}} project integrates {{the findings of the}} work of six workpackages (For workpackage 3 see C 19231 (ITRD E 206417). The reports of these workpackages are available separately. The final report selects main findings of the different workpackages and combines the results as much as possible. The report is policy-oriented and illustrated with photos and clear examples, in accordance with the requests of the European Union (EU) <b>DG</b> <b>VII,</b> the commissioner of the project. The aim of the PROMISING project was to develop measures that reduce the risk of injury to vulnerable and young road users as much as possible in a non-restrictive way. That is to say that safety and mobility must be improved together; the improvement of safety should not take place at the cost of reduced mobility. The potential for problem reduction was specified for four target groups of vulnerable road users: pedestrians, cyclists, motorised two-wheelers (motorcyclists and riders of mopeds), and young car drivers. The differences between European countries in their transport modes were taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the survey that {{was carried out}} {{within the framework of}} the Social Attitudes to Road Traffic Risk in Europe (SARTRE) project. Sixteen research institutes from fifteen European countries have undertaken a similar survey in their country in 1991 - 1992. This survey was conducted among a representative sample of car drivers. The report results from the European Union's Directorate General VII (<b>DG</b> <b>VII)</b> request. The aim was to write a policy document on the SARTRE project, and to present the project's main policy implications, at a meeting of the High Level group in Brussels on 23 November 1994. Important results are as follows: (1) The car drivers' concern of for road safety has more to do with the other people's behaviour than with their own behaviour; (2) Human factors are more often seen as cause of accidents than vehicle characteristics; (3) Breaking speed limits is seen as very common. However, legislation is considered as important; (4) A great majority of European drivers favours a lower legal alcohol limit; (5) Seat belt use is strongly dependent upon habituation. Habitual use is a consequence of legislation and police enforcement; and (6) there is support for both the improvement of driver training, and for a tougher driving test...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} the calculation of environmental and health externalities caused by air pollutants, accidents and noise from different transport modes (road, rail, air) on the route Frankfurt-Milan. The investigation {{is part of the}} QUITS project (QUITS = Quality Indicators for Transport Systems), commissioned by the European Commission <b>DG</b> <b>VII.</b> The evaluation of the external costs is based on a bottom-up approach. The calculation involves four stages: emissions, dispersion, impacts, and costs, following the impact pathway approach. An integrated model for the valuation of environmental and health costs due to air pollutants will be presented consisting of three computer programmes which are linked together. For passenger road traffic, total external costs amount to about 44 ECU/ 1000 pkm on the route Frankfurt -Milan, including the impact categories air pollutants (15. 6), global warming (5. 2), noise (3. 8), and accidents (19. 6 ECU/ 1000 pkm). Concerning a comparison of the transport modes, external costs of passenger road traffic are about 9 times as high as those of rail traffic and about twice as high as those of air traffic. For goods transport by road, the total external costs (30. 6 ECU/ 1000 tkm) are about 11 times as high as those of rail traffic.

40|$|Senior {{livestock}} policy {{advisers and}} experts {{as well as}} scientists {{in the field of}} animal production and livestock services in 21 Eastern and Southern African countries, as well as representatives of European and international livestock institutions, research organizations and donor agencies took part in a seminar on Livestock development policies in Eastern and Southern Africa from 28 July to 1 August 1997 in Mbabane, Swaziland. The seminar was organized by CTA in collaboration with the OAU/IBAR (Organization of African Unity/Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives of Swaziland, with scientific support from the European Commission (<b>DG</b> <b>VII</b> and DG XII) and the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR). This was CTA's second seminar on livestock development policies, and built on the experience gained during a similar seminar held in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, in February 1996. The focus then was on the humid and sub-humid zones of West and Central Africa, while the Mbabane seminar looked at Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). The results of the week-long seminar were summarized in 52 recommendations to strengthen the policy dialogue and promote livestock development in ESA. The seminar highlighted the lack of specific livestock policies in some countries of the region as the major constraint to development. Accordingly, the highest priority was given to building capacity in each country to develop appropriate policies, formulate strategies and evaluate their impacts. The main recommendation for each government was that clearly defined livestock policies be formulated, as well as detailed national strategies and investment plans {{for the development of the}} livestock sector. At the same time, it was recommended that each country review all existing policies that may have negative effects on agricultural development such as inappropriate subsidies, taxation on agricultural inputs, price controls that favoured consumers, non-sustainable services like free dipping, liberal importation of livestock and livestock products and communal land ownership. Participants decided that in general governments should reduce their participation in production and marketing of livestock and livestock products, and should support the trend towards privatization in animal health delivery systems, as well as private land ownership and investment. Delegates also emphasized as a matter of urgency, the need to implement livestock development programmes which give specific attention to the identification, characterization and documentation of existing Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR), as well as programmes, including research, for their improvement, increased use and conservation, and impact assessments to ensure that the importation of foreign germplasm did not adversely affect indigenous AnGR. To promote trade at regional level, it was recommended that countries harmonize import and export regulations, as well as policies on standards. In addition, regional policies need to be established to allow for effective free flow of quality information among countries, not only to promote trade but also break the isolation of professionals in various countries. In this connection, delegates felt that international policies should be established to stimulate North-South professional linkages. After the seminar, the recommendations of the Mbabane and Côte d'Ivoire seminars were consolidated into one set of recommendations for an environment more conducive to livestock development in Sub-Saharan African. This was submitted to the OAU Fifth Conference of Ministers Responsible for Animal Resources, which met in Mbabane in the week following the ESA seminar. seminar on Livestock development policies in Eastern and Southern Africa from 28 July to 1 August 1997 in Mbabane, Swazilan...|$|E
40|$|This workpackage is one {{of seven}} workpackages of the European SAFESTAR project, {{launched}} by <b>DG</b> <b>VII.</b> Directing on safety standards and recommendations for the Trans-European Roadway Network (TERN), the workpackage considered safety measures on emergency lanes (stopping strips), which are inherent facilities of the TERN-motorways. Giving space for emergency stops and making the carriageway of a motorway safer, the emergency lane contains its own additional elements of accident risk. Multiple-vehicle accidents, (when {{at least one of}} the involved vehicles was entering, on, or leaving the emergency lane of the motorway), are seldom, but extremely serious. This workpackage activity consists of the following four tasks: (i) a survey of existing views and policies on the subject emergency lanes and shoulders of motorways; (ii) surveys of relevant research results, including in-depth analyses of road accidents and behavioural studies of road users; (iii) an actual risk estimation of accidents on emergency lanes of motorways in EU-countries; and (iv) a formulation of recommendations. The survey of international national standards on emergency lanes has shown a lot of differences between basic norms and standards in the EU- countries. The data, guidelines, norms and differences between European countries are collected by means of data requests and interviews with specialists from most EU-countries: (i) basic geometric standards of emergency lanes, and the actual percentage of motorways equipped with emergency lanes; (ii) spacing of emergency phones along motorways; (iii) operational rules on the use of emergency lanes; (iv) the spacing of rest areas with parking facilities; and (v) the spacing of service and accommodation areas. There are also some deviating practices found in different countries when segments of the emergency lane are used for other purposes than usual, such as: (i) an additional lane during the rush-hours; (ii) a separated lane for public buses; and (iii) an additional lane when the opposite direction of the road is under reconstruction. These measures are relatively new and there is no evidence pro or contra because of the lack of accident data. Further monitoring of such deviating practices in EU-countries is recommended. Risk figures were estimated for accidents on emergency lanes in the EU by using IRTAD- and CARE-databases, and available in-depths studies in the UK and the Netherlands, The accuracy of the estimation is limited by the lack of in-depth studies in EU-countries. In order to retrieve the needed multiple-vehicle accidents the databases have to proceed rather sophisticated data manipulations taking into account the initial and final position and manoeuvres of the vehicles that are involved in accidents. Only few European countries have this facilities. Totally, about 65, 000 injury accidents (causing 3, 500 deaths) happen each year on approximately 40, 500 kilometres of motorways in 15 EU-countries. An estimation of multiple-vehicle accidents on emergency lanes of these motorways showed at least about 1, 000 of such accidents and about 300 road deaths each year on motorways in EU-countries. The severity of such accidents is more than five times higher than average. On Dutch motorways the presence of obstacles on emergency lanes has been investigated by field observations and behavioural studies. Using the databases of the Royal Dutch Touringclub ANWB and field observations, the density of broken down cars per road kilometre were obtained. The frequency of breakdowns strongly depends the time of day. For instance at 6 am, there is about one broken down car every 70 kilometre and at 9 pm, there is about one broken-down car every 33 kilometre on the emergency lane. In total every 12, 4 kilometre there are obstacles found on the emergency lanes: mostly work zones, stopped cars, and very seldom pedestrians). For a more accurate and deep estimation of multiple-vehicle accidents on emergency lanes, a sample inventory study on motorways of EU-countries should be launched. The Dutch technics for in-depth accident analysis can be recommended, also for the continuation and extension of this research in other EU-countries...|$|E
