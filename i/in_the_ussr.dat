5|$|The formal {{study of}} plant {{resistance}} to herbivory was first covered extensively in 1951 by Reginald (R.H.)

5|$|In June 1962, {{food prices}} were raised, {{particularly}} on meat and butter (by 25–30%). This caused public discontent.

According to Soviet official accounts, 22 {{people were killed and}} 87 wounded. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR,</b> but spread through Samizdat and damaged Khrushchev's reputation in the West.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>USSR.</b> This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E

5|$|The Ministry of Civil Aviation was, {{according}} to the Air Code of the USSR, responsible for all air transport enterprises and airlines established by it.

5|$|The Soviet Union had 7,192 {{airports}}, {{of which}} 1,163 had paved surface.
