5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get <b>knocked</b> down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is <b>knocked</b> down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being <b>knocked</b> down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are <b>knocked</b> down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle, with Daivari as the special guest referee. Early in the match, Angle {{was able to}} apply the Ankle lock on Cena. Cena reached the ropes but Daivari kicked his hand off. An angered Cena slapped Daivari, who tried to disqualify him as a result. Angle, however, stopped him, and both men were <b>knocked</b> {{out of the ring}} by Cena. As Daivari was <b>knocked</b> down outside, a Raw referee came out to officiate. After Cena gained the advantage, Angle <b>knocked</b> down the referee, and {{executed}} an illegal low blow. Angle called for another referee, but failed to get the win after executing an Angle Slam and a superplex. After Angle missed a moonsault, Cena went for an FU but Angle countered by holding onto the referee, which led to Angle knocking down the referee. As the other referee was <b>knocked</b> out, SmackDown referee Charles Robinson came out. Cena then delivered a DDT to Daivari and executed an FU on Angle, pinning him to retain the title.|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{spark-ignition}} engine works {{more and more}} on <b>knocking</b> limit because of higher requirements on consumption, exhaust-gas limits and engine power. Heavy <b>knocking</b> can damage the engine permanently. Therefore it is necessary to prevent <b>knocking.</b> The <b>knock</b> sensor signal consists of many components. A <b>knocking</b> combustion creates one component in the <b>knock</b> sensor signal. But the signal contains also disturbing noise by normal combustion and mechanical vibration of other engine components. This disturbing noise can influence the <b>knock</b> detection. A false detected <b>knocking</b> doesn’t damage the engine, but decreases the performance. The influence of the components piston and valve on the <b>knock</b> detection is analysed in this paper. A possibility to calibrate the <b>knock</b> detection with time-frequency analysis is presented. On this way, the influences of the disturbing noise of the components on the <b>knock</b> detection are mitigated.

The diesel engines <b>knock</b> under normal operating conditions but the <b>knock</b> {{referred to in}} this paper is an objectionable one. In the dual-fuel combustion pro-cess we have the ignition stage followed by the combustion stage. There are three types of knock: diesel <b>knock,</b> spark <b>knock</b> and <b>knock</b> due to secondary ignition delay of the primary fuel (erratic <b>knock).</b> Several factors have been noted to feature in defining <b>knock</b> characteristics of dual-fuel engines that include ignition delay, pilot quantity, engine load and speed, turbulence and gas flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Engine <b>knock</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{limiting}} factors for modern Spark-Ignition (SI) engines to achieve high efficiency targets. The stochastic nature of <b>knock</b> in SI units hinders the predictive capability of RANS <b>knock</b> models, which are based on ensemble averaged quantities. To this aim, a <b>knock</b> model grounded in statistics was recently developed in the RANS formalism. The model is able to infer a presumed log-normal distribution of <b>knocking</b> cycles from a single RANS simulation by means of transport equations for variances and turbulence-derived probability density functions (PDFs) for physical quantities. As a main advantage, the model is able to estimate the earliest <b>knock</b> severity experienced when moving the operating condition into the <b>knocking</b> regime. In this paper, improvements are introduced in the model, which is then applied to simulate the <b>knock</b> signature of a single-cylinder 400 cm 3 direct-injection SI unit with optical access; the engine is operated with two spark timings, under knock-safe and <b>knocking</b> conditions respectively. The statistical prediction of <b>knock</b> resulting from the presented <b>knock</b> model is compared to the experimental evidence for both investigated conditions. The agreement between the predicted and the measured <b>knock</b> distributions validates the proposed <b>knock</b> model. Finally, limitations and some unprecedented possibilities given by the model are critically discussed, with particular emphasis on the meaning of RANS <b>knock</b> prediction...|$|R
40|$|In spark {{ignition}} engines, <b>knock</b> onset limits the maximum spark advance. An inaccurate identification of this limit penalises the fuel conversion efficiency. Thus <b>knock</b> feature extraction {{is the key}} of closed-loop control of ignition in {{spark ignition}} engine. This paper reports an investigation of <b>knock</b> detection in spark ignition (SI) engines using CEEMD-Hilbert transform based on the engine cylinder pressure signals and engine cylinder block vibration signals. Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) was used to decompose the signal and detect <b>knock</b> characteristic. Hilbert transform was {{used to analyze the}} frequency information of <b>knock</b> characteristic. The result shows that, for both of cylinder pressure signals and vibration signals, the CEEMD algorithm could extract the <b>knock</b> characteristic, and the Hilbert transform result shows that the energy of <b>knock</b> impact areas has the phenomenon of frequency concentration in both cylinder pressure signal and cylinder block vibration signal. At last, the <b>knock</b> window is then determined, based on which a new <b>knock</b> intensity evaluation factor K is propose, and it can accurately distinguish between heavy <b>knock,</b> light <b>knock,</b> and normal combustion three states...|$|R
