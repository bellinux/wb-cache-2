40|$|In May of 2009, Japan began formal {{operations}} of the saiban-in seido or lay <b>judge</b> <b>system,</b> a quasi-jury means of criminal trial adjudication that represents the first occasion since 1943 that average Japanese citizens {{will be required to}} fulfill a role in the criminal jurisprudential process. While the lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> promises to affect the methods and procedures of criminal trials in Japan, recent scholarship in the United States has raised an interesting question: to what degree can the lay participatory adjudication process facilitate greater levels of civic engagement in past citizen jurists once their service has completed? It is with this question in mind that the Japanese lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> is examined. In this work I first analyze how the Japanese judicial system fits within the global context, measuring it against the adversarial and inquisitorial archetypes that are followed by other liberal democracies. I then look to describe how lay adjudication is handled elsewhere around the world, finding that two major systems are employed - the Anglo-American jury and the European mixed-tribunal - with the Japanese lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> bearing great resemblance towards the latter. In investigating the origins of the lay <b>judge</b> <b>system,</b> and the changes this new method brings to Japanese criminal jurisprudence, I seek to detail the goals of this recent reform and the opportunities the lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> has to realize those aims. Finally, I look to how lay participation in the courtroom can inspire individuals to be more civically active once their service at trial is finished. In this pursuit, I look to relevant theoretical literature that describes how deliberative participation can spur further participation in civil society, as well as recent research in the United States that document linkages between jury service and an individual`s later inclination to be more civically engaged. With this evidence in hand, I return the focus to Japan and the lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> and ask what results can be expected under this new system. As sufficient data is not readily available to make definitive declarations as to the civic engagement-enhancing potential of the lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> - due to the relative newness of the institution - this thesis instead offers theories and hypotheses that may prove fruitful to later investigations on this very question. Moreover, I examine opinions prevalent in the current literature that would question the ability of the lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> to invigorate the civic engagement-tendencies of past lay jurists and analyze their veracity. In this manner, I seek to provide future research in this area with a more stable footing to proceed...|$|R
40|$|The lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> has {{considerable}} potential both in {{concept and}} form. To realize its full potential, the system needs to overcome various structural impediments and cultural challenges. This Article further {{contributes to the}} emerging discussion by detailing three related areas that merit attention and reform if the {{system is going to}} realize its full potential. Namely, the lay <b>judge</b> <b>system</b> would benefit from 1) increased transparency by eliminating punitive measures against citizen judges desiring to freely speak about the trial proceedings or deliberation process oncle the trial is complete; 2) impoved access to the interrogation of detained suspects and defendants; and 3) limited victim participation in trials until a post-verdicgt phase in the proceedings. Part I establishes a foundation by outlining the movement towards citizen participation, the reasons underlying the new lay <b>judge</b> <b>system,</b> and the ongoing debate about the law <b>judge</b> <b>system.</b> Part II details the development of the Japanese criminal system.
