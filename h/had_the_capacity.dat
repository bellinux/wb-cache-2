5|$|In 1937, {{after he}} unsuccessfully {{applied for a}} job with Canada's National Research Council, the University of Chicago {{accepted}} him as a research associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first cyclotron in the midwestern United States. The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, {{the head of the}} university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon (carbon-14 and carbon-11) from the cyclotron. While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that plant cells <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> to use carbon dioxide for carbohydrate synthesis, through carbon fixation.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> to design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted {{on the use of}} electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E
5|$|The Torah ark <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> {{to house}} 50 Torah scrolls and {{was built on}} two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns {{surrounded}} by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds.

Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right and in front of the ark was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level Ark.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E

In its September issue, Famitsu listed that Senjō no Valkyria 3 would be arriving on the PlayStation Portable. Its first public appearance was at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show (TGS), where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees. During the publicity, story details were kept scant {{so as not to}} spoil too much for potential players, along with some of its content still being in flux {{at the time of its}} reveal. To promote the game and detail the story leading into the game's events, an episodic Flash visual novel written by Fujii began release in January 2011. The game was released January 27, 2011. During an interview, the development team said that the game <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> for downloadable content (DLC), but that no plans were finalized.
