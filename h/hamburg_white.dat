50|$|With the {{explosion}} of the cotton economy, this area became an important market for the increasingly valuable produce of planters throughout upper Georgia and South Carolina. In 1821 the town of Hamburg was established by the mechanical genius and entrepreneur Henry Shultz in direct commercial competition with Augusta. In 1833 the South Carolina Rail Road was established, further connecting the cotton collected at Hamburg to the seaport of Charleston. The 1848 construction of the Augusta Canal channeled produce from upriver away from Hamburg. When a bridge linked the South Carolina Rail Road to Augusta allowing traffic to bypass the doomed town of <b>Hamburg,</b> <b>white</b> citizens began {{to move out of the}} town, being replaced by blacks after the Civil War. The final blow came in 1876, when a white mob attacked and looted the primarily black town, taking and executing several prisoners, while also wounding several others and attempting to kill the town's elected representatives. Henry Shultz died in poverty and reportedly is buried upright on the bluff overlooking Hamburg with his back to Augusta.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the 1880s in Southport, Lancashire, Old English Game, roosters were crossed with Malay hens {{to create}} the {{foundation}} for the breed. Black <b>Hamburgs,</b> <b>White</b> Leghorns, and Sicilian Buttercups were also added to cement its characteristics. The Marsh Daisy would become a proper, defined breed in England as of 1913.|$|R

50|$|The {{coat of arms}} of the German {{state and}} city of Hamburg {{is a kind of}} a {{national}} emblem. The coat of arms and the flags are regulated by the constitution of Hamburg and law. The colors of <b>Hamburg</b> are <b>white</b> and red. One of the oldest versions of the castle is found on a seal in 1245.|$|R
50|$|Despite this {{impressive}} impact, Rogers' hybrids are {{the product}} of only two crosses. Rogers pollinated a vine of Vitis labrusca, known locally as Carter or Mammoth Globe, with pollen from two European Vitis vinifera grapes, Black <b>Hamburg</b> and <b>White</b> Chasselas, being cultivated under glass nearby. He planted the resulting seeds in his garden, and the next spring approximately 150 germinated, but cutworms and other pests and accidents reduced their number to forty-five. Numbers one through five, and fifteen through forty-five, were from the cross Carter x Black Hamburg, while numbers six through fourteen were from Carter x White Chasselas.|$|R
50|$|The {{colors of}} {{version of the}} lesser arms of 2008 are {{declared}} {{by an act of}} law of the Senate of Hamburg on 14 May 1752. Before the tincture was a red castle on white ground. Since 1952, the coat of arms and the flags are regulated by the constitution of Hamburg. The colors of <b>Hamburg</b> are <b>white</b> and red. In general the use of city seals with the coat of arms was a privilege of the City Council. The city elders had to watch its maintenance. Even now the coat of arms is protected and can only be used under specific circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|In 1803 Greene bought land in Boston on Pemberton Hill (i.e. Cotton Hill), from Tremont Street (opposite Court Street) to Somerset Street, {{including}} the former house of William Vassall (built c. 1758). The Greene family {{lived there for}} several decades, until c. 1835. The estate was known for its sweeping harbor views and lush [...] "hillside garden." [...] An acquaintance of the family, Marshall Pinckney Wilder, described the grounds: [...] "The most conspicuous and elegant garden of those days Boston was that of Gardiner Greene, who {{had one of the}} early green-houses of Boston. The grounds were terraced and planted with vines, fruits, ornamental trees, flowering shrubs and plants. ... Here were growing in the open air Black <b>Hamburg</b> and <b>White</b> Chasselas grapes, apricots, nectarines, peaches, pears and plums. ... Here were many ornamental trees brought from foreign lands." ...|$|R

5|$|In 1874, a {{moderate}} Republican, Daniel Henry Chamberlain, was elected South Carolina's governor, attracting even some Democratic votes. When Chamberlain sought re-election in 1876, Gary recruited Wade HamptonIII, a Confederate war hero {{who had moved}} out of state, to return and run for governor as a Democrat. That election campaign of 1876 was marked by violence, of which the most notorious occurrence was {{what became known as}} the Hamburg massacre. It occurred in Hamburg, South Carolina, a mostly black town across the river from Augusta, in Aiken County, bordering Edgefield County. The incident grew out of a confrontation on July 4 when a black militia marched in <b>Hamburg</b> and two <b>white</b> farmers in a buggy tried to ride through its ranks. Both sides filed criminal charges against the other, and dozens of armed out-of-uniform Red Shirts, led by Butler, traveled to Hamburg on the day of the hearing, July 8. Tillman was present, and the subsequent events were among his proudest memories.|$|R
2500|$|During March and April 1945, {{concentration}} camp prisoners from Scandinavian countries had been transported {{from all over}} the Reich to the Neuengamme {{concentration camp}} near <b>Hamburg,</b> in the <b>White</b> Bus programme co-ordinated through the Swedish Red Cross - with prisoners of other nationalities displaced to make room for them. Eventually Himmler agreed that these Scandinavians, and selected others regarded as less harmful to Germany, could be transported through Denmark to freedom in Sweden. Then between the 16 and 28 April 1945, Neuengamme was systematically emptied of all its remaining prisoners, together other groups of concentration camp inmates and Soviet POWs; with the intention that they would be relocated to a secret new camp, either on the Baltic island of Fehmarn; or at Mysen in Norway where preparations were put in hand to house them under the control of concentration camp guards evacuated from Sachsenhausen. In the interim, they were to be concealed from the advancing British and Canadian forces; and for this purpose the SS assembled a prison flotilla of decommissioned ships in the Bay of Lübeck, consisting of the liners Cap Arcona and , the freighter , [...] and the motor launch [...] Since the steering motors were out of use in Thielbek and the turbines were out of use in Cap Arcona, Athen was used to transfer prisoners from Lübeck to the larger ships and between ships; they were locked below decks and in the holds, and denied food and medical attention [...]|$|R
