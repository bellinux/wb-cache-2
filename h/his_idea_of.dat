5|$|McNeile {{continued}} writing {{after he}} left the army in 1919, although he stopped writing war stories and began to publish thrillers. In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond, whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an English gentleman and his friend Gerard Fairlie. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E

5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante was {{the next}} choice, {{increasing}} the budget for <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, {{making it to the}} final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev told Mikoyan of <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{shipping}} Soviet {{missiles to}} Cuba. Mikoyan {{was opposed to}} the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles. In early November 1962, after the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a framework to remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal. Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed {{about the death of}} his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} {{view is that}} George Berkeley uses sections 29 - 33 of A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (PHK) {{to argue}} non-enthymematically {{for the existence of}} God. 2 This view is supported by the following considerations. In PHK 29, Berkeley claims that <b>his</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> sense, unlike <b>his</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> imagination, are not dependent on his own will. 3 Given that these ideas must have a cause, that only spirits can be causes (as established in PHK 25 - 26), and that he is not himself the cause <b>of</b> these <b>ideas,</b> Berkeley concludes that there must be “some other will or spirit that produces them”. In PHK 30, Berkeley argues that because <b>his</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> sense have a “steadiness, order, and coherence ” and are “admirabl[y] cone[cted]”, the spirit that causes them, whom Berkeley now calls the “Author ” of nature, must possess “wisdom and benevolence”. In PHK 32, Berkeley summarizes this point, writing that “this consistent uniform working…so evidently displays the goodness and wisdom of that governing spirit whose will constitutes the Laws of Nature”. And in PHK 33, Berkeley adds that the governing spirit who produces <b>his</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> sense (which are styled “real things ” because of thei...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{most of his}} contemporaries, Mani Ratnam did not assist {{anybody in}} film-making prior to {{entering}} the industry. He is credited with revolutionizing the Tamil film industry and is referred for bringing new dimension to the South Asian cinema. A majority of his films are characterized by a string of socio-political themes. Because of <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> combining art and commercial elements, most of his films garnered both critical acclaim and commercial success. Nayagan, Bombay and Iruvar were inspired from real-life incidents, while Thalapathi and Raavan were based on Indian epics.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game were its linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, {{his first}} cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a son, Sandip, {{who is now}} a film {{director}}. In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> filming Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which {{had a profound impact on}} him. Ray later said that he came out of the theatre determined to become a film-maker.|$|E

Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, and held on to his concept of bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience {{the merits of the}} original Zelda, but also as a test for the development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if {{it turned out to be}} successful.|$|E
5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was a throwback to the medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the German people's will.|$|E
5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E

Marge soon finds a mural-painting job at Springfield Elementary School for him. Jack paints a powerful mural symbolizing school spirit with a warrior woman riding a puma, which the whole school likes, but Principal Skinner demands he tone it down using <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a cartoonish puma walking with two children under a rainbow in a fantasy land. Jack reluctantly gives into his wishes; however, upon its unveiling, the new mural is panned by everyone in town. Skinner blames Jack and fires him.|$|E
5|$|The Special Boat Section {{was founded}} in July 1940 by a Commando officer, Roger Courtney.

He was unsuccessful in his initial attempts to convince Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes and later Admiral Theodore Hallett, commander of the Combined Training Centre, that <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a folding kayak brigade would be effective. He decided to infiltrate , a Landing Ship, Infantry anchored in the River Clyde. Courtney paddled to the ship, climbed aboard undetected, wrote his initials on the door to the captain's cabin, and stole a deck gun cover. He presented the soaking cover to a group of high-ranking Royal Navy officers meeting at a nearby Inveraray hotel. He was promoted to captain, and given command of twelve men, the first Special Boat Service/Special Boat Section.|$|E

Looking for an alternate publication mechanism, Ellsberg returned to <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> having a member of Congress read them, and chose Gravel based on the latter's efforts against the draft; Gravel agreed where previously others had not. Ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to Gravel on June 26 via an intermediary, Washington Post editor Ben Bagdikian.

5|$|The idea of {{chemical}} chain reactions was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist Max Bodenstein for {{a situation in}} which two molecules react to form not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist Leo Szilard on 12 September 1933. Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced neutrons or dineutrons, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating. Szilard proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts, although he did entertain the possibility of using uranium as a fuel. He filed a patent for <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a simple nuclear reactor the following year. The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, opened up the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction with uranium or indium, but initial experiments were unsuccessful.|$|E
