This was a white cake mix <b>with</b> <b>multicolored</b> <b>sprinkles</b> mixed into the batter. The cake's unique look was meant to target the demographic of children. The cake soon gained popularity and in 1990 Betty Crocker introduced a cookie that was to be eaten with icing that had sprinkles mixed into it, called Dunk-a-roos.
