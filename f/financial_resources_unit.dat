40|$|AbstractThe {{financial}} sector provides services {{that have been}} identified as germane for the growth of an economy. The principal function of the {{financial sector}} is the movement of <b>financial</b> <b>resources</b> between different <b>units</b> in an economy through the process of financial intermediation. An economy suffers if the financial sector is not efficient. An efficient financial sector can only exist when development occurs in the financial sector. However, the supply-leading hypothesis assumes that financial development is the driver of economic growth. Thus this study inquires into whether the supply-leading hypothesis can be upheld in a developing economy, with particular reference to the Nigerian economic growth between 1981 and 2013. Using the Granger Pairwise causality test, it reveals that there is weak evidence in support of supply-leading hypothesis; rather, the demand-following hypothesis is dominant in the economy. However, the study suggests that there is bi-directional causality between financial development variables and indices of economic growth which thus confirms the existence of their interdependence in Nigeria context...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic linear programming model for studying long-range development alternatives of forestry and forest based industries {{at a national}} and regional level. The Finnish forest sector is used {{as an object of}} implementation and for numerical examples. Our model is comprised of two subsystems, the forestry and the industrial subsystem, which are linked to each other through the wood supply. The forestry submodel describes the development of the volume and age distribution of different tree species within the nation or its subregions. In the industrial submodel we consider various production activities, such as saw mill industry, panel industry, pulp and paper industry, as well as further processing of primary products. For a single product, alternative technologies may be employed. Thus, the production process is described by a small Leontief model with substitution. Besides supply of wood and demand of wood products, production is restricted through labor availability, production capacity, and <b>financial</b> <b>resources.</b> The production activities are grouped into financial units and the investments are made within the <b>financial</b> <b>resources</b> of such <b>units.</b> Objective functions related to GNP, balance of payments, employment, wage income, stumpage earnings, and industrial profit have been formulated. Terminal conditions have been proposed to be determined through an optimal solution of a stationary model for the whole forest sector. The structure of the integrated forestry-forest industry model is given in the canonical form of dynamic linear programs for which special solution techniques may be employed. Two versions of the Finnish forest sector models have been implemented for the interactive mathematical programming system called SESAME, and a few numerical runs have been presented to illustrate possible use of the model...|$|R
