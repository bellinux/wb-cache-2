5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals have been {{introduced}} to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately. Moose, snowshoe hare, American red squirrel, <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunk,</b> and masked shrew, and others, {{were brought to the}} island through specific wildlife mandates. Moose were introduced in 1904 and are now the dominant ungulate on the island. An unusual experiment conducted in 1964 involved relocating a small herd of bison onto Brunette Island in Fortune Bay. The last of these animals is thought to have died by 1994. Rats and mice were unintentionally introduced while mink escaped from fur farms. Coyotes are a very recent addition to the fauna of Newfoundland. How coyotes got onto the island is still debated by wildlife officials, but it is probable that they crossed the ice from Cape Breton Island in the 1980s. Newfoundland has no native amphibians, but frogs were introduced onto the island in the 1860s and toads almost a century later.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunk</b> characters, or {{borrowed}} a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing his blue jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E

40|$|Human {{alteration}} of natural ecosystems {{in the form}} of habitat fragmentation changes the composition and configuration of the landscape and may shift the distribution of resources essential for survival of individuals or entire species. Habitat patches become separated by a complex system of non-ideal matrix, which can inhibit movement and ultimately lead to genetic substructure among populations. In time, negative consequences of isolation may be loss of genetic diversity or extirpation of local populations. I examined white-footed mice and <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks</b> in northern Indiana, a region that has undergone extensive changes in land cover over the last 200 years, at multiple scales to elucidate the effect of landscape features on genetic structure. I found no evidence of genetic structure in white-footed mice at the study area scale, while <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks</b> exhibited evidence of at least five large subpopulations across the study area. Small scale analysis revealed extensive genetic structure in <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks,</b> and a variable degree of structure in white-footed mice. Many populations of <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks</b> were separated by distances well within the species’ dispersal capabilities, indicating that a factor other than distance was hindering gene flow. While setting a limit on the maximum distance between two populations, I evaluated the permeability of eight land cover variables at eight different widths. Forests, grasslands, and non-treed corridors were consistently the greatest facilitators of gene flow, while there was some evidence that treed corridors and roads limited gene flow. Finally, I investigated the possible factors influencing the variability in presence of genetic structure at small scales in white-footed mice using both landscape composition and configuration variables. Unlike <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks,</b> treed corridors seem to facilitate gene flow and reduce the probability of observing genetic structure at small scales. ...|$|R
50|$|Chipmunks play an {{important}} role as prey for various predatory mammals and birds but are also opportunistic predators themselves, particularly with regard to bird eggs and nestlings, {{as in the case of}} <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks</b> and mountain bluebirds (Siala currucoides).|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks</b> (Tamias striatus) {{were capable}} of crossing roads with varying levels of traffic volume. We live-trapped small mammals in 24 “home” patches. We uniquely marked and translocated 197 white-footed mice and 115 <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks</b> to nearby forest patches. Recaptured animals were recorded as successful returns. Forty five (22. 8 %) of the mice and 22 (19. 1 %) of the chipmunks returned to their home patches within six days of their release. Traffic on roads between the capture and release sites had a significant negative effect on small mammal return rates. No small mammals returned when moved across roads with average annual daily traffic over 11, 000. Roads with low traffic may be weak barriers to movement, but high traffic prevents successful crossing...|$|R

40|$|We use {{museum and}} other {{collection}} records to document large and extraordinarily rapid {{changes in the}} ranges and relative abundance of nine species of mammals in the northern Great Lakes region (white-footed mice, woodland deer mice, southern red-backed voles, woodland jumping mice, <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks,</b> least chipmunks, southern flying squirrels, northern flying squirrels, common opossums). These species reach either the southern or the northern limit of their distributions in this region. Changes consistently reflect increases in species of primarily southern distribution (white-footed mice, <b>eastern</b> <b>chipmunks,</b> southern flying squirrels, common opossums) and declines by northern species (woodland deer mice, southern red-backed voles, woodland jumping mice, least chipmunks, northern flying squirrels). White-footed mice and southern flying squirrels have extended their ranges over 225 km since 1980, and at particularly well-studied sites in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, small mammal assemblages have shifted from numerical domination by northern species to domination by southern species. Repeated resampling at some sites suggests that southern species are replacing northern ones rather tha...|$|R
50|$|Ctenophthalmus pseudagyrtes is {{a species}} of fleas in the family Hystrichopsyllidae. It is {{widespread}} in North America, east of the Rocky Mountains, and is found mainly on small mammals.
