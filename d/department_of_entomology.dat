5|$|The <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>entomology</b> {{has done}} several studies in apiculture, {{chemical}} ecology, horticultural pollination, {{and the behavior}} of honeybee and bumblebee colonies.

5|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1970s the {{laboratory}} was used mainly for faculty and graduate research, with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced beekeeping {{as well as}} a single course offered to the public in the summers. There was a brief time in the spring semesters of 2001 and 2002 that an introductory course in beekeeping was offered, however, with the reorganization of the <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>entomology</b> these classes have since ceased.|$|E

500|$|In {{the span}} of only a decade the apiary {{laboratory}} had been run by 4 different faculty members until finally, in 1931, {{a new and more}} permanent apiology instructor, Frank R. Shaw, was hired. Shaw, a student at the time, had previously been hired on in 1930 as assistant entomologist to the college Experimental Station, but with the resignation of Farrar, his responsibilities would shift as he began to teach courses in beekeeping and pollinator ecology. In 1935, he was made an [...] "Instructor in Economic Entomology and Beekeeping" [...] while concurrently finishing his Ph.D. of entomology at Cornell University. In 1944, Shaw left to serve in the Second World War. Eventually, he would be promoted from being an instructor to an assistant professor in 1954. UMass would continue to offer beekeeping courses and maintain a beekeeping section of the entomology department right up through the 1970s, however it appears there was never another superintendent hired to replace Byard and much of the extension work to state beekeepers seems to have ceased. Professor Shaw went on to coauthor a comprehensive beekeeping and ecology textbook with UC Davis apiologist John Eckert. This textbook, intended to replace the beekeeping text of the same name by renowned apiculturalist E. F. Phillips, would be published for a total of seven editions from 1960 through 1977. Shaw retired in 1969 at the age of 61, he would be the first and last [...] "Professor of Beekeeping" [...] to do so as the position was abolished immediately after. Following his retirement, a student scholarship fund for the <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>entomology</b> was set up by the department in Shaw's name.|$|E
