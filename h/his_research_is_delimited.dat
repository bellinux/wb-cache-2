40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and reflects}} about {{the assumptions of}} an ongoing research at Nomads. usp that seeks to relate spatial appropriations and ways of life in different locations, by constitution of a third spatiality in virtual instance, via digital media. The outline of <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>delimited</b> by relations between two geographically distinct neighborhoods, but with very similar physical spaces, and in opposition to this, idiosyncratic appropriations, uses and social conformations. To this end, the comparison between population aspects and reports of Waldomiro Lobbe Sobrinho Housing in São Carlos, and Cidade Tiradentes, in São Paulo, stood as means of reflecting on social and urban phenomena from the mediation of these exchanges experience through ICT (information and communication technologies) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was, {{on the basis of the}} association’s annual reports, to {{describe}} appropriate key performance indicators for non-profit associations. The purpose was furthermore to study how the associations show their goal-attainment.   The <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>delimited</b> to contain the second category of non profit associations, which include sports associations. The authors choose three non profit associations, which according to the law, shall draw up annual reports. The three ice hockey associations HV 71, MODO Hockey and Frölunda Hockey Club, were thereafter chosen on the basis of those <b>delimits.</b> The <b>research</b> <b>was</b> furthermore <b>delimited</b> to include the parent associations only.      The authors obtained the basis of the paper through studies of literature and annual reports and via an interview. The authors described different key performance indicators based on these studies and analytical assumptions.   In the study it appeared that all of the three studied associations largely present their goal-attainment in the statement of activity, which is a part of the annual report. The financial key performance indicators that appeared were “the equity ratio” and “the gross profit margin”, which are considered to be appropriate for these three sport associations. It also appeared that the described appropriate non financial key performance indicators could be used as statistical measures to show the three studied association’s goal-attainments and with that consolidate the credibility in their annual reports. ...|$|R

50|$|Another area of <b>his</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> on {{proteins}} {{involved in}} pre-mRNA 3'-end processing.
