5|$|When first conceived, it {{was known}} as the Semaphore Battery, later changed to South Battery and then Fort Glanville by the opening ceremony. The name Glanville came from nearby Glanville Hall, {{residence}} of John Hart (1809–1873) thrice Premier of South Australia. Hart <b>had</b> <b>named</b> the house after his mother's maiden name (Mary Glanville).|$|E
5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig <b>had</b> <b>named</b> another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E

5|$|Blame for {{the loss}} of Blücher was not placed on Hipper, but on his {{superior}} Admiral von Ingenohl, who was removed from his post on 4 February. Also on the 4th, Hipper met with the Kaiser on an inspection of the fleet in Wilhelmshaven. That same day, Hipper was awarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser; on the 23rd he was presented with the Friedrich August Cross, First and Second Classes, by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg. Three days later, Hipper was informed that his hometown <b>had</b> <b>named</b> its main street Hipperstrasse (Hipper Street).|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} 16 March 2005 when Sonia Gandhi laid the {{foundation}} stone. Two days prior, the Central Government <b>had</b> <b>named</b> the airport after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had undergone pilot training in Hyderabad. The naming resulted in opposition from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). At Begumpet Airport, the international terminal was named after Rajiv Gandhi while the domestic terminal was named after TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao; the TDP wanted to continue this naming convention at the new airport. However, the new airport has only one terminal.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Albin was {{involved}} in a political controversy regarding succession to an earldom. An alleged papal bull, dated 13 December 1255, <b>had</b> <b>named</b> Bishop Albin as a papal mandatory, along with Robert de Stuteville, with instructions to investigate Alan Durward's claim to the earldom of Mar; however, the bull was denounced as a forgery on 28 March 1257, after Durward's rivals had seized power. During the months preceding this denunciation, Albin was once again out of Scotland; on 4 March 1257 his presence was once again recorded at Durham.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant <b>had</b> <b>named</b> Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E
5|$|John Lindley <b>had</b> <b>named</b> {{material}} collected by James Drummond Banksia cylindrostachya in 1840, but this {{proved to be}} the same as the species named Banksia attenuata by Robert Brown 30 years earlier in 1810, and thus Brown's name took precedence. Within the genus Banksia, the close relationships and exact position of B. attenuata is unclear.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in 1904, Herbert F. Standing <b>had</b> <b>named</b> a {{different}} species {{using the same}} name, Lemur jullyi, and named another species Lemur maziensis. He noted similarities between this group and the ruffed lemurs, then considered a single species, Lemur varius. In 1908, Standing named another species in the group, Lemur majori, and included his Lemur maziensis in L.jullyi. The name Pachylemur was introduced for these animals in 1948 by Charles Lamberton, who grouped Lemur insignis, Lemur majori, and Lemur jullyi in a subgenus of the genus Lemur.|$|E
5|$|The December 2007 {{issue of}} the British Esquire {{magazine}} announced that it <b>had</b> <b>named</b> Ganguli a runner up at the inaugural 'Esquire Man at the Top Awards' under the category 'Young Entrepreneur of the Year'.

In November 2010 and 2011, Ganguli was selected {{as one of the}} 1000 most influential figures in London by the Evening Standard.|$|E
5|$|The most {{striking}} sign {{of this was}} his mode of forming a board of trustees; for, {{instead of the usual}} effort to tie up the organization forever in some sect, party or clique, he <b>had</b> <b>named</b> the best men of his town — his political opponents as well as his friends; and had added to them the pastors of all the principal churches, Catholic and Protestant.|$|E

5|$|Alexander then chased Darius, {{first into}} Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king no longer {{controlled}} his own destiny, {{and was taken}} prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius <b>had</b> <b>named</b> him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, in {{the form}} of leaves from the willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium {{salicylate}} with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer <b>had</b> <b>named</b> the drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.|$|E
5|$|Because court {{statements}} did {{not clearly}} announce {{the cause of}} the emperor's death, rumors soon started to circulate that he had not died but in fact retired to a Buddhist monastery to live anonymously as a monk, either out of grief for the death of his beloved consort, or because of a coup by the Manchu nobles his will <b>had</b> <b>named</b> as regents. These rumors seemed not so incredible because the emperor had become a fervent follower of Chan Buddhism in the late 1650s, even letting monks move into the imperial palace. Modern Chinese historians have considered the Shunzhi Emperor's possible retirement as one of the three mysterious cases of the early Qing. But much circumstantial evidence—including an account by one of these monks that the emperor's health greatly deteriorated in early February 1661 because of smallpox, and the fact that a concubine and an Imperial Bodyguard committed suicide to accompany the emperor in burial—suggests that the Shunzhi Emperor's death was not staged.|$|E

5|$|Bradford started September with {{consecutive}} defeats; first 2–1 in {{the league}} against Barnet, before a 5–1 loss to Doncaster Rovers in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. For the latter game, McCall <b>had</b> <b>named</b> a weakened team, which included debutants Ben Saynor and Sean Taylforth, and City faced a £5,000 fine from The Football League, but were eventually only fined £3,000. Two victories {{in the league}} followed against Lincoln Citythe first time the two teams had met in a league game since the fire disaster in 1985 and Peterborough United. But the month ended as it had started with back-to-back defeats against Hereford United and Wycombe Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|Brunel and Gooch both {{gave their}} {{locomotives}} names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies {{that became a}} part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore <b>had</b> <b>named</b> broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. From the time of Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives– both broad and standard– were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E
5|$|By 1916 Rutherford {{had become}} one of the seven {{directors}} of the Watch Tower Society; when Russell died on October 31, 1916 he joined vice-President Alfred I. Ritchie and Secretary-Treasurer William E. Van Amburgh on a three-man executive committee that ran the Pennsylvania corporation until a new president was elected at the annual general meeting the following January. He also joined a five-person editorial committee to run The Watch Tower from the December 15, 1916 issue. Russell's will, drawn up in 1907, <b>had</b> <b>named</b> the five people he wished to run the magazine after his death; Rutherford appeared only on a second list of five alternative members to fill any vacancies that arose.|$|E
