5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated {{into the top of}} the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder is at the top rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in <b>external</b> <b>finish,</b> depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Since its inception, the M1911 has lent {{itself to}} easy customization. [...] Replacement sights, grips, and other {{aftermarket}} accessories {{are the most}} commonly offered parts. [...] Since the 1950s {{and the rise of}} competitive pistol shooting, many companies have been offering the M1911 as a base model for major customization. These modifications can range from changing the <b>external</b> <b>finish,</b> checkering the frame, and hand fitting custom hammers, triggers, and sears. Some modifications include installing compensators and the addition of accessories such as tactical lights and even scopes. A common modification of John Browning's design is to use a full-length guide rod that runs the full length of the recoil spring. This adds weight {{to the front of the}} pistol, but does not increase accuracy, and does make the pistol slightly more difficult to disassemble. Custom guns can cost over $5000 and are built from the ground up or on existing base models. The main companies offering custom M1911s are: Springfield Custom Shop, Ed Brown, STI International, Nighthawk Custom, Wilson Combat, and Les Baer. IPSC models are offered by both Strayer Voigt Inc (Infinity Firearms) and STI International.|$|E

I think Dowson's best verse immortal, bound, that is, to outlive famous novels and plays and learned histories and other discursive things, {{but he was too}} vague and gentle for my affections. I understood him too well, for I had been like him but for the appetite that made me search out strong condiments.

50|$|The site {{originally}} sloped steeply from Ann Street down to Adelaide Street and was excavated {{to create}} a flat platform. The Ann Street facade is five storeys, with a further two storeys and a mezzanine located below pavement level. In the centre of this facade is a prominent arched portal. This entrance is faced in smooth sandstone and its simplified modern design, without mouldings or banding, contrasts with the <b>external</b> <b>finishes</b> of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|R
5000|$|Apart from {{a slight}} {{difference}} in the cab, the superb <b>external</b> <b>finish</b> of the NBL engines appears to have given them an advantage in prestige among the crews over the three Belfast-built engines. Although {{less than half of}} the class had been built in Glasgow, the U2s gained the general nickname of [...] "Scotch Engines". Eleven of the engines were named after Ulster castles and a twelfth, No.87, carried the name Queen Alexandra.|$|E
50|$|The station layout {{remained}} substantially unaltered {{throughout its}} operational life. However, {{it was found}} {{after a few years}} usage that the original <b>external</b> <b>finish</b> to the main station building of timber beams and plaster infill was prone to water ingress, and so in the early 1900s was reformed in the local architectural style by covering the external walls with vertically-hung clay tiles. In the 1930s, the Southern Railway removed many of the superfluous LB&SCR decorations, and shortened the downside facilities to what was basically an open-plan shelter located next to the footbridge.|$|E

With the notable exception of the grand south facing window with its pointed arch, the windows consist of pointed tracery contained within rectangular frames, a style characteristic of Deane's domestic work. The entrance hall, which {{is in the}} form of a long gallery, takes up half of the area of the ground floor. The west wing of the Castle takes the form of a round tower, with a spiral staircase contained within an attached turret.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{comprehensive}} review of the literature concerning the various causes of failures of <b>external</b> wall tile <b>finishes.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A 4 × 3 matrix hierarchy framework is developed for a systematic analysis of the literature reviewed. Findings - The findings from this paper indicate the importance of environmental effects, movement joints, and adhesive on the performance of <b>external</b> wall tile <b>finishes.</b> Thermal and moisture effects induce movement of tiles, and the failure of the tiling system depends very much on the adhesive strength and the provision of movement joints. Workmanship is also a key factor affecting the performance of <b>external</b> wall tile <b>finishes</b> and should not be overlooked. Research limitations/implications - Various studies have been carried out on the causes of defects in <b>external</b> <b>finishes</b> in the past. However, many of them were case-oriented and were not supported by laboratory findings. The hierarchical framework developed in this paper serves as a basis for further laboratory and field studies on this issue. Practical implications - The framework is conducive to the diagnosis of external wall tile delamination. Originality/value - This paper reviews systematically and comprehensively the literature on the causes of external wall tile delamination. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|In {{summer of}} 1909 the <b>external</b> <b>finishes</b> were completed, and the {{scaffolds}} removed. The building was clad in black granite (base and columns) and yellow brick (walls) with terra cotta inserts. Inside, the iconostasis {{was made of}} marble from the Urals. The four portals were decorated with mosaic images of Theotokos, Saint Nicholas, Peter, Paul, John of Rila and Mitrofan of Voronezh by Foma Raylian. Most interior paintings were executed by the school of Mikhail Vasilyev; icons were painted by Appolon Troitsky. Adjacent park was designed by E. G. Gilbikh.|$|R

5000|$|The FHA [...] "minimum house" [...] {{program was}} an {{outgrowth}} of the Great Depression, when the home building industry slowed down severely and mortgage foreclosures were rising sharply. The FHA sponsored a conference targeted at reforming the home financing structure in the United States, improving the affordability of housing for the middle and lower income groups, and stimulating the homebuilding industry. In 1936, the FHA published a book, Principles of Planning Small Houses, which featured five different home patterns. The main design principle was, [...] "providing a maximum accommodation within a minimum of means," [...] so the floor plans omitted nonessential spaces and unnecessary ornamentation. The conference also planned labor- and time-saving construction methods, standard building codes, and basic requirements for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, plumbing, and electrical systems. The house plans could be built with a variety of materials, such as wood, brick, concrete block, shingles, stucco, or stone. Houses could be customized by varying the <b>external</b> <b>finish</b> types, placement on the lot, or other changes, giving the neighborhood a more pleasing appearance. The experience of builders who built homes on a large scale gave rise to the trend of tract housing.|$|E

5000|$|The only student {{accommodation}} on {{the campus}} is located in two small-scale towers known as the Round Tower and the Square Tower, close to the Scott Sutherland building. Designed by London-based architects Edward Jones and Jeremy Dixon and completed in 1993, they are inspired by traditional Scottish tower houses. The location {{on the campus}} was carefully selected to enhance the landscape, with the Round Tower placed at a slight curve in {{the river and the}} Square Tower {{at the end of an}} existing paved terrace. The construction is of concrete blocks covered by an <b>external</b> <b>finish</b> of harling, common on Scottish castles, and tinted pink as at Craigievar Castle in Aberdeenshire (approximately 27 miles/43 km to the west of the campus). In the seven-storey Round Tower each floor comprises a single apartment consisting of five student bedrooms and a kitchen with an inner [...] "drum", originally clad in wood, containing two shared toilets. A semi-circular common area with balcony is found on the top floor with a roof terrace giving almost 360-degree views over the surrounding landscape. The five-storey Square Tower is similar, with a rectangular common area and roof terrace on the top floor. The cost of design and construction was twice as great as for a typical university hall of residence at the time, and paid by a donation from an anonymous benefactor. The Round Tower and Square Tower have received architectural acclaim by critics and are included in Prospect magazine's list of the 100 best Scottish modern buildings. When the list was published in 2005, the Round and Square Towers were the only buildings in Aberdeen to be included. The two towers won a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Regional Award in 1994.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the stabilization, {{conservation}} and strengthening of historic plaster fabrics based on nanofibers. As a result of degradation processes, in particular the chemical nature, accompanied by increased humidity of the historical masonry, there is a loss of coherence and disturbance of the surface finishes and plasters. Traditional remediation techniques and methods normally lead to a reduction of diffuse permeability in multiphase structure and create different expansion properties under the plaster. The undesirable features of these methods are their irreversible character. Currently, there are primarily preferred procedures which stabilize {{the structure of the}} <b>external</b> <b>finishes</b> {{and at the same time}} preserve the original features of the historical plasters.
