6000|$|Now if {{all this}} can be done in the key of tragedy and philosophic comedy, it can, I have always contended, be done in the key of farcical comedy; and Overruled is a trifling {{experiment}} in that manner. Conventional farcical comedies are always finally tedious because the heart of them, the inevitable conjugal infidelity, is always evaded. Even its consequences are evaded. Mr. Granville Barker has pointed out rightly that if the third acts of our farcical comedies dared to describe the consequences that would follow from the first and second in real life, they would end as squalid tragedies; and in my opinion they would be greatly improved thereby even as entertainments; for I have never seen a three-act farcical comedy without being bored and tired by the third act, and observing {{that the rest of the}} audience were in the same condition, though they were not vigilantly introspective enough to find that out, and were apt to blame one another, especially the husbands and wives, for their crossness. But it is happily by no means true that conjugal infidelities always produce tragic consequences, or that they need produce even the unhappiness which they often do produce. Besides, the more momentous the consequences, the more interesting become the impulses and imaginations and reasonings, if any, of the people who disregard them. If I had an opportunity of conversing with the ghost of an executed murderer, I have no doubt he would begin to tell me eagerly about his trial, with the names of the distinguished ladies and gentlemen who honored him with their presence on that occasion, and then about his execution. All of which would bore me exceedingly. I should say, [...] "My dear sir: such manufactured ceremonies do not interest me in the least. I know how a man is tried, and how he is hanged. I should have had you killed in a much less disgusting, hypocritical, and unfriendly manner if the matter had been in my hands. What I want to know about is the murder. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> you committed it? Why did you do it? What did you say to yourself about it? If, like most murderers, you had not been hanged, would you have committed other murders? Did you really dislike the victim, or did you want his money, or did you murder a person whom you did not dislike, and from whose death you had nothing to gain, merely for the sake of murdering? If so, can you describe the charm to me? Does it come upon you periodically; or is it chronic? Has curiosity anything to do with it?" [...] I would ply him with all manner of questions to find out what murder is really like; and I should not be satisfied until I had realized that I, too, might commit a murder, or else that there is some specific quality present in a murderer and lacking in me. And, if so, what that quality is.|$|E
6000|$|There is no {{subject in}} {{the whole range of}} human affairs so {{interesting}} to a working majority of the race as the theory and practice of proposals of marriage. Men perhaps cease to be very much concerned about the ordeal when they have been through it. But the topic never loses its charm for the fair, though they are presumed only to wait and to listen, and never to speak for themselves. That this theory has its exceptions appears to be the conviction of many novelists. They not only make their young ladies [...] "lead up to it," [...] but heroines occasionally go much further than that, and do more than prompt an inexperienced wooer. But all these things are only known to the world through the confessions of novelists, who, perhaps, themselves receive confessions. M. Goncourt not long ago requested all his fair readers to send him notes of their own private experience. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> you were confirmed? How did Alphonse whisper his passion? These and other questions, quite as intimate, were set by M. Goncourt. He meant to use the answers, with all discreet reserve, in his next novel. Do English novelists receive any private information, and if they do not, how are we to reconcile their knowledge--they are all love-adepts--with the morality of their lives? [...] "We live like other people, only more purely," [...] says the author of [...] "Some Private Views," [...] which is all very well. No man is bound to incriminate himself. But as {{in the course of his}} career a successful novelist describes many hundreds of proposals, all different, are we to believe that he is so prompted merely by imagination? Are there no [...] "documents," [...] as M. Zola says, for all this prodigious deal of love-making? These are questions which await a reply in the interests of ethics and of art. Meanwhile an editor of enterprise has selected five-and-thirty separate examples of [...] "popping the question," [...] as he calls it, from the tomes of British fiction. To begin with an early case--when Tom Jones returned to his tolerant Sophia, he called her [...] "Madam," [...] and she called him [...] "Mr. Jones," [...] not Tom. She asked Thomas how she could rely on his constancy, when the lover of Miss Segrim drew a mirror from his pocket (like Strephon in [...] "Iolanthe"), and cried, [...] "Behold that lovely figure, that shape, those eyes," [...] with other compliments; [...] "can the man who shall be in possession of these be inconstant?" [...] Sophia was charmed by the [...] "man in possession," [...] but forced her features into a frown. Presently Thomas [...] "caught her in his arms," [...] and the rest was in accordance with what Mr. Trollope and the best authorities recommend. How differently did Arthur Pendennis carry himself when he proposed to Laura, and did not want to be accepted! Lord Farintosh--his affecting adventure is published here--proposed nicely enough, but did not behave at all well when he was rejected. By the way, when young men in novels are not accepted, they invariably ask the lady whether she loves another. Only young ladies, and young men whom they have rejected, know whether this is common in real life. It does not seem quite right.|$|E

60|$|As {{for when}} you come to Florence, we won't have 'a pony {{carriage}} between us,' if you please, because we may have a carriage and a pair of horses and a coachman, and pay as little as for the pony-chair in England. For three hundred a year one may live much like the Grand Duchess, and go to the opera in the evening at fivepence-halfpenny inclusive. Indeed, poor people should have their patriotism tenderly dealt with, when, after certain experiments, they decide on living upon the whole on the Continent. The differences are past belief, beyond expectation, and when the sunshine is thrown in, the head turns at once, and you fall straight into absenteeism. Ah, for the 'long chats' and the 'having England at one another's fireside!' You talk of delightful things indeed. We are very quiet, politically speaking, and though we hear now and then of melancholy mothers who have to part with their sons for Lombardy,[179] and though there are processions for the blessing of flags and an occasional firing of guns for a victory, or a cry in the streets, 'Notizie della guerra--leggete, signori;' this is all we know of Radetsky in Florence; while, for civil politics, the meeting of the senate took place a few days since to the satisfaction of everybody, and the Grand Duke's speech was generally admired. The elections have returned moderate men, and many land-proprietors, and Robert, who went out to see the procession of members, was struck by the grave thoughtful faces and the dignity of expression. We are going some day to hear the debates, but it has pleased their signoria to fix upon twelve (noon) for meeting, and really I do not dare {{to go out in the}} sun. The hour is sufficiently conclusive against dangerous enthusiasm. Poor France, poor France! News of the dreadful massacre at Paris just reaches us, and the letters and newspapers not arriving to-day, everybody fears a continuation of the crisis. How is it to end? Who 'despairs of the republic?' Why, I do! I fear, I fear, that it cannot stand in France, and you seem to have not much more hope. My husband has a little, with melancholy intermediate prospects; but my own belief that the people have had enough of democratic institutions and will be impatient for a kingship anew. Whom will they have? How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> the cry was raised, 'Vive l'Empereur'? Only Prince Napoleon is a Napoleon cut out in paper after all. The Prince de Joinville is said to be very popular. It makes me giddy to think of the awful precipices which surround France--to think, too, that the great danger is on the question of property, which is perhaps divided there more justly than in any other country of Europe. Lamartine has comprehended nothing, that is clear, even if his amount of energy had been effectual.... Yes, do send me the list of Balzac, after 'Les Misères de la Vie Conjugale,' I mean. I left him in the midst of 'La Femme de Soixante Ans,' who seemed on the point of turning the heads of all 'la jeunesse' around her; and, after all, she did not strike me as so charming. But Balzac charms me, let him write what he will; he's an inspired man. Tell me, too, exactly what Sue has done after 'Martin.' I read only one volume of 'Martin.' And did poor Soulié finish his 'Dramas'? And after 'Lucretia' what did George Sand write? When Robert and I are ambitious, we talk of buying Balzac in full some day, to put him up in our bookcase from the convent, if the carved-wood angels, infants and serpents, should not finish mouldering away in horror at the touch of him. But I fear it will rather be an expensive purchase, even here. Would that he gave up the drama, for which, as you observe, he has no faculty whatever. In fact, the faculty he has is the very reverse of the dramatic, ordinarily understood.... Dearest Mr. Kenyon is called quite well and delightful by the whole world, though he suffered from cough in the winter; and he is bringing out a new book of poems, a 'Day at Tivoli,' and others; and he talks energetically of coming to Florence this autumn. Also, we have hopes of Mr. Chorley. I congratulate you on the going away of Madame. Coming and going bring very various associations in this life of ours. Why, if you were to come we should appreciate our fortune, and you should have my particular chair, which Robert calls mine because I like sitting in a cloud; it's so sybaritically soft a chair. Now I love you for the kind words you say of him, who deserves the best words of the best women and men, wherever spoken! Yes, indeed, I am happy. Otherwise, I should have a stone where the heart is, and sink by the weight of it. You must have faith in me, for I never can make you thoroughly to understand what he is, of himself, and to me--the noblest and perfectest of human beings. After a year and ten months' absolute soul-to-soul intercourse and union, I have to look higher still for my first ideal. You won't blame me for bad taste that I say these things, for can I help it, when I am writing my heart to you? It is a heart which runs over very often with a grateful joy for a most peculiar destiny, even in the midst of some bitter drawbacks which I need not allude to farther....|$|E

40|$|Background: We used a {{computational}} method to quantitatively investigate {{the relationship between}} personality and written narratives of life events. Agentic (i. e., self- directedness), communal (i. e., cooperativeness), and spiritual (self-transcendence) traits were of special interest because they represent individual differences in intentional val- ues and goals, in contrast to temperament traits, which describe individual differences in automatic responses to emotional stimuli. We also investigated which pronouns were most common in relation to personality constructs that {{were significantly related to}} the narratives. Methods: Personality was assessed among 79 adolescents at one point in time using the NEO Personality Inventory—Revised (NEO-PI-R) and the temperament and char- acter inventory (TCI). Six months later, adolescents were asked to write down the most positive or the most negative event that had happened to them in the last 3 months. Adolescents were explicitly instructed to answer the following questions within their narratives: What happened? Who were involved? Why do you think it happened? How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> it happened? How do you think the involved persons felt? The descriptions were quantified using a {{computational method}} in which the latent semantic analysis algorithm generates a semantic representation of the narratives. Results: Only self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence were related to the semantic representation of the narratives. Moreover, cooperativeness and self- transcendence were associated with less frequent usage of singular pronouns (e. g., me respectively mine). Conclusions: Agentic, communal, and spiritual traits are involved when adolescents describe positive and negative life experiences. Moreover, high levels of communal and spiritual traits are related to less self-focused narratives.

The sample was comprised by 25 women in the age group from 18 to 59 years, users of the Mother-Child Health Center in Barbalha-CE-Brazil. Data collection happened between May and June 2009 using semi-structured interviews with the following guiding questions: What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know about {{the purpose of the}} preventive examination of uterine cervical cancer? What made you seek the health unit to perform this examination? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> undergo the examination? Data were analyzed based on the subjects’ speeches categorization, and later discussed according to the literature concerning the subject. Results: The investigation showed that the subjects {{understand the}} preventive examination with a healing perspective, since most seek the service facing some symptoms; shame and fear are the main expressed feelings concerning the examination. These factors can contribute to the non adherence to Pap test. Conclusion: The women interviewed showed to have superficial and often wrong knowledge on the examination of cervical cancer. This reveals the need for re-orientation of health services focusing on health promotion, providing the users knowledge and awareness to act as jointly responsible for their health, by adhering to the examination and probably reducing the number of cases of uterine cervical cancer...|$|R

40|$|While most college writing {{instructors}} {{would agree}} that grammatical errors should not be students 2 ̆ 7 main concern when writing and revising there is little consensus {{as to how much}} focus should be placed on grammatical errors and how best to teach students to avoid such errors. This study looks at how and with what frequency first-year writing instructors and business writing instructors indicate errors on student papers and how students view grammatical errors. ^ Instructors at four colleges and universities were given anonymous surveys to fill out. Part one listed ten of the errors found by Chris Anson and Robert Schwegler to be most bothersome to writing instructors and asked instructors to indicate how they respond to these errors when they encounter them in student papers—do they mark them? Ignore them? Correct them? Code them? Part two consisted of five questions such as 2 ̆ 2 <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> include grammar lessons as part of your course? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> treat errors in ESL students 2 ̆ 7 papers differently than in native speakers 2 ̆ 7 papers? 2 ̆ 2 ^ Student participants were given an anonymous survey to fill out. Sample questions include; 2 ̆ 2 When <b>do</b> <b>you</b> look at the grammatical markings/corrections on your paper? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> receive a paper back and your instructor has indicated there are grammatical errors in it? 2 ̆ 2 ^ Results from this study showed that mark, correct, and explain are the preferred modes of response from instructors. Instructors at all four institutions had similar responses with both how they indicate errors and their policies regarding error. Results from the student survey seemed to indicate that students have more concern for grammatical errors than instructors often assume. The overwhelming majority of students reported looking at the grammatical markings/corrections on their papers, often multiple times. Students were divided as to how they <b>feel</b> <b>when</b> they receive a paper back in which their instructor has indicated there are errors with some students being quite upset or embarrassed while others were blasé and did not care at all. ...|$|R
40|$|Food {{behaviour}} is modulated by {{the eating}} situation and environment. In a previous study, we investigated drink choices {{according to the}} ambiance by developing an immersive approach based {{on the concept of}} “having a drink in a bar”. Two bars (Modern vs. Traditional ambiance) were settled with a few piece of furniture (counter, tables and bar stools) made in raw wood for the Traditional bar and in blue retro-lighted translucent plastic for the Modern bar. A video-clip was projected on one wall: Red moving shapes associated to a “far west” music in the Traditional bar, and Blue moving bubbles associated to an “electro” music in the Modern bar. In each bar, 100 participants were asked which beverage they would like to drink (declarative). Specific drink selections were observed in this previous study: spirits in the Modern bar and beer, wine, hot chocolate and tea in the Traditional bar. To evaluate whether this contextual effect could be mediated by emotions, we designed a new series of experiments: In Study 1, 60 subjects per bar rated the ambiance on the 36 -items GEOS 1 questionnaire. In Study 2, 100 subjects per bar rated the ambiance on the 6 -items simplification of GEOS questionnaire (ScentMoveTM 2). Both studies indicate that the traditional bar was more relaxing and serene whereas the modern bar was more energising and stimulating. In Study 3, 100 participants evaluated emotions elicited by beverage names using ScentMoveTM questionnaire out of the bar context (i. e. beverage names cited as appropriate with each bar in the previous study). Drinks chosen in the traditional bar were more relaxing than energising, the reverse was observed for drinks chosen in the modern bar. The coherence of emotions elicited by both the bars and the drinks supports the hypothesis that environment modulation of food behaviour could be mediated by emotions. References: 1) C. Chrea et al.

40|$|Objectives This paper explores {{whether some}} {{individual}} features —due to pain socialisation— {{may have an}} effect on subjects’ pain perception. Our study focuses on three types of personal traits: social, apprehensive and egalitarian individuals. We analyse the effect of these personal traits on pain sensitivity, pain endurance and willingness to report pain as obtained through the Gender Role Expectations of Pain (GREP) questionnaire. Material and methods A total of 136 experimental subjects completed the questionnaire (in Spanish) in two experimental sessions at the University of Granada (Spain). Subjects were required to report their pain level (sensitivity, endurance and mode of expression) using a blind VAS when they compared themselves to a typical woman, and then to a typical man. We use both variables to compute our core variables. The questionnaire included three new variables to capture personal traits of the subject: <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> contentment <b>when</b> <b>you</b> report your pain to others? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> suffer pain when other individuals share their pain with <b>you?</b> <b>Does</b> knowing that other people also suffer pain make your pain less severe? We called them social, apprehensive and egalitarian, respectively. We use censored regression models to examine the effect of these personal traits on GREP measures. Results 1) The proportion of individuals who share their pain with other subjects (or vice versa) is overwhelming: only 25...|$|R

In ON |OFF, Sarah Genner assesses the risks and rewards of the anytime-anywhere Internet, focusing on digital divides, social relationships, physical and mental health, and data privacy. She discusses implications for a variety of decision-makers in the world of work, in education, in families, and in politics. The author deconstructs the online/offline dichotomy and suggests the ON | OFF scale as a new theoretical framework for researchers and practitioners...|$|R
