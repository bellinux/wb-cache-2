5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I know it <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E

500|$|Originally, [...] "Lola" [...] {{received}} backlash for its controversial lyrics. In a Record Mirror {{article entitled}} [...] "Sex Change Record: Kink Speaks", Ray Davies refused to tell Lola's biological sex, saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what sex Lola <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she's alright". Some radio stations would fade the track out before Lola's biological sex was revealed. On 18 November 1970, {{the song was}} banned in Australia because of [...] "controversial subject matter".|$|E
500|$|After the game, Brandon Graham, {{who played}} with Robinson at Michigan in 2009 and also played with Michael Vick on the Philadelphia Eagles told reporters that Robinson is even quicker than Vick: [...] "Both of them are pretty fast, I just think Vick's older; he's not really that fast like how Shoelace <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Shoelace is more quick than Vick, but Vick, he gets away. He's pretty fast still. I think Shoelace might have got him by a couple steps." ...|$|E

The composer Edgar Bainton said of him, [...] "Whatever opinions may be held upon Stanford's music, and they are many and various, it <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> always recognised that he was a master of means. Everything he turned his hand to always 'comes off. On the day of Stanford's death, one former pupil, Gustav Holst, said to another, Herbert Howells, [...] "The one man who could get any one of us out of a technical mess is now gone from us." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{news report}} about this segment that aired on WJBK, Gallagher {{noted that it}} [...] "poked fun at the untrue and unfounded notion that somehow Muslim sharia law {{prevails}} in Dearborn." [...] Dawud Walid, head of the Michigan branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, commented in the report that The Simpsons [...] "is a very prolific show. Now [...] is addressing this anti-sharia fear mongering issue, and perhaps it may gain some currency and ... more people will make fun of it." [...] The segment was met with mixed reception from students at University of Michigan–Dearborn. A number of them were interviewed by Gallagher in his report. One student said: [...] "It's pretty cool showing how ridiculous the hate <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's pretty funny," [...] while another noted: [...] "I don't think it's a good thing [...] because we can change it by talking, not making fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
500|$|Singer {{described}} the Apt Pupils premise as a [...] "study in cruelty". He {{prepared for the}} film by reading books like the 1996 history book Hitler's Willing Executioners, which confirmed his beliefs that Nazi war criminals felt [...] "guiltless and matter-of-fact about what they did". He referred to how young Todd Bowden's interactions with Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander start to affect him: [...] "I {{liked the idea of}} the infectious nature of evil... The notion that anybody has the capacity within them to be cruel if motivated properly <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> a scary concept." [...] The director also perceived the film as not about the Holocaust, believing that the Nazi war criminal could have been replaced by one of Pol Pot's executioners or a mass murderer from Russia. [...] "It wasn't about fascism or National Socialism. It was about cruelty and the ability to do awful deeds, to live with them and be empowered by them," [...] Singer said. To this end, the director sought to avoid overt use of swastikas and other Nazi symbols. He was also attracted to the film as [...] " [...] idea that the collective awfulness of this terrible thing that happened decades ago in Europe had somehow crept up across the ocean and through time, like a golem, into this beautiful Southern California suburban neighborhood".|$|E

500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town but, all I can say <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 4 October 2011 new {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of Norris' conviction. Retired Professor Vincent Marks – a leading expert on insulin poisoning – said the jury at Norris' trial was led to believe by experts that a cluster of hypoglycaemic episodes, among people who were not diabetic, was sinister. The professor said international medical studies carried out in the years since the 35-year-old Glaswegian was convicted told a different story. [...] "Looking at all the evidence, all I can say <b>is</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Colin Norris' conviction is unsafe," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|He {{worked for}} two years on London {{building}} sites, then studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths, University of London (1986–89), although again he was refused a place {{the first time he}} applied.
