His greatest mentor in these affairs, and one of its most enthusiastic promoters, was the counselor Sousa Dias, president of the council of ministers between 1884 and 1885. 23 In Europe, where he was with his grandparents between 1887 and 1888, Eduardo Prado and Baron Star were propagating his virtues in contrast to the [...] "defects" [...] of Dona Isabel.|$|R

This {{dissertation}} {{evaluates the}} granting of capitulations to the Dutch Republic by the Ottoman Sultan in 1612, and early years of first Dutch ambassador Cornelis Haga. The United Provinces, formed by seven provinces of the Low Countries in 1579, signed Twelve Years Truce with Spain in 1609. The truce {{was the beginning of}} Dutch primacy in world economy, which would last until mid 17 th century. The Dutch Republic sent sent Haga to achieve grant of capitulations by the Sultan Ahmed I. Despite intensive opposition of Venetian, French and English ambassadors at the Porte, Haga fulfilled his mission and remained in Istanbul as resident ambassador. From Haga's arrival onwards, Vizier Halil Paşa Provided all kinds of assistance to him in establishing diplomatic relations with the Porte. In a few years Dutch consulates were opened in major port cities throughout the Mediterranean. Haga remained in Istanbul for 27 years, where he came for a temporary mission.

Moffat's negotiations with the king and izinDuna were therefore very long and uneasy. The missionary presented the proposed British treaty as an offer to renew that enacted by d'Urban and Mzilikazi in 1836. He told the Matabele that the Boers were misleading them, that Pretoria's interpretation of the Grobler treaty differed greatly from their own, and that the British proposal served Matabele interests better in any case.

Perhaps, after all, the surest footing of hope is to be found in the rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and less of qualification in candidates.

500|$|Enhanced by the {{considerable}} influence of Leicester's Commonwealth, the rumours about Amy Robsart's death {{developed into a}} tradition of embellished folklore. As early as 1608, a domestic tragedy named A Yorkshire Tragedy alluded to her fall {{from a pair of}} stairs as an easy {{way to get rid of}} one's wife: [...] "A politician did it." [...] In the 19th century her story became very popular due to the best-selling novel, Kenilworth, by Walter Scott. The novel's arch-villain is again called Varney. The notion that Amy Robsart was murdered gained new strength with the discovery of the Spanish <b>diplomatic</b> <b>correspondence</b> (and with it of poison rumours) by the Victorian historian James Anthony Froude. Generally convinced of Leicester's wretchedness, he concluded in 1863: [...] "she was murdered by persons who hoped to profit by his elevation to the throne; and Dudley himself … used private means … to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently far." [...] There followed the Norfolk antiquarian Walter Rye with The Murder of Amy Robsart in 1885: here she was first poisoned and then, that method failing, killed by violent means. Rye's main sources were Cecil's talk with de Quadra around the time of Amy Dudley's death and, again, Leicester's Commonwealth. Much more scholarly and influential was an 1870 work by George Adlard, Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leycester, which printed relevant letters and covertly suggested suicide as an explanation. By 1910, A.F. Pollard was convinced that the fact that Amy Robsart's death caused suspicion was [...] "as natural as it was incredible … But a meaner intelligence than Elizabeth's or even Dudley's would have perceived that murder would make the marriage impossible." ...|$|E

40|$|In many {{historical}} analyses, imperialism {{is almost}} exclusively analysed {{from an economic}} or political perspective. Yet human decision-making is also influenced by culturally determined value-systems, which are often {{left out of the}} equation in analyses of imperialism. This thesis makes use of anthropological and sociological theories of honour to examine its relation to Dutch imperialism at the advent of the Aceh War in 1873. Two case studies are examined. The first case-study concerns politics and decision making, and assesses to what extent honour was involved in the Dutch decision to declare war on Aceh, the concomitant expedition and its aftermath. The second study concentrates on patriotic sentiments in Dutch songs. The first case-study analyses <b>diplomatic</b> <b>correspondences</b> between Governor-General J. Loudon (1824 - 1900) and the minister of Colonial Affairs I. D. Fransen van de Putte (1822 - 1902). Both were motivated by questions of honour to some extent. Loudon was far more driven by honour than Fransen van de Putte. Loudon's kind of honour was typically aristocratic and very impulsive. He considered the so-called 'Betrayal of Aceh' to be an insult both to his own, personal honour, as well as the Netherlands' national honour. Van de Putte is less impulsive. For him, the defeat of the first military expedition to Aceh was the game changer: from that moment onward, Aceh had to be conquered to redeem national honour. This complies with literature concerning loss, restoration, and preservation of honour. The second study analyses various patriotic folk-songs with regard to the war in Aceh. The kind of honour discussed in these songs is mostly military, of the aristocratic kind of honour. This complies with theories of honour insofar that the military was the one institution where this kind of honour was preserved, apart from the aristocracy. In all other layers of society, honour supposedly changed to revere not martial prowess but Christian piety instead. In all, this thesis concludes that some characteristics and transformations of honour described by the literature are demonstrated clearly by these case studies. The kind of honour described here was primarily external and reflexive in nature, and it resembled the aristocratic honour code. Honour definitely was a prominent cultural force both in the Netherlands and its overseas colonies in the Indonesian archipelago and it was a primary motivation, both for politicians to declare war on Aceh and for citizens to enlist for the army...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2012. Major: Comparative Studies in Discourse and Society. Advisor: Meredith Morgan Gill. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 284 pages. This dissertation examines the cultural {{logic of the}} Cold War, {{on both sides of}} the Iron Curtain, as a symptom of postmodern globalization. Following Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson's 1947 proclamation that Cold War propaganda should be crafted as "clearer than truth," this study investigates the complicated relationships among truth, production, and interpretation that emerged in similar manners between the U. S. and U. S. S. R. during the Cold War period. In particular, I consider literary, visual, and critical texts that contest a logic of truth which seeks to dissociate truth from its conditions of production. In so doing, I assert that a second Cold War took place between a global creative class, which has been termed "the multitude," and the (unwittingly) allied forces of the U. S. and the U. S. S. R. Accordingly, I argue that the Cold War cannot be understood simply as a battle between East and West, capitalism and communism, two world orders, or disparate modes of production. In chapter one, I explore the transition to postmodernism, as the cultural logic of late capitalism, to detail the changing conditions for aesthetic and political dissent against the neo-liberal management of American capitalism and the socialist management of Soviet state capitalism. I explore <b>diplomatic</b> <b>correspondences</b> between the U. S. and U. S. S. R. as well as a number of examples of aesthetic dissent ranging from popular magazines to Soviet subcultures to Leftist American avant-garde visual art and a ten-year old American schoolgirl's quest to discover the truth about the Cold War. In chapter two, I provide a close reading of E. L. Doctorow's The Book of Daniel, a meta-fictional, "autobiographical" novel about political life during the Cold War period. I read this text alongside Louis Althusser's autobiography, The Future Lasts Forever, to examine the complexities of locating truth that have resulted from postmodernity's complication of the distinction between subjects and objects. Chapter three presents a historical case study of how the concept of truth was contested within samizdat, the underground late-Soviet self-publishing movement. In particular, I look at Metropol, a 1979 samizdat literary anthology, which, I argue exemplifies a form of literary communism within the creative block of actually lived "communism. " The fourth and final chapter explores the autobiography of Assata Shakur [...] communist, former Black Panther, and escaped convict who writes from socialist Cuba. I argue that the complex interplay of narrative forms in her text, as well as her use of intuition as a methodology, exposes a logic of truth that is non-representational, points to similarities between late capitalist and prison temporalities, and radically remaps the discursive parameters of the Cold War...|$|R
