25|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> {{wind tunnel}} in Gottingen was {{started as a}} tool for studies of Zeppelin behavior, but that it had proven to be {{valuable}} for everything else from determining the direction of smoke from a ship’s stack, to whether a given airplane would fly. Progress at Aachen, I felt, would be virtually impossible without a good wind tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|I said to him, 'Commander of the Believers, {{was there}} some matter that troubled you this night?' And he said, 'Yes, I saw how I was {{occupied}} while governing {{the affairs of the}} community, all its black sheep and its white sheep, and <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> stranger, beggared and straying, and the poor and the needy, and the prisoners in captivity, and all like them in the far places of the earth, and I realised that God Most High would ask me about all of them, and I (Umar) would testify about them, and I feared that I should find no excuse when I was with God, and no defence with me.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{was eight}} {{years old at the time}} of the bombing and both a classmate and friend of Carol Denise McNair. On the day of the bombing, Rice was at her father's church, located a few blocks from the 16th Street Baptist Church. In 2004, Rice {{recalled}} her memories of the bombing: <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> bombing of that Sunday School at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963. I did not see it happen, but I heard it happen and I felt it happen, just a few blocks away at my father's church. It is a sound that I will never forget, that will forever reverberate in my ears. That bomb took the lives of four young girls, including my friend and playmate [...] Denise McNair. The crime was calculated, not random. It was meant to suck the hope out of young lives, bury their aspirations, and ensure that old fears would be propelled forward into the next generation.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{sat down}} and wept when <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> lost pubs of Burslem, the {{demolished}} Star that stood where the Moonglow Ballroom stands now, {{on the corner of}} the street of the Preacher and the Tote office; it was a gaunt, dark building nicknamed the Star of Bethlehem, a grimey stuccoed star the colour of years of wet smoke. From outside it looked forbidding and empty, lit only by one or two naked electric light bulbs; its doors were difficult to find, its main door {{on the corner of the}} Square had been screwed down for some reason and on the inside covered with a piece of painted plywood. Only the side-doors would let you in and these were narrow and difficult to open. One was in Queen's Street and the other in William Clowes Street, opposite the Dolphin... for all its dreary appearance, the Star was the highest drinking temple in the town; nothing has been the same since it was knocked down. No pub has been more lamented." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other singers {{joined the}} Gospelaires {{from time to}} time, {{including}} Judy Clay, Cissy Houston and Doris [...] "Rikii" [...] Troy, whose chart selection [...] "Just One Look," [...] when she recorded it in 1963, featured backing vocals from the Gospelaires. After personnel changes (Dionne and Doris left the group after achieving solo success), the Gospelaires became the recording group the Sweet Inspirations, who had some chart success, but were much sought-after as studio background singers. The Gospelaires and later the Sweet Inspirations performed on many records cut in New York City for artists such as Garnet Mimms, the Drifters, Jerry Butler, Solomon Burke and later Warwick's recordings, Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Warwick recalled, in her 2002 A Biography, that [...] "a man came running frantically backstage at the Apollo and said he needed background singers for a session for Sam [...] "the Man" [...] Taylor and old big-mouth here spoke up and said 'We'll do it!' and we left and did the session. I wish <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> gentleman's name because {{he was responsible for}} the beginning of my professional career." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 31, 2002 the Israeli {{newspaper}} Yediot Aharonot {{published an}} interview with Moshe Nissim, nicknamed [...] "Kurdi Bear", a D-9 operator {{who took part in}} the battle. Nissim said he had driven his D-9 for seventy-five hours straight, drinking whiskey to avoid fatigue, and that apart from a two-hour training before the battle, he had no prior experience in driving a bulldozer. He said he had begged his officers to let him destroy more houses and added: [...] "I didn't see, with my own eyes, people dying under the blade of the D-9 [...] and I didn't see house falling down on live people. But if there were any, I wouldn't care at all … [...] "But the real thing started the day 13 of our soldiers were killed up that alley in the Jenin refugee camp. [...] "If we had moved into the building where they were ambushed, we would have buried all those Palestinians alive. [...] "I kept thinking of our soldiers. I didn't feel sorry for all those Palestinians who were left homeless. [...] I just felt sorry for their children, who were not guilty. There was one wounded child, who was shot by Arabs. A Golani paramedic came down and changed his bandages, till he was evacuated. We took care of them, of the children. The soldiers gave them candy. [...] But I had no mercy for the parents of these children. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> picture on television, of the mother who said she will bear children so that they will explode in Tel Aviv. I asked the Palestinian women I saw there: 'Aren't you ashamed?'" [...] By Tsadok Yeheskeli, Yediot Aharonot ...|$|E
