50|$|A HP/UHP {{metamorphism}} {{caused by}} subduction at the Silurian/Devonian boundary was {{followed in the}} Devonian/Mississippian by polyphase <b>dynamometamorphism</b> due to crustal shortening. The latter developed a cross pattern in the resulting structures - the well known Variscan x. The intensive nappe-stacking during continental collision transported high-grade terranes in a southerly direction over less deformed units creating the impression of an inverted metamorphism - a feature so ubiquitous in the Massif Central. The last two deformational phases in the Pennsylvanian formed under extensional stresses and again produced a cross pattern in the resulting structures. The strong orogenic extension and final collapse triggered decompressional melting which led to pronounced granitisation and associated mineralisation mainly of the Au - Sb - W - type.|$|E
50|$|On {{account of}} the minuteness with which it has been {{described}} and the important controversies on points of theoretical geology which have arisen regarding it, the granulite district of Saxony (in the area of Rosswein and Penig) in Germany may be considered the typical region for rocks of this group. It should be remembered that though granulites are probably the commonest rocks of this country, they are mingled with granites, gneisses, gabbros, amphibolites, mica schists and many other petrographical types. All of these rocks show more-or-less metamorphism either of a thermal character or due to pressure and crushing. The granites pass into gneiss and granulite; the gabbros into flaser gabbro and amphibolite; the slates often contain andalusite or chiastolite, and show transitions to mica schists. At one time these rocks were regarded as Archean gneisses of a special type. Johannes Georg Lehmann propounded the hypothesis that their present state was due principally to crushingacting on them in a solid condition, grinding them down and breaking up their minerals, while the pressure {{to which they were}} subjected welded them together into coherent rock. It is now believed, however, that they are comparatively recent and include sedimentary rocks, partly of Palaeozoic age, and intrusive masses which may be nearly massive or may have gneissose, flaser or granulitic structures. These have been developed largely by the injection of semi-consolidated highly viscous intrusions, and the varieties of texture are original or were produced very shortly after the crystallization of the rocks. Meanwhile, however, Lehmanns advocacy of post-consolidation crushing as a factor in the development of granulites has been so successful that the terms granulitization and granulitic structures are widely employed to indicate the results of <b>dynamometamorphism</b> acting on rocks at a period long after their solidification.|$|E
40|$|The Mukodek gold {{field is}} {{discussed}} {{as an example}} proving that <b>dynamometamorphism</b> {{is a major factor}} in the formation of gold deposits in the Abchad fault zone. This deposit belongs to the gold‐silver‐ore zones of mylonitization and schistosity. The ore source is related to the original host rocks with an increased geochemical background concentration of Au. Due to <b>dynamometamorphism</b> processes, gold particles are abundant and mostly enlarged. From the primary rocks, the dynamometamorphites inherit a positive correlation between the number of particles and the concentrations of gold. The dynamometamorphic complex of the ore field developed in two stages, as a minimum. At the early stage (321. 0 ± 1. 9 Ma), the host rocks were mechanochemically deformed and transformed into the gold‐ bearing mineralized dynamometamorphites containing sericite, chlorite, ankerite, albite, and quartz. In the second stage (280 ± 15 Ma), the albite‐dolomite‐quartz ore veins were formed. Such veins have industrial gold contents...|$|E
40|$|In {{two large}} {{outcrops}} in the Polhov Gradec area basic data on development of Val Gardena Formation {{as well as}} uranium and copper mineralization were assembled and compared to those elsewhere in western Slovenia. Among new views about tectonic structure of territory the features along the fault contact between the Hrušica and Trnovo overthrusts nappes can be mentioned. They consist of a different development of Val Gardena beds and of explicit structural alterations of rocks considered a consequence of <b>dynamometamorphism...</b>|$|E
