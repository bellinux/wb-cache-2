2500|$|In fact, {{there is}} not an {{essential}} contradiction between the victory proclamations of both sides. As observed by the Spanish academic [...] Luis Suárez Fernández: [...] "But this document [...] of great importance does not contain more than the bare attribution of the victory to the Castilian arms, and doesn’t contradict in any way the reality of one part of the Portuguese army, winner of one of the [...] wings, staying on the camp and being able to retreat on the next day without being hindered. Neither is contradiction in the admission that being a <b>dubious</b> <b>business</b> it represented a very great political victory to Ferdinand and Isabella as it finished what still remained from the Juana’ s party."]] Luís Suárez Fernández- , Ediciones Rialp SA., Madrid,1989, p.178 (footnote 61).|$|E
6000|$|This {{paragraph}} gains {{point when}} one remembers that Defoe had served both Whig and Tory governments. In 1718, as letters written to Lord Stanhope {{in that very}} year testify, he was engaged in the perhaps <b>dubious</b> <b>business</b> of masquerading as a Tory, while actually {{in the service of}} the Whig ministry, to take the [...] "sting" [...] out of the more violent Tory periodicals; and he was much concerned with the danger of his ambiguous position. In December of 1717 he had been identified as a writer for Mist's Weekly Journal, the leading Tory paper, and was subjected to growing attacks in the Whig press. One can hardly doubt that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as a professional journalist.|$|E

60|$|I {{think this}} one of my great successes. I was exposed, unmasked, summoned to do a {{perfectly}} natural act which must prove my doom, and which I had not the slightest pretext for refusing. I kept my head, stuck to my guns, and, against all likelihood, here I was once more at liberty and in the king's highway. This was a strong lesson never to despair; and, at the same time, how many hints to be cautious! and what a perplexed and <b>dubious</b> <b>business</b> {{the whole question of}} my escape now appeared! That I should have risked perishing upon a trumpery question of a pourboire, depicted in lively colours the perils that perpetually surrounded us. Though, to be sure, the initial mistake had been committed before that; and if I had not suffered myself to be drawn a little deep in confidences to the innocent Dolly, there need have been no tumble at the inn of Kirkby-Lonsdale. I took the lesson to heart, and promised myself in the future to be more reserved. It was none of my business to attend to broken chaises or shipwrecked travellers. I had my hands full of my own affairs; and my best defence would be a little more natural selfishness and a trifle less imbecile good-nature.|$|E

5000|$|Having {{signed a}} formal {{recording}} contract with Cheree, Bark Psychosis immediately found themselves dismayed by management {{changes at the}} label. Cheree's two new commercial backers were later described by Sutton as [...] "a couple of cons, really, that had screwed so many people," [...] with links to various <b>dubious</b> <b>businesses</b> including pornography. The band reneged on their contract and spent a year extricating themselves from the situation, during which time Sue Page left the band. Much-needed managerial and financial support during this period {{was provided by the}} band's friend Rudi Tambala of AR Kane. Sutton has commented: [...] "That year was murder. When we were {{trying to get away from}} Cheree it was fucking hell. I had a lot of problems after that year. I was squatting and stuff and did a lot of things I shouldn't have done. It's caused a lot of problems." ...|$|R

50|$|Seagrave {{attempts}} {{to disclose the}} way these Chinese merchants do business, {{with each other and}} with others. He claims that many of these entrepreneurs, despite how many years or centuries they may have been settled in a particular country hold no real allegiance to any government or people except their ancestral clans and ‘home’ villages in China. The author also reveals some of the <b>dubious</b> and aggressive <b>business</b> practices these Lords of the Rim have adopted and mastered over the years. These tactics and their traditional work ethos go some way to explain their astonishing success in the past and up to the present day.|$|R
2500|$|According to the Department of Justice, Jowers had inconsistently {{identified}} {{different people}} as King's assassin since 1993.

40|$|Many are {{questioning}} whether KM has any {{chance to become}} a viable tool with real business applications and impact on organizations work.

5000|$|Uncle Pio acts as Camila Perichole's valet, and, in addition, [...] "her singing-master, her coiffeur, her masseur, her reader, her errand-boy, her banker; rumor added: her father."

50|$|The tabloid press {{said that}} Bignasca had made himself President for Life of the Ticino League.

50|$|In November 1804, Hippolyte Charles {{bought the}} estate of Cassan from Francois-Denis Courtillier.

50|$|Free Press of India was an Indian nationalist-supporting {{news agency}} {{founded in the}} 1920s by Swaminathan Sadanand, {{during the period of}} the British Raj.
