2500|$|Both sides {{considered}} the judgment a victory. Vivid Entertainment founder and co-chairman Steven Hirsch {{said in a}} statement that he is pleased with the decision regarding the enforcement questions, but plans to appeal the part of the ruling that upholds the measure. He stated, [...] "We won most everything we sought to be determined unconstitutional with Measure B. We are, however, disappointed the Court found it necessary to rewrite a portion of the measure in order to salvage a small portion of the measure and refused, at this time, to accept the adult industry’s own regulations by imposing an unfunded mandate upon the county by AHF." [...] AIDS Healthcare Foundation president Michael Weinstein stated, [...] "Today’s ruling that requiring condoms in porn is constitutional is just a tremendous, tremendous victory, one that will <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> safeguard the health and safety of those adult performers working in the industry." [...] Vivid filed an appeal.|$|E
2500|$|The festival has {{continued}} ever since (excepting 1941–1946 while Bowmer served in World War II), and quickly {{developed a reputation}} for quality productions. Angus Bowmer’s first wife Lois served as art director, creating both costumes and scenery during the formative years of the festival from 1935 to 1940 years. In 1939, OSF took a production of The Taming of the Shrew to the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco that was nationally broadcast on radio. The lead actress, learning {{at the last minute}} the broadcast would be to a national audience, [...] suffered a panic attack, {{was rushed to the hospital}} and the stand-in took over. The scripts didn’t arrive on the set until three minutes before air time. The Festival achieved widespread national recognition when, from 1951 to 1973, NBC broadcast abbreviated performances each year that were carried by more than 100 stations and, after 1954 on Armed Forces Radio and Radio Free Europe. The programs won favorable review from critics and for the first time people began to come from around the country. The programs led Life magazine to do a story on the Festival in 1957, bringing even more people to the plays. The NBC programs and the subsequent attention <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> explaining the mystery of how a tiny out-of-the-way timber town in the Northwest became a theatrical and tourist Mecca.|$|E

GameSpot gave it an Editor's Choice Award, praising the unique story, gameplay, {{and sense of}} humor. X-Play gave the game 5/5, citing [...] "exceptional writing, sharp satire, satisfying game progression, unique visual style, intuitive controls, and a catchy and distinctive soundtrack. Xplay also called it the third best game and best Wii game released {{in the first half}} of 2008". Cheat Code Central called the game [...] "a must-buy blast that out-shines all other third-party Wii titles to date." [...] The praise continued with notable gaming critic Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw, as he mentioned that he enjoyed the game for its satire, quirky aesthetic, and unpredictable story, despite the repetition and restrictive overworld. GamePro magazine also praised No More Heroes with a Game of the Month Award and Editor's Choice award, saying [...] "The entries for the best new character of 2008 are closed here's your winner (Travis Touchdown)" [...] and that the game [...] "easily ranks among the Wii's finest titles." [...] GameTrailers, although reviewing the game positively, found its open world to be somewhat limited, an assessment shared by IGN, who went even further, claiming it ground an otherwise exciting game to a dead halt. [...] Despite awarding the game a less positive review than others, IGN awarded it [...] "Game of the Month" [...] for January, calling it a [...] "must-play" [...] despite its flaws. Game Informer gave it one of the lowest scores, stating that [...] "the repetition and lack of substance behind the flash" [...] was among the many problems they had with the game. Nintendo Power gave it an 8/10 stating that [...] "No More Heroes's zany charm and zest for excess <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make up for its weaknesses." [...] They also listed it as the 7th best Wii game to date. No More Heroes won multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in their 2008 video game awards, including Best Story and Best Action Game. It was also a nominee for several other Wii-specific IGN awards, including Best Artistic Design, Best Voice Acting, and Best New IP. GameSpot awards this game for 2008 for its original IP and platform award. Daniel Wilks of Hyper commended the game for its [...] "very clever writing and great combat mechanics". However, he criticised it for being [...] "deliberately repetitive".' ...|$|E

Still, the fact that he could do so hurt her, and she waited in a state of painful tension.

60|$|I do {{not speak}} very confidently, because my {{researches}} in that sort were not exhaustive. I indeed visited the cathedral, not wholly because Inigo Jones {{had something to do}} in planning it, but because I had formed the habit of visiting churches in Rome, and I mechanically went into one wherever I saw it. Generally speaking, I think that they were rather bare in painting or sculpture, but they were such churches as in America one would <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see and think one's self well rewarded by their objects of interest. I do not know what defence to offer for not having visited the galleries of the Museo Civico, where by actual count in the guide-book I missed one hundred and sixty-nine works of art, though just how many masterpieces I am not able to say: probably one out of every ten was a masterpiece. But, if I did not much resort to the churches and galleries in Leghorn, I roamed gladly through its pleasant streets and squares, and by the shores of the canals which once gave it the name of New Venice, and which still invite the smaller shipping up among its houses in right Venetian fashion. The streets of Leghorn are not so straight as they are long, but many are very straight, and the others are curved rather than crooked. The longest and straight-est were streets of low dwelling-houses, uncommon in Italian towns, where each family lived under its own roof with a little garden behind, and a respective entrance, as people still mostly do in our towns. From the force of the mid-April sun in these streets I realized what they might be in summer, and, if I lived in Leghorn, I would rather live on the sea-front, in one of the comfortable, square, stone villas which border it. But everywhere Leghorn seemed a pleasant place to live, and convenient, with lively shops and cafes and trams and open spaces, and statues and monuments in them. The city, I understood, is of somewhat radical politics, tending from clericalism to socialism; and, like every other Italian city, it is full of patriotic monuments. There is a Victor Emmanuel on horseback, plump and squat, but heroic as always, and a Garibaldi struggling in vain for beauty in his poncho and his round, flat cap; there is a Mazzini, there is a Cavour, and, above all, there is a Guerrazzi, no great thing as to the seated figure, but most interesting, most touching in two of the bas-reliefs below. One represents him proclaiming the provisional government at Florence in 1849, after the expulsion of the grand-duke, where the fact is studied, with the wonderful realism of the Italians, in all its incidents and the costumes of the thronging spectators. The sculptor has hesitated at no top-hat or open umbrella; there are barefooted boys and bareheaded young girls, as well as bearded elders; if my memory serves, the scene is not without a dog or two. But it is the other relief which is so simply and so deeply affecting--the interior of a narrow cell, with one chair and a rude table, at which the patriot novelist wrote his greatest work, The Siege of Florence, and with him standing a little way from it. In spite of the small space and the almost vacant stage, the scene is full of most moving drama, and records a whole Italian epoch, now happily past forever.|$|E
