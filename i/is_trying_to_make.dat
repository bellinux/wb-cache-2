5|$|Whilst at a {{boot camp}} trip with Steph and Fernando, Steph {{believes}} Gilly has feelings for Sarah, and is unaware his feelings are for her. During the trip, after Steph, Fernando and Gilly leave, Sarah is {{killed in a}} tragic parachute jump. Gilly writes a poem for Steph, and in it, offends Fernando. When Steph reads it she is angry at Gilly, who tells her it is Rhys who has the feelings for her. Fernando punches Rhys as Gilly convinces Steph {{he had nothing to}} do with the poem. In order to make Steph jealous, Gilly kisses Cheryl who <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Calvin jealous. Despite using him, Cheryl develops true feelings for Gilly. Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson) works out that Gilly is in love with Steph. However, Gilly denies it, saying that he loves Cheryl. Cheryl catches Gilly looking at an engagement ring, which Fernando has bought for Steph. She assumes the ring is for her and tells everyone in The Dog in the Pond that she and Gilly are getting married. Gilly reluctantly goes along, not wanting to hurt her feelings. Cheryl notices the growing closeness between Gilly and Steph and confronts him. On discovering he is in love with Steph, she breaks off their engagement, at the same time Steph and Fernando break up. Gilly goes travelling with Zoe and Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst). Steph, after being told about Gilly's feelings for her, rushes after him to admit her love just as Gilly leaves. Gilly returns on 5 March with his girlfriend Jem. Steph is upset when he proposes to Jem. Steph admits her feelings to Gilly, but he decides to stay with Jem. Rhys tells Jem that Gilly still loves Steph causing them to split up. Gilly and Steph finally confess their true feelings to each other and begin a relationship.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{view is that}} Satan on each {{occasion}} <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Jesus {{commit a}} particular sin — avarice by offering power over the kingdoms of the world, gluttony by suggesting a way to relieve Jesus' hunger, and hubris by suggesting that Jesus jump and rely on angels to break his fall.|$|E

25|$|The {{schools were}} highly {{rejected}} by the more conservative Tabrizis, specially clerics, alleging that Roshdieh <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the students quit Islam, mentioning the school ring and its similarity to church bells. This resulted in mobs destroying some of his schools (which resulted in a few students being killed or injured), unsuccessful assassination attempts using guns, and later a fatwa against the modern schools, which finally resulted in him fleeing Tabriz.|$|E
25|$|The book's superscription {{claims that}} Jeremiah was active for forty years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah (627 BCE) {{to the fall}} of Jerusalem in 587. It {{is clear from the}} last {{chapters}} of the book, however, that he continued to speak in Egypt after the assassination of Gedaliah, the Babylonian-appointed governor of Judah, in 582. This suggests that the superscription <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a theological point about Jeremiah by comparing him to Moses – where Moses spent forty years leading Israel from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land, Jeremiah's forty years saw Israel exiled from the land and Jeremiah himself ultimately in exile in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Raven-Symoné {{starred in}} her first {{television}} series in four years as the main character of ABC Family's multi-camera comedy pilot State of Georgia. The project, from ABC Studios, centers on her character named Georgia, an exuberant and curvy performer from the south who <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it big as an actress in New York City. The pilot was written by author Jennifer Weiner (In Her Shoes) and Jeff Greenstein (Desperate Housewives). The series premiered in June 2011. The season concluded August 17, 2011 with twelve episodes, and ABC Family cancelled the show on September 16, 2011.

25|$|The fourth series {{features}} Nero, now in {{the main}} role, and his crew have replaced Josh and the Elmsbury gang who have all temporarily departed the series (except Isaac, who becomes Elmsmere's caretaker) and Dexter <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it as an accomplished teacher, but is given the new job {{of taking care of}} Nero's shenanigans, which indirectly resembles Josh and Nathan's relationship in the first series. The teachers who appeared in series 3, Miss Parkwood and Aine O'Brien do not appear in this series, leading to the re-introduction of former head teacher Anita Andress (Liz Hume-Dawson). The series also introduced a new main character, rebellious and cynical tomboy Clem Burton (Jade Alleyne), who joins Nero's crew as well as mysterious spray paintings of Andress appear around Elmsmere, called 'The Phantom Sprayer', however it was later revealed that it was Mr. Bell who was the criminal. A new love interest for Dexter, Science teacher Lizzie Baker (Sarah Schoenbeck), is introduced in episode one. A new recurring character, Isobel Harlow (Ruby Barnhill) appears from episode three. This series also features mini cameos from Josh's gang as shown in the series premiere and series finale. Nathan also makes his comeback in two episodes.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot and IGN named Marston the year's {{best new}} {{character}}. Marston was a nominee for character and voice acting awards at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards and 14th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. In 2013, Complex remembered Rob Wiethoff's voice acting {{performance as the}} second best in a video game. Network World stated John Marston [...] "is a complicated character, having been a bad person who <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> things right." [...] The New York Times stated that [...] " [...] and his creators conjure such a convincing, cohesive and enthralling re-imagination {{of the real world}} that it sets a new standard for sophistication and ambition in electronic gaming." [...] Marston has been included in multiple lists of top video game character traits. GamesRadar placed Marston fifth in their list of best game characters of the generation, and GameSpy called John Marston a noticeable omission from the 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer's Editions top 50 video game characters.|$|E
500|$|PepsiCo's {{acquisition}} {{was seen}} by some analysts {{as a means for}} the company to increase its soft drinks sales. PepsiCo chairman D. Wayne Calloway denied that soft drink preference was a factor in the KFC takeover. KFC management had previously given franchisees the freedom to sell any soft drinks they wanted, but PepsiCo stated that it hoped it could convince them to stock Pepsi products. Before the takeover, only 1,000 of the 6,500 KFC outlets sold Pepsi Cola, and PepsiCo switched 1,800 company-owned stores to their own soft drinks with immediate effect. The purchase of KFC by PepsiCo led to some fast food competitors switching from Pepsi to Coca-Cola. One of the first to switch was Wendy's, whose chairman, Robert Barney, stated, [...] " [...] interests are now in conflict with Wendy's and we will not support a company that <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> our customers its customers." [...] Burger King, which had switched from Coca-Cola to PepsiCo in 1983, returned to Coca-Cola in 1990, citing the growth of the PepsiCo chains as a [...] "large factor" [...] in the switch. By 1998, the majority of KFC franchisees had agreed to stock PepsiCo soft drink products.|$|E

500|$|Another {{departure}} from history comes during Victoria's coronation scene. Contrary {{to what is}} shown in the film, Albert was not present at the ceremony; the couple instead wrote letters to each other, but Fellowes felt that having them keep opening letters would be less cinematic. Furthermore, according to Fellowes, [...] "The scene where [...] <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her sign the paper when she is ill and she throws it to the floor - it's completely true", and [...] "The scene in Windsor where the King stands up and insults Victoria's mother is not only true, but about two-thirds of his speech is what he actually said!" [...] However, the Duchess of Kent was seated next to the King when he spoke and did not leave during the speech; and, undepicted in the film, the princess burst into tears, [...] "and the two parties, soon realising that they had gone too far, patched up an uneasy truce". According to Charles Greville's memoirs: [...] "The Queen [...] looked in deep distress, the Princess [...] burst into tears, and the whole company were aghast. The Duchess of Kent said not a word. Immediately after they rose and retired, and a terrible scene ensued; the Duchess announced her immediate departure and ordered her carriage, but a sort of reconciliation was patched up, and she was prevailed upon to stay till the next day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Martha {{is first}} seen in action with UNIT in [...] "The Sontaran Stratagem", where Donna Noble, the Doctor's current companion, reacts with shock asking derisively if the Doctor turns {{all of his}} companions into [...] "soldiers". The Doctor also appears to {{disapprove}} over the situation until Martha defends her intentions, reminding the Doctor that she herself does not carry a gun, and stating that she <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> UNIT [...] "better" [...] from the inside. Agyeman herself states that she was never in any worry about Martha becoming too gun-toting: [...] "I never felt any danger of that happening. At the end of Series Three, she'd struggled for a year, and travelled alone, and saw all this hardship, her family tortured... that's going to have affected her. At the same time, she's continued in her studies to become a doctor, so obviously she still has this caring side to her".|$|E
2500|$|Moira Kelly portrays Karen Roe, Lucas's mother.

It's better for me, personally, {{to have that kind of}} role, especially on that kind of show that's geared towards teenagers. There's got to be, I feel, a role model that says, 'Okay look, it seems this way right now, but it may very well be this way later. Dan abandoned Karen after she became pregnant in high school. With help from Dan's brother Keith, who in later years is her lover and father of her second child, Karen raises Lucas to strive for his best potential.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{a student}} at Kashima high school and is a classmate of Hazumu's in their second year. Tomari is Hazumu's {{childhood}} friend, so the two {{know a lot about}} each other and have many memories from the past. Hazumu would often get bullied as a child, and Tomari would have to come to his rescue, saying that she would protect him forever. After Hazumu's initial transformation, Tomari does not know what to do. Ayuki observes that Tomari liked Hazumu more as a boy, {{due to the fact that}} she has had affections for Hazumu for some time. At first, she is very annoyed that everyone around Hazumu <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her more feminine, but ultimately realizes that while Hazumu has changed physically, her personality is still the same, and therefore still the same person inside. Tomari tries to protect Hazumu from the emotional stress Yasuna caused her by rejecting Hazumu by trying to tell Yasuna to back off for the time being, but after Hazumu says she still wants to be Yasuna's friend, Tomari does not push any further.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, the {{legislature}} passed the same legislation, the Defense of Marriage Act, and expected {{the governor to}} allow it to become law without his signature. Instead, he vetoed it a second time, saying that [...] "Our laws right now prohibit same-gender marriages, and I oppose this legislation because it <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> illegal something that is already illegal". Democrats who feared the impact of having the legislation on the November ballot helped override his veto. One Democratic leader in the House said: [...] "I'll vote to override. I'll stand up and say it's a bad bill, but it's even worse to have this issue on the ballot." [...] According to the Seattle Times: [...] "Lawmakers, eager to be done with the controversial issue, rushed the ban through in minutes and dumped it in the governor's lap. Locke's veto came within the hour. Then both houses voted summarily to override the veto. No one could remember the last time a bill was passed, vetoed and overridden within hours–with almost no discussion and no debate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Callum Marsh of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} film 1 star, and wrote: [...] "Flaws—and {{there are a}} great many that would have never made the cut were this a perfectible studio recording—are {{conveniently}} swept under the rug of candid expression ... the worst quality of Les Misérables's live singing is simply that it puts too much pressure on a handful of performers who frankly cannot sing.... Fisheye lenses and poorly framed close-ups abound in Les Misérables, nearly every frame a revelation of one man's bad taste ... One would be hard-pressed to describe this, despite the wealth of beauty on display, as anything but an ugly film, shot and cut ineptly. Everything in the film, songs included, is cranked to 11, the melodrama of it all soaring. So it's odd that this kind of showboating maximalism should be ultimately reduced to a few fisheye'd faces, mugging for their close-up, as the people sing off-key and broken." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Michael Philips gave the film only one and a half stars, writing: [...] "The camera bobs and weaves like a drunk, frantically. So you have hammering close-ups, combined with woozy insecurity each time more than two people are in the frame. ...too little in this frenzied mess of a film registers because Hooper <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> everything register at the same nutty pitch." ...|$|E
