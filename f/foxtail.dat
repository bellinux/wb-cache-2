5|$|Millet cultivation: The {{discovery}} in northern China of domesticated varieties of broomcorn and <b>foxtail</b> millet from 8500 BC, or earlier, suggests that millet cultivation might have predated that of rice {{in parts of}} Asia. Clear evidence of millet began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of Cishan, Peiligang and Jiahu. Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storage pits, 80 with millet remains, with a total millet storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000kg of grain. By 4000 BC, most Yangshao areas were using an intensive form of <b>foxtail</b> millet cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging and harvesting the crop. The success of the early Chinese millet farmers is still reflected today in the DNA of many modern East Asian populations, such {{studies have shown that}} the ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout East Asia.|$|E

Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E

40|$|Pinus luchuensis MAYR can {{be found}} {{throughout}} in Okinawa Prefecture (Subtropical Zone) on the photoperiods ranging from 11 to 15 hr. The terminal buds of this pine are {{not considered to be}} induced into the winter dormant state requiring winter chilling for its release. It is considered also that the shoot growth (internode elongation) of this pine is active on the photoperiods of 14 to l 5 hr, and that leaf-primor-dia differentiation (activity of apical meristem) is active on the photoperiods of 11 to 12 hr. Therefore, on the intermediate photoperiods of 12 to 14 hr, the balance between growth and differentiation is kept on a 50 - 50 basis, and the balanced continuous shoot growth without branching (fox-tailing) is induced. In fact, a higher incidence of <b>foxtailing</b> was observed on the photoperiods of 12 and 13 hr without any special temperature control (Fig. 1 - 5 and Table 1). Under the temperature controlled conditions, however, not only photoperiod but also temperature is shown to have a great influence on inducing <b>foxtailing.</b> The highest incidence (80 %) of <b>foxtailing</b> for over 500 days was observed on 12 -hr phtoperiods at a constant temperature of 25 ℃. While no <b>foxtailing</b> was observed on 12 -hr photoperiods of a 25 ℃ day temperature (8 hr) with a 15 ℃ night temperature (16 hr) as well as on 16 hr phtoperiods at a constant temperature of 25 ℃ (Fig. 6 - 8 and Table 2). Therefore,a low incidence of <b>foxtailing</b> at high elevations and latitudes seems to result from the longer photoperiods (high latitudes) and the greater difference between day and night temperatures (high elevations and latitudes). True <b>foxtailing</b> is the balanced continuous shoot growth without branching taking place in the area with small annual and diurnal fluctuations in temperature in the Tropical Zone (photoperiods of 12 - 14 hr). In this case, both leaf-primordia differentiation and internode elongation do occur together without correlated inhibition throughout the year...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, <b>foxtail</b> millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E
40|$|Weeds are a {{major problem}} in seeding {{rangeland}} and cropland to native grasses. However, many immature weedy forbs and grasses are palatable to cattle. Research was conducted using yearling cattle for weed control in big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii var. gerardii Vitman) seedings (1987, 1988) at Mead, Nebraska on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudoll) soil. Prominent volunteer species were annual <b>foxtails</b> (Setaria spp. Beauv.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus SSL.), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.), and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.). Cattle consumed annual <b>foxtails</b> and redroot pigweed, but did not consume velvetleaf or common ragweed. Annual <b>foxtails</b> were grazed completely while heifers mainly stripped leaves and defoliated the tops of red root pigweed. Redroot pigweed and annual <b>foxtails</b> were randomly collected within blocks during both grazing seasons to quantify forage value. Foliage (upper stem and leaves) was analyzed for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD). Redroot pigweed foliage and leaves were analyzed for nitrate (N 03). Crude protein levels of annual <b>foxtails</b> and redroot pigweed were never below nutritional requirements for heifers. Fiber (NDF and AD F) and IVDMD values were similar to early-vegetative smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and early-bloom alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Nitrate concentration reached toxic levels (10, 000 ppm N 03) in redroot pigweed by mid-July, 1987. In 1988 nitrate levels exceeded the toxic level {{at the beginning of the}} grazing season. An abundance of forage nitrate accumulators in weedy vegetation limits grazing as a weed control practice. However, grazing may be an adequate weed control practice when the prominent weeds are annual grasses...|$|R

50|$|Park Yongrae’s poetic {{career was}} {{essentially}} quaratpartite.

25|$|In {{the high}} alpine country, plant {{communities}} are mostly meadows, herbs and shrubs with some scattered groves of <b>foxtail</b> pine and stunted whitebark pine. Trees often create krummholtz formations, or a stunted, deformed growth pattern characterized by branches closely hugging the ground. Talus slopes {{are home to}} small mammals such as pikas and yellow-bellied marmots. Birds such as gray-crowned rosy finches and American pipits, and sensitive amphibian species such as mountain yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite toads, feed on insects near alpine lakes and wetlands. Larger animals such as bears may venture into the alpine zone {{in search of food}} (a behavior now exacerbated by improper disposal of waste by campers), but do not winter there.|$|E
25|$|Elements {{of concern}} to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native species reintroduction, human {{recreational}} (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species. Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion. The nodding thistle weed (Carduus nutans) was discovered {{in the area in}} 2006. Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive downy brome (Bromus tectorum), creeping meadow <b>foxtail</b> (Alopecurus arundinaceus), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada. Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing. Russian olive, imported as a soil stabilizer, windbreak, and ornamental, reduces biodiversity of riparian areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Foxtails</b> can be annual or perennial. They grow in tufts. They have flat {{leaves and}} blunt ligules (a small flap at the {{junction}} of leaf and stem). Their inflorescence is a dense panicle (a branching head without terminal flower) with 1-flowered spikelets. A few, particularly A. myosuroides, are considered weeds, others are very decorative and are used in bouquets of dried flowers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Foxtails</b> are {{a problem}} {{beginning}} when the grass inflorescences begin to disarticulate, and ending when the spikelets or spikelet clusters are mechanically abraded or incorporated into the soil, turf, or leaf litter.

2500|$|Additionally, Princeton has {{a number}} of genuine secret societies; perhaps the most {{well-known}} is a chapter of St. Anthony Hall, otherwise known as Delta Psi, a co-ed literary society. [...] While membership in the Princeton chapter of Delta Psi is public, the society is known to maintain a secret president, referred to as Number One, whose identity is known only to members for the duration of his or her office. The 21 Club, an all-male drinking society, is also a notorious Princeton secret society. [...] Princeton also has a long tradition of underground societies. While secret society membership is relatively public at some schools, Princeton's historical secret society rolls are very secretive because of Woodrow Wilson's ban on clandestine organizations and his threat to expel secret fraternity members from Princeton. One such society is Phi (pronounced fē), a society dating to 1929 when members of the Whig society splintered off after the merger of the Whig and Cliosophic debating societies. Phi's membership is secretive and difficult to discern, because no more than 10 active [...] "Phis" [...] exist at one time: Phis usually receive offers {{at the end of their}} 3rd year. As an adaptation to Princeton's stringent anti-society rules, each active class does not meet the preceding class that selected it until the 1st of June (after their first Reunions and before graduation). 1.6... is the Golden Ratio, hence the name Phi. Another society is the exclusively female <b>Foxtail</b> Society, founded in 1974 soon after Princeton began admitting women in 1969. The society was founded in response to the lack of eating clubs open to women. While admittance numbers have changed over the years, the <b>Foxtail</b> selects anywhere from 10 to 15 women to become members at the end of their junior year.|$|E
