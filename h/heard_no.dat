5|$|The defense {{continued}} a {{few more}} days with testimony from a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man. A black petty officer under Delucchi testified that he had <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> derogatory remarks or conspiratorial comments and that it had been a surprise to everybody when all of the men suddenly refused to march toward the docks on August 9.|$|E

The vice-president of the Armenian Chess Federation Smbat Lputian responded that Armenia was still discussing the matter and had not decided on the matter yet. In July 2016, Lputian announced that (based upon discussion within the federation) the Armenian chess team would not participate in the Chess Olympiad.|$|E

After they protested loudly when the sentence was read, they were forcibly removed from the court. Amnesty International concluded that an appeal session on 6 September had <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> evidence to support charges. The military appeal court hearing on 28 September took a few minutes before the court upheld all the convictions. In November, the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry asked for a retrial in civilian courts, because they were convicted in military courts.|$|E

5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was <b>heard,</b> <b>no</b> fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Revie's {{reputation}} {{suffered in}} the late 1970s after his highly controversial England resignation. Both the Daily Mirror and Sunday People claimed that Revie had attempted to bribe Wolverhampton Wanderers players to lose a crucial match in May 1972. The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake's claims that Revie's captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe. Bremner sued for libel and won £100,000 libel damages, along with legal costs, after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations under oath in court. Wolves player Derek Dougan, who had scored against Leeds in the match in question, testified that he had <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> mention of the alleged bribes.|$|E
5|$|In early August, D'Oliveira {{returned}} to form with an innings of 89 against Warwickshire. Before {{the fifth and}} final England–Australia Test match, played between 22 and 27 August, Cowdrey batted at the Oval, where the match was to be played, and deduced that medium-paced bowlers would be very effective given {{the condition of the}} cricket pitch. Consequently, when the England team was chosen, he asked for a medium-paced bowler to be placed in reserve in case conditions warranted their selection. The two first-choice selections, Knight and Tom Cartwright, were unavailable, so D'Oliveira was called up by Cowdrey as a reserve on account of his bowling. On the day before the game, one of the England batsmen, Roger Prideaux, withdrew from the team, saying he had an infection. The team was duly re-arranged and the new version included D'Oliveira as a batsman. He <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> more from Oosthuizen, who was transferred from the London office soon after. The intervention of Oosthuizen became public knowledge when it was reported in the press in April 1969.|$|E

25|$|Parker {{made his}} last public {{appearances}} in 1994. By this point, {{he was a}} sick man who could barely leave his own house. On January 20, 1997, Parker's wife heard a crashing sound from the living room, and when she <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> response to her calls, she went in to find him slumped over in his chair. He had suffered a stroke.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 inquest into Menezes's death, {{passengers}} who were travelling {{in the same}} carriage also contradicted police accounts, saying that they <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> warnings and that Menezes gave no significant reaction to arrival of the policemen. One passenger said that Menezes appeared calm even as a gun was held to his head, and {{was clear that the}} police officers did not shout any warnings before shooting him.|$|E
25|$|Inside the lobby, Sweeny, District Engineer Farley and his firemen, Cain, and {{the other}} police {{officers}} eventually cleared the dress circle stairs {{to work their way}} up to the doors, where there was the connecting doorway to the family gallery stairway. They tried going up to the family gallery but were stopped by thick smoke. They <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> traffic on the stairway, <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> human sounds. They called up but received no response. Farley ordered one last inspection of the dress circle, but saw no activity. Nor was there any signs of life in the parquet and orchestra, below, now burning fiercely. To Farley the building seemed evacuated, barring, perhaps, a few stragglers. Not wanting to subject himself or others to any further risk, he ordered his men to quit the building. Within minutes, cracks appeared on the exterior theatre walls facing Johnson street, where, within, the heart of the blaze raged. At 11:45pm, less than a half hour after J. W. Thorpe had spied a flame no larger than his hand, the Johnson Street end of the building collapsed and an intense rush of air was drawn in, feeding the flames. Anyone who could speak of events transpiring within the building had already left.|$|E

25|$|The next day, Balao {{investigated}} smoke on the horizon, {{found two}} cargo ships, tracked {{them through a}} rain squall, and as she passed into clear weather, found the convoy in perfect position for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, Balao submerged {{to wait out the}} inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, Balao moored alongside Coucal and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.|$|E
25|$|After {{suffering}} from mental disorders for several years, Kiki committed suicide {{on the night}} of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a window of her fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went into {{the living room of the}} apartment to read. When she <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a window open and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an areaway behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was also living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Kiki's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.|$|E

500|$|The {{proposed}} revival {{was mentioned}} in several more letters throughout {{the autumn of}} 1875, until on 23 November Gilbert wrote, [...] "I have <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> more about Thespis. It is astonishing how quickly these capitalists dry up under the magic influence of the words 'cash down'." [...] In 1895, with Richard D'Oyly Carte struggling to rediscover success at the Savoy, he once again proposed a revival of Thespis, but the idea was not pursued. No mention of the whereabouts of the music of Thespis exists since 1897, and scholars have searched for it among many of the extant collections. Except for two songs and some ballet music, it is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|Van Beinum's {{poor health}} obliged {{him to resign}} in 1950. Sir Adrian Boult, who had been {{forced out of the}} BBC by {{internal}} politics, accepted an invitation from the LPO's managing director, Thomas Russell, to take up the principal conductorship. With Boult the LPO began a series of commercial recordings, beginning with Elgar's Falstaff, Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen with the mezzo-soprano Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven's First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by reviewers.

500|$|Although he {{had worked}} {{extensively}} in the studio for the BBC, Boult had, up to this point, recorded {{only a part of}} his large repertoire for the gramophone. [...] With the LPO he began a series of commercial recordings that continued at a varying rate {{for the rest of his}} working life. Their first recordings together were Elgar's Falstaff, Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen with the mezzo Blanche Thebom, and Beethoven's First Symphony. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by the reviewers. Of the Elgar, The Gramophone wrote, [...] "I have <b>heard</b> <b>no</b> other conductor approach [...] performance.... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably". In The Manchester Guardian, Neville Cardus wrote, [...] "Nobody is better able than Sir Adrian Boult to expound the subtly mingled contents of this master work." ...|$|E
500|$|Long since obsolete, Avnillah {{was reduced}} to a {{stationary}} ship based in Beirut in 1910, where she was tasked with providing local defense. By this time, she was armed with only four [...] quick-firing guns. In September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, initiating the Italo-Turkish War. The Italian command was concerned that Avnillah or the torpedo boat , which was also in the harbor, would attack Italian troop transports passing through the Suez Canal, and therefore decided to neutralize the vessels. On the morning of 24 January 1912, two Italian armored cruisers, [...] and [...] arrived off the port and demanded that the two ships be surrendered.

The cruisers then entered the harbor, where Giuseppe Garibaldi fired two torpedoes at Avnillah, the first of which missed and sank six civilian vessels. The second struck her amidships and sank her in the shallow water. Casualty estimates range from two officers and forty-nine enlisted men killed to three officers and fifty-five men killed in the sinking. A further eight officers and a hundred men were injured.|$|E
500|$|To get {{attention}} from club owners, Metallica recorded the Power Metal demo which featured [...] "Motorbreath" [...] {{in addition to}} the already-performed originals. The logo, displaying the band's name with the first and last letter drawn larger with sharp serifs and italicized, was designed by Hetfield. The No Life 'til Leather demo was recorded in July 1982, and it created a buzz in the underground tape trading circles. No Life 'til Leather featured a re-recorded version of [...] "Hit the Lights", which appeared on the second pressing of Metal Massacre, in addition to new songs such as [...] "Phantom Lord", [...] "Seek & Destroy", and [...] "Metal Militia". The recording and mastering was financed by Kenny Kane, owner of the punk label High Velocity, and distributed by Ulrich and his friend Pat Scott. Because of tensions with Mustaine, McGovney left the band in December. Ulrich was impressed by Cliff Burton's performance with Trauma at The Troubadour and offered to let him join the group. Burton joined on the condition that Metallica would relocate to the San Francisco area. Moving to El Cerrito in February 1983, the band stayed and rehearsed at Exodus manager Mark Whitaker's house, which they called the [...] "Metallica Mansion". Metallica intended to record its debut in Los Angeles on Slagel's independent label on an $8,000 budget. Slagel could not afford the record, and Ulrich contacted Jon Zazula, a New Jersey record store owner and promoter of heavy metal bands on the East Coast who had already <b>heard</b> <b>No</b> Life 'til Leather. Metallica rented a U-Haul truck and drove to New Jersey in late March, and upon arrival, allowed Zazula to sell copies of No Life 'til Leather to help him found Megaforce Records, because no label wanted to finance the album's recording.|$|E
