In the hoopoe, this hinge is movable that confirmed practically during the skull preparation; also in the common moorhen, the upper jaw can depress <b>downward</b> <b>relative</b> to skull. The movement of the upper jaw (depression) occurs as resulting of the contraction of pterygoid muscle complex of each bird species. The pterygoid muscles are originated from the palatine bone “pars lateralis” and insert on the lower jaw “posterior portion of the mandible”. The contraction of this muscle pulls the palatine bone backward, thereby depressing the upper jaw, as well as, adducting the mandible by elevating the anterior portion of mandible that leads to closing the beak. Physically, the naso-frontal hinge determines the ability of the gliding movement of the palatine bone beside its shape and position. The skull of kestrel have immovable naso-frontal hinge; this leads to the mechanical force which is produced during the contraction of the pterygoid muscle closing the mandible quickly to produce a strong bit force; this result agree with those mentioned by Mahmoud et al.

40|$|Adaptive metric {{utility balance}} {{is at the}} heart of one of the most widely used and studied methods for {{conjoint}} analysis. We use formal models, simulations, and empirical data to suggest that adaptive metric utility balance leads to partworth estimates that are relatively biased—smaller partworths are upwardly biased relative to larger partworths. Such relative biases could lead to erroneous managerial decisions. Metric utility-balanced questions are also more likely to be inefficient and, in one empirical example, contrary to popular wisdom, lead to response errors that are at least as large as nonadaptive orthogonal questions. We demonstrate that this bias is because of endogeneity caused by a “winner’s curse. ” Shrinkage estimates do not mitigate these biases. Combined with adaptive metric utility balance, shrinkage estimates of heterogeneous partworths are biased <b>downward</b> <b>relative</b> to homogeneous partworths. Although biases can affect managerial decisions, our data suggest that, empirically, biases and inefficiencies are of the order of response errors.

Other important processes that form precipitation are riming, when a supercooled liquid drop collides with a solid snowflake, and aggregation, when two solid snowflakes collide and combine. The precise mechanics of how a cloud forms and grows is not completely understood, but scientists have developed theories explaining the structure of clouds by studying the microphysics of individual droplets. Advances in weather radar and satellite technology have also allowed the precise study of clouds on a large scale.|$|R

Hence, the raft load is partially transferred to the pile through the pile head and partially through the negative skin friction of the upper shaft.

However, when the spores are germinated on a clinostat, the emerging rhizoids show no preferential orientation. This indicates that under normal 1 g conditions the initial growth direction of rhizoids can be oriented by gravity.

These results indicate that the growth direction of emerging rhizoids is set by gravity prior to actual emergence, and that the time of full orientation responsiveness is limited to a period ranging from the initiation of germination to about 3 - 4 h after the start of germination. There is a gravity-oriented nuclear movement beginning at about 13 h after germination, and this movement appears to predict the initial growth direction of rhizoids...|$|E

Experiment 3 shows listeners perceive a suprathreshold tone as falling along a trajectory of constant velocity when the frequency is near to the region of greatest detection as measured in Experiments 1 and 2. Further, results show greater accuracy and decreased bias in the use of velocity information with increased exposure to a constant-velocity sound. As the duration of occlusion lengthens, results also show a <b>downward</b> shift (<b>relative</b> to a trajectory of constant velocity) in the frequency at which listeners’ detection and experience of a continuous trajectory are greatest.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect <b>downward</b> <b>relative</b> to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{combination}} of generalized Procrustes superimposition (GPS) and {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) has been hypothesized to solve {{some of the problems}} plaguing traditional cephalometry. This study demonstrates how to establish the currently unclear relationship between the shape space defined by the first two principal components to the ANB angle, Wits appraisal, and GoGnSN angle, and to elucidate possible clinical applications thereof. METHODS: Digitized landmarks of 200 lateral cephalograms were subjected to GPS and PCA, after which the sample mean shape was deformed along/parallel to principal components (PC) 1 and 2, recording the ANB, Wits, and GoGnSN value at each location. Trajectories were then calculated through the PC 1 -PC 2 space connecting locations with the same values. These were finally utilized to renormalize the PC 1 -PC 2 space. RESULTS: The trajectories for the Wits appraisal were almost straight and parallel to PC 1. Those for the ANB angle were angled approximately 20 degrees <b>downward</b> <b>relative</b> to PC 1, with a more accentuated curvature. The GoGnSN curves were mildly angled relative to the PC 2 axis, their curvature increasing slightly with increasing PC 1 scores. By combining the aforementioned trajectories, it was possible to delineate the region of the PC 1 -PC 2 shape space which would be regarded as normodivergent and skeletal Class I in traditional cephalometry. Geometric distortion could be avoided by assigning patients the ANB, Wits, or GoGnSN value of the sample mean shape, deformed to the patient's position within the PC 1 -PC 2 plot. CONCLUSION: The methodology successfully relates the shape space resulting from the GPS-PCA results with traditional cephalometric variables...|$|E

Thus, each appraisee's absolute performance feedback and {{the mean of the}} distribution of absolute performance feedback are shifted upward (vs. <b>downward).</b> Yet, <b>relative</b> performance remains constant. When evaluation outcomes depend solely on relative performance, can the adoption of laxer (vs. stricter) criteria-leading to higher absolute performance feedback but no change in relative performance-influence appraisees' satisfaction with performance? Despite the ubiquity of such systems in organizations, research has not addressed this question. This article points to an important gap between practitioners' beliefs and research findings. We show that while most appraisers believe that higher absolute performance feedback will automatically result in more satisfaction with performance, the opposite may also happen. Specifically, we find that appraisees with a stronger (vs. weaker) chronic or contextual need to engage in social comparison are more satisfied with lower (vs. higher) absolute performance feedback. Overall, we demonstrate why and how feedback interventions in relative performance evaluation systems may backfire, and suggest a set of practical guidelines for maximizing appraisees' satisfaction with performance in such systems...|$|R
