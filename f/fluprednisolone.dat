40|$|In <b>fluprednisolone</b> and {{chloroprednisone}} acetate, the polarographic {{reduction of}} the carbon—halogen bond in position 6 occurs first. The carbanion—enolate formed is reduced at the dropping mercury electrode at more negative potentials than the conjugate acid. Controlled potential electrolysis at a mercury pool electrode where the carbanion—enolate can be protonated, yields the unsaturated ketone. Polarographic reduction of clobetasol- 17 -propionate and of clobetasone- 17 -butyrate results in cleavage of the C—Cl bond in the side-chain. This process is followed by {{reduction of the}} α,β-unsaturated ketone in the A-ring. Analytical methods for the determination of these compounds in ointments, creams and eye/ear drops gave results with standard deviations of 1 – 2 %...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} was determined for five prednisolone 21 -tert-butylacetate (PTBA) crystal forms, two prednisolone crystal forms, one cortisol crystal form, two <b>fluprednisolone</b> crystal forms, two 9 (alpha) -fluorocortisol acetate crystal forms, one cortisol acetate crystal form and one cortisol 17, 20 (beta) -acetonide acetate (CAA). Conformational {{analysis of these}} structures showed some unusual variations. Cortisol acetate and 9 (alpha) -fluorocortisol acetate (II) both showed an inverted A-ring. The bowing of the steroid nucleus showed some large variations between crystal forms and structurally similar steroids. The {{crystal structure}} data {{were used to determine}} which factors influenced solid state C- 13 NMR chemical shifts most significantly. Among the factors examined were conformation, crystal packing and hydrogen bonding. The C(9) carbon showed significant (3 ̆e 5 ppm) chemical shift variation between steroids with the normal versus inverted A-ring. This change was attributed to the conformational variations at the C(1) -C(10) bond. Intermolecular shielding could account for shift variations of up to 4 ppm. Hydrogen bonding had the greatest influence on chemical shift variation, accounting for variations of up to 11 ppm. Hydrogen bonding influenced the chemical shifts of carbonyl carbons and carbons conjugated with a carbonyl group exclusively. PTBA (V) and CAA are both sensitive to oxidation at the 0 (11) position in the presence of light and air. The crystal packing of PTBA(V) shows channels which can allow penetration of oxygen into the crystal lattice. CAA does not have any channels in its crystal packing and therefore its oxygen sensitivity is probably a surface phenomenon. Of twenty-one crystal forms studied, three were found to be sensitive to oxidation. ...|$|E
40|$|Acomplete {{screening}} and confirmation analytical method for the direct determination of six endogenous (cortisol, cortisone, deoxycorticosterone, tetrahydrocortisol, tetrahydrocortisone, tetrahydro-S) and 17 synthetic (amcinonide, betamethasone, desoximethasone, dexamethasone, fludrocortisone, flumethasone, flunisolide, flucinolone acetonide, flucinonide, <b>fluprednisolone,</b> flurandrenolide, fluorometholone, 6 -methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone, triamcinolone, triamcinolone acetonide) glucocorticoids in human urine by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC–MS) is presented. The analytical technique comprises a pre treatment procedure and the instrumental {{analysis of the}} trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives, performed by GC–MS (quadrupole) with electron impact (EI) ionization. The derivatization yields obtained by two different derivatizing mixtures, namely N-methyl N(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MTSFA) :NH 4 I:dithioerythritol (DTE) 1000 : 2 : 4 (usually indicated as TMSiodine); and N-trimethylsilylimidazole (TMSim) :N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) acetamide (BSA) :trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) 3 : 3 : 2, both under direct thermal heating and with microwave (MW) irradiation, were evaluated, also {{as a function of}} the temperature, of the MWì power and of the incubation time. The highest yields of the derivatization process were obtained, for most of the compounds here considered, by a two-step procedure: a microwave-assisted derivatization stage (40 min in a microwave oven at 900 Wemitted power), followed by a traditional heat transfer derivatization (1. 5 h in a thermostated bath at 70 ◦C) with the derivatization mixture TMSim:BSA:TMCS 3 : 3 : 2. In these operating conditions, diagnostic EI–MS spectra of all considered glucocorticoids were obtained. Limits of detection (LOD) of synthetic glucocorticoids in urine ranged from 3 to 25 g/l. The effectiveness of the method for the determination of glucocorticoids in urine was evaluated on spiked urine samples and on real samples obtained from patients under pharmacological treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids. Apart from the clinical monitoring of glucocorticoids in urine, the method can be applied as a complete screening + confirmation analytical protocol in antidoping tests for the detection of illicit administration of glucocorticoids by the athletes...|$|E
