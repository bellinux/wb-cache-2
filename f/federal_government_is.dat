5|$|A <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> only sensible, for Russell, when it {{has limited}} but {{well-defined}} powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E

The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E

The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> the largest funding source, providing 49.8 percent of Queen's research budget, primarily through grants. Corporations contribute another 26.3 percent of the research budget. In terms of research performance, High Impact Universities 2010 ranked Queen's 185th out of 500 universities.

Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island. Animal trafficking is a large issue, and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti-trafficking laws.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> <b>is</b> to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E

5|$|In Research Infosource's Decade in Review, McMaster was {{designated}} as the top Canadian performer in university research income growth from 1999 to 2009 in the medical doctoral category and as the second-top performer in research intensity growth for the same period. With a total sponsored research income of $324.624 million in 2015, McMaster has the eighth largest sponsored research income in the country. In the same year, Research Infosource ranked McMaster as the second most research intensive university {{in the country with}} an average research income of C$358,300 per full-time faculty member, the second highest average in the country. Its research activities exceed those of universities twice its size. The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> the largest source of funding, providing 54 percent of McMaster's research budget, primarily through grants. Corporate research income account for 35 percent of the overall research budget.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
