5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached.

The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for <b>gasses.</b> Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E

If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood <b>gasses</b> should be measured.|$|E

30|$|Natural <b>gases</b> {{were widely}} {{distributed}} in the Jiyang Depression with complicated component composition, {{and it is difficult}} to identify their genesis. Based on investigation of <b>gas</b> composition, carbon isotope ratios, light hydrocarbon properties, as well as geological analysis, natural <b>gases</b> in the Jiyang Depression are classified into two types, one is organic <b>gas</b> and the other is abiogenic <b>gas.</b> Abiogenic <b>gas</b> is mainly magmatogenic or mantle-derived CO 2. Organic <b>gases</b> are further divided into coal-type <b>gas,</b> oil-type <b>gas,</b> and biogas according to their kerogen types and formation mechanisms. The oil-type <b>gases</b> are divided into mature oil-type <b>gas</b> (oil-associated <b>gas)</b> and highly mature oil-type <b>gas.</b> The highly mature oil-type <b>gases</b> can be subdivided into oil-cracking <b>gas</b> and kerogen thermal degradation <b>gas.</b> Identification factors for each kind of hydrocarbon <b>gas</b> were summarized. Based on genesis analysis results, the genetic types of <b>gases</b> buried in different depths were discussed. Results showed that shallow <b>gases</b> (< 1, 500 Â m) are mainly mature oil-type <b>gases,</b> biogas, or secondary <b>gases.</b> Secondary <b>gases</b> are rich in methane because of chromatographic separation during migration and secondary biodegradation. Secondary biodegradation leads to richness of heavy carbon isotope ratios in methane and propane. Genesis of middle depth <b>gases</b> (1, 500 â€“ 3, 500 Â m) is dominated by mature oil-type <b>gases.</b> Deep <b>gases</b> (3, 500 â€“ 5, 500 Â m) are mainly kerogen thermal degradation <b>gas,</b> oil-cracking <b>gas,</b> and coal-type <b>gas.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{formulated}} a short-run model, with {{an explicit}} role for monetary policy, for analyzing world oil and <b>gas</b> markets.

Short-run price inelasticity could be a source for high volatility in oil and <b>gas</b> prices, and could confer to producers a temporary market power.

5|$|The Earth {{was formed}} {{approximately}} 4.5billion years ago. As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat.

Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling.

5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer <b>gasses</b> to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis.

The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955.

The gloves of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 amps of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin.
