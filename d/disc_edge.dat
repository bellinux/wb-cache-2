60|$|One morning, {{they saw}} the sun rise with a {{serenity}} and majesty which it rarely has outside of the theatre. The dawn began over that sea which was like the rumpled canvas imitations of the sea on the stage, under long mauve clouds bathed in solemn light. Above these, in the pale tender sky, two silver stars hung, and the steamer's smoke drifted across them like a thin dusky veil. To the right a bank of dun cloud began to burn crimson, and to burn brighter till {{it was like a}} low hill-side full of gorgeous rugosities fleeced with a dense dwarfish growth of autumnal shrubs. The whole eastern heaven softened and flushed through diaphanous mists; the west remained a livid mystery. The eastern masses and flakes of cloud began to kindle keenly; but the stars shone clearly, and then one star, till the tawny pink hid it. All the zenith reddened, but still the sun did not show except in the color of the brilliant clouds. At last the lurid horizon began to burn like a flame-shot smoke, and a fiercely bright <b>disc</b> <b>edge</b> pierced its level, and swiftly defined itself as the sun's orb.|$|E

The bipolar outflows in the image indicate that the system has angular momentum, which is very likely generated by an accretion disc.

5000|$|Long {{after the}} {{original}} Faraday disc had been abandoned as a practical generator, a modified version combining the magnet and disc in a single rotating part (the rotor) was developed. Sometimes the name homopolar generator is reserved for this configuration. One of the earliest patents on the general type of homopolar generators was attained by A. F. Delafield, [...] Other early patents for homopolar generators were awarded to S. Z. De Ferranti and C. Batchelor separately. Nikola Tesla {{was interested in the}} Faraday disc and conducted work with homopolar generators, and eventually patented an improved version of the device in [...] Tesla's [...] "Dynamo Electric Machine" [...] patent describes an arrangement of two parallel discs with separate, parallel shafts, joined like pulleys by a metallic belt. Each disc had a field that was the opposite of the other, so that the flow of current was from the one shaft to the <b>disc</b> <b>edge,</b> across the belt to the other <b>disc</b> <b>edge</b> and to the second shaft. This would have greatly reduced the frictional losses caused by sliding contacts by allowing both electrical pickups to interface with the shafts of the two disks rather than at the shaft and a high-speed rim. Later, patents were awarded to C. P. Steinmetz and E. Thomson for their work with homopolar generators. The Forbes dynamo, developed by the Scottish electrical engineer George Forbes, was in widespread use during the beginning of the 20th century. Much of the development done in homopolar generators was patented by J. E. Noeggerath and R. Eickemeyer.|$|E

Using blaZ PCR as the reference standard, the sensitivities of the tests for detection of penicillinase production were as follows: Cefinase disc test, 24 / 38 isolates (63 %); P 10 <b>disc</b> zone <b>edge</b> test, 34 / 38 isolates (89 %); P 10 disc diameter test, 25 / 38 isolates (66 %); P 1 <b>disc</b> zone <b>edge</b> test, 38 / 38 isolates (100 %); and P 1 disc diameter test, 38 / 38 isolates (100 %). We also found that the P 10 <b>disc</b> zone <b>edge</b> test reading was interpreted differently by the clinical laboratory and the study investigators in 11 % of instances. Our findings support those of previous studies showing that chromogenic cephalosporin-based β-lactamase tests are inferior to disc methods in detecting S. aureus penicillinase. We also conclude that the EUCAST method using the P 1 disc has the best performance, particularly because the P 1 disc zone diameter reading closely correlated with penicillinase production and reading of the disc zone diameter is less subjective than reading of the zone edge.

40|$|Observations of accreting systems often show {{significant}} variability (10 – 20 {{per cent}} of accretion luminosity) on time-scales {{much longer than}} expected for the disc regions releasing most of the luminosity. We propose an explicit physical model for disc variability, consistent with Lyubarskii's general scheme for solving this problem. We suggest that local dynamo processes can affect the evolution of an accretion disc by driving angular momentum loss {{in the form of}} an outflow (a wind or jet). We model the dynamo as a small-scale stochastic phenomenon, operating on roughly the local dynamical time-scale. We argue that large-scale outflow can only occur when the small-scale random processes in neighbouring disc annuli give rise by chance to a coherent large-scale magnetic field. This occurs on much longer time-scales, and causes a bright large-amplitude flare as a wide range of disc radii evolve in a coherent fashion. Most of the time, dynamo action instead produces small-amplitude flickering. We reproduce power spectra similar to those observed, including a 1 /ƒ power spectrum below a break frequency given by the magnetic alignment time-scale at the inner <b>disc</b> <b>edge.</b> However, the relation between the black hole mass and the value of the break frequency is less straightforward than often assumed in the literature. The effect of an outer <b>disc</b> <b>edge</b> is to flatten the spectrum below the magnetic alignment frequency there. We also find a correlation between the variability amplitude and luminosity, similar to that found in some active galactic nuclei. ...|$|E

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Abstract. We {{present an}} XMM-Newton {{analysis of the}} cataclysmic variable T Leo. The X-ray light curve shows sinusoidal variation on a period Px equal to 0. 89 + 0. 14 − 0. 10 times the previously spectroscopically determined orbital period. Furthermore, we find a signal in the power spectrum at 414 sec that {{could be attributed to}} the spin period of the white dwarf. If true, T Leo would be the first confirmed superoutbursting intermediate polar (IP). The spin profile is double-peaked with a peak separation of about 1 / 3 spin phases. This appears to be a typical feature for IPs with a small magnetic field and fast white dwarf rotation. An alternative explanation is that the 414 sec signal is a Quasi-periodic Oscillation (QPO) that is caused by mass transfer variation from the secondary, a bright region (“blob”) rotating in the disc at a radius of approximately 9 Rwd or – more likely – a travelling wave close to the inner <b>disc</b> <b>edge</b> of a dwarf nova with a low field white dwarf. The XMM-Newton RGS spectra reveal double peaked emission for the O VIII Lyαline. Scenarios in the IP and dwarf nova model are discussed (an emitting ring in the disc, bright X-ray spot on <b>disc</b> <b>edge,</b> or emitting accretion funnels), but the intermediate polar model is favoured. Supported is this idea by the finding that only the red peak appears to be shifted and the ‘blue ’ peak is compatible with the rest wavelength. The red peak thus is caused by emission from the northern accretion spot when it faces the observer. Instead, the peak at the rest wavelength is caused when the southern accretion funnel is visible just on the lower edge of the white dwarf – with the velocity of the accreting material being perpendicular to the line of sight...|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{simultaneous}} UBVR quiescent light {{curves of}} the cataclysmic variable V 2051 Oph using the Physical Parameter Eclipse Mapping method {{in order to}} map the gas temperature and surface density of the disc for the first time. The disc appears optically thick in the central regions and gradually becomes optically thin towards the <b>disc</b> <b>edge</b> or shows a more and more dominating temperature inversion in the disc chromosphere. The gas temperatures in the disc range from about 13500 K near the white dwarf to about 6000 K at the <b>disc</b> <b>edge.</b> The intermediate part of the disc has temperatures of 9000 K to 6500 K. The quiescent disc (chromosphere) shows a prominent bright region with temperatures of 10500 K around the impact region of the stream from the secondary with an extension towards smaller azimuths. The disc has a size of 0. 53 +- 0. 03 R_L 1 and a mass accretion rate of between dM/dt = 10 ^ 15 g/s to 10 ^ 17 g/s. The light curves must include an uneclipsed component, a hot chromosphere and/or a disc wind. The PPEM method allows us to determine a new distance of 146 +- 20 pc, compatible with previous rough estimates. For the white dwarf we then reconstruct a temperature of 19600 K, if the lower hemisphere of the white dwarf is occulted by the disc. We find that although V 2051 Oph {{is very similar to}} the SU UMa type dwarf novae HT Cas, OY Car and Z Cha, there must be a substantial difference in order to explain its unique light curve.
