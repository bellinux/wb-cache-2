50|$|In {{order to}} study the {{fracture}} microstructure of HIPS in a transmission electron microscope {{it is necessary to}} stain one of the phases with a heavy metal, Osmium tetroxide for example. This produces substantially different electron density between phases. Given a constant particle size, it is the cross-linking density that determines the toughness of a HIPS material. This can be measured by exploiting the negative relationship between the cis-polybutadiene content of the rubber and the crosslink density that can be measured with the swelling index. Lower crosslink density leads to <b>increased</b> <b>toughness.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the factors}} {{affecting}} the toughness of epoxy nanocomposites include the chemical identity of the epoxy curing agent, entanglement density, and interfacial adhesion.

50|$|The energy-balancing model {{applies the}} {{physical}} {{properties of the}} whole material to describe the microscopic behavior during triaxial stress. The volume stress and particle radius conditions for cavitation can be calculated, giving the theoretical minimum particle radius for cavitation, useful for practical applications in rubber toughening.Typically cavitation will occur when the average stress on the rubber particles is between 10 and 20 megapascal. The volume strain on the particle is relieved and voiding occurs. The energy absorption due to this increase in volume is theoretically negligible. Instead, it is the consequent shear band formation that accounts for <b>increased</b> <b>toughness.</b> Before debonding, as the strain increases, the rubber phases is forced to stretch further strengthening the matrix. Debonding between the matrix and the rubber reduces the toughness, creating the need for strong adhesion between the polymer and rubber phases.|$|E
5000|$|Tempering quenched-steel at {{very low}} temperatures, between 66 and 148 C, will usually not have much effect other than a slight relief {{of some of the}} {{internal}} stresses. Tempering at higher temperatures, from 148 to 205 C, will produce a slight reduction in hardness, but will primarily relieve much of the internal stresses. Tempering in the range of 260 and 340 C causes a decrease in ductility and an increase in brittleness, and {{is referred to as the}} [...] "tempered martensite embrittlement" [...] (TME) range. Except in the case of blacksmithing, this range is usually avoided. Steel requiring more strength than toughness, such as tools, are usually not tempered above 205 C. Instead, a variation in hardness is usually produced by varying only the tempering time. When <b>increased</b> <b>toughness</b> is desired at the expense of strength, higher tempering temperatures, from 370 to 540 C, are used. Tempering at even higher temperatures, between 540 and 600 C, will produce excellent toughness, but at a serious reduction in the strength and hardness. At 600 C, the steel may experience another stage of embrittlement, called [...] "temper embrittlement" [...] (TE), which occurs if the steel is held within the TE temperature range for too long. When heating above this temperature, the steel will usually not be held for any amount of time, and quickly cooled to avoid temper embrittlement.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the edge}} cools fast a diffusionless {{transformation}} occurs, turning the austenite into very hard martensite. This requires a temperature drop from around 750 °C (cherry-red) to 450 °C (at {{which point the}} transformation is complete) {{in less than a}} second to prevent the formation of soft pearlite. Because the rest of the blade cools slowly, the carbon in the austenite has time to precipitate, becoming pearlite. The diffusionless transformation causes the edge to [...] "freeze" [...] suddenly in a thermally expanded state, but allows the back to contract as it cools slower. This typically causes the blade to bend or curve during quenching, as the back contracts more than the edge. This gives swords like katana and wakizashi their characteristic curved shapes. The blade is usually straight when heated but then bows as it cools; first curving toward the edge as it contracts, and then away from the edge as the spine contracts more. With slashing-type swords, this curvature helps to facilitate cutting, but increases the chances of cracking during the procedure. Up to one third of all swords are often ruined during the quenching process. However, when the sword does not crack, the internal stresses created help increase the toughness of the blade, similar to the <b>increased</b> <b>toughness</b> in tempered glass. The sword may need further shaping after quenching and tempering, to achieve the desired curvature.|$|E
