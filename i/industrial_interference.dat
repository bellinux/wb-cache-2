Commonly, these differences are explained by diverging economic developments, varying political systems and preferences and <b>industrial</b> <b>interference.</b> The empirical estimations reported in this paper, however, suggest another reason: The more a step towards full competition in the electricity sector reduces the tax revenues generated by this industry, the less likely is its implementation. We conjecture that this relationship is especially caused by the persistent financial dependency of regulatory decision-makers on governments, which results in authorities that shrink from reforms which reduce the executive’s and hence their own financial ressources. In this case, a clear delineation of a regulator’s budgetary interests from its regulatory goals is vital to achieve the latter. JEL-classification: Keywords...|$|E

In large <b>industrial</b> facilities, <b>interference</b> between neighboring networks {{is a major problem}} that can be mitigated by reducing the radio transmission power to the necessary minimum. However, reliability of the network should not be compromised even in spite of packet loss bursts. In this paper we aim at keeping the link within certain burstiness bounds while still minimizing the transmission power. We present evaluation results showing that the burstiness changes with the receiver signal strength. Based on this observation we present two mechanisms for dependable wireless sensor networks and study the performance in our testbed. I...|$|R

The sensitivity of radio astronomical receivers and their interference limits are outlined. EMC above 30 MHz {{is a serious problem}} for Radio Astronomy. Interferer (CISPR) and victim (ITU-R RA 769) standards are not harmonised. The emissions from the interferer and their spectral characteristics are not defined sufficiently well by CISPR standards. The required minimum coupling losses (MCL) between an industrial device and radio astronomical antenna depends on device properties but is shown to exceed 140 dB in most cases. Spatial separation of a few km is insufficient on its own, the terrain must shield > 30 – 40 dB, additional mitigations such as extra shielding or suppression of high frequency emissions may be necessary. A case by case compatibility analysis and tailored EMC measures are required for individual installations. Aggregation of many weak rfi emitters can become serious problem. If deployment densities are high enough, the emission constraints can even exceed those for a single interferer at a short distance from the radio observatory. Compatibility studies must account not only for the single interferer but also for many widely distributed interference sources...|$|E

(CTI). The pultruded RP profiled sections were designed specially for composite materials to compete with and replace conventional materials. These sections were made competitive by tailoring the geometry, advantageously placing fibers, and controlling the load path to overcome stiffness and engineering limitations, erection costs, and life-cycle costs. As with conventional structural materials such as steel and prestressed concrete, RP has definite predictable and measurable performance characteristics. Extensive laboratory, university, and field testing for long-term effects of deflection, bending, shear, buckling, and temperature has enabled CTI to simulate and evaluate the performance, projected through the warranteed period of twenty-five years. As {{a result of the}} test program, these RP structural components maximize the perfor-mance potential of both RP and the pultrusion process for civil engineering structural ap-plications.

The soundings were deployed in a cross-strike profile bisecting the basin along one of its thickest sub-basins and extending over mountain plateaus to the southeast and the northwest. Occurrences of numerous alkaline plugs and aligned tectonic grabens {{in the region are}} records of intense Mesozoic-Cenozoic tectonic activity. MT analysis techniques were used to evaluate data quality, infer strike direction, and correct for near-surface distortion. As the studied area is located only some tens of kilometers away from the Atlantic Ocean and {{in one of the most}} densely populated regions of the country, the data are severely distorted by <b>industrial</b> <b>interference</b> and the coast effect. Because of such effects, the data are modelled using a 2 D inversion scheme within periods shorter than 0.1 s for the Taubaté Basin sites and shorter than 1 – 10 s for the off-basin sites, the latter depending on the distance of the site from the coast. The main result observed in the modelling is the identification of a conducting zone below 10 km depths beneath the region. There is poor resolution in the data of structures below this conductor, which is also not imaged beneath the basin. Studies carried out in different tectonic regions of the world have also reported conductive layers at about the same depth but in the studied area it is impossible to reach any conclusion about the total conductance of the layer with the available MT data.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the coal}} {{industry}} in Australia continues to expand and chase improvements in technology, equipment, training and safety, the industry still suffers from underground incidents which have tragic consequences for individuals and families. The responsibility is for all stakeholders, employers, employees and support agencies to remove causes and behaviors which create such incidents. This will make underground coal mining safer for all personnel. The fundamental mind set to safety perfomlance has changed dramatically over the last 15 years. During the early 19802 ̆ 7 s, the recognition was made that the industry safety perfomlance was ve:ry poor. At {{the end of that}} decade and by the early 19902 ̆ 7 s many large companies, together with government and the unions were supporting safety training programs to reduce Lost Time Injuries -the high level measure of safety. These programs produced varying levels of success, but developed a sceptism amongst some parts of the industry where the reslllts were managed, not the risks. A few incidents occurred in the early to mid 19902 ̆ 7 s which showed that the rate of change and the approaches to the management of safety were not good enough. The industry started to look at Risk Management and the need to formally quantify the risks, controls and protection to improve safety performan(;e. The Wardens Inquiry into the accident at Moura No. 2 in 1994 highlighted the need to review rescue operations for persons underground. A coal industry committee, already set up to review the fundamentals of coal mines rescue, was given the task to review escape and rescue options by the Queensland Chief Inspector of Coal Mines. The committee consisted of a broad cross section of major stakeholders of the NSW and Queensland coal industry. The process of review was fundamental, exhaustive and widespread in its scope. It was clearly appreciated by all the committee members that escape and rescue options for mine personnel could be substantially updated and improved. The mind set previously held, That mines rescue was the calvary charging over the will to rescue people, needed to be changed in response to recent major incidents. This change would encompass the techniques, equipment, design of mines aJrld the role of the rescue service. The work has taken 2. 5 years to get to this stage and will require the stakeholders in this industry to implement the recommendations, complete R and D projects and participate in the infonnation sharing that will be necessary to sustain these improvements. I would like to thank all those who have contributed including the sub committee participants.

30|$|The Schumann {{resonances}} (SR) are electromagnetic oscillations of the Earth-ionosphere cavity at {{frequencies of}} 7.8, 14, 20, 26, 33, 39, and 45  Hz. The long-term {{monitoring of the}} Schumann phenomenon has recently drawn attention, not least from the space-geophysics community [1 – 3]. SR measurements and analysis provide information on the planetary thunderstorm activities, the properties of lower ionosphere layers, the Earth surface and atmosphere temperature variations, and the properties of earthquakes {{as well as on}} the studies of other celestial bodies [4 – 9]. Consequently, increased interest has been shown by the scientific community on the methods and techniques employed in SR experimental detection. The detection of SR is a complex procedure that employs the limited energy generated and dissipated by the global lighting activity. This total energy is then smeared inside the huge volume of the Earth-ionosphere cavity, providing electric and magnetic field components. The prevailed electric component is vertically oriented, and the corresponding amplitude is close to 10 − 7  V/m. The magnetic field exhibits two horizontally potential components at N-S and E-W orientation with amplitudes of few tenths of picotesla. The detection of such weak electromagnetic fields in noisy environments is too difficult. Additionally, hardware imperfections can significantly reduce the performance of the system [10, 11]. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it is necessary to use specialized sensors and electronic equipment [12]. Especially, in the ELF band, where Schumann resonances lie, very few works give details about measurement equipment used regarding electrical and magnetic antennas, the analog front-end, and the data acquisition module [13]. In the observation system of ULF/ELF emissions at Nakatsugawa, the signal observed by the N-S sensor (each coil consists of perm alloy of 1.2  m long with 100, 000 turns of the copper wire) is fed to a preamplifier, then to a low-pass filter of 10 and 30  Hz and main-amplifier, stored on DL- 708 data recorder and saved on a hard disk. Summarized values of the induction coils, the amplification, and filtering are given for the observation system of ULF/ELF emissions at Nakatsugawa [14]. Two research teams from Mexico have developed a Schumann resonance station with two inductive antennas. Details about the structure and development of the magnetic antenna are given. This station measures the first three harmonics [15]. In SR observatories in southwestern China, the frequency band of the instruments is about 3 – 29  Hz (in the range of 3  dB), and the sampling frequency is 100  Hz. There is a notch filter at 50  Hz to suppress <b>industrial</b> <b>interference</b> in the electronics part of [16]. Details and a block diagram, concerning associated electronics, of the TNB Antarctica Schumann measurement platform are presented by a research team from Italy [17]. In the Schumann station located at Calar Alto (Spain), modes are captured through the 2 -m magnetic antenna with an acquisition time of 30  min. Characterization of the sensor and detailed description of the amplification system are also presented [13]. The magnetometers, noise of the system, and the ELF measurement station that has been deployed in Sierra Nevada (Spain) are described and discussed by five research teams from Spain and Sweden [18]. The technical setup of the Hylaty geophysical station with a frequency range up to 300  Hz, as well as the design of ELF equipment, including antennas and receivers, is discussed by three research teams from Poland [19]. In this paper, a versatile receiver for SR detection and monitoring is presented. The SR detection and monitoring system is portable, low-cost, battery-powered, autonomous for nearly 45  days’ time, and able to measure up to six SR harmonics. The system, which consists of the induction coil antenna and the amplifying and filtering chain as well as the data acquisition and processing system, was designed and implemented entirely in the Electronics-Telecommunications and Applications Lab (ETA Lab) of the Physics Department of the University of Ioannina. The constructed magnetic field antenna is much smaller than the antennas described in the literature with cores 0.8 – 2  m long and a diameter of a few centimeters. The magnetic field antenna is implemented by two back-to-back identical induction coils [20] which are presented in detail and discussed in the following section. Moreover, the filtering and amplification chain exhibits an experimentally measured total passband gain equal to 410, 000 or 112  dB (at 10  Hz). The preliminary induction coil sensor antenna design has already been presented and described [21]. The design and implementation stages of the induction coil sensor were based on the fact that the induction core should avoid saturation due to external electromagnetic fields which were mostly originated from 50 -Hz power lines. Therefore, the SR measuring equipment was installed in relatively low “EM pollution” areas. In order to evaluate the portable SR system, measurements were acquired at various spots which were located at 1 -km far distances from man-made electromagnetic pollution in the area of Northwest Greece. From these measurements, it is obvious that up to six harmonics can be detected within 10 -min acquisition time. Schumann resonance is a global phenomenon with numerous applications and many open questions [22]. As already mentioned, there is a very limited number of ELF measurement stations around the globe, based on synchronous electronic methodologies and techniques of signal reception, conditioning, and processing. The contribution of this new ELF Schumann resonance receiver includes (a) signal conditioning stages with an equivalent input noise as low as 2.88  nV/√Hz and a total passband gain from 86 to 112  dB at 10  Hz, (b) monitoring and recording of six SR harmonics through a two back-to-back magnetic field antenna with total weight of 2.2  kg and 60  cm length, and (c) portability and over one and half month autonomy. Furthermore, discussion and detailed analysis of the efficient induction coil magnetic antenna and the low-noise amplifying-filtering chain through this work could motivate other researchers to create new and improved ELF measurement stations. The implemented induction coil antenna is presented and discussed in Section 2. The filtering and amplification chain we developed is extensively described in Section 3. Experimental results are present in Section 4, and finally, the article concludes with Section 5.|$|E

We further analyze the spatial correlation and the factors influencing the utilization efficiency using spatial panel data models. The results show that water utilization efficiency in China differs between provinces and regions. For example, water utilization efficiency in the eastern coastal provinces is significantly higher than that of inland provinces. The pattern of spatial auto-correlation Moran’s I index presents significant spatial auto-correlation and evident cluster tendencies in China’s inter-provincial water utilization. Factors that contribute to water utilization efficiency include economic development, technological progress, and economic openness. Negative factors affecting water utilization efficiency arise from <b>industrial</b> structure, government <b>interference,</b> and water resources endowment. In addition, the price of water resources is insignificant. The improvement of water utilization efficiency is essential to sustainable economic development.

40|$|The main {{types of}} faults {{studied in the}} {{literature}} are commonly categorized as electrical faults and mechanical faults. In addition to well known faults, {{the performance of a}} diagnostic algorithm and its operational reliability in harsh environments has been another concern. In this work, the reliability of an electric motor diagnosis signal processing algorithm itself is studied in detail under harsh industrial conditions. Reliability and robustness of the diagnosis has especially been investigated under 1) potential motor feedback error; 2) noise interference to a diagnosis-relevant system; 3) ease of implementation; and 4) universal application of diagnostic scheme in industry. Low cost and flexible implementation strategies are also presented. 1) Signature-based diagnosis has been performed utilizing the speed feedback information which is used to determine fault characteristic frequency. Therefore, feedback information is required to maintain high accuracy for precise diagnosis which, in fact, is not the case in a practical industrial environment due to <b>industrial</b> noise <b>interferences.</b> In this dissertation, the performance under feedback error is analyzed in detail and error compensation algorithms are proposed. 2) Fault signatures are commonly small where the amplitude is continuously being interfered with motor noise. Even though a decision is based on the signature, the detection error will not be negligible if the signature amplitude is within or close to the noise floor because the boundary noise level non-linearly varies and, hence, is quite ambiguous. In this dissertation, the effect of noise interference is analyzed in detail and a threshold design strategy is presented to discriminate potential noise content in diagnosis. 3) The compensating procedure of speed feedback errors and electrical machine current noise, characteristics which are basically non-stationary random variables, requires an exhaustive tracking effort. In this dissertation, the effective diagnosis implementation strategy is precisely presented for digital signal processor (DSP) system application. 4) Most of the diagnosis algorithms in the literature are developed assuming specific detection conditions which makes application difficult for universal diagnosis purposes.
