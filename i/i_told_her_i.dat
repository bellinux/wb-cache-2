500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{her fifth}} album, Ciara {{contributed to both}} the writing and {{production}} of the album's songs. She wrote [...] "Sweat" [...] (featuring 2 Chainz), a song that was originally {{supposed to be the}} album's first single when the album was called One Woman Army. Ciara also co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sorry", the song that was chosen to supersede [...] "Sweat" [...] as one of One Woman Armys two lead singles, along with [...] "Got Me Good", also written by Ciara. None of these records made the final album. [...] "Sorry" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Jasper Cameron, who previously worked with Ciara on her 2006 single [...] "Promise" [...] and 2009 single [...] "Never Ever". Together the duo wrote and produced [...] "Super Turnt Up" [...] which did make the final listing for Ciara. [...] "Got Me Good" [...] was co-written with Rodney Jerkins and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waith). When interviewed by Rap-Up TV, Jerkins said [...] "I had a meeting with her about what her future holds and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was there if she ever needed my creative juices, so hopefully me and her get in the studio and work." [...] Jerkins previously produced records for [...] and Fantasy Ride.|$|E
2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wanted her to sound like a rock and roll queen on itâ€“she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{as we went}} on to {{the corner}} together, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> why <b>I</b> did it, and {{recalled}} the car-ride.|$|R
60|$|Rectus couldn't; but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> {{understood}} the language tolerably well, {{and asked her}} why she wished to know.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> thanked <b>her</b> and accepted. She {{was curious}} {{to hear about}} Asquith and its people, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>I</b> knew.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> {{was ready}} to explain my self, if she would give me her Word, she would not resent it, and would take nothing ill.|$|E
6000|$|... "So do I, {{but not so}} much as I {{thought at}} that time, and--oh, surely that is not Rachel Curtis? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> thought you would call." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> {{had met her}} on Saturday last, {{had been}} so {{fortunate}} as to render her a trifling service, and was come now on the young lady's invitation.|$|E
60|$|EILEEN. No, that didn't {{amount to}} anything. She seemed mad because <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so little. <b>I</b> think she guessed <b>I</b> only <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>I</b> did so she'd {{let me stay}} up, maybe--your last day,--and {{to keep her from}} {{thinking}} what she did--about us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother {{took the}} oranges {{out of the}} knapsack, and then I pulled it up again. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> had plenty more for myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly remember. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what <b>I</b> {{thought would}} please her. I've been in Florence a week. I hoped {{you would come}} to see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kilcullen. [...] "I have bid {{her good}} bye. But give her my kindest love, {{and tell her}} that I did what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> would do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mrs. Somers!' she whispers, {{her eyes}} poppin'. 'Are you crazy?' An' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> shore wasn't crazy an' I shore was sober. An' thet my name wasn't Moran, but Somers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grandfather, {{this letter}} is from my aunt. She wishes me to go and live with her and prepare for the stage. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wished to do so. I am going." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> as <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> Major Fitz-David, that I {{had reason}} to think Mr. Dexter's advice might be of real {{assistance}} to me at starting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help it, George! Don't you be popping your ugly head {{so close}} to my ears, Gumbo! After what has passed between us, I am bound in honour to stand by her. If she sees no objection, I must find none. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that Madam would be very rusty at first; but {{that she was very}} fond of me, and must end by relenting. And when you come to the property, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> knew my dearest George so well, that I might count upon sharing with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> persisted; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> greatly desired {{that she}} should speak a few {{sentences}} in Burmese into my instrument. I had a certain reason for this which I would explain afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I met {{the owner}} in Rome last winter. It {{belongs to a}} Mrs. Craddock, and when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was looking out for a house, she {{suggested}} that I should come and see this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{no doubt}} you will too. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> should come to you, {{and she did not}} object. I think she was glad to be saved {{broaching}} the subject, for she is half ashamed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she doesn't think that I {{care much about}} it. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> did it all of a heap, you see; and I fancy she thought I was just mad at the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} too," [...] Mr. Armstrong agreed; [...] "and now {{let us go}} in. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> should speak to you this evening, and she must be waiting anxiously for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} lied {{to all of}} them," [...] she replied. [...] "I will have told them all that <b>I</b> had plenty. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> too. <b>I</b> could not be {{lowering}} James More to them." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> {{coloring}} as <b>I</b> spoke. But {{she laid}} a kindly hand upon my shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "I gave Aunt Mary {{her gift}} this morning. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> wasn't going to Murraybridge, that I just meant {{to stay home}} with her. She was so glad--and I'm glad, too, now that I've decided so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} are; Cousin Marilda, in a bonnet like a {{primrose}} bank, is {{to pick up}} Fernan somewhere, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was too true to my principles to let wild horses drag me there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She wouldn't {{go in the}} parlour, {{but come}} right out here in her fine clothes. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> didn't think she belonged in a kitchen--but I guess I did her an injustice," [...] said Euphrasia, slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] Mary assured him, laughing. [...] "It {{was one of}} the first things she mentioned. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> should ask any one to tea I liked she was {{positively}} indignant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My sister," [...] she answered. [...] "It {{was to try}} {{and save}} <b>her</b> life that <b>I</b> wanted the money. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> could not get it, she gave up and died. Your uncle killed her. Come." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fanny's good-humoured face cleared up. 'Yes, ma'am, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> {{was quite}} sure that Miss Gillian would not go for to do {{anything}} wrong, {{and that it could}} be easy explained; but people has tongues, you see.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll do that," [...] said David. [...] "He did it last time. My dear missis could scarce {{believe her}} ears when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> was converted, or {{her eyes when}} she saw the Bethel-flag and the temperance pledge." ...|$|E
60|$|It is easy {{to judge}} what a fright I was in upon this occasion, and it was {{impossible}} for my governess ever to bring me to dress in that disguise again; for, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> should certainly betray myself.|$|E
6000|$|Clementina's face brightened. She wanted {{very much}} to go. She should meet some {{pleasant}} people; she always did, at Miss Milray's. Then the light died out of her gay eyes, and she set her lips. [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, it ain't anyways in the {{neighbourhood}} of a {{third of}} what you are worth,' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> 'And <b>I</b> don't think Uncle Cal is too sick to hear a little agitation of the piano-keys just to christen the machine.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> if <b>I</b> {{found you}} really {{intended}} it, and had time, I would {{ask you to}} drive to her with me this morning, and then no one need know anything about it,' he said, almost with tears in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> why <b>I</b> had come, as respectful and earnest as <b>I</b> could. And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{everything}} about myself, and what I was making, {{and how that}} all I asked was just to get acquainted with her {{and try to get}} her to like me.|$|R
