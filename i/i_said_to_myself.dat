In January 1961, he {{traveled}} to New York City, to perform there and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie, who was seriously ill with Huntington's disease in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.

[...] "No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was {{until they got}} in the ring with him", Jacobs said. The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative.
