5000|$|Chemicals are {{regulated}} under various laws including the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In 2010, Congress was considering {{a new law}} entitled the Safe Chemicals Act. Over the following several years, the Senate considered a number of legislative texts to amend the TSCA. These included the Safer Chemicals Act, several versions of which were introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), with the latest in 2013, and the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (S. 1009, CSIA) introduced by Senators Lautenberg and David Vitter (R-LA) in 2013. Senator Lautenberg died shortly after CSIA's introduction, and over time his mantle {{was picked up by}} Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), who continued to work with Senator Vitter on revisions to the CSIA. The result of that effort was the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, passed by the Senate on December 17, 2015. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Modernization Act of 2015 (H.R. 2576), passed the House of Representatives on June 23, 2015. Revised legislation, which resolved differences between the House and Senate versions, was forwarded to the President on June 14, 2016. [...] President Obama signed the bill into law on June 22, 2016. The Senator's widow, Bonnie Lautenberg, was present at the White House signing ceremony.

40|$|Dapsone (DDS) (4, 4 ` diaminodiphenylsulfone), {{the drug}} of choice for the {{treatment}} of leprosy, frequently induces hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. N-hydroxylation, one of the major pathways of biotransformation, has been constantly related to the methemeglobinemia after the use of the drug. In order to prevent the dapsone-induced hemotoxicity, N-acetylcysteine, a <b>drug</b> <b>precursor</b> of glutathione, was administered in combination with DDS to male Wistar rats, weighting 220 - 240 g. The animals were then anaesthetized and blood was collected from the aorta for determination of plasma DDS concentration by HPLC, determination of methemoglobinemia and glutathione by spectrophotometry, and for biochemical and hematological parameters. Our results showed that N-acetylcysteine enhanced dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia due to increased dapasone plasmatic concentration and consequent increased N-hydroxylamine formation. We concluded that drug interactions with dapsone require individually studies in order to avoid undesirable effects of dapsone...|$|R
50|$|Amphetamine is {{a potent}} central nervous system (CNS) {{stimulant}} of the phenethylamine class that is approved {{for the treatment of}} attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine refers to equal parts of the enantiomers, i.e., 50% levoamphetamine and 50% dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine is also used as a performance and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. Although it is a prescription medication in many countries, unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine is often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with uncontrolled or heavy use. As a consequence, amphetamine is illegally synthesized by clandestine chemists, trafficked, and sold. Based upon <b>drug</b> and <b>drug</b> <b>precursor</b> seizures worldwide, illicit amphetamine production and trafficking is much less prevalent than that of methamphetamine.|$|R
40|$|Many {{drugs and}} <b>drug</b> <b>precursors</b> found in natural organisms are rather {{difficult}} to synthesize chemically and to extract in large amounts. Metabolic engineering is playing {{an increasingly important}} role in the production of these drugs and <b>drug</b> <b>precursors.</b> This is typically achieved by establishing newmetabolic pathways leading to the product formation, and enforcing or removing the existingmetabolic pathways toward enhanced product formation. Recent advances in system biology and synthetic biology are allowing us to performmetabolic engineering at the whole cell level, thus enabling optimal design of a microorganism for the efficient production of drugs and <b>drug</b> <b>precursors.</b> In this review, we describe the general strategies for themetabolic engineering ofmicroorganisms for the production of drugs and <b>drug</b> <b>precursors.</b> As successful examples of metabolic engineering, the approaches taken toward strain development for the production of artemisinin, an antimalarial drug, and benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, a family of antibacterial and anticancer drugs, are described in detail. Also, systems metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of L-valine, an important drug precursor, is showcased as an important strategy of future metabolic engineering effort. drug productionMetabolic engineerin microorganisms: genIntroduction Since the advent of recombinant DNA technology, genetic engi...|$|E
