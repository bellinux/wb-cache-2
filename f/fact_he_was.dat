5|$|Although Keynes {{has been}} widely criticised – {{especially}} {{by members of the}} Chicago school of economics – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in <b>fact</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure {{to meet the needs of}} exceptional circumstances.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in <b>fact,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E
5|$|Two {{successive}} inquiries {{failed to}} find evidence against Clayton. The legislature refused to continue, all charges were dropped, and Clayton was exonerated. In <b>fact,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> never found guilty of any wrongdoing while governor. Finally a deal was reached. Johnson, now politically badly damaged by his impeachment ordeal and willing to take any position he could get, resigned as lieutenant governor, was appointed Secretary of State, and was given a compensation of several thousand dollars for his loss of power and prestige, since he would not become governor. A staunch Clayton supporter, O.A. Hadley, was then appointed lieutenant governor. Three days later, Clayton left the state for Washington, D.C., to join the US Senate, and Hadley succeeded him as governor.|$|E

5|$|Bradford {{opened the}} scoring after only eight {{minutes of the}} match through teenage {{hometown}} midfielder Hamilton. A long pass from Huxford down the right flank was headed by Shutt into Hamilton's path. He beat three defenders and, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> stumbling, shot past Notts County goalkeeper Ward, with the ball going in after hitting the crossbar. It had been Bradford's first shot of the game. Steve Finnan had County's first chance after 14 minutes but shot straight at Bradford keeper Jonathan Gould. Minutes later, City had two successive chances through Shutt and Youds, but the first was blocked and the second went wide. During this spell of play, County's two central defenders Murphy and Gary Strodder both received yellow cards. Just before half-time, Shutt {{had the chance to}} double City's lead but his weak shot hit Ward's ankles after good work by Kiwomya.|$|E
5|$|Through June 12, Zito was 7–2 with a 3.10 ERA. After {{a strong}} {{start to the}} season, Zito regressed down the stretch, going 2–12 with a 4.97 ERA {{the rest of the}} way. He {{finished}} the season 9–14 with a 4.15 ERA, snapping a streak of nine straight seasons in which he had 10 or more wins. In a rotation featuring Tim Lincecum, Matt Cain, Jonathan Sánchez, and Madison Bumgarner, Zito was the odd man out for the playoffs. In <b>fact,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> left completely off the Giants' 25-man active roster for the postseason. Zito worked out throughout the playoffs so that he would be ready to join the roster in case of an injury, but he was never needed and remained on the secondary squad. Nevertheless, he won his first World Series ring {{as a member of the}} full roster.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Schindler {{had spent}} his entire fortune on bribes and black-market {{purchases}} of supplies for his workers. Virtually destitute, he moved briefly to Regensburg and later Munich, but did not prosper in postwar Germany. In <b>fact,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reduced to receiving assistance from Jewish organisations. In 1948 he presented a claim for reimbursement of his wartime expenses to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and received $15,000. He estimated his expenditures at over $1,056,000, including the costs of camp construction, bribes, and expenditures for black market goods, including food. Schindler emigrated to Argentina in 1949, where he tried raising chickens and then nutria, a small animal raised for its fur. When the business went bankrupt in 1958, he left his wife and returned to Germany, where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures, including a cement factory. He declared bankruptcy in 1963 and suffered a heart attack the next year, which led to a month-long stay in hospital. Remaining in contact with many of the Jews he had met during the war, including Stern and Pfefferberg, Schindler survived on donations sent by Schindlerjuden from all over the world. He died on 9 October 1974 and is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, {{the only member of the}} Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. For his work during the war, in 1963 Schindler was named Righteous Among the Nations, an award bestowed by the State of Israel on non-Jews who took an active role to rescue Jews during the Holocaust. Other awards include the German Order of Merit (1966).|$|E

5|$|Jim Ross, {{one of the}} draftees, {{was unaware}} he was to switch brands during the draft. After the draft, Ross {{was on the verge}} of quitting his job as a {{commentator}} for WWE, as he was angry at the <b>fact</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> leaving the Raw brand, where he had commentated for over ten years. Ross stated on his official blog that he was about to quit WWE, but he decided to continue to work for the company and make the best of working on SmackDown. After the Draft, the ECW brand was left without a world championship, after the ECW Champion Kane was drafted to Raw. As a result of pre-draft stipulations, champions took their championships to their new brand and made them property of that brand. SmackDown, however, lost their secondary championship, after United States Champion Matt Hardy was drafted to the ECW brand, in the process making the title ECW property, but gained another top-tier championship when WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand, in the process making the title SmackDown exclusive for the first time since 2005. The result of Triple H being drafted was the loss of the Raw brand's world championship. After the draft, the ECW Championship moved back to ECW when Mark Henry defeated Kane and The Big Show in a Triple Threat match at Night of Champions, leaving Raw without any top-tier championships. On the June 30, 2008 episode of Raw, the Raw brand regained a world championship, after Money in the Bank contract holder, CM Punk, cashed in his contract and defeated the World Heavyweight Champion, Edge. Lastly, the United States Championship returned to SmackDown after Shelton Benjamin defeated Matt Hardy at The Great American Bash pay-per-view on July 20. Trevor Murdoch and Big Daddy V were both later released from WWE prior to their first appearances on SmackDown after being drafted. Chuck Palumbo was also later released from the WWE prior to his first appearance on Raw after being drafted.|$|E
