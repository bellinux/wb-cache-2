40|$|Effects of nitrogen-limitation and phosphorus-limitation on {{microcystin}} (MC) {{content and}} energy charge (EC) of the Microcystis aeruginosa were investigated <b>in</b> batch <b>cultures</b> and semi-continuous <b>cultures.</b> <b>In</b> batch <b>cultures,</b> nitrogen-limitation retarded the MC synthesis and phosphorus-limitation had little effects on MC production.

5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment.

Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes <b>in</b> <b>culture,</b> technology, and fashion for example with stage magic.

40|$|Background: Growth of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus with glucose as carbon {{an energy}} source has been {{extensively}} studied. However, there are no reports in the literature describing growth of G. diazotrophicus <b>in</b> <b>cultures</b> containing sucrose as carbon source. The first step in sucrose pathway and production of levans was investigated. Biomass, levans, gluconic acid and keto gluconic acids production and levansucrase activity were determined <b>in</b> <b>cultures</b> with different sucrose concentration and nitrogen sources. Results: The biomass production was maximal <b>in</b> <b>cultures</b> containing 100 g x L- 1 sucrose and inorganic nitrogen. Gluconic acid production was observed under all conditions tested, at levels up to 9 g x L- 1 <b>in</b> <b>cultures</b> with sucrose excess and biological N 2 -fixation (BNF). Keto gluconic acids were detectable only <b>in</b> <b>cultures</b> with sucrose excess and supplemented with organic nitrogen sources. Levans production, although observed <b>in</b> all <b>cultures,</b> was maximal <b>in</b> batch <b>culture</b> with 100 g x L- 1 of sucrose and BNF, concomitant with a significant expression of extracellular levansucrase. Conclusions: Ours results not only describe some unknown aspects of G. diazotrophicus physiology, but open up the possibility of developing a technology of levans production by this organism using culture media with sucrose (or some cheaper substitute, like molasses) and without the addition of any N-source because of its ability of fixing atmospheric N 2...|$|R

5|$|In 1974, Thomas Henry Flewett {{suggested}} the name rotavirus after observing that, when viewed through an electron microscope, a rotavirus particle {{looks like a}} wheel (rota in Latin); the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide. Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, rotavirus from humans was first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys, by adding trypsin (an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate) to the culture medium.
