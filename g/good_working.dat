5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians. Their decentralized mode of planning was entirely different from the top-down approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of frustration, as {{it was difficult to}} extract information from them.

5|$|The {{director}} assigned was Rudolph Cartier, {{with whom}} Kneale had a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationship; {{the two had}} collaborated on the previous Quatermass serials, {{as well as the}} literary adaptations Wuthering Heights (1953) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954). The budget of £17,500 allocated for Quatermass and the Pit was larger than that of the previous Quatermass productions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the coup}} and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless, enjoyed <b>good</b> <b>working</b> {{relationship}} with Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, who subsequently led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Sapieha, ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from St. Leonard's Crypt to Royal Tombs at Wawel. This led to open {{conflict with the}} church and the government, which threatened to step down.|$|E

The locomotives were acquired for <b>goods</b> <b>working</b> and were named Port Alfred and Kowie respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} ceremonially opened amid {{considerable}} festivity on 13 November 1861, {{and the public}} passenger service started the next day, 14 November 1861. As the connections to the goods facilities were not yet in place, the operation of a goods service was delayed until 1 March 1862, a local contractor Malachi Bartlett being brought in to complete work apparently left unfinished by Pickering. It appears that <b>goods</b> <b>working</b> was performed by mixed (passenger and goods) trains.|$|R
5|$|After {{removing}} her corpse {{from the}} canvas sack and beginning the post mortem examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson {{he was certain}} that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E
5|$|Before talks could begin, Coalition armies {{crossed the}} Rhine on 22 December. Metternich retired from Frankfurt to Breisgau to {{celebrate}} Christmas with his wife's family before travelling {{to the new}} Coalition headquarters at Basel in January 1814. Quarrels with Tsar Alexander, particularly {{over the fate of}} France intensified in January, prompting Alexander to storm out. He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid-January. Metternich and Castlereagh formed a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationship and then met with Alexander at Langres. The Tsar remained unaccommodating however, demanding a push into the centre of France; fortunately, he was too preoccupied to object to Metternich's other ideas, like a final peace conference in Vienna. Metternich did not attend talks with the French at Chatillon, as he wanted to stay with Alexander. The talks stalled, and, after a brief advance, Coalition forces had to retreat after the Montmirail and Montereau. This relieved Metternich's fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally.|$|E
5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} <b>good</b> <b>working</b> {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

While {{he was with}} the Black Cats, Hamilton captained the England youth team, which was coached at the time by Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, to the final of the 1978 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, where they lost to the USSR. He admitted to having a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationship with Clough while he {{was a part of the}} England youth side.

5|$|Himmler's organised, bookish intellect {{served him}} well as he began setting up {{different}} SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy. The two men had a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationship and a mutual respect. In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police. That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler {{to the rank of}} SS-Obergruppenführer, equal in rank to the senior SA commanders. Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.|$|E
5|$|In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn {{installed}} the Pong prototype {{at a local}} bar, Andy Capp's Tavern. They selected the bar because of their <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relation with the bar's manager, Bill Gaddis; Atari supplied pinball machines to Gaddis. Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype {{on one of the}} tables near the other entertainment machines: a jukebox, pinball machines, and Computer Space. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next one and a half weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate Pong to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing; he intended to use Pong to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game. A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters.|$|E

Even though they were not designed to be mixed traffic locomotives, they saw service on both passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>working.</b> Until the Class 15F arrived on the Midland, the mainline was ruled by these locomotives. Later, in spite of their small 51 in diameter coupled wheels, they were comfortable at 60 mph when employed on the mainline in tandem with the larger Class 15F.|$|R
5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal {{role in the}} {{coalition}} government, Bruxner formed a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner saw himself as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{commentators}} consider Staunton's {{understanding of}} positional play {{to have been}} far ahead of his contemporaries'. Although not an all-out attacking player, he attacked when his preparations were complete. His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess in the United Kingdom, and his Chess-Player's Handbook (1847) was a reference for decades. The chess openings the English Opening and Staunton Gambit were named for his advocacy of them. Staunton has been a controversial figure since his own time, and his chess writings could be spiteful. On the other hand, he maintained <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationships with several strong players and influential chess enthusiasts, and demonstrated excellent management skills.|$|E
5|$|The Reformist Party {{supported}} privatization, {{opposing the}} Modernist Party, which had dominated politics {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu and the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued that state monopolies provided abundant raw materials, <b>good</b> <b>working</b> conditions, and high quality iron; the Reformists countered that state-owned ironworks produced large and impractical implements designed to meet quotas rather than to be of practical use, were of inferior quality, and were too expensive for commoners to purchase. In 44 BC, the Reformists had both the salt and iron monopolies abolished, but the monopolies were reinstated in 41 BC after their abrupt closure resulted in significant losses of revenue for the government and disruption of the private economy.|$|E

At the time, however, the demand for general utility locomotive types was so pronounced that no good argument could be put forward for {{the introduction of a}} heavy locomotive dedicated to <b>goods</b> <b>working</b> only. Another factor which acted against the project was the insufficient length of the receiving sidings in the yards which made it doubtful that such a locomotive {{would have been able to}} be used to its full capacity.|$|R

5|$|There {{was also}} {{friction}} within the Catholic groups, first over Sukarno's 1957 decree {{that he was}} president for life and establishment of a guided democracy policy. A faction, led by Soegijapranata, supported this decree, while Catholic Party leader I. J. Kasimo's faction was heavily against it. Sukarno, who had a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationship with Soegijapranata, asked the vicar to join the National Council, a request that Soegijapranata refused; he did, however, assign two delegates to the Council, ensuring Catholic representation. This, along with Soegijapranata's support of Sukarno's decree on 5 July 1949 calling {{for a return to}} the 1945 constitution, resulted in Bishop of Jakarta Adrianus Djajasepoetra's denunciation of Soegijapranata as a sycophant. However, Soegijapranata was strongly against Sukarno's idea of Nasakom, which based part of the nation's government on communism.|$|E
5|$|At the Conservatoire Massenet studied solfège with Augustin Savard and {{the piano}} with François Laurent. He pursued his studies, with modest distinction, until the {{beginning}} of 1855, when family concerns disrupted his education. Alexis Massenet's health was poor, and on medical advice he moved from Paris to Chambéry in the south of France; the family, including Massenet, moved with him. Again, Massenet's own memoirs and the researches of his biographers are at variance: the composer recalled his exile in Chambéry as lasting for two years; Henry Finck and Irvine record that the young man returned to Paris and the Conservatoire in October 1855. On his return he lodged with relations in Montmartre and resumed his studies; by 1859 he had progressed so far as to win the Conservatoire's top prize for pianists. The family's finances were no longer comfortable, and to support himself Massenet took private piano students and played as a percussionist in theatre orchestras. His work in the orchestra pit gave him a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> knowledge of the operas of Gounod and other composers, classic and contemporary. Traditionally, many students at the Conservatoire went on to substantial careers as church organists; with that in mind Massenet enrolled for organ classes, but they were not a success and he quickly abandoned the instrument. He gained some work as a piano accompanist, in the course of which he met Wagner who, along with Berlioz, was one of his two musical heroes.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{ultimately}} {{proved to}} be an able commander. Thirty-seven years old and a New Zealander by birth, he had been commissioned into the Australian 2/2nd Battalion with Green during the Second World War. Serving as an intelligence officer on the headquarters of the 16th Brigade during the Libyan campaign in 1941, Ferguson had been awarded the Military Cross for his actions during fighting on the Kokoda Track in New Guinea in 1942. Later, he had served as a liaison officer with the 6th Division, before finishing the war as a staff officer posted to the 7th Division headquarters on Morotai island, taking part in the amphibious landing at Balikpapan in 1945. Ferguson volunteered to serve in the BCOF in Japan after the war and was posted to the 67th Battalion as a company commander, arriving in Kure in February 1946. After leaving the battalion in 1948 to serve on the headquarters of BCOF for six months, he returned as battalion second-in-command. In 1949 the battalion had been renamed the 3rd Battalion, Australian Regiment, and was later granted the 'Royal' prefix. He remained with the battalion after that time. The change of command was confirmed by the Commander-in-Chief BCOF, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, and Ferguson was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 10 November. He developed a <b>good</b> <b>working</b> relationship with Coad, who held him in high regard, and went on to command 3 RAR during its most demanding period in Korea.|$|E
