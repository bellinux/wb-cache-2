Nash made his first grade debut for Fitzroy as a seventeen-year-old and spent {{two and a half}} seasons at Fitzroy, earning plaudits for his performances and, until he broke his wrist in a fielding mishap, there were suggestions that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to Victorian selection.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier started to write {{a new version of}} Newton's Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz. In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party's Press Secretary and led a {{strategy}} to neutralise {{the influence of the}} press (which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock) and create allies for the party. While in government, Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit, a central body whose role was to co-ordinate the party's media relations and ensure that a unified image was presented to the press. Because of his background in tabloid journalism, Campbell understood how different parts of the media would cover stories. He was a valued news source for journalists because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to Blair– he was the first press secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings.|$|E
5|$|Both Ravel's {{parents were}} Roman Catholics; Marie was also {{something}} of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods.|$|E
5|$|Laís Bodanzky {{read the}} biographical book Canto dos Malditos by Austregésilo Carrano Bueno {{for the first}} time in 1996, when she was signed to assist with the {{direction}} of a documentary on the subject. She found the book after entering a discussion and research group on mental health in Brazil. Impressed by its narrative, she asked Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it, as she knew he had a similar worldview and would have the respect necessary to work on the subject. Bolognesi was reluctant as he considered it a complicated subject; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to giving up until he read and was touched by Paulo Leminski's presentation of the book.|$|E

5|$|On 27 August 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that Smith {{had signed a}} four-year deal with Premier League club Portsmouth for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £1.8m. He later admitted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to signing for Championship side Reading but chose Portsmouth instead. On 30 August 2009, Smith made his Portsmouth debut in a 1–0 defeat to Manchester City at Fratton Park. Portsmouth failed to pay their player's wages on time on three occasions in the 2009–10 season, and Smith was among a number of Portsmouth players linked with a transfer during the January 2010 transfer window. However, due to his five games for Watford, he would have been ineligible to play for another club during the 2009–10 season.|$|E

The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees. After there was optimism <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to returning to the lineup in December, he suffered a setback with his left knee and underwent further surgery in February 2012. During his recovery, he told reporters with Swedish newspaper Expressen that he was unsure whether he could continue playing.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} four. He began to learn to play the piano, becoming interested in it after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also interested in Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E

5|$|By 1198 Burnell's {{family had}} {{bestowed}} its {{name on the}} village of Acton Burnell in Shropshire, where Burnell was born probably in about 1239, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> in age to King Edward. His father was probably Roger Burnell, who died in about 1259. He had three brothers, two of whom died fighting the Welsh at the Battle of Moel-y-don in 1282; the third, Hugh, died in 1286. Hugh's son Philip was Robert's eventual heir. Burnell worked as a clerk in the royal chancery, the office responsible for the writing of documents, {{before moving to the}} household of Prince Edward, later King Edward I of England. By 1257 Burnell was spending most of his time with the prince and the prince's household. After Simon de Montfort's victory at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, Burnell continued to serve Edward, and was named the prince's clerk in December 1264. As a reward for his service, Burnell was given the prebend of Holme in the diocese of York some time before 1267, and was named Archdeacon of York in December 1270. He also held the office of chancellor to Edward {{from the time of the}} Battle of Evesham in 1265 until 1270, when Edward left on crusade.|$|E
5|$|In early 1930 Cochet {{decided to}} rest and only compete in doubles contests. He won at Gallia L.T.C., Carlton L.T.C. (also in mixed doubles with Elizabeth Ryan), Biarritz, La Baule mixed doubles with Ryan. His only singles loss came at the Belgian International Championship to Jean Borotra. His most {{successful}} French Championships came in this year when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to winning a triple crown after being victorious in singles over Bill Tilden, in doubles with Jacques Brugnon over Harry Hopman and James Willard and was a finalist in the mixed tournament as well. At the 1930 Wimbledon Championships he was seeded first but made an early exit after his straight-set loss to Wilmer Allison in the quarterfinals. In the doubles Cochet—Brugnon lost in the semifinals {{as well as in}} mixed doubles with Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E
5|$|John was {{the eldest}} child of Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol. He was distant from his father, who treated him harshly, {{and did not}} get on well with him, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to his first stepmother, Lady Juliet. After {{spending}} time in London, Monte Carlo, Paris and New York in the 1970s, he settled in {{part of the family}} seat, Ickworth House in Suffolk, becoming the 7th Marquess in 1985. Despite inheriting a large fortune of up to £35 million, the Marquess spent most of it during his lifetime. He struggled with addiction to cocaine and other drugs, serving several jail sentences for possession, and was known for his flamboyant lifestyle and homosexuality. His brief marriage in the mid-1980s did not last because of this, and he became increasingly depressed as he lost money and faced bankruptcy, culminating in the sale of the remainder of Ickworth House to the National Trust. He died in early 1999 of complications resulting from his drug addiction, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol.|$|E

5|$|In May 1962, Serong was {{selected}} to lead the 30-man Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) of instructors to South Vietnam. Serong had been appointed by Pollard—with whom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> friends—and was given authority to act unilaterally. He conducted a reconnaissance of South Vietnam in June, and {{the main body of}} the AATTV began arriving in early August. Serong based his headquarters in Saigon; the rest of the team was located at various installations throughout the country. Although the AATTV was mostly involved in training the South Vietnamese forces, a few had been attached to the Combined Studies Division, run by the CIA as a counter-insurgency organisation. Serong later became a counter-insurgency advisor to General Paul Harkins, Commander US MACV, but this relationship ended under Pollard's successor, Lieutenant General John Wilton, who reduced Serong's autonomy while continuing to grant him considerable latitude. In May 1963 Serong accepted an invitation to visit the US Special Warfare School in North Carolina, only informing the Military Board after doing so, and he later visited West Germany to become familiar with intelligence activities there, again without informing Wilton, who reacted angrily after finding out about it from a newspaper report. Meanwhile, in late 1963, Serong started to redeploy members of the team into combat advisory roles, and by February 1964 some officers and NCOs were working with Special Forces teams involved in counter-insurgency operations. Resulting in the first involvement of Australian personnel in combat during the conflict, this was a significant decision; it was retrospectively approved by Wilton, who lifted earlier restrictions on the role of AATTV personnel that had prevented them being involved in combat.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 All-Africa Games {{represented}} a double landmark victory for Zersenay: {{he became the}} first Eritrean medallist in the competition's history, and won his first ever gold medal on the track, sealing victory in the 10,000 m final with a Games record time of 27:00.30. The following month he competed at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, and he edged closer to a podium finish – he led the 10,000 m race up to the 8km mark, setting a fast pace, but ultimately ended up in fourth position. Preparing for the road championships that year, he ran the 10-mile Dam tot Damloop race in September and won in 45:51 (the world's fastest that season), finishing some distance ahead of runners up Bernard Kipyego and James Rotich. Zersenay emphasised his position as one of the world's most dominant half marathon runners with a second victory at the 2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships in Udine, Italy. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>close</b> to world record pace at the 15km point, he slowed behind the leading pack of Makau Musyoki, Evans Kiprop Cheruiyot and Deriba Merga. In the final kilometre, he burst away to take the lead and the gold medal, setting a national and championship record time of 58:59 in the process. Following these achievements, a medical team did a study of his running economy and found him {{to be one of the}} most efficient runners ever to be tested.|$|E
