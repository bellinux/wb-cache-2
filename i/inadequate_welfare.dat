40|$|Socio-demographic {{research}} on ageing has increasingly examined {{the impact of}} migration on older people’s welfare and support networks. The basic tenor of such research is often that older people are ‘left behind’ by younger migrants, and that the very conditions encouraging outmigration by the young (poor economic prospects, <b>inadequate</b> state <b>welfare,</b> weak civil society) also add to the vulnerability of older people in sending communities. We examined old-age support arrangements among a German minority in Romania, who had experienced dramatic outmigration to Germany in the 1990 s, leaving a severely distorted age-structure among the remaining population. Childlessness and small local but significant transnational kin networks characterise the study population. Contrary to expectations, we found little evidence of vulnerability among the older population. However, old-age security was less a function of remittances and other transnational family support, as has been documented in other studies of migration, but of strong local networks that emerged transformed out of long-standing ethnic institutions (including the Lutheran church) and inter-ethnic relationships.

A North Carolina study demonstrates how one restorative practice—family group conferencing (FGC) —advances family participation in child welfare planning. A sample of 27 conferences showed that the 221 family group members outnumbered the 115 service providers at the meetings. Family group members were usually satisfied with the conference process and decision and saw the plans as primarily reached through consensus, following a trusted leader, and bargaining.

Because of this 'moonlight effect', organizations and governments implement many policies and practices that increase expenses but damage either progress or wellbeing.

40|$|AbstractHypertension is {{the most}} common {{cardiovascular}} disease worldwide. Moreover, management of hypertension requires long-term treatment that may result in poor patient compliance with conventional dosage forms due to greater frequency of drug administration. Although there is availability of a plethora of therapeutically effective antihypertensive molecules, <b>inadequate</b> patient <b>welfare</b> is observed; this arguably presents an opportunity to deliver antihypertensive agents through a different route. Ever since the transdermal drug delivery came into existence, it has offered great advantages including non-invasiveness, prolonged therapeutic effect, reduced side effects, improved bioavailability, better patient compliance and easy termination of drug therapy. Attempts were made to develop the transdermal therapeutic system for various antihypertensive agents, including β-blockers, an important antihypertensive class. β-blockers are potent, highly effective in the management of hypertension and other heart ailments by blocking the effects of normal amounts of adrenaline in the heart and blood vessels. The shortcomings associated with β-blockers such as more frequent dose administration, extensive first pass metabolism and variable bioavailability, make them an ideal candidate for transdermal therapeutic systems. The present article gives a brief view of different β-blockers formulated as transdermal therapeutic system in detail to enhance the bioavailability as well as to improve patient compliance. Constant improvement in this field holds promise for the long-term success in technologically advanced transdermal dosage forms being commercialized sooner rather than later...|$|R
40|$|Britain {{is often}} heralded {{as a country}} in which the rights and welfare of {{survivors}} of conflict and persecution are well embedded, and where the standard of living conditions for those seeking asylum is relatively high. Drawing on a decade of activism and research in the North West of England, this book contends that, on the contrary, conditions are often structurally violent. For survivors of gendered violence, harm inflicted throughout the process of seeking asylum can be intersectional and compound the impacts of previous experiences of violent continuums. The everyday threat of detention and deportation; poor housing and <b>inadequate</b> <b>welfare</b> access; and systemic cuts to domestic and sexual violence support all contribute to a temporal limbo which limits women’s personal autonomy and access to basic human rights. By reflecting on evidence from interviews, focus groups, activist participation and oral history, Gendered Harm and Structural Violence provides a unique insight into the everyday impacts of policy and practice that arguably result in the infliction of further gendered harms on survivors of violence and persecution...|$|E

40|$|The {{rationale}} for local fiscal autonomy suggests that local expenditure and local revenue generation {{should remain in}} close proximity. This is achieved through fiscal decentralisation to local government, to ensure efficient provision of local services that align with local needs, and to improve accountability to residents. Fiscal decentralisation has found resonance in developing countries through local government reforms, but in Africa fiscal decentralisation has been focussed mainly on revenue sharing, except {{in a few cases}} where some local fiscal autonomy has been achieved. Urbanisation in Africa is likely to continue (UN-Habitat, 2008), necessitating an increase in municipal service delivery which African cities must finance − hence the need for local fiscal autonomy. Local fiscal autonomy is arguably contentious for African cities, partly because provision of municipal services must be tempered with considerations of equity and redistribution to the poorer urban populations, and because <b>inadequate</b> <b>welfare</b> nets from national government do not subsidise the gap in municipal revenue.

30|$|The {{papers in}} this special issue all address, in various ways, how members of modern Chinese {{families}} are negotiating changes in relationships between generations and the opportunities and constraints that face them. So what conclusions can we reach {{in this special}} issue? We found that there is continued importance of filial piety {{but it has been}} reconstructed and reworked under new conditions. Chinese families now look very different from those of 1949. Families have grown smaller with the decline in intergenerational co-residence and the impact of the one-child policy, but children and parents maintain close ties and exchanges of material, instrumental, and emotional support. The Confucian family ideology which undergirded relations between elders and the young, husbands and wives, has been shaken so that intergenerational relations are more often based on mutuality than on obedience, but the practical need for family care to compensate for <b>inadequate</b> social <b>welfare</b> ensures that filial piety is still expressed, albeit in a modified form. We also need to take account of the geographical and economic constraints facing families when care for ill or disabled elders becomes necessary. As Zhang’s study indicates, those who are relatively affluent can consider the possibilities of hiring domestic help or paying for a private care home—even if the latter proves problematic in terms of traditional filial norms. For poorer couples juggling the multiple demands of maintaining an adequate income, caring for their child or children and elders, a crisis in the life circumstances of their parents could prove close to unmanageable (see also Liu’s rural sample). Since traditional family practices have changed, there is an urgent need for the state policy-makers to catch up with reality and take into consideration the diversified family forms and new family practices rather than take the Chinese family for granted and assume that families can always provide care for ageing relatives.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the management of}} conflicts {{in the administration of}} secondary schools in Osun State, Nigeria. It also identifies, discusses and analyses the causes as well as the various ways conflicts manifested in the administration of secondary schools in the state. The effects of conflicts on school administration are equally examined. Quantitative and qualitative data were generated from both primary and secondary sources. The paper shows that administration of secondary schools in the state was hampered by high rate of conflicts. Several types of conflicts were identified in the schools among which were conflicts between management and staff, between staff and students, between the communities and schools, and inter-personal conflicts, to mention a few. The causes of conflicts in schools in the state included <b>inadequate</b> <b>welfare</b> package for workers, forceful and compulsory retirement/retrenchment of workers, administrative incompetence, personality clashes, role conflicts, and non-involvement of students in school administration. The fact that most of the school administrators were not knowledgeable in conflict management, coupled with the absence of laid down procedures for conflict management in most schools contributed to the high rate of conflicts and industrial actions in the schools. The paper concludes that the issue of conflict management in school administration has reached a point where effective use of relevant strategies can no longer be ignored...|$|E
40|$|In this {{preliminary}} study {{the occupational safety}} and health practices among flower greenhouses workers were evaluated. The study was carried out in the alto Tiete region, located at the Sao Paulo State, Brazil. <b>Inadequate</b> <b>welfare</b> facilities; poor pesticide storage, use and disposal conditions; use of highly toxic pesticides; lack of adequate data regarding pesticide use; and incorrect use and maintenance of PPE were observed in most of the visited greenhouses. These results suggest that, in greenhouses, workers may be at higher risk of pesticide exposure, due to many factors that can intensify the exposure such as the lack of control on reentry intervals after pesticide application. Specific regulations are needed to ensure better OSH practices on pesticide use and to improve working conditions in greenhouses, in order to deal with the peculiarities of greenhouse working environment. Some of the special requirements for greenhouses workers' protection are the establishment of ventilation criteria for restricted entry interval; clear reentry restrictions; and EPI for workers other than applicators that need to enter the greenhouse before expiring REI interval. Another important way to improve OSH practices among workers includes the distribution of simple guidelines on the dos and don'ts regarding OSH practices in greenhouses and extensively training interventions to change the perception of hazards and the behavior towards risk.

40|$|The {{theory of}} cohort {{competition}} developed by Easterlin suggests that individuals born during {{the baby boom}} {{are more likely to}} be poor than those born before or after them. This article investigates this claim by addressing two questions: Is there any effect of cohort on poverty, and, if so, does this effect follow the pattern predicted by Easterlin's theory? A decomposition of poverty by age, period, cohort, and household type shows that among whites, every successive generation of family heads born throughout the baby boom has faced an increasingly greater chance of being poor. Among blacks, the cohort effect is not statistically significant. Contrary to Easterlin's prediction, however, it is white family heads born after the baby boom who face the highest odds of poverty. The cohort effect is not due to recent changes in family structure, which are controlled. Theoretical Overview One of the most compelling questions debated by researchers and policy makers is why poverty in the U. S. has not shown a sustained decline since President Johnson launched the "War on Poverty " in 1964 (Danziger & Weinberg 1986; Sawhill 1988). Despite the increases in spending for welfare programs over the past twenty years, the poverty rate was slightly higher in 1988 than it was in 1968 (U. S. Census Bureau 1991). 1 Proposed answers to this question include the rise in female-headed families, the industrial restructuring of the economy, <b>inadequate</b> <b>welfare</b> policies, and economic recession (Eggebeen & Lichter 1991...|$|E

One third of children aged 5-12 (national survey, 1933) required medical treatment or observation for potential clinical conditions.

40|$|AbstractDebates on the post-socialist {{welfare state}} evolved in two main directions. While some {{scholars}} have maintained that they would eventually converge with Western European patterns, some others have pointed at the need of a more ‘particularist’ approach, seeking to demonstrate that post-socialist states might follow a different and non-traditional path, individually or as a region in terms of welfare provision. Our current work {{is an attempt to}} contribute to the debate on the direction of post-socialist welfare state adaptation by engaging with corruption and welfare state/public sector failure in post-socialist spaces. In particular, emphasis is put on the tactics and strategies used by public workers and citizens to cope with incomplete and <b>inadequate</b> public social <b>welfare</b> provision. Rooted in different disciplinary schools, and making use of diverse methodological and theoretical approaches, the papers of this special issue provide further evidence to rechart the relationship between the public welfare sector, citizens and the current economic transition, a commonality that allows us to point at alternatives to the capitalist model that for some time has been seen as the only option. In line with our previous works, in this special issue we explore the possibility that informality and formality are complementary or that informality may ‘replace’ formal processes and structures. In other words, where the welfare state does not penetrate, welfare might be spread also through informal channels and it might redefine the very dynamics underpinning of a society...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{synopsis of}} the welfare of captive, wild (ie non-domesticated) animals in travelling circuses is missing. We examined circus animal welfare and, specifically, behaviour, health, living and travelling conditions. We compared the conditions of non-domesticated animals in circuses with their counterparts kept in zoos. Data on circus animals were very scarce; where data were absent, we inferred likely welfare implications based on zoo data. Circus animals spent {{the majority of the}} day confined, about 1 – 9 % of the day performing/training and the remaining time in exercise pens. Exercise pens were significantly smaller than minimum zoo standards for outdoor enclosures. Behavioural budgets were restricted, with circus animals spending a great amount of time performing stereotypies, especially when shackled or confined in beast wagons. A higher degree of stereotyping in circuses may be indicative of poorer <b>welfare.</b> <b>Inadequate</b> diet and housing conditions, and the effects of repeated performances, can lead to significant health problems. Circus animals travel frequently and the associated forced movement, human handling, noise, trailer movement and confinement are important stressors. Although there is no conclusive evidence as to whether animals habituate to travel, confinement in beast wagons for long timeperiods is a definite welfare concern. Circuses have a limited ability to make improvements, such as increased space, environmental enrichment and appropriate social housing. Consequently, we argue that non-domesticated animals, suitable for circus life, should exhibit low space requirements, simple social structures, low cognitive function, non-specialist ecological requirements and an ability to be transported without adverse welfare effects.

40|$|The {{notion of}} an 'underclass' {{existing}} {{outside the realm of}} mainstream society continues to hold sway among journalists and policy-makers. While there are many new contenders for inclusion among the underclass, one of the most enduring group of participants is the long-term unemployed. Work-shy individuals, seemingly content to live on welfare benefits, are regarded as placing themselves outside the boundaries of mainstream economic and social life and passing a host of negative characteristics on to their children. The possibility that some of this group might defraud the welfare benefit system through working while claiming benefits adds further weight to negative images about the characteristics of 'underclass' members. The aim {{of this paper is to}} challenge some of these common assumptions by examining the ways in which unemployed people in an economically depressed locality in West Belfast relied on informal economic activity to help meet their material needs. Such activity has implications for the underclass debate because, rather than demonstrating commitment to some alternative set of values, informal economic activity drew participants into the wider economy and demonstrated adherence to mainstream values. Moreover, often the debate on social security abuse focuses on the supply side of the issue and is remarkably silent about the demand side of the equation. 'Doing-the-double' (working while claiming benefits) was not simply an individual response to unemployment and <b>inadequate</b> <b>welfare</b> benefits but was linked to changes in the labour needs of employers in the wider economy.

Factors such as freedom of movement for the animals, access to veterinary care, environmental noise quality, hygiene standards and work intensity {{were included in the}} score sheet. 1688 elephants, 371 macaques and 621 tigers were found at the venues. 89 venues exclusively kept elephants, 9 designated 'Monkey schools' offered macaque shows, 4 venues kept primarily tigers, mostly for petting and photo opportunities, and the remaining venues kept a mix of these animals. A strong imbalance in female to male gender ratios was recorded with about 4 : 1 for adult elephants and 1 : 4 for adult macaques. Severely <b>inadequate</b> <b>welfare</b> conditions were common, with 75 % of macaques and 99 % of tigers being kept at venues with scores less than 5. 86 % of elephants were kept in inadequate conditions at venues with scores between 3 and 5, but a significant number of venues with scores above 5 were found. 4. 6 % of elephants were provided commendable conditions, reaching assessment scores of 8 and above. 71 % of venues did not offer any sort of education about animals to visitors.

40|$|This review {{describes}} the principal causes of poor welfare in beef cattle and veal calves raised in intensive husbandry systems in Italy. Nowadays {{there are no}} specific regulations in force for beef cattle welfare. However, a document produced in 2001 by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare of the European Commission on Health and Consumer Protection identified the main causes of <b>inadequate</b> <b>welfare</b> levels in the different cattle rearing systems in Europe. In Italy and in the Po Valley in particular, the beef cattle farms are mainly finishing units characterised by animals kept at high density in multiple pens and fed high starch diets. Under these rearing conditions the limited space allowance {{is one of the}} most important issues impairing animal welfare. Other risk factors for poor welfare related to the housing structures are type of floor, space at the manger, number of water dispensers and lack of specific moving and handling facilities. Microclimatic conditions can be critical especially during the summer season when cattle can experience heat stress. The feeding plan adopted in the Italian beef farms may be another factor negatively affecting the welfare of these animals due to the low content of long fibre roughage which increases the risk of metabolic acidosis. In the veal calf rearing systems there has been a mandatory introduction of the new system of production according to the European Council Directives 91 / 629 /EEC and 97 / 2 /EC. Farms had to adopt group housing and to provide calves with an increasing amount of fibrous feed in addition to the all-liquid diet. Despite this specific legislation, several risk factors for calves' welfare can still be identified. Some of them are related to the housing system (type of floor, air quality, feed and water supply equipment and lack of loading facilities) and some others to the feeding plan (type and amount of roughage, quality of milk replacers). Recent studies have shown that the welfare of veal calves and beef cattle can be severely affected by the quality of the stockmanship and particularly by negative human-animal interaction...|$|E
40|$|Optimum {{construction}} worker (CW) performance {{is required to}} achieve project delivery within project parameters. It {{is not always the}} case as CWs are regularly exposed to hazards, involved in accidents, their productivity is poor, they suffer from ill health, suffer from work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) and contractors lack resources to allocate towards H&S. However, the lack or the absence of health and safety (H&S) measures, which the aforementioned depend on, has a negative impact on workers’ performance. Two descriptive surveys were conducted among professional construction project managers (CPMs) registered with the South African Council for Project and Construction Management Professions (SACPCMP) and general contractors (GCs) registered with the East Cape Master Builders Association (ECMBA). Interviews were also conducted with CPMs registered with the SACPCMP residing in the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan area. The salient findings include: • Accidents, which occur on construction sites, impact workers’ performance; • Inadequate H&S implementation affects both CW skills and motivation, which in turn affects their performance; • Poor constructability is relevant to H&S and CWs’ skills; • Provision and maintenance of welfare facilities are commonly inadequate and affect workers’ performance, and • Projects do not benefit from the adequate financial provision for H&S. It was concluded that exposure to hazards, poor site conditions, <b>inadequate</b> provision of <b>welfare</b> facilities, WMSDs, and insufficient financial provision for H&S affect workers’ performance by either incapacitating or demotivating them. Recommendations include : CPMs should make better use of their influence on clients; they should improve communication channels between project stakeholders; legislators need to raise awareness regarding H&S and worker welfare, and training and education institutions need to empower workers and professionals with H&S knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The main {{impetus for}} 'modern' {{intensive}} animal production occurred after the Second World War, when Western governments developed policies {{to increase the}} availability of cheap, safe food for their populations. Livestock benefit under intensive husbandry by protection from environmental extremes and predators, and better nutritional and health management. Nevertheless, there are costs to the animal, such as impaired social behaviour, limited choice of living environment or pen mates, poor environmental stimulation and behavioural restrictions. The rapid progress in genetic selection of production traits has also, in some cases, adversely affected welfare by creating anatomical and metabolic problems. Above all, the intensively housed animal is heavily reliant on the stockperson and, therefore, inadequate care and husbandry practices by the stockperson may be the largest welfare risk. In {{a future in which}} the food supply may be limited as the world's population grows and land availability shrinks, intensive animal production is likely to expand. At the same time, ethical considerations surrounding intensive farming practices may also become more prominent. Novel technologies provide the opportunity to enhance both the productivity and welfare of intensively kept animals. Developing countries are also establishing more intensive commercial systems to meet their growing need for animal protein. Intensive livestock production in such countries has the potential for major expansion, particularly if such developments address the key constraints of poor <b>welfare,</b> <b>inadequate</b> nutrition, poor reproduction, poor housing, and high mortality often seen with traditional systems, and if farmer access to emerging market opportunities is improved. However, as shown by previous experience, inadequate regulation and staff who lack the appropriate training to care for the welfare of intensively housed livestock can be major challenges to overcome.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} lives and experiences of individuals who were born in Korea, adopted overseas as infants or young children, and have returned to their country of birth as adults. More specifically, I present the diverse, creative, and sometimes subtle ways in which adoptee returnees have engaged in resistance in order to reclaim their right to reside in Korea, access their personal histories, and challenge the system that produced their subjectivities as overseas Korean adoptees. Ranging from everyday practices, such as cross-cultural or linguistic code-switching, to grassroots activism and coalition building, this broad spectrum of resistance practices elucidates the ways power manifests itself in several forms in Korean society, the state, and the adoption industry. Throughout this study, I draw on the theoretical contributions of Michel Foucault, which have greatly shaped our understandings of power in its ubiquity and multi-dimensionality, and Michel de Certeau’s concepts of strategies, tactics, and resistance against power in daily life practices. I approach the interactions of power and resistance as inherently dynamic, open-ended, unpredictable, and constantly shifting rather than assume direct causation or the necessary presence of intention or consciousness. I argue that all these practices, including the act of return to a place from where these adoptee returnees were adopted away in previous decades, signify resistance against existing systems of power. 	In an attempt to disrupt conventional narratives of adoption, this study aims to focus the discussion on {{those who have been}} directly affected by Korea’s <b>inadequate</b> social <b>welfare</b> system and the institution of overseas adoption: adoptees, families of origin, single mother families, and other vulnerable members of Korean society. Broken down into an introduction, three main chapters, and a conclusion, this study is an ethnography that conceptualizes power and resistance through narratives. I present a historical overview of adoption practices in Korea starting from the mid- and late Chosǒn dynasty and continuing up to current overseas and domestic adoption practices. Additionally, I situate the return of Korean adoptees to Korea and their everyday practices and modes of consumption within the history of overseas Korean adoption. Next, I focus on original family search and reunion among adoptees, which includes a debate surrounding access to adoption records and personal histories. The discussion then shifts to a coalition that has formed among adult adoptee returnees, unwed and single mothers, original Korean family members who have been separated from a child or children through Korean adoption practices, a Korean pastor and his wife who run an adoptee guesthouse in Seoul, and other allies, highlighting their mobilization strategies and political activism. Finally, I consider how utilizing a social justice and human rights framework facilitates a more holistic understanding of the history of Korean adoption and the lives that have been directly affected by adoption practices...|$|R
