5|$|During {{the late}} 16th century the Dunlugas Ogilvies {{undertook}} re-furbishment and <b>extension</b> <b>work,</b> including {{the addition of}} courtyard buildings and a distinctive circular tower that incorporated the hall into its first storey. An act recording the lands in favour of George Ogilvy was ratified by King Charles I in late June 1633. George {{was the son of}} Walter Ogilvy, and an ardent Royalist and supporter of the king against the Covenanters. Inchdrewer Castle was left in ruins after being attacked by Covenanter forces led by General Robert Monro in 1640; another of the family properties, a town house, was also devastated. George Ogilvy was appointed a peer in 1642, becoming the first Lord Banff.|$|E

25|$|A common {{perception}} is that the birth of Cooperative Extension followed passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which provided federal funds to land-grant universities to support <b>Extension</b> <b>work.</b> In a formal sense, this is true. But the roots of Cooperative Extension extend {{as far back as}} the late 18th century, following the American Revolution, when affluent farmers first began organizing groups to sponsor educational meetings to disseminate useful farming information. In some cases, these lectures even were delivered by university professors– a practice that foreshadowed Cooperative <b>Extension</b> <b>work</b> more than a century later.|$|E

The State Institute of Education later developed into the State Council of Education, Research and Training (SCERT) and now, as the Directorate of Teacher Education, Research and Training (DTERT) with all the teacher training institutes under it. As Founder-Director, Lawrence had laid the proper foundations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} few years, {{there has been a}} sharp {{increase}} of visitors in Macau. The Macau SAR Government has decided to upgrade the existing Taipa temporary ferry terminal with <b>extension</b> <b>works</b> into a permanent one in order to alleviate congestion at the terminal. In this paper, a general introduction of the New Ferry Terminal is descried while the scope of the <b>extension</b> <b>works</b> and the proposed facilities are also described. Some of the key design features of the Terminal Building are discussed, in particular, the Terminal Building, its deep foundations, its reinforced concrete structures, its steel roof structures as well as the design and construction of the metal roof systems...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{went through}} several major <b>extension</b> <b>works.</b> The first {{was carried out}} between 1873 and 1875. In 1901, the building was extended towards the river. Coleman's original design was lost {{as a result of}} the <b>extension</b> <b>works.</b> In 1909, two courtrooms were reconstructed and a residence for the Attorney General was built, and the architectural style of the building was transformed from Coleman's Neo-Palladian design to appear more Victorian. In 1939, the Supreme Court moved into its new building further down the road, and the building was then used as a storehouse, and later for the Department of Social Welfare after the Second World War.|$|R
25|$|Following an {{agreement}} to leave a short section {{at one end of}} the tunnel untreated, and more sympathetic treatment of the rest of the tunnel, the work went ahead and the route reopened– much later than originally anticipated– in 1998. The tunnel closed again from 23 December 2007 to permit tracklaying and resignalling for the East London Line extension. The <b>extension</b> <b>work</b> resulted in the tunnel becoming part of the new London Overground. After its reopening on 27 April 2010, it was used by mainline trains again.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} was modelled on the American state university (similar to the University of Alberta), {{with an emphasis}} on <b>extension</b> <b>work</b> and applied research. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was a link between the bodies to perform institutional leadership.|$|E
25|$|Today, all Northern line trains {{consist of}} 1995 Stock in the Underground livery of red, white and blue.

If the proposed split of the line takes place (initial estimates of 2018 having been abandoned to focus on completion of the Battersea and Nine Elms <b>extension</b> <b>work),</b> 19 new trains {{will be added to}} the existing fleet of 106 trains, though additional trains beyond the extra 19 trains may be required to provide a full service for the new Battersea extension.|$|E
