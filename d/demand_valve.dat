5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/mÂ³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the <b>demand</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{sharing of}} {{breathing}} gas may {{be done by}} sharing a single <b>demand</b> <b>valve,</b> or by the donor providing a <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> to the receiver, and another for their own use. The gas supply for the second <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> may be from the same scuba set or from a separate cylinder. The preferred technique of air sharing is donation of a <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> that is not needed by the donor.|$|E
25|$|Secondary (octopus) <b>demand</b> <b>valves,</b> {{submersible}} {{pressure gauges}} and low pressure inflator hoses {{were added to}} the first stage.|$|R

50|$|An {{economical}} {{and effective}} method of reducing risk while sharing air is use of secondary (octopus) <b>demand</b> <b>valves.</b> This is effective {{only if the}} buddy is available for sharing {{at the time of}} the emergency.|$|R
25|$|The {{secondary}} <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> can be {{a hybrid}} of a <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> and a buoyancy compensator inflation valve. Both types are sometimes called alternate air sources. When the secondary <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is integrated with the buoyancy compensator inflation valve, since the inflation valve hose is short (usually {{just long enough to}} reach mid-chest), {{in the event of a}} diver running out of air, the diver with air remaining would give his or her primary second stage to the out-of-air diver, and switch to the inflation valve himself.|$|E
25|$|Recovering and {{clearing}} the <b>demand</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
25|$|The donor is {{expected}} to take a good breath and pass his/her <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> (or mouthpiece {{in the case of a}} twin-hose regulator) to the recipient, who {{is expected}} to take two good breaths and pass it back. In reality the recipient will often take more than two breaths, and the donor should expect this and relax to minimize metabolic rate. The donor should retain a good grip on the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> throughout the buddy breathing process, as a panicked recipient may fail to give it back. A reasonably reliable way of keeping control of the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is to grasp the hose firmly in the fist where it connects to the <b>demand</b> <b>valve.</b> This provides good control but allows the recipient to use the purge button if needed.|$|E
50|$|In <b>demand</b> <b>valves</b> {{where the}} {{cracking}} pressure is adjustable by the diver, {{it may also}} occur {{as a result of}} maladjustment of the cracking pressure (dial a breath) knob. In these cases the freeflow can usually be eliminated by adjusting the setting.|$|R
50|$|D-rings {{are usually}} fitted to the waistbelt, {{shoulder}} straps and crotch strap to secure stage cylinders, additional equipment, and clipping off <b>demand</b> <b>valves,</b> light heads, and submersible pressure gauges {{which are not}} currently being used. The number and position of these D-rings can be adjusted by the user, {{but there are a}} few positions which have become fairly standard.|$|R
25|$|Some <b>demand</b> <b>valves</b> use a small, {{sensitive}} {{pilot valve}} {{to control the}} opening of the main valve. The Poseidon Jetstream and Xstream and Oceanic Omega second stages are examples of this technology. They can produce very high flow rates for a small pressure differential, and particularly for a relatively small cracking pressure. They are generally more complicated and expensive to service.|$|R
25|$|The {{alternative}} is to donate the primary <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> that the donor is currently breathing from, {{on the principle that}} it is known to be working and is immediately recognizable and accessible. The donor, who should be less stressed, will then switch to the secondary <b>demand</b> <b>valve,</b> which in this arrangement is generally mounted on a loop of bungee cord which hangs on the neck, and keeps the secondary <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> tucked up under the diver's chin, where it can often be reached without the use of the hands, by bending the head forward and gripping the mouthpiece with the teeth.|$|E
25|$|A {{full-face}} mask encloses both {{mouth and}} nose, which {{reduces the risk}} of the diver losing the air supply compared to a half mask and <b>demand</b> <b>valve.</b> Some models require a bailout block to provide alternative breathing gas supply from the umbilical and bailout cylinder, but are not suitable for accepting an alternative air supply from a rescue diver, while a few models accept a secondary <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> which can be plugged into an accessory port (Draeger, Apeks and Ocean Reef). The unique Kirby Morgan 48 SuperMask has a removable DV pod which can be unclipped to allow the diver to breathe from a standard scuba <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> with mouthpiece.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} reasons why a <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> may be removed from a diver's mouth under water, both {{intentionally}} and unintentionally. In all cases, it may fill with water and this must be removed before the diver can safely breathe from it again. This is known as clearing the <b>demand</b> <b>valve,</b> {{and there are two}} ways this can be done.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there is}} some small <b>demand</b> for <b>valve</b> preamps and filter {{circuits}} for studio microphone amplifiers, equalising preamplifiers for vinyl discs, and exceptionally for active crossovers.|$|R
25|$|The diver {{must be able}} to {{positively}} {{identify the}} gas supplied by any one of the several <b>demand</b> <b>valves</b> that these configurations require, to avoid potentially fatal problems of oxygen toxicity, hypoxia, nitrogen narcosis or divergence from the decompression plan which may occur if an inappropriate gas is used. One of the conventions puts the oxygen rich gases to the right, Other methods include labelling by content and/or maximum operating depth (MOD), and identification by touch. Often several or all of these methods are used together.|$|R
25|$|Some early twin hose {{regulators}} were of single-stage design. The {{first stage}} functions {{in a way}} similar to {{the second stage of}} two-stage <b>demand</b> <b>valves,</b> but would be connected directly to the cylinder valve and reduced high pressure air from the cylinder directly to ambient pressure on demand. This could be done by using a longer lever and larger diameter diaphragm to control the valve movement, but there was a tendency for cracking pressure, and thus work of breathing, to vary as the cylinder pressure dropped.|$|R
25|$|Bailout to {{open circuit}} by closing and exchanging the rebreather {{mouthpiece}} {{for a separate}} <b>demand</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} {{full-face}} mask exist, and {{the procedure for}} clearing them depends on the construction. They will automatically drain through the exhaust port of the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> provided the water can get to it, {{but this is not}} always possible, and in models which use an internal mouthpiece, the procedure is the same as with a half mask. Models which use an oral/nasal internal seal will usually drain to the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> or an additional drain valve at a low point when the diver's face is roughly upright or face down, and these will clear during normal breathing for small leaks, and may be cleared of major flooding by using the purge button on the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> to fill the mask with air.|$|E
25|$|Bailout to {{open circuit}} by opening a bailout <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> already {{connected}} to the full face mask, or by nose-breathing in some cases.|$|E

50|$|Concorde had to {{deal with}} {{particularly}} high pressure differentials because it flew at unusually high altitude (up to 60000 ft) and maintained a cabin altitude of 6000 ft. This made the aircraft significantly heavier and contributed to the high cost of a flight. The Concorde also had smaller cabin windows than most other commercial passenger aircraft in order to slow the rate of decompression if a window failed. The high cruising altitude also required the use of high pressure oxygen and <b>demand</b> <b>valves</b> at the emergency masks unlike the continuous-flow masks used in conventional airliners.|$|R
25|$|Exhaust valve failure, like <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> failure, can {{be dealt}} with by opening the free flow valve and {{ensuring}} a constant outflow of air.|$|E
25|$|Breathing from a <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is the {{fundamental}} and definitive skill of scuba diving, {{and it must be}} done correctly to make effective use of a limited air supply, and to avoid drowning. Most recreational scuba diving is done with a half mask and the <b>demand</b> <b>valve</b> is held in the mouth, gripped by the teeth, and sealed by the lips. The air is breathed through the mouth, and the diver must be able to seal off the nasal passages from the pharynx so that breathing remains possible with a flooded or dislodged mask.|$|E
25|$|<b>Demand</b> <b>valve</b> failure. This {{is a minor}} {{problem if}} there is a free flow valve, but the dive will {{normally}} be terminated, as the bailout will not last long if needed.|$|E
5000|$|Inflator valve {{malfunction}} can {{inflate the}} bladder when the buoyancy is not needed, {{and if not}} recognized and dealt with promptly, can result in uncontrolled ascent with associated risk of decompression illness. This can happen more quickly with inflators combined with alternative <b>demand</b> <b>valves</b> as they must use a larger bore hose connector. However, the standard overpressure and dump valves provided are able to vent air faster than the inflator valve can fill the bladder. This can be mitigated by the ability to disconnect the inflator hose under pressure, a skill which is trained by some agencies.|$|R
50|$|Oxygen {{supply to}} divers in {{decompression}} chambers is preferably through a built-in breathing system, which uses an oxygen mask plumbed into supply and exhaust hoses which supply oxygen {{from outside the}} chamber, and discharge the exhaled oxygen-rich gas outside the chamber, using a system equivalent to two <b>demand</b> <b>valves,</b> one upstream of the diver, to supply oxygen on demand, and the other downstream, to exhaust exhaled gas on demand, so that the oxygen partial pressure in the chamber is limited to relatively safe levels. If oxygen masks are used that discharge into the chamber, the chamber air must be replaced frequently to keep the oxygen level within safe operating limits.|$|R
25|$|A {{pressure}} reduction regulator {{is used to}} control the delivery pressure of the gas supplied to a free-flow helmet, in which the flow is continuous, to maintain the downstream pressure which {{is provided by the}} ambient pressure of the exhaust and the flow resistance of the delivery system - mainly the umbilical - and not influenced by the breathing of the diver. Gas reclaim systems use a third kind of regulator to control the flow of exhaled gas to the return hose. Rebreather systems may also use regulators to control the flow of fresh gas, and <b>demand</b> <b>valves,</b> known as automatic diluent valves, to maintain the volume in the breathing loop during descent.|$|R
