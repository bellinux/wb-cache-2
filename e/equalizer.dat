40|$|It {{has been}} shown in the {{literature}} that, with zero-padding prefix (ZPP), the optimum diversity gain of frequency selective channels can be obtained by uncoded signals and zero forcing (ZF) <b>equalizers.</b> In this paper, we derive two important results about linear <b>equalizers</b> over frequency selective channels: 1) With cyclic prefix and any rate- 1 unitary precoding, which includes the uncoded/coded-OFDM/SCFDMA systems as special cases, linear <b>equalizers</b> can only obtain order- 1 diversity; and 2) Although linear <b>equalizers</b> can achieve the optimum diversity order with zero-padding prefix and uncoded signals, the required SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) is an increasing function of the symbol-length. The second result implies that {{we may not be able}} to take advantage of the diversity gain in practice due to the high SNR requirements. Special cases are also investigated to gain some physical insights about the effects of different prefixes on the performance of linear <b>equalizers.</b> The results in this paper can be utilized in the design of up/down-link LTE systems with linear <b>equalizers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental verification}} {{of the impact}} of individual battery equalization on battery life and performance. A study of two battery systems, one equipped with PowerCheq <b>equalizers,</b> a new battery equalization device, and one without, was conducted over 450 charge and discharge cycles simulating an electric scooter drive routine. The data clearly shows that the batteries equipped with the PowerCheq devices (individual battery <b>equalizers)</b> outperformed those with no equalization as well as those employing string equalization. In fact, the battery without the <b>equalizers</b> reached its end of life (80 % of initial capacity) after 140 drive cycles while the one with the <b>equalizers</b> lasted more than 450 drive cycles, thus tripling battery life.
