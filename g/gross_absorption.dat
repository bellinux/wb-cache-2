30|$|The {{hypothesis}} in {{this experiment}} was as follows. When the chitin-hydroxyapatite-fibroin composite is applied as a membrane for guided bone regeneration, the relatively fast degradation of chitin makes room {{for the growth of}} new tissue and increases the opportunity to assimilate hydroxyapatite with the host bone [33]. However, an unabsorbed membrane remained at 8  weeks in the experimental group. This might have been due to containing hydroxyapatite. Although hydroxyapatite is a bioresorbable material, sufficient time for complete absorption is required. According to the report of Jansen et al. [34], depending on the ratio of the hydroxyapatite, at least 4  weeks is required for the identification of <b>gross</b> <b>absorption.</b> At 8  weeks of the experimental group, the time interval might be the cause of the remnant of membranes. The time interval which was set in this study was the result of considering clinical application, where the time intervals of about 6  weeks or longer between the operation and secondary surgery or implantation [35] are generally applied for guided bone regeneration. It might be carefully expected that this problem could be solved, if it is applied for a longer period.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{decomposes}} manufacturing import {{growth rates}} in a selected set of large industrial {{and developing countries}} (five industrial and eight developing) and measures the relative contributions of domestic demand and market share changes for two separate periods 1991 / 92 - 2001 / 02 and 2001 / 02 - 2007 / 08. It also shows the shares of imports both {{from the rest of}} the world and from developing countries for aggregate and three digit manufacturing sectors. Import growth is much higher during the 2000 s driven by higher demand growth rates. While market share changes explain most of the growth during the 1990 s, its contribution is relatively smaller during the 2000 s. Imports from developing countries have grown much faster both in industrial and developing country markets driven primarily by market share changes. However, more than half of market share gains by developing countries are caused by the exports of China which accounts for more than 70 percent of market share gains of developing countries in our sample countries during the 2000 s. Despite rapid growth, developing country’s share in the <b>gross</b> <b>absorption</b> of the sample countries is still very low and can expand substantially even if demand growth is much lower in the near future. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe bioavailabilty of {{selenium}} (Se) from selenium-rich Spirulina (SeSp) {{was assessed}} in Se-deficient rats by measuring tissue Se accumulation and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. For 42 d, rats {{were subjected to}} dietary Se depletion by consumption of a Torula yeast (TY) -based diet with no Se; controls were fed the same diet supplemented with 75 ?g Se/kg diet as sodium selenite. Se-deficient rats were then repleted with Se (75 ?g/kg) {{by the addition of}} sodium selenite, selenomethionine (SeMet) or SeSp to the TY basal diet. Selenium speciation in SeSp emphasized the quasi-absence of selenite (2 % of total Se); organic Se comprised SeMet (? 18 %), with the majority present in the form of two selenoproteins (20 - 30 kDa and 80 kDa). <b>Gross</b> <b>absorption</b> of Se from SeSp was significantly lower than from free SeMet and sodium selenite. SeMet was less effective than sodium selenite in restoring Se concentration in the liver but not in kidney. SeSp was always much less effective. Similarly, Se from SeSp was less effective than the other forms of Se in restoring GSH-Px activity, except in plasma and red blood cells where no differences were noted among the three sources. This was confirmed by measuring the bioavailability of Se by slope-ratio analysis using selenite as the reference form of Se. Although Se from SeSp did not replenish Se concentration and GSH-Px activity in most tissues to the same degree as the other forms of Se, we conclude that it is biologically useful and differently metabolized due to its chemical form...|$|E

40|$|Gore Bio-A {{has been}} {{reported}} to be an ideal synthetic bioabsorbable scaffold material for hernia repair. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of Gore Bio-A in soft tissue augmentation. Six New Zealand white rabbits were used in the study. Five subcutaneous pockets were created on the back of the rabbit, and 20 × 20 [*]mm sized square shaped Gore Bio-A sheets, each 1. 5 [*]mm, 3 [*]mm, 4. 5 [*]mm, 6 [*]mm, and 7. 5 [*]mm in thickness, were implanted into each pocket (1 layer to 5 layers). To analyze the morphologic and histologic changes, the implants were harvested 1, 3, and 6 months after implantation. Following the <b>gross</b> analysis, <b>absorption</b> rate was accelerated with increased implant duration and decreased thickness. Histological analysis of the implants demonstrated progressive neovascularization, fibroblast infiltration, and neocollagenation over time. Six months after implantation, Gore Bio-A was almost absorbed and degenerated, not maintaining its volume. Based on this study, Gore Bio-A was revealed as a biocompatible material; however, it is not suitable for soft tissue augmentation because it is absorbed in the process of changing into soft tissue without maintaining its own volume. Therefore, this material is incomplete and needs more study to overcome this limitation...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{production}} of breath hydrogen {{has been shown}} in premature infants, suggesting limited intestinal capacity for digestion of carbohydrate. To evaluate net absorption of carbohydrate 24 three day balance studies were carried out in seven preterm infants fed pasteurised banked human milk and in 17 preterm infants fed a formula containing 75 % lactose and 25 % glucose polymers. Because carbohydrate reaching the colon may be converted to organic acids by bacterial flora, carbohydrate net absorption was determined by quantitating the faecal excretion of energy derived from carbohydrate. The carbohydrate derived energy content of milk and stools was calculated as the difference between the measured gross energy and the sum of energy related to nitrogen and fat. Faecal loss of carbohydrate derived energy was lower in the group fed formula (1. 9 (SD 1. 2) kcal/kg/day) than in the group fed human milk (4. 0 (SD 1. 8) kcal/kg/day). Net absorption of carbohydrate derived energy was 97. 0 (SD 1. 9) % as opposed to 92. 6 (SD 3. 9) %, respectively. Within each group there was no significant relation between carbohydrate energy absorption and fat, nitrogen, or <b>gross</b> energy <b>absorption.</b> Thus, although less complete with human milk than with formula, apparent absorption of energy derived from carbohydrate seemed quite satisfactory in these preterm infants...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrganophosphate esters (OPEs) {{are widely}} used as flame retardants and {{plasticizers}} and have been detected ubiquitously in the remote atmosphere. Fourteen OPEs were analyzed in 115 aerosol phase samples collected from the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans during the MALASPINA circumnavigation campaign. OPEs were detected in all samples with concentrations ranging from 360 to 4400 pg m– 3 for the sum of compounds. No clear concentration trends {{were found between the}} Northern and Southern hemispheres. The pattern was generally dominated by tris(1 -chloro- 2 -propyl) phosphate (TCPP), although tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) had a predominant role in samples close to continents and in those influenced by air masses originating in continents. The dry deposition fluxes of aerosol phase ∑ 14 OPE ranged from 4 to 140 ng m– 2 d– 1. An estimation of the OPE gas phase concentration and <b>gross</b> <b>absorption</b> fluxes by using three different sets of physical chemical properties suggested that the atmosphere–ocean diffusive exchange of OPEs could be 2 – 3 orders of magnitude larger than dry deposition. The associated organic phosphorus inputs coming from diffusive OPE fluxes were estimated to potentially trigger up to 1. 0 % of the reported primary production in the most oligotrophic oceanic regions. However, the uncertainty associated with these calculations is high and mostly driven by the uncertainty of the physical chemical properties of OPEs. Further constraints of the physical chemical properties and fluxes of OPEs are urgently needed, in order to estimate their environmental fate and relevance as a diffusive source of new organic phosphorus to the ocean...|$|E

40|$|Examination of {{particulate}} {{light absorption}} and microplankton metabolism in 36 northeastern Spanish aquatic ecosystems, ranging from alpine rivers to inland saline lakes {{and the open}} Mediterranean Sea, revealed the existence of general relationships between particulate light absorption and the biomass of phytoplankton and microplankton metabolism. The particulate absorption spectra reflected a dominance of nonphotosynthetic, likely detrital, particles in rivers and a dominance of phytoplankton in coastal lagoons. There was a strong relationship between the light absorbed by phytoplankton and the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration of the systems, which indicated an average (±SE) Chl a specific absorption coefficient of 0. 0233 ± 0. 0020 m 2 · mg Chl a- 1 for these widely diverse systems. Chl a concentration was a weaker predictor of the total particulate light absorption coefficient, pointing to an important role of nonphytoplanktonic particles in light <b>absorption.</b> <b>Gross</b> production was very {{closely related to the}} light absorption coefficient of phytoplankton, whereas community respiration was strongly correlated with the total particulate light absorption coefficient, indicating the optical signatures of sestonic particles to be reliable predictors of planktonic biomass and metabolism in aquatic ecosystems.
