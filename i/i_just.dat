5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> heard {{the track and}} loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E

5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> {{have to play the}} character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm not looking at the audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} <b>I</b> <b>just</b> stood up and I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo.

5|$|I didn't {{even know}} the project was coming out. I didn't know what the beat was for; <b>I</b> <b>just</b> knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent it to them.... When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
5|$|I {{had that}} beat {{actually}} {{before she got}} to the studio. So she came in, she heard that beat and was like, 'Yeah, that's what I want.' That {{was one of the first}} records we had. I didn't really know what to do for her because I didn't hear nothing else that was on the album, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> felt like she didn't have that bounce on her album.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go.

It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E

5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
5|$|The Prank War series, which depicts Blumenfeld and Streeter Seidell as {{they play}} a series of {{escalating}} practical jokes on each other, became popular {{and led to the}} two appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2009.

5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E

5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show me what he could do. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E

Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E
