25|$|On June 16, 2009, Judge Burton Lifland {{approved}} the settlement between Picard and Banco Santander SA's Optimal Investment Services. The Optimal SUS fund, one of Madoff's largest feeder funds, {{agreed to pay}} $235 million, about 85% of the $285 million that the Geneva-based hedge fund group redeemed in the 90 days before Madoff was arrested. As of December 2008, Santander had $3.2 billion of clients' money invested with Madoff, a relationship that started in 1996. The fund continues to have claims against Madoff's estate. The largest Spanish bank earned nearly $100 million in management fees in 2006 and 2007 combined selling the <b>feeder</b> <b>fund.</b> Santander lost €17 million ($23.8 million) of its own money. 70% of its affected clients are in Latin America. In April, Santander offered its clients compensation for losses from the fraud, and 93% of clients affected by the Madoff fraud had accepted, which it originally valued at €1.38 billion. The offer has been widely criticized.|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Cox, {{the former}} SEC chairman, has {{recognized}} the organization's multiple failures {{in relation to}} the Bernard Madoff fraud. Starting with an investigation in 1992 into a Madoff <b>feeder</b> <b>fund</b> that only invested with Madoff, and which, according to the SEC, promised [...] "curiously steady" [...] returns, the SEC did not investigate indications that something was amiss in Madoff's investment firm. [...] The SEC has been accused of missing numerous red flags and ignoring tips on Madoff's alleged fraud.|$|E

This structure is increasingly being challenged by institutional investors and other stakeholders [...] to implement more independent governance and investor friendly mechanisms typically in the form of advisory boards or independent GPs or managing members.|$|E

[...] The lawsuit alleges {{the bank of}} aiding Madoff's crime by maintaining his checking accounts and trading with his brokerage firm long after the bank {{realized that he was}} running a vast fraud. In September 2008, Morgan Chase began withdrawing $250 million of its own money from the Sentry funds operated by the Fairfield Greenwich Group, a Madoff <b>feeder</b> <b>fund.</b> If the bank had terminated Madoff's accounts then, the plaintiffs would not have lost their money.|$|E
