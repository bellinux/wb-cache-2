50|$|In {{the novel}} The Journeyer by Gary Jennings, an executioner {{explains}} {{to the main}} character, Marco Polo, that 1,000 pieces of paper are placed in a container, and a paper is drawn out to determine where the cut will be made. For this procedure, there are 333 <b>designated</b> <b>body</b> parts, and each part is represented three times, {{for a total of}} 999 slips of paper, with the 1,000th paper representing immediate death. In the case of a finger, if the first paper drawn denoted a particular finger, the digit would be removed at the first joint; the second time a paper is drawn indicating the same finger, another section to the next joint is amputated. The third paper related to the same finger would indicate final amputation. Jennings also fictionalises in the book that, in an extended form of the torture, the body parts and blood are fed to the condemned as his only nourishment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gameplay}} {{revolves around}} one thing: sucking {{blood from the}} Yamada family while they go about their everyday business. However, the player can only suck from a <b>designated</b> <b>body</b> area which will only be available at specific times. Each family member follows a set looping pattern of movements. By following these movements, the player must fill a quota of blood for each stage. The challenge in bloodsucking is that each victim has a [...] "stress meter". The player must {{make sure that the}} victim stays unaware. Sucking too fast or too slow will increase the victim's stress level. If Mister Mosquito is swatted while sucking blood, instant death occurs. If the player is noticed by a victim while flying around, Battle Mode begins, involved like boss battle. The victim tries to attack Mister Mosquito through various means. To calm them, the player must hit a number of pressure points, relieving them of tension. Once they are relaxed enough, they return to their business.|$|E

40|$|In {{looking at}} the videos of the Indonesian tsunami coming ashore at various locations, I thought, “That’s {{a lot of water}} with a lot of {{momentum}}, and that’s what does the damage. ” Perhaps the momentum of a tsunami might be a physical quantity to focus on. Only external forces on the <b>designated</b> <b>body</b> of water create its momentum. Within the body of water, turbulence, internal friction and laminar flow involve internal forces and are not relevant. This could be particularly useful in the generating area. There could be external forces on a <b>designated</b> <b>body</b> of water from a landslide, a pyroclastic flow, an explosion, from steam generation and from chunks of matter falling into the ocean. The horizontal components of those forces result in horizontal momentums. Ultimately when the wave moves out from the generating area and the internal turbulence and laminar flow get dissipated by friction, in the remaining long wave motion the wave height is simply related to the horizontal momentum. The horizontal momentum contribution to the directionality of the wave would be narrower than that due only to the initial vertical displacement. Focusing on the momentum description of the tsunami introduces many new kinds of physical problems that are interesting in themselves...|$|E
