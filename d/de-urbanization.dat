5000|$|Counterurbanization, or <b>de-urbanization,</b> is a {{demographic}} and social process whereby people move from urban areas to rural areas. It is, like suburbanization, {{inversely related to}} urbanization. It first occurred {{as a reaction to}} inner-city deprivation and overcrowding. Initial studies of counterurbanization were carried out by human geographer Brian Berry.

50|$|The book {{focuses on}} {{the decline of the}} towns and their {{desertion}} in late ancient and early medieval India on the basis of archaeological evidence. The author has material remains to study crafts, commerce and coinage, and identifies and illustrates signs of growth and decay for more than 130 excavated sites. The strata with poor remains are taken to indicate decrease in construction, manufacturing and commercial activities, and are hence associated with <b>de-urbanization.</b> The reasons for the urban eclipse are sought not only in the fall of empires but also in social disorder and the loss of long-distance trade. The disintegration of the town life is seen not as social regression but as part of the social transformation which generated classical feudalism and promoted rural expansion. The book explores the link between urban decay and land grants to officials, priests, temples and monasteries. It shows how the landed elements collected surplus and services directly from the peasants, and remunerated artisan servicing castes through land grants and grain supply. The monograph should interest students of pre-modern urban history and those who study processes of change in economy and society in Gupta and post-Gupta times. It may also provide basic information on the urban horizons of excavated sites {{during the second half of}} the first millennium BC and the following six centuries AD.|$|E

40|$|Industrialization was the {{catalyst}} {{for the growth of}} cities in Southeast Asia, in particular Malaysia. However, in many cities industrialization has peaked and is now declining. This raises the issue of increased urban poverty as a significant problem facing these cities in the 21 st century. Evidence from other developing countries is that faced with the choice of urban poverty or rural subsistence, {{there appears to be a}} trend towards <b>de-urbanization.</b> As Malaysia is unique in imposing laws that protect rural land ownership, this study investigates the capacity of the available land to absorb migrants from the city and seeks to identify whether the returning migrants have the capabilities required to maintain a subsistence lifestyle. This paper presents a case study analyzing the trends of urban to rural migration in Malaysia. An audit of land capacity was carried out in a typical kampong and an investigation of the capability of migrants has been done in both urban and rural areas. In conclusion, this study has found that the land abandoned by the rural-urban migration of the 1970 s is available and remains accessible for future use. The findings also identified several examples of returnees who have shown that they have adapted well to a rural lifestyle. The results indicate that there is evidence that <b>de-urbanization</b> can result in a sustainable lifestyle through subsistence living in Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} of urbanization affecting {{the modern world}} have seen {{the explosion of the}} city and the transformation of compact and well defined structures in agglomerations with a seamlessly expansion. This has sparked a number of social and economic consequences that have impacted on the city, on the urbanized areas, and on the surroundings. The usage of the term “sprawl” to define the process of expansion of the human agglomerations dates back to eighty years ago, about, and from that period countless researches were done on the argument, also if it is open the question about the future trends of the city; if it is clear that the expansive model is still winning, it is equally necessary to identify new models that can better interpret the needs for a new attention to the territory and its environment. For this purpose the paper explores the feasible use of the scenario analysis as tool for defining the potential evolutionary paths of the city. Particular attention is placed on the construction of de-urbanization’s scenarios, namely the set of reorganization’s hypotheses of urban structures focused on the compaction of their physical size and on the maximizing of the number of residents and users. The paper seeks to deepen the possible trajectories of <b>de-urbanization</b> and of urban and territorial reorganization stretched to reverse the diffusion and expansive processes at the metropolitan level. The paper initially defines the characters of the {{processes of}} urbanization, also with reference to some research’s models.

40|$|The {{province}} of Zeeland in the Netherlands de-urbanized {{in the eighteenth}} and nineteenth century. In 1750 almost half of the population in Zeeland lived in one of the three major cities (Middelburg, Vlissingen and Zierikzee). One century later no more than one third of the population lived in these three cities. This was caused by a strong economic and demographic decline of Middelburg, Vlissingen and Zierikzee and by a population growth in the countryside. Hence, the balance between the city and countryside changed dramatically. This thesis analyses the cultural changes during this process of <b>de-urbanization</b> and in particular the changes in the cultural balance between city and countryside in Zeeland. The general conclusion is that the countryside and its inhabitants gained in importance in Zeeland culture from {{the second half of the}} eighteenth century. Although the cities dominated the public sphere that evolved in this period, from the 1780 s associational culture spread over the countryside. Most members of rural reading and other societies were gentlemen farmers who in the eighteenth century had achieved such a wealth that they could achieve the necessary cultural capital to participate in the public sphere. An analysis of material culture in Zeeland shows that at the end of the eighteenth century the rural population started to distinguish themselves from townspeople by creating a distinctive rural lifestyle. The countryside, in particular its economy and its folk-culture, became at the same a popular topic in provincial public debate. The debate on agriculture resulted in 1843 in the founding of the Zeeland Society for the promotion of Agriculture and Cattle-breeding. Furthermore, from the 1830 s the countryside and its traditional costumes, folk-customs and dialects turned into an essential ingredient of the self-image of Zeeland. However, the <b>de-urbanization</b> of Zeeland did not cause this growing attention for the countryside in Zeeland by itself. Mainly, it was made possible by changes in European thought concerning the balance between city and countryside in human history. New ideas about concepts like equality, citizenship, civilization and progress resulted in Zeeland, as elsewhere in Europe, in the ‘discovery’ of the countryside. It were these international intellectual changes in combination with regional economic developments that resulted in the growing importance of the countryside in Zeeland culture...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{economic}} development has induced urbanization in China. Urbanization and deurbanization strategies co-exist {{in most of}} China's mountain regions. Urbanization typically occurs in famous scenic spots and {{in the vicinity of}} macro engineering works, while <b>de-urbanization</b> is implemented in large areas by the government to protect the natural environment. Over-urbanization has considerable impacts on the esthetic qualities of many mountain tourist resorts and sometimes even destroys the natural state of landscapes and ecosystems. Administrative gaps and omissions of the central government in managing the development of mountain parks and world heritage sites are responsible for over-urbanization in mountains. The search by local governments for short-term economic benefits is also a driving force of over-urbanization. The present article recommends that regulations and laws be developed to effectively assess and monitor the state of parks and world heritage sites in mountains. Institutions with sufficient authority must be set up to legally supervise and protect the natural state of parks and heritage sites in mountains, {{for the benefit of the}} Chinese people and the entire world...|$|E

This 1. 3 % was not able to answer the social demands of the population that grew 2. 2 % per year. The IMF pressures encourages the countries to return to accumulation regimes based on primary exportation modes which strengthen the concentration of economic groups, and has plead for decentralization of the State and privatization -a. o. of city services- in order to raise productivity standards. This is noticed in the urban structure, the accentuation of fragmentation of the build environment, the <b>de-urbanization</b> pattern, and the rapid modernization and -verticalization- of some given areas.

40|$|The main {{research}} {{objective is to}} decipher the role of both water conditions and water conflicts in the interplay of the rural settlements and productive landscapes that constitute the Chia-Nan Plain, Taiwan. Consequently, the research considers Taiwans (r) urban design from three main perspectives: (1) rural water management; (2) vulnerable productive landscapes; and (3) fragmentated peri-urban settlements. The rural economies of Taiwan have been experiencing a shift from agriculture to high-technology industry, while the rural population remained stable and aging. Therefore, the research focuses on the challenges regarding the environmental and economic transformations of the rural areas in the Chia-Nan Plain. The research applies descriptive and interpretive mapping methodologies to review the patterns of interactions between cultivation behaviours and rural settlement morphologies in the Chia-Nan Plainthe rice basket of Taiwan. The research furthermore discusses the crucial logics behind the formation of settlements in this region {{as a result of}} rural-urban interactions. Hence, three layers (water, productive landscape, and scales of production) in the productive surface, that are critical to the spatial environment, are highlighted in the research. These three layers characterize its social and spatial networks for territorial development, and build up the fundamental structures and activities of the region. Three new hypotheses in the form of urban design investigations, are tested: (1) a qualitative water landscape which could guide the deurbanization in the post-agricultural regions; (2) a qualitative water productive landscape that could be an engine of new rural economic development; and (3) new scales of production which could change land patterns. The design research for the Chia-Nan plain concentrates mainly on the ability of the potential new rural settlement forms to adapt to the contemporary requirements that result from climate change and economic shifts. Extreme weather conditions, such as floods and droughts, are both new realities. The increasing frequency of storms has led to massive floods in both low-lying fields and along the coastline, and droughts have resulted in a fight of water usage between agriculture and high-technology industry. The research employs two case studies to discuss two different water-related productive landscapes (paddy and aquatic landscapes), and explores how innovative urban design propositions and water management measures in these territories can be adapted to benefit the environment. The areas investigated by these two case studies are located in two different geographical conditionsplain and coastal areasof the Chia-Nan Plain. They face two different challenges, namely water retention and land subsidence. The two case studies are initiated by historical analysis and the deciphering of contemporary projects, via-a-vis layered narratives and contested territories of specific sites. Design research concludes the two studies, that intend to innovate an approach for Taiwans urban design and water management in the interplay of rural settlements and productive landscapes. They verify the three hypotheses. In short, the research uses research by design. It explores spatial strategies that aim to have the potential to meet the changes of contemporary society and steer necessary environmental transformations. The research therefore draws on and contributes to the field of landscape urbanism in Asian agrarian territories, which are currently undergoing unprecedented transformation, in speed, scale and scope. The research will enable new possibilities for a productive terrain to generate new public realm, which can be used by urban and landscape designs to structure a deurbanizing agrarian territory.
