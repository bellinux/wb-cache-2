5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} involved an <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend the separation of powers.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} non-compliance with the procedures set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that is, power without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E

5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> political power, but she feared that the irresponsible <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E

40|$|Training <b>exercises</b> <b>of</b> {{recovery}} of sportsmen include both exercises implying hig- her level <b>of</b> training and <b>exercises</b> <b>of</b> optimal {{recovery of}} sportsmen. In order to use training <b>exercises</b> <b>of</b> recovery best {{way it is}} necessary to know how they react to the body of a sportsman concerning their character and length. It is also necessary to take into consideration the fact that human body adapts equally both to burden and adequ- ate recovery exercises. To increase the efficiency <b>of</b> training <b>exercises</b> <b>of</b> recovery it is inevitable to use different exercises and methods changing their use, that is, they should be applied in a complex way considering their change depending on sport activities and structure of training process. The aim of the study is to check and analyse attitudes of fooyball players of different ranks towards training <b>exercises</b> <b>of</b> recovery. The sample of examinees consists of 120 footballers of different ranks (super league of Serbia = 43, the first league of Serbia = 40 and Serbian league = 37). The sample of variables consists of the system of 10 attitudes (claims), and each attitude (claim) consists of 5 verbal ca- tegories (marked from - 2 to + 2). To determine multivariate and univariate significance of differences between footballers of different competition ranks multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been ap- plied. Concerning the attitudes <b>of</b> training <b>exercises</b> <b>of</b> recovery statistically significant differences were got between the groups where 7 out of 10 attitudes were different. Con- cerning the correlation two types of attitudes were noticed.

5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E

5|$|In Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the appellants {{had been}} {{detained}} without trial under section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act ("ISA") for alleged {{involvement in a}} Marxist conspiracy to subvert and destabilize the country. The detention orders were subsequently suspended under section 10 of the Act, but the suspensions were revoked following {{the release of a}} press statement by the appellants in which they denied being Marxist conspirators. Having applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for writs of habeas corpus to be issued, the appellants appealed against the ruling. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the narrow ground that the Government had not adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proving the President was satisfied that the appellants' detention was necessary to prevent them from endangering, among other things, Singapore's security or public order, which was required by section 8(1) of the ISA before the Minister for Home Affairs could make detention orders against them. However, in a lengthy obiter discussion, the Court held that an objective rather than a subjective test should apply to the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> discretion by the authorities under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. In other words, the executive could not insist that the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> the discretion was unchallengeable. The <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> discretion could be reviewed by the court, and the executive had to satisfy the court that there were objective facts justifying its decision.|$|E
