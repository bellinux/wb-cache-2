5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident.

I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E

Later, Peter meets with Gwen at {{their high school}} graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her father, ends their relationship. Peter's childhood friend, Harry Osborn, returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, Norman, CEO of OsCorp. Norman explains his <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies and Harry is appointed the new OsCorp CEO.|$|E
40|$|It {{has become}} common to say {{psychiatric}} <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> brain diseases. This reflects {{a conception of}} the mental as being biologically based, though it is also thought that thinking of psychiatric illness this way will reduce the stigma attached to psychiatric illness. If psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> brain diseases, however, {{it is not clear}} why psychiatry should not collapse into neurology, and some argue for this course. Others try to maintain a distinction by saying that neurology deals with abnormalities of neural structure while psychiatry deals with specific abnormalities of neural functioning. It is not clear that neurologists would accept this division, nor that they should. I argue that if we take seriously the notion that psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> mental <b>illnesses</b> we can draw a more defensible boundary between psychiatry and neurology. As mental illnesses, psychiatric illnesses must have symptoms that affect our mental capacities and that the sufferer is capable of being aware of, even if they are not always self-consciously aware of them. Neurological illnesses, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, may be diagnosed even if they are silent, just as the person may not be aware of having high blood pressure or may suffer a silent myocardial infarction. It does not make sense to speak of panic disorder if the person has never had a panic attack, however, or of bipolar disorder in the absence of mood swings. This does not mean psychiatric <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> not biologically based. Mental <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> <b>illnesses</b> of persons, whereas other <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> <b>illnesses</b> of biological individuals...|$|R

5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea.

5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> {{distinguished}} into categories {{of natural and}} unnatural <b>illnesses.</b> Natural <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> based on sicknesses derived that involve external conditions. Examples of natural illnesses include from exposure to extreme temperatures of hot or cold or transmission of microbes from contaminated sources. Unnatural <b>illnesses</b> <b>are</b> described as sicknesses being obtained {{due to the lack}} of commitment to one’s faith. The lack of commitment whether it be by sin or a lack of attention to religious practices, the Lord would retract his protection over the individual; thus, making him susceptible to evil influences and ultimately <b>illnesses.</b> It <b>is</b> believed by multiple cultural groups.  Evil influences include supernatural forces as well as vengeful spirits - both ancestral and non-ancestral spirits.|$|R

5|$|Mary's son by Darnley, James, {{was born}} on 19 June 1566 in Edinburgh Castle, but the murder of Rizzio led inevitably to the {{breakdown}} of her marriage. In October 1566, while staying at Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders, Mary made a journey on horseback of at least four hours each way to visit the Earl of Bothwell at Hermitage Castle, where he lay ill from wounds sustained in a skirmish with border reivers. The ride was later used as evidence by Mary's enemies that the two were lovers, though no suspicions were voiced {{at the time and}} Mary had been accompanied by her councillors and guards. Immediately after her return to Jedburgh, she suffered a serious illness that included frequent vomiting, loss of sight, loss of speech, convulsions and periods of unconsciousness. She was thought to be near death or dying. Her recovery from 25 October onwards was credited to the skill of her French physicians. The cause of her <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> unknown; diagnoses include physical exhaustion and mental stress, haemorrhage of a gastric ulcer, and porphyria.|$|E
5|$|Part Three {{starts with}} the prefectural tournament still in progress. After another win by Seishu, Akane is hospitalized due to an {{unspecified}} illness. Initially, Akaishi's play is affected by worrying about Akane's condition. Ko continues to perform well and promises Akane {{to go on a}} date with her if Seishu reaches Koshien. However, Akane's <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> more severe than expected, and she is scheduled for surgery {{on the morning of the}} prefectural final against Ryuō. Before the game begins, Ko tells Aoba he loves her more than anyone, but in such a way she thinks he is lying until after Seishu wins in extra innings, clinching a Koshien berth. In the final chapter, the morning before traveling to Koshien, Akaishi visits Akane recovering in the hospital and Ko and Aoba head for the train station holding hands.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E

5|$|It is {{gradually}} revealed that Ruka's father Souya had {{become obsessed with}} helping complete a ritual dance that would purify the islanders of the Hidden Moon Disease, which required {{the construction of a}} special mask for the dancer. Ruka herself became infected, and was treated at the sanatorium along with the other girls and the dancer, Haibara's sister Sakuya. The ritual was a catastrophic failure, with Sakuya reaching the final stage of the Hidden Moon Disease and falling into a coma, while the other girls collapsed and had their memories wiped. Two years after Ruka and Sayaka left the island, Sakuya woke and spread the Hidden Moon Disease across the island, killing all the inhabitants including Souya. To lay her to rest, the ritual must be completed, and for that her mask must be restored. Ruka comes into possession of all the mask fragments, which reform into the complete mask. Confronting Sakuya atop the island's lighthouse, she manages to pacify her with a sacred tune communicated to her by Sayaka, then Chōshirō puts the mask on Sakuya, completing the ritual and allowing all the island's spirits to pass into the afterlife. Depending on the game's difficulty setting, Misaki's fate is either left unknown, or her <b>illness</b> <b>is</b> cured after she is saved by Madoka's spirit and she leaves the island with Ruka.|$|E
