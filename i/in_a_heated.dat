5|$|Japan's {{population}} {{is expected to}} drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> debate over {{how to cope with}} this problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000.|$|E
5|$|For the 1920 season, Maryland {{played in}} the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). Meanwhile, members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) were locked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> debate over whether first-year {{students}} should be eligible to play football. The larger schools, in general, were against the practice, and eventually the disagreement resulted in a schism within the SIAA. Eight teams from the SIAA split to form the Southern Conference: Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Mississippi State, and Tennessee. They were joined by six non-SIAA members: North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Washington & Lee, and Maryland. Maryland would remain within the Southern Conference {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E
5|$|MacBride {{entered the}} navy after serving on {{merchant}} vessels and distinguished {{himself in a}} number of actions during the Seven Years' War, including cutting out a privateer, which secured him the rank of post-captain {{by the end of the}} conflict. He was instrumental in establishing and securing a British settlement on the Falkland Islands in the years of peace which followed, and also performed service to the Royal Family by transporting the King's sister, Caroline Matilda. Still in active service by the outbreak of war with the American colonies, MacBride took command of a ship of the line and saw action in engagements under Keppel and Rodney. He was also active against privateers, capturing the Comte d'Artois <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> battle off the Irish coast. Further service followed with Parker's fleet against the Dutch and with Barrington in the Channel.|$|E

5|$|Nicolls {{contributed to}} these post-war {{diplomatic}} {{tensions between the}} United Kingdom and the United States, by attempting to represent {{the interests of the}} Native Americans and blacks who had taken up arms on the British side. Prior to returning to Great Britain, Nicolls engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> exchange of letters with U.S. Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins. Hawkins accused Nicolls of being overzealous and of overstepping his authority in his personal defence of Redstick Creeks, Seminoles, and their Marron Creole allies, who some Americans in authority viewed as nothing more than runaway slaves and lost or unclaimed property.|$|E
5|$|Parliament met in February 1308 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> atmosphere. Edward {{was eager}} to discuss the {{potential}} for governmental reform, but the barons were unwilling to begin any such debate until the problem of Gaveston had been resolved. Violence seemed likely, but the situation was resolved through the mediation of the moderate Henry de Lacy, the Earl of Lincoln, who convinced the barons to back down. A fresh parliament was held in April, where the barons once again criticised Gaveston, demanding his exile, this time supported by Isabella and the French monarchy. Edward resisted, but finally acquiesced, agreeing to send Gaveston to Aquitaine, under threat of excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury should he return. At the last moment, Edward {{changed his mind and}} instead sent Gaveston to Dublin, appointing him as the Lieutenant of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has {{a soft spot for}} animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E

5|$|The away team scans Armus' energy field, {{finding that}} when Armus engulfs {{the shuttle and}} speaks to Troi, expressing his remorse and pity, the field disrupting their {{transporter}} signals is weakened which could allow them to beam Troi and the pilot out of the shuttle. After Armus toys with Troi by completely engulfing Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Captain Picard beams down to speak to Armus directly, sending {{the rest of the}} away team to the ship. Picard engages Armus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> discussion to discover its motive, which is to seek revenge on those that abandoned it on Vagra II. Armus is riled to a point where the energy field is dissipated enough, allowing for Picard, Troi and the pilot to be safely beamed back to the Enterprise. After destroying the shuttlecraft from orbit, Picard orders a quarantine on Vagra II.|$|E
5|$|Wrestling with a {{lumberjack}} gimmick, he {{debuted in}} Stampede Wrestling with his kayfabe brother, Paul LeDuc. The pair later won several titles in Montreal, where they feuded with the Rougeau wrestling family, and Florida, where {{they held the}} NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. After an injury ended Paul's career, LeDuc competed as a singles wrestler and involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> feud with Dusty Rhodes. LeDuc then moved to Tennessee, where he had a rivalry with Jerry Lawler over the NWA Mid-America Southern Tag Team Championship, notably legitimately breaking Lawler's leg when he threw him over the top rope onto the announcer's desk.|$|E
5|$|Blue Velvet premiered in {{competition}} at the Montréal World Film Festival in August 1986, and at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on September 12, 1986, {{and a few days}} later in the United States. It debuted commercially in both countries on September 19, 1986, in 98 theatres across the United States. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $789,409. It eventually expanded to another 15 theatres, and domestically grossed a total of $8,551,228. Blue Velvet was met with uproar during its audience reception, with lines formed around city blocks in New York City and Los Angeles. There were reports of mass walkouts and refund demands during its opening week. At a Chicago screening, a man fainted and had to have his pacemaker changed. Upon completion, he returned to the cinema to see the ending. At a Los Angeles cinema, two strangers became engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> disagreement, but decided to resolve the disagreement in order to return to the theatre.|$|E

Aerosmith decided to go on tour during {{a break in the}} {{recording}} schedule but tensions within the band were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to Cleveland Stadium on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the World Series of Rock festival. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> argument backstage, Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument Perry quit the band and left (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). In leaving, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure Perry formed a new band called the Joe Perry Project.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc's {{next stop}} was in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), where he resumed teaming with Paul LeDuc. Wrestling {{under the name}} The Canadian Lumberjacks, they were soon pushed to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in December 1973 by {{defeating}} Dusty Rhodes and Dick Slater. They defended the belts for two months before dropping them to Slater and his new partner Stan Vachon, a kayfabe brother of the Vachons from Montreal. This was the final time the LeDuc's held a title together, as Paul LeDuc sustained a legitimate injury that forced Jos to wrestle without him. Jos LeDuc also wrestled as a singles competitor in Florida. He was booked to win the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship by defeating Rhodes in late 1973. He dropped the title to Rhodes in January 1974, however. LeDuc and Rhodes were placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> feud at this time, and they frequently faced each other in Death matches.|$|E
5|$|Mephisto and Averno {{defeated}} Atlantis and Blue Panther for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> {{match on}} April 2, 2005. The team would defend the tag team titles {{several times over}} the next year in some very well received matches that led to several reporters labeling them {{as one of the best}} Mexican tag teams in the 21st century. Their most prominent defense was on the last Arena México show of 2005 when they defeated El Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas in the main event. In early 2006, they defended their titles against Místico and Black Warrior twice. In the first match, they won by disqualification when Black Warrior interfered in the match after being pinned. In the second match two weeks later, Black Warrior turned on Místico, starting a long-running storyline between the two. On April 14, 2006, they lost the tag team championship to the team of Místico and Negro Casas, ending their year-long reign.|$|E

5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained {{and to reduce}} the amount of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>heated</b> {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E
