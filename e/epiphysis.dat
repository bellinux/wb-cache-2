5|$|X-rays show lucency of the {{ossification}} {{front in}} juveniles. In older people, the lesion typically appears {{as an area}} of osteosclerotic bone with a radiolucent line between the osteochondral defect and the <b>epiphysis.</b> The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and {{on the amount of}} knee flexion used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the site of an OCD lesion.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an <b>epiphysis</b> and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
25|$|Legg {{believed}} {{the cause was}} impairment of blood supply to the femoral <b>epiphysis,</b> Calve believed rickets, and Perthes deduced an infection possibly causing degenerative arthritis leads to LCP disease. Currently, {{a number of factors}} have been implicated, including heredity, trauma, endocrine dysfunction, inflammation, nutrition, and altered circulatory hemodynamics.|$|E
25|$|During puberty, bones become {{harder and}} more brittle. At the {{conclusion}} of puberty, {{the ends of the}} long bones close during the process called <b>epiphysis.</b> There can be ethnic differences in these skeletal changes. For example, in the United States of America, bone density increases significantly more among black than white adolescents, which might account for decreased likelihood of black women developing osteoporosis and having fewer bone fractures there.|$|E
25|$|X-ray imaging {{of the hip}} is {{most often}} unremarkable. Subtle {{radiographic}} signs include an accentuated pericapsular shadow, widening of the medial joint space, lateral displacement of the femoral epiphyses with surface flattening (Waldenström sign), prominent obturator shadow, diminution of soft tissue planes around the hip joint or slight demineralisation of the proximal femur. The main reason for radiographic examination is to exclude bony lesions such as occult fractures, slipped upper femoral <b>epiphysis</b> or bone tumours (such as osteoid osteoma). An anteroposterior and frog lateral (Lauenstein) view of the pelvis and both hips is advisable.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{fracture}}s, {{such as a}} toddler's fracture (spiral {{fracture of}} the shin bone), can also cause pain and limp, but are uncommon around the hip joint. Soft tissue injuries can be evident when bruises are present. Muscle or ligament injuries can be contracted during heavy physical activity —however, {{it is important not}} to miss a slipped upper femoral <b>epiphysis.</b> Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease) typically occurs in children aged 4–8, and is also more common in boys. There may be an effusion on ultrasound, similar to transient synovitis.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{of the hip}} {{may suggest}} and/or verify the diagnosis. X-rays usually {{demonstrate}} a flattened, and later fragmented, femoral head. A bone scan or MRI {{may be useful in}} making the diagnosis in those cases where X-rays are inconclusive. Usually, plain radiographic changes are delayed 6 weeks or more from clinical onset, so bone scintigraphy and MRI are done for early diagnosis. MRI results are more accurate, i.e. 97 to 99% against 88 to 93% in plain radiography. If MRI or bone scans are necessary, a positive diagnosis relies upon patchy areas of vascularity to the capital femoral <b>epiphysis</b> (the developing femoral head).|$|E
2500|$|The pineal gland, {{also known}} as the conarium or <b>epiphysis</b> cerebri, is a small {{endocrine}} gland in the vertebrate brain. The pineal gland produces melatonin, a serotonin derived hormone which modulates sleep patterns in both circadian and seasonal cycles.The shape of the gland resembles a pine cone, hence its name. [...] The pineal gland is located in the epithalamus, {{near the center of the}} brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join.|$|E
2500|$|The {{causes of}} limping are many {{and can be}} either serious or non-serious. [...] It usually results from pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a {{skeletal}} deformity. [...] In 30% of cases, the underlying cause remains unknown after appropriate investigations. [...] The most common underlying cause of limping in children is minor physical trauma. [...] In those with no history of trauma, 40% are due to transient synovitis and 2% are from Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome. Other important causes are infectious arthritis, osteomyelitis, and slipped capital femoral <b>epiphysis</b> in children.|$|E
2500|$|Slipped capital femoral <b>epiphysis</b> (SCFE) is a {{condition}} in which the growth plate of the head of the femur slips over the underlying bone. [...] It most commonly presents with hip pain in males during puberty and is associated with obesity. [...] The majority of people affected have a painful limp and in half of cases both hips are affected. [...] Nearly a quarter of people present with only knee pain. [...] Treatment involves non-weight-bearing movement and surgery. [...] If not identified early, osteonecrosis or death of the head of the femur may occur.|$|E
2500|$|A limp {{is a type}} of {{asymmetric}} abnormality of the gait. Limping may {{be caused}} by pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity. [...] The most common underlying cause of a painful limp is physical trauma; however, in the absence of trauma, other serious causes, such as septic arthritis or slipped capital femoral <b>epiphysis,</b> may be present. [...] The diagnostic approach involves ruling out potentially serious causes via the use of X-rays, blood tests, and sometimes joint aspiration. Initial treatment involves pain management. [...] A limp is the presenting problem in about 4% of children who visit hospital emergency departments.|$|E
2500|$|Long {{bones are}} {{characterized}} by a shaft, the diaphysis, that is much longer than its width; and by an <b>epiphysis,</b> a rounded head {{at each end of}} the shaft. They are made up mostly of compact bone, with lesser amounts of marrow, located within the medullary cavity, and areas of spongy, cancellous bone at the ends of the bones. [...] Most bones of the limbs, including those of the fingers and toes, are long bones. The exceptions are the eight carpal bones of the wrist, the seven articulating tarsal bones of the ankle and the sesamoid bone of the kneecap. Long bones such as the clavicle, that have a differently shaped shaft or ends are also called modified long bones.|$|E
2500|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease (LCPD) is a {{childhood}} hip disorder initiated by {{a disruption of}} {{blood flow to the}} ball of the femur called the femoral head. [...] Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing. [...] Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head. [...] The bone loss leads to some degree of collapse and deformity of the femoral head and sometimes secondary changes to the shape of the hip socket. It is also referred to as idiopathic avascular osteonecrosis of the capital femoral <b>epiphysis</b> of the femoral head since the cause of the interruption of the blood supply of the head of the femur in the hip joint is unknown.|$|E

50|$|Slipped capital femoral <b>epiphysis</b> (SCFE or skiffy, slipped upper femoral <b>epiphysis,</b> SUFE or souffy, {{coxa vara}} adolescentium) {{is a medical}} term {{referring}} to a fracture through the growth plate (physis), which results in slippage of the overlying end of the femur (<b>epiphysis).</b> Normally, {{the head of the}} femur, called the capital, should sit squarely on the femoral neck. Abnormal movement along the growth plate results in the slip. The femoral <b>epiphysis</b> remains in the acetabulum (hip socket), while the metaphysis (end of the femur) move in an anterior direction with external rotation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>epiphysis</b> (...) is {{the rounded}} {{end of a}} long bone, at its joint with {{adjacent}} bone(s). Between the <b>epiphysis</b> and diaphysis (the long midsection of the long bone) lies the metaphysis, including the epiphyseal plate (growth plate). At the joint, the <b>epiphysis</b> is covered with articular cartilage; below that covering is a zone similar to the epiphyseal plate, known as [...] bone.|$|E
50|$|Ossification commences in {{the lower}} end in the second year, and in the upper about the fourth year. The lower <b>epiphysis,</b> the first to ossify, unites with the body about the twentieth year; the upper <b>epiphysis</b> joins about the twenty-fifth year.|$|E
50|$|The {{center for}} the upper <b>epiphysis</b> appears before or shortly after birth at close to 34 weeks gestation; it is {{flattened}} in form, and has a thin tongue-shaped process in front, which forms the tuberosity; that for the lower <b>epiphysis</b> appears in the second year.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure epiphysis: The {{region of}} the long bone that forms the joint is a {{pressure}} <b>epiphysis</b> (e.g. {{the head of the}} femur, part of the hip joint complex). Pressure epiphyses assist in transmitting the weight of the human body and are the regions of the bone that are under pressure during movement or locomotion. Another example of a pressure <b>epiphysis</b> {{is the head of the}} humerus which is part of the shoulder complex. condyles of femur and tibia also comes under the pressure <b>epiphysis.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{secondary}} centres generally {{appear at}} the <b>epiphysis.</b> Secondary ossification mostly occurs after birth (except for distal femur and proximal tibia which occurs during 9th month of fetal development). The epiphyseal arteries and osteogenic cells invade the <b>epiphysis,</b> depositing osteoblasts and osteoclasts which erode the cartilage and build bone. This occurs {{at both ends of}} long bones but only one end of digits and ribs.|$|E
50|$|Purpose of the {{treatment}} is {{the removal of the}} <b>epiphysis</b> that causes the abnormal growth of the wrist. This is done by making a small incision at the volar-radial side. This approach passes the Flexor pollicis longus and Palmaris longus and leaves the Median nerve and Radial artery protected. Then the Pronator quadratus muscle is found and detached from the radius. Here a cut into the bone will find the abnormal <b>epiphysis.</b> When the <b>epiphysis</b> is clearly defined more bone is removed so the radius is in its normal position and prevents a new bone bar from forming. This {{is the end of the}} physiolisis. This is always combined with a Vickers Ligament release.|$|E
50|$|The {{fracture}} {{occurs at}} the hypertrophic zone of the physeal cartilage. Stress on the hip causes the <b>epiphysis</b> to move posteriorly and medially. By convention, position and alignment in SCFE is described by referring to {{the relationship of the}} proximal fragment (capital femoral <b>epiphysis)</b> to the normal distal fragment (femoral neck). Because the physis has yet to close, the blood supply to the <b>epiphysis</b> still should be derived from the femoral neck; however, this late in childhood, the supply is tenuous and frequently lost after the fracture occurs. Manipulation of the fracture frequently results in osteonecrosis and the acute loss of articular cartilage (chondrolysis) because of the tenuous nature of the blood supply.|$|E
50|$|Androgens cause slow <b>epiphysis,</b> or {{maturation}} of the bones, {{but more}} of the potent <b>epiphysis</b> effect comes from the estrogen produced by aromatization of androgens. Steroid users of teen age may find that their growth had been stunted by androgen and/or estrogen excess. People with too little sex hormones can be short during puberty but end up taller as adults as in androgen insensitivity syndrome or estrogen insensitivity syndrome.|$|E
