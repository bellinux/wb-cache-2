30|$|For {{multimedia}} transmissions over heterogeneous wireless networks, {{data are}} often separated into multiple <b>data</b> <b>layers.</b> Depending on the end-to-end transmission capacity between a source and a destination, {{the number of}} <b>data</b> <b>layers</b> received determines the quality perceived by the destination. In short, CNC requires that the involved unicast sessions have the same data rate. With separated <b>data</b> <b>layers,</b> CNC can be applied in some <b>data</b> <b>layers</b> even though the overall data rates (or equivalently the transmission capacities) of the involved unicast sessions are not equal. Hence, layered coding can increase the applicability of CNC in heterogeneous wireless networks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Sensor Web is {{a growing}} {{phenomenon}} where {{an increasing number of}} sensors are collecting data in the physical world, to be made available over the Internet. To help realize the Sensor Web, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has developed open standards to standardize the communication protocols for sharing sensor data. Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) are systems that have been developed to access, process, and visualize geospatial data from heterogeneous sources, and SDIs can be designed specifically for the Sensor Web. However, there are problems with interoperability associated with a lack of standardized naming, even with data collected using the same open standard. The objective of this research is to automatically group similar sensor <b>data</b> <b>layers.</b> We propose a methodology to automatically group similar sensor <b>data</b> <b>layers</b> based on the phenomenon they measure. Our methodology is based on a unique bottom-up approach that uses text processing, approximate string matching, and semantic string matching of <b>data</b> <b>layers.</b> We use WordNet as a lexical database to compute word pair similarities and derive a set-based dissimilarity function using those scores. Two approaches are taken to group data layers: mapping is defined between all the <b>data</b> <b>layers,</b> and clustering is performed to group similar <b>data</b> <b>layers.</b> We evaluate the results of our methodology...|$|R
