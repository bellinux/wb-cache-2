5|$|Altrincham has two theatres, the Altrincham <b>Garrick</b> Playhouse and the Club Theatre (latterly {{known as}} the Altrincham Little Theatre). The Altrincham <b>Garrick</b> group was formed in 1913. The <b>Garrick</b> held the world stage premier of Psycho in 1982. In 1998, it {{received}} a grant of £675,000 from the National Lottery {{as part of a}} £900,000 redevelopment of the theatre, which was completed in 1999. The Club Theatre group began in 1896, as the St Margaret's Church Institute Amateur Dramatics Society. It provides a venue for the Trafford Youth Theatre production each year, and it runs the Hale One Act Festival, an annual week-long event started in 1972. The club has received awards from both the Greater Manchester Drama Federation and the Cheshire Theatre Guild. Altrincham also had Greater Manchester's only Michelin starred restaurant, the Juniper.|$|E
5|$|<b>Garrick</b> {{built the}} temple on land {{adjoining}} a villa {{that he had}} bought in October 1754 {{to serve as a}} country retreat. The villa's riverside garden, a plot now known as Garrick's Lawn, was separated from the main property by the road from Kingston upon Thames to Staines. <b>Garrick</b> commissioned the building of an elaborate grotto-tunnel under the road, illuminated by 500 lanterns, to facilitate private access to the lawn from the house.|$|E
50|$|The collection, as {{received}} by the Museum in April 1780, did not include <b>Garrick's</b> copy of Shakespeare's First Folio, which remained the property of <b>Garrick's</b> wife, Eva Maria. Following her death in 1822 the remainder of <b>Garrick's</b> library, including the Shakespeare volume, was sold at auction. The folio passed through several hands before being bought by Queen's College, Oxford, in the mid-nineteenth century.|$|R

5|$|On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson {{left for}} London {{with his former}} pupil David <b>Garrick.</b> To make things worse, Johnson {{received}} word that his brother had died on the day they left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as <b>Garrick</b> was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, <b>Garrick</b> had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived on Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for Paolo Sarpi's The History of the Council of Trent (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.|$|E
5|$|Although never {{promoted}} to ministerial office, Mitchell was a high-profile backbench MP in demand by {{society and the}} media. Notably, he was a popular member of the <b>Garrick</b> Club and was reported to enjoy a “gregarious social life”.|$|E
5|$|In 1747, Fleetwood's playhouse patent expired. The theatre and {{a patent}} renewal were {{purchased}} by actor David <b>Garrick</b> (who had trained under Macklin earlier) and partner James Lacy. <b>Garrick</b> served as manager and lead actor of the theatre until roughly 1766, {{and continued on}} in the management role for another ten years after that. He is remembered {{as one of the}} great stage actors and is especially associated with advancing the Shakespearean tradition in English theatre – during his time at Drury Lane, the company mounted at least 24 of Shakespeare's plays. Some of Shakespeare's surge in popularity during this period can be traced to the Licensing Act of 1737, which mandated governmental approval of any play before it could be performed and thereby created something of a vacuum of new material to perform. <b>Garrick</b> shared the stage with company including Peg Woffington, Susannah Cibber, Hannah Pritchard, Kitty Clive, Spranger Barry, Richard Yates and Ned Shuter. It was under Garrick's management that spectators were for the first time barred from the stage itself.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the many}} adaptations of The Taming of the Shrew, the most {{successful}} was David <b>Garrick's</b> Catharine and Petruchio, which was introduced in 1754 and dominated the stage for almost two centuries, with Shakespeare's play not returning until 1844 in England and 1887 in the United States, although <b>Garrick's</b> version was still being performed as late as 1879, when Herbert Beerbohm Tree staged it. In <b>Garrick's</b> version, the subplot is entirely omitted, Bianca is married to Hortensio when the play opens. Consequently, {{it is not a}} full-length play, and was often performed with <b>Garrick's</b> shorter version of The Winter's Tale. Much of Shakespeare's dialogue is reproduced verbatim. <b>Garrick's</b> play was a huge success, and major productions took place in the United States in 1754 (with Hannah Pritchard as Catharine), in 1788 (with Sarah Siddons and John Philip Kemble), in 1810 (again with Kemble and his real life wife, Priscilla Hopkins Brereton), and in 1842 (with William Charles Macready as Petruchio).|$|R

5|$|In 1757, a {{year after}} the debut of his operatic version, David <b>Garrick</b> {{produced}} a heavily cut performance of Shakespeare's script at Drury Lane, and it was revived, profitably, throughout the century.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} <b>Garrick</b> took over as manager of Drury Lane Theatre that the play was {{guaranteed}} a production. By this point Johnson was {{hard at work on}} his Dictionary, but he found time for further work on Irene.|$|E
5|$|After {{being open}} for {{little more than}} a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a {{reputation}} as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn him the money he had hoped for, though, until <b>Garrick</b> produced it in 1749.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the temple}} is managed by <b>Garrick's</b> Temple Partnership, which brings {{together}} the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, the <b>Garrick's</b> Temple to Shakespeare Trust, the Temple Trust, the Thames Landscape Strategy and Hampton Riverside Trust. The <b>Garrick's</b> Temple to Shakespeare Trust is chaired by the actor Clive Francis, and Liz Crowther {{is a member}} of the Temple Management Committee. The temple is open to the public on Sunday afternoons between April and September. It is used for concerts, annual general meetings and private events, and runs an educational programme for local schoolchildren in conjunction with the nearby Orleans House.|$|R

5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David <b>Garrick</b> who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|Auguste {{made his}} debut for Notre Dame in a November 12, 2012 victory against Monmouth, {{contributing}} 4 points and 3 rebounds in 3 minutes. After two ankle sprains during pre-season practice, Auguste had difficulty {{breaking into the}} already established team. Finding himself behind Jack Cooley and <b>Garrick</b> Sherman in the rotation, he averaged 10.7 minutes per game in 25 games.|$|E

5|$|Other {{influences}} {{included the}} composer Niccolò Jommelli and his maître de ballet at Stuttgart, Jean-Georges Noverre. Noverre's Lettres sur la danse (1760) called for dramatic effect over acrobatic ostentation; Noverre was himself {{influenced by the}} operas of Rameau and the acting style of David <b>Garrick.</b> The considerable quantity of ballet in Orfeo ed Euridice {{is thought to be}} due to his influence. Jommelli himself was noted for his blending of all aspects of the production: ballet, staging, and audience.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Siddons {{starred in}} John Philip Kemble's 1794 {{production}} at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and offered a psychologically intricate portrait of Lady Macbeth {{in the tradition of}} Hannah Pritchard. Siddons was especially praised for moving audiences in the sleepwalking scene with her depiction of a soul in profound torment. Siddons and Kemble furthered the view established by Pritchard and <b>Garrick</b> that character was the essence of Shakespearean drama.|$|E
5|$|The Goodman's Fields Theatre was {{established}} in 1727, and {{it was here that}} David <b>Garrick</b> made his successful début as Richard III, in 1741. In the 19th century the theatres of the East End rivalled in their grandiosity and seating capacity those of the West End. The first of this era was the ill-fated Brunswick Theatre (1828), which collapsed three days after opening, killing 15 people. This was followed by the opening of the Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel (1828), the <b>Garrick</b> (1831) in Leman Street, the Effingham (1834) in Whitechapel, the Standard (1835) in Shoreditch, the City of London (1837) in Norton Folgate, then the Grecian and the Britannia Theatre in Hoxton (1840). Though very popular for a time, from the 1860s onwards these theatres, one by one, began to close, the buildings were demolished and their very memory began to fade.|$|E

5|$|The hardnose shark was {{described}} by German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. They named it Carcharias (Hypoprion) macloti in honour of Heinrich Christian Macklot, who collected the type specimen from New Guinea. In 1862, American ichthyologist Theodore Gill elevated Hypoprion {{to the rank of}} full genus, with C. macloti as the type species. In 1985, Jack <b>Garrick</b> synonymised Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. This species may also be called Maclot's shark.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} {{description of}} the silky shark was first published by the German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle under the name Carcharias (Prionodon) falciformis, in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus. Because Müller and Henle's type specimen was a 53-cm-long female fetus from Cuba, adult silky sharks were historically not recognized as C.falciformis and were described as a separate species, Carcharhinus floridanus, by Henry Bigelow, William Schroeder, and Stewart Springer in 1943. Jack <b>Garrick,</b> Richard Backus, and Robert Gibbs, Jr. synonymized C.floridanus with C.falciformis in 1964.|$|E
