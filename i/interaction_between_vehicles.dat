50|$|Traffic {{congestion}} is {{a condition}} on transport networks that occurs as use increases, and is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing.

50|$|Compared to most console racing {{games of}} its time, World GP {{was much more}} difficult. The {{circuits}} were accurately depicted as having both sharp and wide turns, thus requiring players to slow down to certain speeds for corners, instead of most arcade-style games, which allowed players to unrealistically take turns flat-out. Gear shifting was also required for three of the cars (and notably for 8 of the 9 levels of the game), and some courses required dozens of gear changes per lap. Tire wear increased as the races went on, and players {{would be required to}} pit for tires at least once during each race to remain competitive. When multiple cars were on the track, the game featured no direct <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles.</b> All of the competitors' machines behaved in a ghost-like manner, and could be driven through and occupy the same space as others. Cars were unable to spin others out, and could not directly impede their progress.|$|E

30|$|Traffic {{conditions}} {{in developing countries}} are characterized by two prominent phenomena—(1) heterogeneous vehicle types and (2) weak lane discipline. Due to these conditions, a vehicle’s behavior in such a traffic stream is impacted {{by the actions of}} not only the leading vehicles but also adjacent vehicles. Thus, maneuvering a vehicle needs more attentive control to avoid accidents and involves greater <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> present in close neighborhood of the vehicle—laterally (sidewise) as well as longitudinally. Till recently, majority of works have been carried out to study the longitudinal interaction (or car-following behavior) of vehicles in different traffic streams; however, less research has been devoted to lateral <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Therefore, a detailed research on lateral <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> needs to be carried out for better understanding of traffic {{conditions in}} developing countries.|$|R

50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{eliminate}} any negative elements of the design, research was done to visit early coved sites and query both residents and cities to revise and update the design methods. Along with receiving comments from land developers and builders, coved design had gone through 4 iterations of evolution. Today's coved designs have better vehicular flow reducing energy and time in transit, direct and connective pedestrian systems with safer and elegant meandering walks, as well as curve radii standards that reduce excessive infrastructure of early designs. These comparisons are for traditional curved subdivision designs {{as well as the}} New Urbanism or smart growth methods of planning. In the top two images on this page, the before TND, or Smart Growth design has 54 street intersections and 38% more street length than the coved design of the same housing mix and density. The coved plan has much better walking connectivity and is far safer with less <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> and people. More important is that the average lot size increases 15% and monotony is eliminated. As with all coved development, the design methods accomplish all of this and more by exceeding every existing regulatory minimum. Coved development is unique in all of land planning in that it actually gains efficiency by exceeding existing regulatory minimums, it is the first method of design with such a claim to boast. What this means is there is nothing special to request for approvals - the design exceeds the regulatory minimums.|$|E

3000|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a PP-CA model to {{determine}} <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicle</b> types for the given traffic flow conditions. Hence, this model was first validated using visual inspection and fundamental diagram (q-ρ [...] a [...]) and then by comparing pair-wise simulated and observed <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> types. For estimating interactions, whenever a vehicle was found to be following or overtaking another vehicle, it was considered to be interacting with that vehicle. Therefore, a vehicle in measurement region can have 0, 1, 2 or 3 interactions based on the type of vehicles and the minimum gaps to the sides and front. If one vehicle is followed by another and at the same time overtaken by the third, it would have two interactions. Similarly, if there was only one vehicle in the frame the number of interactions would be zero. Vehicles travelling side by side (with overlap > 50 %) and having different speeds were also considered to be involved in overtaking even if the overtaking manoeuvre could not be completed in the video. These interactions were grouped by vehicle types and expressed as the ratio of the number of vehicles interacting to that observed for that vehicle type. Here, vehicles with gap more than 60  m were not assumed to be following. Similarly, the vehicles with longitudinal overlaps were considered as overtaking or overtaken.|$|R

30|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies that {{investigated}} headway distributions at low and medium traffic flow rates. However, studies that have been devoted to headway modelling at high flow, in which all vehicles are in the car-following state, are still insignificant [4]. Thus, the premise on which the present study is situated considers the effect of heterogeneity on headway distribution models and accordingly encompasses traffic flow ranging from moderate to congested, wherein such effect usually aggravates owing to frequent <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Accordingly, an attempt was made to find the theoretical distribution models which fit well to headway data: log-logistic, lognormal, Pearson 5 and Pearson 6 distributions were considered in the present study. Appropriate models of headway distributions were selected using a methodology based on goodness-of-fit test (K-S test) considering 5 % level-of- significance.|$|E

40|$|In {{microscopic}} traffic simulators, the <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> is considered. The {{dynamics of}} the system then becomes an emergent property {{of the interaction between}} its components.

By building a nanoscopic traffic simulation model that uses steering angle and throttle position as parameters, the model aims to overcome unrealistic acceleration and deceleration values, as found in various microscopic simulation tools.
