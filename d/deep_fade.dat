50|$|In a fast-fading channel, the {{transmitter}} may {{take advantage of}} the variations in the channel conditions using time diversity to help increase robustness of the communication to a temporary <b>deep</b> <b>fade.</b> Although a <b>deep</b> <b>fade</b> may temporarily erase some of the information transmitted, use of an error-correcting code coupled with successfully transmitted bits during other time instances (interleaving) can allow for the erased bits to be recovered. In a slow-fading channel, {{it is not possible to}} use time diversity because {{the transmitter}} sees only a single realization of the channel within its delay constraint. A <b>deep</b> <b>fade</b> therefore lasts the entire duration of transmission and cannot be mitigated using coding.|$|E
50|$|Antenna {{diversity}} is especially effective at mitigating these multipath propagation situations. This is because multiple antennas afford a receiver several {{observations of the}} same signal. Each antenna will experience a different interference environment.

40|$|Aircraft {{navigation}} {{based on}} GPS (Global Positioning System) and WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) requires both code and carrier measurements {{to calculate the}} position estimate [1]. A GPS receiver’s carrier tracking loop is weaker than code tracking loop. Thus, carrier lock can more easily be broken under <b>deep</b> signal <b>fading</b> caused by ionospheric scintillation. If a receiver cannot track code and carrier of at least four satellite channels, the aircraft cannot navigate using GPS or WAAS. The solar maximum data set analyzed in this research demonstrates frequent <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> and almost all satellites in view suffered from scintillation, which could significantly reduce number of simultaneous tracked satellites. Statistics of number of tracked satellites under 45 minutes of strong scintillation are given in this paper and importance of shorter reacquisition time of a receiver is also emphasized. In order to design an aviation receiver with shorter reacquisition time under frequent deep signal fadings, characteristics of signal fading have to be well understood. Two important characteristics of <b>deep</b> <b>fading</b> are analyzed, which are fading duration and time between <b>deep</b> <b>fades.</b> The fading duration model in this paper can provide a guideline for more robust aviation receiver design. Even if the receiver could reacquire phase lock quickly, frequent <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> significantly increase noise level in smoothed pseudoranges, which results in lower navigation availability. Statistics of time between <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> given in this paper shows very frequent <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> {{that could be a}} major concern of GPS navigation under strong scintillation during solar maximum period...|$|R

40|$|In {{wireless}} communication systems antenna diversity {{is an important}} technique to combat <b>deep</b> <b>fading</b> to improve the system performance and to increase the channel capacity. The fast and random fluctuation of the received signal strength is usually called fading. Diversity technique has been taken into consideration to mitigate the effects of fading by generating several copies of the signal, which experience independent or estimated independent fading, to decrease the probability of instantaneous <b>deep</b> <b>fades.</b> This paper presents the performance analysis of a system in various diversity mechanism environments by improving bit error rate (BER) ...|$|R
50|$|A common {{example of}} <b>deep</b> <b>fade</b> is the {{experience}} of stopping at a traffic light and hearing an FM broadcast degenerate into static, while the signal is re-acquired if the vehicle moves {{only a fraction of}} a meter. The loss of the broadcast is caused by the vehicle stopping at a point where the signal experienced severe destructive interference. Cellular phones can also exhibit similar momentary fades.|$|E
50|$|Antenna {{diversity}} is especially effective at mitigating these multipath situations. This is because multiple antennas offer a receiver several {{observations of the}} same signal. Each antenna will experience a different interference environment. Thus, if one antenna is experiencing a <b>deep</b> <b>fade,</b> {{it is likely that}} another has a sufficient signal. Collectively such a system can provide a robust link. While this is primarily seen in receiving systems (diversity reception), the analog has also proven valuable for transmitting systems (transmit diversity) as well.|$|E
50|$|A RLP {{transport}} cannot ask the {{air interface}} {{to provide a}} certain payload size. Instead, the air interface scheduler determines the packet size, based upon constantly changing channel conditions, and upcalls RLP with the chosen packet payload size, right before transmission. Most other fragmentation protocols, {{such as those of}} 802.11b and IP, used payload sizes determined by the upper layers, and call upon the MAC to create a payload of a certain size. These other protocols are not as flexible as RLP, and can sometimes fail to transmit during a <b>deep</b> <b>fade</b> in a wireless environment.|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{parameters}} obtained for Nakagami distribution in CP [17] and XP channels (Table  7), multipath fading {{should be expected}} to impose greater variability of the Rx signal and <b>deeper</b> <b>fades</b> in the XP channel.|$|R
30|$|For each {{destination}} node {{in the broadcast}} scheme, the channel quality varies with different pathloss and channel fading. Moreover, the channel quality of some destinations is severely degraded due to <b>deep</b> <b>fading.</b> Those nodes are nearly out of {{the coverage of the}} source node. Taking advantage of the virtual multi-antenna array, we can avoid <b>deep</b> <b>fading</b> and notably improve the reliability of the broadcast by exploiting the diversity gain. If we consider to select a group of transmit antennas from all antennas in the decoded nodes to form the virtual array, the maximum diversity gain can be achieved. However, for simplicity we take all the decoded destinations to be relay node without selection as in our model.|$|R
30|$|This {{indicates}} that the channel cannot support the transmission rate and consequently the data transmission is unsuccessful. It is an important analytical metric that characterizes the probability of data loss providing a bound on the symbol error rate or equivalently of <b>deep</b> <b>fading.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of reflectors {{in the environment}} surrounding a transmitter and receiver create multiple paths that a transmitted signal can traverse. As a result, the receiver sees the superposition of multiple copies of the transmitted signal, each traversing a different path. Each signal copy will experience differences in attenuation, delay and phase shift while travelling from the source to the receiver. This can result in either constructive or destructive interference, amplifying or attenuating the signal power seen at the receiver. Strong destructive interference is frequently {{referred to as a}} <b>deep</b> <b>fade</b> and may result in temporary failure of communication due to a severe drop in the channel signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
50|$|Since {{different}} frequency {{components of}} the signal are affected independently, {{it is highly unlikely}} that all parts of the signal will be simultaneously affected by a <b>deep</b> <b>fade.</b> Certain modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) are well-suited to employing frequency diversity to provide robustness to fading. OFDM divides the wideband signal into many slowly modulated narrowband subcarriers, each exposed to flat fading rather than frequency selective fading. This can be combated by means of error coding, simple equalization or adaptive bit loading. Inter-symbol interference is avoided by introducing a guard interval between the symbols. CDMA uses the rake receiver to deal with each echo separately.|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{evaluate the}} performance of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) links {{in the presence of}} different air bubbles. Air bubbles of different sizes and densities are generated by using an air pipe in conjunction with a submersible water pump of variable flow rate that help break up large bubbles into smaller bubbles. Received signal intensity measurements show that bubbles significantly degrade {{the performance of}} UWOC links. Large bubbles completely obstruct the optical beam and cause a <b>deep</b> <b>fade.</b> However, as the bubble size decreases, the level of <b>deep</b> <b>fade</b> also decreases because the optical beam is less susceptible to complete obstruction and more light reaches the detector. We also show that beam expansion could help mitigate the performance degradation due to the <b>deep</b> <b>fade</b> caused by air bubbles scatters in the channel...|$|E
30|$|When the FBS is {{far from}} the MUE or the channel between the FBS and the MUE is in <b>deep</b> <b>fading,</b> the {{interference}} is small, so PMI should be applied at the FBS to maximize the signal power from the FBS to the FUE.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the use of threshold-based multiuser scheduling in WiMAX OFDMA. Threshold-based scheduling is applicable to all the WiMAX subcarrier permutation options, but due to analytical difficulty we will later focus on the band-AMC in our analysis. Motivation for the threshold-based scheduling consideration is the fact that, in OFDMA systems, user channels experience <b>deep</b> <b>fades</b> frequently, therefore the regular WiMAX OFDMA scheduler based on FUSC, PUSC, or band-AMC systems {{would be forced to}} assign subchannels to users when their channels experience <b>deep</b> <b>fades,</b> degrading the BS throughput significantly. To optimize BS throughput in such case, we propose in this paper the use of threshold-based multiuser scheduling, where users first undergo threshold test before the regular scheduling policy of the BS is applied.|$|R

An important aspect of CDMA is that it requires tight power control to reduce multiple access interference among CDMA users. Closed loop power control has been implemented in CDMA to mitigate the effect of fading channel [1]. However in practice, signal fluctuation due to multipath fading can not be mitigated completely because power control algorithm is not perfect, particularly when the channel goes into <b>deep</b> <b>fades.</b> Fig. 1 shows the controlled signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) when the target level is set at 10 dB. We can see that power control error (deviation from the target SIR) is larger when <b>fading</b> is <b>deeper</b> because power control fails to track <b>deep</b> <b>fades...</b>|$|R

Hence in this paper, we design an Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relaying aided DSTM scheme, which is capable of attaining a diversity gain even when the source node is in <b>deep</b> <b>fade.</b> Furthermore, Multiple-Symbol Differential Sphere Decoding (MSDSD) is developed for the proposed scheme to avoid the potential performance degradation of the noncoherent receiver in fast fading channels...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an {{adaptive}} expansion strategy (AES) is proposed for multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) detection {{in the presence}} of circular signals. By exploiting channel properties, the AES classifies MIMO channels into three types: excellent, average and <b>deep</b> <b>fading.</b> To avoid unnecessary branch-searching, the AES adopts single expansion (SE), partial expansion (PE) and full expansion (FE) for excellent channels, average channels and <b>deep</b> <b>fading</b> channels, respectively. In the PE, the non-circularity of signal is exploited, and the widely linear processing is extended from non-circular signals to circular signals by I (or Q) component cancellation. An analytical performance analysis is given to quantify the performance improvement.

40|$|We {{consider}} the linear precoded OFDM approach proposed in [1], where a non-redundant precoding {{was applied to}} the symbol blocks before entering the OFDM system.

We propose an adaptive modulation based extension of the method of [1] in order to combat channel with <b>deep</b> <b>fading.</b> Bits are allocated on each subcarrier so that the overall transmit power is minimized under a fixed bit error rate (BER).
