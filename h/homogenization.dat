5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and <b>homogenization</b> of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{has a long}} history of academic research, and in 2013–14 spent $528 million toward it. In 1877, botany professor William J. Beal performed the first documented genetic crosses to produce hybrid corn, which led to increased yields. MSU dairy professor G. Malcolm Trout invented the process for the <b>homogenization</b> of milk in the 1930s. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed cisplatin, a leading cancer fighting drug. Albert Fert, an Adjunct professor at MSU, was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Peter Grünberg.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method {{takes advantage of the}} organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes over a period of time. From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio <b>homogenization,</b> as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and <b>homogenization</b> may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to <b>homogenization</b> or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E
25|$|Coal <b>homogenization</b> {{refers to}} the process of mixing coal to reduce the {{variance}} of the product supplied. This <b>homogenization</b> process is performed during the coal stockpiling operation. Although the terms blending and <b>homogenization</b> are often used interchangeably, there are differences as the definitions show. The most notable difference is that blending refers to stacking coal from different sources together on one stockpile. The reclaimed heap would then typically have a weighted average output quality of the input sources. In contrast, <b>homogenization</b> focuses on reducing the variance of only one source. A blending operation will cause some <b>homogenization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{unification}} and <b>homogenization</b> {{by force}} was propounded by Petar II Petrović-Njegoš (1813–1851).|$|E
25|$|<b>Homogenization</b> aims {{to upgrade}} the raw {{material}} to a uniform composition of the product being homogenized. In coal <b>homogenization</b> the primary aim {{is to reduce the}} variance {{of the quality of the}} product supplied (in comparison to the variance in quality of the different sources of supply). This is necessary to ensure consistent (or homogeneous) quality, as well as a constant calorific value of the coal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homogenization</b> {{can be used}} at {{coal mines}} {{in order to get}} a better overall quality product from a stockpile. It can thus form an {{integral}} part of the quality management system in coal mines. When processing coal by more than one supplier like power stations and heat plants, coal <b>homogenization</b> can serve well as a strategy of processing the coal in order to get to the best acceptable quality.|$|E
25|$|Coal <b>homogenization</b> {{could be}} applied {{whenever}} a consistent quality is needed and multiple sources of different qualities are supplied or mined.|$|E
25|$|In {{cell biology}} {{aprotinin}} {{is used as}} an enzyme inhibitor to prevent protein degradation during lysis or <b>homogenization</b> of cells and tissues.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homogenization</b> is {{a process}} that reduces the size of fat {{globules}} by forcing pressurized, hot milk through small holes, causing turbulence that breaks up the larger fat globules so that they remain suspended rather than separating in a cream layer at the top. The purpose of <b>homogenization</b> is to make milk more convenient to process, store and consume, eliminating the need to shake or stir the milk container to remix the separated cream layer and increasing the shelf-life of the product.|$|E
25|$|He {{has made}} {{contributions}} to <b>homogenization</b> theory, theoretical models of turbulence, stochastic partial differential equations, electronic structure analysis, multiscale methods, computational fluid dynamics, and weak KAM theory.|$|E
25|$|The <b>homogenization</b> process {{increases}} the shelf life of milk because it decreases the radius of fat globules and other particles (per stokes' law) thus delaying {{the rate of}} agglomeration.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{studies are}} {{somewhat}} limited {{but do not}} currently support claims that milk <b>homogenization</b> affects the development of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, milk allergy and milk intolerance, Type I diabetes or Type II diabetes.|$|E
25|$|If {{the protein}} of {{interest}} is not secreted by the organism into the surrounding solution, {{the first step of}} each purification process is the disruption of the cells containing the protein. Depending on how fragile the protein is and how stable the cells are, one could, for instance, use one of the following methods: i) repeated freezing and thawing, ii) sonication, iii) <b>homogenization</b> by high pressure (French press), iv) <b>homogenization</b> by grinding (bead mill), and v) permeabilization by detergents (e.g. Triton X-100) and/or enzymes (e.g. lysozyme). Finally, the cell debris can be removed by centrifugation so that the proteins and other soluble compounds remain in the supernatant.|$|E
25|$|Nanocellulose {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from native fibers by an acid hydrolysis, giving rise to highly crystalline and rigid nanoparticles (often referred to as CNC or nanowhiskers) which are shorter (100s to 1000 nanometers) than the nanofibrils obtained through <b>homogenization,</b> microfluiodization or grinding routes. The resulting material is known as nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC or CNC).|$|E
25|$|The 2012 {{study found}} that modern breeds only emerged in the 19th century and that claims of their antiquity are based on little or no {{historical}} or empirical evidence. The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and <b>homogenization,</b> with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.|$|E
25|$|A {{criticism}} of the European proposal is that dogs in East Asia show more genetic diversity. However, dramatic differences in genetic diversity can be influenced both by an ancient and recent history of inbreeding. A counter-comment is that the modern European breeds only emerged in the 19th century, and that throughout history global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and <b>homogenization,</b> with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.|$|E
25|$|The Structure of Scientific Revolutions {{elicited}} {{a number}} of reactions from the broader sociological community. Following the book's publication, some sociologists expressed {{the belief that the}} field of sociology had not yet developed a unifying paradigm, and should therefore strive towards <b>homogenization.</b> Others argued that the field {{was in the midst of}} normal science, and speculated that a new revolution would soon emerge. Some sociologists, including John Urry, doubted that Kuhn's theory, which addressed the development of natural science, was necessarily relevant to sociological development.|$|E
25|$|Like composition, fat {{globules}} vary in {{size from}} less than 0.2 to about 15 micrometers in diameter between different species. Diameter may also vary between animals within a species and at different times within a milking of a single animal. In unhomogenized cow's milk, the fat globules have an average diameter of two to four micrometers and with <b>homogenization,</b> average around 0.4 micrometers. The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K along with essential fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acid are found within the milk fat portion of the milk.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} rankings can divert universities’ {{attention}} away from teaching and social responsibility towards the type of scientific research valued by indicators used for ranking exercises. There have also been concerns that by applying a limited set of criteria to world universities, and given the strong desire to feature in the top 200 universities, rankings actually encourage the <b>homogenization</b> of higher education institutions, making them less responsive and less relevant to their immediate contexts. The fact that rankings are also said to favour the advantage enjoyed by the 200 best-ranked institutions {{has important implications for}} equity.|$|E
25|$|In Navarre, {{the civil}} wars between the Agramont and the Beaumont confederacies {{paved the way}} for the Spanish conquest of the bulk of Navarre from 1512 to 1524. The {{independent}} Navarre north of the Pyrenees was largely absorbed by France in 1620, despite the fact that King Henry III of Navarre had decreed Navarre's permanent independence from France (31 December 1596). In the decades after the Spanish annexation, the Basque Country went through increased religious, ideological and national <b>homogenization,</b> encouraged by new national ideas embraced by the rising Spanish and French absolutist monarchies during the Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|CNF is a {{material}} composed of nanosized cellulose fibrils {{with a high}} aspect ratio (length to width ratio). Typical fibril widths are 5–20 nanometers {{with a wide range}} of lengths, typically several micrometers. It is pseudo-plastic and exhibits thixotropy, the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but become less viscous when shaken or agitated. When the shearing forces are removed the gel regains much of its original state. The fibrils are isolated from any cellulose containing source including wood-based fibers (pulp fibers) through high-pressure, high temperature and high velocity impact <b>homogenization,</b> grinding or microfluidization (see manufacture below).|$|E
25|$|Between 10,000 and 30,000 Turks {{were killed}} in Tripolitsa by Greek rebels {{in the summer of}} 1821, {{including}} the entire Jewish population of the city. Similar events as these occurred elsewhere during the Greek Revolution resulting in the eradication and expulsion of virtually the entire Turkish population of the Morea. These acts ensured the ethnic <b>homogenization</b> of the area under the rule of the future modern Greek state. According to claims by Turkish delegations, in 1878 the Muslim inhabitants in Thessaly are estimated to be 150,000 and in 1897 the Muslims numbered 50,000 in Crete. By 1919 there were virtually no Muslims left in Thessaly and only 20,000 in Crete.|$|E
25|$|Once again Norman Thomas, August Gerber, and Morris Hillquit {{jumped to}} action, {{painting}} the station's woes {{as part of}} a political vendetta aimed at <b>homogenization</b> of the radio airwaves at the expense of political minorities. The American Civil Liberties Union promised its aid in making the WEVD renewal controversy a national free speech campaign. The final report of the FRC examiner was filed on December 11, 1930 and the station was notified of the decision a week later. Within two weeks the station had submitted a 17-page challenge of the FRC examiner's ruling, which combined with public pressure from listeners compelled the FRC to temporarily reverse its decision on January 13, 1931.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{often is}} homogenized, a {{treatment}} that prevents a cream layer from separating {{out of the}} milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than {{a smaller number of}} larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during <b>homogenization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution—i.e., uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to <b>homogenization</b> or out-competition from the introduced (or hybrid) species. Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact. Extinction is likeliest for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones; interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool (for example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the abundant domestic water buffalo). Such extinctions are not always apparent from morphological (non-genetic) observations. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionarily process, nevertheless, hybridization (with or without introgression) threatens rare species' existence.|$|E
25|$|To {{assess what}} current {{knowledge}} of social immune systems suggested about whether social immunity was a bypoduct or driver of complex group living, Meunier delineated 30 different mechanisms of social immunity found in eusocial insects {{and looked for}} counterparts to these in presocial and solitary insects. Supporting the hypothesis that social immunity was a driver and not a by-product of complex group living, 10 mechanisms had counterparts in presocial insects and 4 in solitary species (though this {{does not imply that}} some mechanisms may evolve as a byproduct). Evidence that social immunity mechanisms are selected for at least somewhat due to collective benefits is lacking though – possibly due to the difficulty in isolating the immune benefits from the other benefits that social immunity mechanisms often bestow (e.g. allogrooming inhibits the establishment of ectoparasites, but also improves the accuracy of nest mate recognition due to the sharing and thus <b>homogenization</b> of chemical signatures between group members), and the difficulty in experimentally separating direct fitness from indirect fitness, potentiated in eusocial taxa where sterile/non-reproductive individuals predominatee. More studies on presocial taxa would allow for phyletic analyses to recover the actual path of evolution that different mechanisms of social immunity took.|$|E
25|$|A a rally held at Petrova Gora on 4 March had a {{significant}} impact upon ethnic <b>homogenization.</b> It was not formally associated with any party standing in the election; it was organized by the municipalities of Vojnić and Vrginmost, and the Yugoslav Independent Democratic Party. According to the then-mayor of Vrginmost, the two municipalities had organized the rally to show their support for brotherhood and unity—a Titoist concept whereby all of Yugoslavia's ethnic groups would live in harmony—instead of letting it become a Serb nationalist event. The rally was attended by tens of thousand Serbs who heard mainly pro-Yugoslav speeches about the threat posed by the HDZ and the unfavourable position of Serbs in Croatian society. The SKH-SDP condemned the rally in advance as being harmful to inter-ethnic relations and potentially capable of increasing Croatian nationalism. Croatian media linked the rally to the anti-bureaucratic revolution in neighbouring Serbia and depicted it as a protest demanding the overthrow of the Croatian government. Conversely, Serbian media equated the SKH-SDP with the HDZ, declared the entire Croatian political spectrum nationalist and said Serbs should not take part in Croatia's electoral process.|$|E
25|$|Thracians or Thracian Bulgarians (Bulgarian: Тракийски българи or Тракийци) are a regional, ethnographic {{group of}} ethnic Bulgarians, inhabiting or native to Thrace. Today, the larger {{part of this}} {{population}} is concentrated in Northern Thrace, but much is spread across the whole of Bulgaria and the diaspora. Until {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century the Thracian Bulgarians lived also in the whole of Thrace, then part of the Ottoman Empire. After the persecutions during the Preobrazhenie Uprising and the ethnic cleansing, caused to the Bulgarian population in Eastern Thrace after the Second Balkan War, these people were expelled from the area. After World War I, Bulgaria was required to cede Western Thrace to Greece. A whole population of Bulgarians in Western Thrace was expelled into Bulgaria-controlled Northern Thrace. This was followed by a further population exchange between Bulgaria and Greece (under the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine), which radically changed the demographics of the region toward increased ethnic <b>homogenization</b> within the territories each respective country ultimately was awarded. At this period the Bulgarian Communist Party was compelled by Comintern to accept the formation of a new Thracian nation on the base of this people in order to include them in a new separate Thracian state, as a part of a future Balkan Communist Federation.|$|E
25|$|Although less parsimonious than recent gene flow, the {{observation}} {{may have been}} due to ancient population sub-structure in Africa, causing incomplete genetic <b>homogenization</b> within modern humans when Neanderthals diverged while early ancestors of Eurasians were still more closely related to Neanderthals than those of Africans to Neanderthals. On the basis of allele frequency spectrum, it was shown that the recent admixture model had the best fit to the results while the ancient population sub-structure model had no fit–demonstrating that the best model was a recent admixture event that was preceded by a bottleneck event among modern humans—thus confirming recent admixture as the most parsimonious and plausible explanation for the observed excess of genetic similarities between modern non-African humans and Neanderthals. On the basis of linkage disequilibrium patterns, a recent admixture event is likewise confirmed by the data. From the extent of linkage disequilibrium, it was estimated that the last Neanderthal gene flow into early ancestors of Europeans occurred 47,000–65,000 years BP. In conjunction with archaeological and fossil evidence, the gene flow is thought likely to have occurred somewhere in Western Eurasia, possibly the Middle East. Through another approach—using one genome each of a Neanderthal, Eurasian, African, and chimpanzee (outgroup), and dividing it into non-recombining short sequence blocks—to estimate genome-wide maximum-likelihood under different models, an ancient population sub-structure in Africa was ruled out and a Neanderthal admixture event was confirmed.|$|E

In 2004, scientists at the Cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element germanium, called Ge-60. In that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the government of Brazil, broke ground on the 4.1-meter Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics & Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins. Since 1999, MSU has been part of another consortium called the Michigan Life Sciences Corridor, which aims to develop biotechnology research in the State of Michigan. The College of Communication Arts and Sciences' Quello Center researches current issues of information and communication management. Avida, an artificial life software platform to study the evolutionary biology of self-replicating and evolving computer programs, is under active development by Charles Ofria in the Digital Evolution Lab of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.|$|E
