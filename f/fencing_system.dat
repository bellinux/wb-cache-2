Lethal trapping is a widely used and accepted tool to reduce beaver damage caused by flooding; however, acceptable and efficacious non-lethal tools are increasingly desired by the public. We traced the origin of non-lethal tools used to reduce beaver flooding {{as far back as}} the early 20 th century, when beavers received protective status and were reintroduced to many areas across North America. These tools focus on 2 general factors—exclusion and deception—and can be categorized as <b>fence</b> <b>systems</b> and pipe systems.

We recommend that natural resource managers avoid using <b>fence</b> <b>systems</b> or pipe systems alone, unless they can be used in areas where maintenance requirements and expected damage are extremely low. Flow devices are not intended to replace lethal control; however, we recommend use of flow devices as part of integrated management plans where beaver flooding conflicts are expected and where local conditions allow flow-device installation and maintenance.

Currently permanent wire fencing {{is used to}} control cattle; this is both expensive and inflexible. Cattle are known to respond to auditory and visual cues and we investigated whether these {{can be used to}} manipulate their behaviour. Twenty-five Belmont Red steers with a mean live weight of 270 kg were each {{randomly assigned to one of}} five treatments. Treatments consisted of a combination of cues (audio, tactile and visual stimuli) and consequence (electrical stimulation). The treatments were electrical stimulation alone, audio plus electrical stimulation, vibration plus electrical stimulation, light plus electrical stimulation and electrified electric fence (6 kV) plus electrical stimulation. Cue stimuli were administered for 3 s followed immediately by electrical stimulation (consequence) of 1 kV for 1 s. The experiment tested the operational efficacy of an on-animal control or virtual <b>fencing</b> <b>system.</b> A collar-halter device was designed to carry the electronics, batteries and equipment providing the stimuli, including audio, vibration, light and electrical of a prototype virtual fencing device. Cattle were allowed to travel along a 40 m alley to a group of peers and feed while their rate of travel and response to the stimuli were recorded. The prototype virtual <b>fencing</b> <b>system</b> was successful in modifying the behaviour of the cattle. The rate of travel of cattle along the alley demonstrated the large variability in behavioural response associated with tactile, visual and audible cues. The experiment demonstrated virtual fencing has potential for controlling cattle in extensive grazing systems. However, larger numbers of cattle need to be tested to derive a better understanding of the behavioural variance. Further controlled experimental work is also necessary to quantify the interaction between cues, consequences and cattle learning. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this Master of Design {{study is to}} utilise design-aided {{research}} to develop a desirable, conceptual livestock electric <b>fencing</b> <b>system</b> in conjunction with Gallagher animal management Ltd. Proudly known worldwide for their innovative agricultural products, Gallagher have identified {{an opportunity for a}} fence system to be marketed towards the comparatively niche industry of hobby/lifestyle farming, and provide hobby farmers with a <b>fencing</b> <b>system</b> that they can construct without requiring heavy machinery or fencing experience. This could provide a sound opportunity for Gallagher to maintain their industry status and provide a product that is really desirable to the market users. This investigation intends to develop an electric fence design proposal, primarily for the European hobby farming market, which obtains the sought after market differentiation and innovation by proposing a new livestock fence concept that is desirable to the customer; commencing from the point of purchase, through to its installation and operation. A new product that will give the customer the traditional satisfaction of constructing their fence themselves without machinery and with a system that the user finds intuitive and physically less arduous to install, simple to operate and visually pleasing within a lifestyle farm environment. The contemporary theory papers regarding Affective design (Warell, 2001) and ‘utilitarian’ and ‘hedonic’ design principles (Chitturi, et al. 2007) support the investigation’s research methods used; determining existing product experiences through market analysis, observation, user interviews and focus groups, followed by structured concept generation, prototypes and iterated design development. The unresolved issues and desirable aspects identified throughout the research methods were categorised into ‘performance’ and ‘experience’ criteria attributes which the methods stated that the design required to produce a ‘desirable’ design proposal, and accomplish the research aim. The final design was evaluated against the research criteria, based on the research knowledge. The testing method indicated that the fence design proposal had fulfilled most of the experience and performance design criteria, successfully achieving the research aim. The investigation not only fulfilled the aim stated to create a desirable electric fence system, but additionally highlights the advantages of applying ‘affective design’ theories to this particular fencing industry which itself is so wrought by utilitarian tradition...|$|E

Enforcement mainly involves apprehending illegal immigrants and assisting with the interdiction of illegal drug smugglers and suspected terrorists. The United States has approximately 6, 000 miles of land-based international border. By far the largest problem with illegal immigration occurs along the 2, 000 miles of border with Mexico.

40|$|Training {{cattle to}} avoid {{electric}} fences before turnout to grazing {{reduces the risk}} of the animals breaking out from their paddock. We investigated the time needed for dairy bull calves to learn to avoid a light-built electric fence. Nineteen dairy bull calves were trained to an electric fence in a training yard during seven days. The number of electric shocks the animals received from the training fence was recorded continuously. After the training period, the calves were turned to pasture. Nine of the animals were also grazed the following summer as yearlings, and observed before turnout in a smaller enclosure. The calves got more shocks from the fence during training hour 1 than during any of the following seven hours. The number of shocks the calves received from the fence also declined from training day 1 to 2 and from training day 3 to 4. The results indicate that the dairy bull calves learned to avoid an electric fence quickly, even within an hour from release into the training yard. A simple training procedure was sufficient to ensure that the animals could be grazed in and would avoid a light-built electric <b>fencing</b> <b>system</b> as calves and, even after a winter-housing period, as bulls. ...|$|E
