5000|$|The {{quantity}} of rainfall {{during the year}} is relatively small, between 600-750 mm. The reasons for this are the geographical position(the place where Bogdanci is located), {{the distance from the}} sea, the temperatures and the frequently winds are the most important factor for this little {{quantity of}} rain, because they clear the clouds of the sky. November and December are also known as months of the rain. During the summer (June, July, August and September the quantity of rain is the smallest for the whole year). From this we can see that the rainfall is bigger during the vegetation and it goes down when the vegetation is gone, which is pretty bad for the agriculture. The snow (fall) is less than the rainfall. There are around 9 days during the whole year, that the snow cover stays on the earth.

The nature of November in the south is low diurnal temperature variation and lack of extreme cold, but significant snowfall occurred on several occasions quite far south in the country, and Jönköping, Linköping, Uppsala and Örebro all recorded daily means below freezing. All of those cities are located inland, and in coastal locations means were above the freezing point, albeit not by much. Stockholm and Gothenburg both recorded 7 days with highs below freezing, something that is highly unusual for the country's big cities in November.

40|$|Cold {{temperature}} and associated extremes often impact adversely {{human health and}} environment and bring disruptions in economic activities during winter over Canada. This study investigates projected changes in winter (December to March) period cold extreme days (i. e., cold nights, cold days, frost days, and <b>ice</b> <b>days)</b> and cold spells over Canada based on 11 regional climate model (RCM) simulations for the future 20402 ̆ 0132069 period {{with respect to the}} current 19702 ̆ 0131999 period. These simulations, available from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program, were obtained with six different RCMs, when driven by four different Atmosphere 2 ̆ 013 Ocean General Circulation Models, under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A 2 scenario. Based on the reanalysis boundary conditions, the RCM simulations reproduce spatial patterns of observed mean values of the daily minimum and maximum temperatures and inter-annual variability of the number of cold nights over different Canadian climatic regions considered in the study. A comparison of current and future period simulations suggests decreases in the frequency of cold extreme events (i. e., cold nights, cold days and cold spells) and in selected return levels of maximum duration of cold spells over the entire study domain. Important regional differences are noticed as the simulations generally indicate smaller decreases in the characteristics of extreme cold events over western Canada compared to the other regions. The analysis also suggests an increase in the frequency of midwinter freeze 2 ̆ 013 thaw events, due mainly to a {{decrease in the number of}} frost days and <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> for all Canadian regions.

30|$|The {{expected}} value of environmental prediction information is assessed by carrying through {{two sets of}} calculations, one with and one without ice forecasts. The base case computes the expected annual cost of ice to an offshore platform similar to the White Rose without any use of countermeasures such as escort vessels nor any use of environmental prediction. This provides a baseline against which the other strategies can be judged. Four {{percent of the time}} the middle circle is breached. A middle circle breach requires a one day production shutdown at a cost of one day’s deferred production, estimated to be $ 2.25 million. As we assume 30 ice risk days in a year so the total cost of this middle circle breach is 30 x 0.04 x$ 2.25 [*]=[*]$ 2.7 million. Conditioned on the middle circle being breached, one-quarter of the time the inner circle is breached next. An inner circle breach requires a shutdown for 7 [*]days (after which it is assumed that the ice has left the outermost threat circle) at a cost of 7 [*]days of lost production. Again, there are 30 <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> in a year so the cost of an inner circle breach is $ 4.725 million.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to provide}} a deeper {{understanding}} of the level of uncertainty associated with the development of extreme weather frequency and intensity indices at the local scale. Several different global climate models, downscaling methods, and emission scenarios were used to develop extreme temperature and precipitation indices at the local scale in the Hamilton region, Ontario, Canada. Uncertainty associated with historical and future trends in extreme indices and future climate projections were also analyzed using daily precipitation and temperature time series and their extreme indices, calculated from gridded daily observed climate data along with and projections from dynamically downscaled datasets of CanRCM 4 and PRECIS, and the statistically downscaled CIMP 5 ensemble. A bias correction technique was applied to all raw daily temperature and precipitation time series prior to calculation of the indices. All climate models predicted increasing trends for extreme temperature indices, maximum 1 -day and 5 -day precipitation (RX 1 day and RX 5 day), total wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT), very heavy precipitation days (R 20 mm), Summer Days (SU), and Tropical Nights (TR) and decreasing trend for Forest Days (FD) and <b>Ice</b> <b>Days</b> (ID) in 2020 s, 2050 s, and 2080 s compared to present.

40|$|The northeastern United States {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{variable}} climates in the world, and how climate extremes are changing is critical to populations, industries, and the environment in this region. A long-term (1870 – 2005) temperature and precipitation dataset was compiled for the northeastern United States to assess how the climate has changed. Adjustments weremade to daily temperatures to account for changes in mean, variance, and skewness resulting from inhomogeneities, but precipitation data were not adjusted. Trends in 17 tem-perature and 10 precipitation indices at 40 stations were evaluated over three time periods— 1893 – 2005, 1893 – 1950, and 1951 – 2005 —and over 1870 – 2005 for a subset of longer-term stations. Temperature indices indicate strong warming with increases in the frequency of warm events (e. g., warm nights and warm summer days) and decreases in the frequency of cold events (e. g., <b>ice</b> <b>days,</b> frost days, and the cold spell duration indicator). The strongest warming is exhibited in the decrease in frost days and the increase in growing season length. Although maximum temperatures indices showed strong warming trends over the period 1893 – 1950, sub-sequent trends show little change and cooling. Few significant trends were present in the precipitation indices; however, they displayed a tendency toward wetter conditions. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that some of the variability in the 27 indices from 1951 to 2002 was explained by the North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific decadal oscillation, and Pacific–North American pattern. However, teleconnection pat-terns showed little influence on the 27 indices over a 103 -yr period. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of air temperatures during cold half-year {{to a large}} extent affect all human activities. Most significant damages are caused by minimum air temperatures dropping to very low values. Due to the current ongoing climate change, air temperatures in winter in general are increasing, however, this does not necessarily mean the frequency of these very low temperatures decreases. It is not easy to express the course of air temperatures during cold periods using some simple characteristic. Meteorologists and climatologists use various characteristics, which can be referred to as frost indexes. These include the number of frost, ice or arctic days. Since these indexes not always perfectly reflect reaction of the nature to a particular temperature threshold, the analysis also included number of days with minimum air temperature below - 3, - 5, - 7, - 10, - 15, - 20 and - 25 °C. In the last 15 years (2001 - 2015), there has been a decrease in the frost indexes in comparison to the normal period 1961 - 1990, this trend however, is not always statistically significant. Significant changes were found in particular in case of the number of days with a higher temperature threshold (frost, <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> and minimum air temperature above - 3 to - 10 °C). In contrast, days with extremely low temperatures are relatively rare (sometimes only observed once in several years), so the dominant factor here is rather variability.

40|$|Pleuragramma {{antarctica}} is {{the dominant}} forage fish of the coastal Antarctic, exhibiting a circumantarctic distribution and a well documented abundance in all shelf environments, from the high Antarctic Weddell and Ross Sea systems, to the milder waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) shelf. Rapid regional warming on the WAP has produced a dichotomy in annual weather patterns between the high Antarctic systems and the WAP, resulting in swiftly rising midwinter air temperatures and fewer sea <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> during the annual winter cycle on the WAP, and little change in the Ross and Weddell Seas. The WAP shelf thus provides a model system for examining the potential effects of climate warming on an important Antarctic species. Pleuragramma’s life history is characterized by slow growth, late maturity, a high reproductive investment and an association with coastal sea ice for spawning and larval development. All those features will allow the species to weather episodic annual failures in recruitment, but not long term change. Most effects of the increasing temperature associated with climate change will be indirect ones, as temperatures will not increase {{to the point where}} they are physiologically life-threatening in the short term. A recent survey of Pleuragramma distribution on the WAP shelf revealed a large break in its historical distribution in shelf waters, suggesting a collapse in the local population of silverfish there. The break occurred in the area that has been most heavily impacted by rapid regional warming: the northern mid-shelf including Anvers and Renaud Island. It may be that the multi-faceted effects of climate change are already at work in its local disappearance...|$|E

This lagoon {{is a crucial}} staging area during migration for numerous species of avian migrants and a major eelgrass (Zostera marina) area important {{to a variety of}} marine and terrestrial organisms, especially Pacific Flyway black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans). Ice cover is a common feature of the lagoon in winter, but appears to be declining, which has implications for eelgrass distribution and abundance, and its use by wildlife. We evaluated ice conditions from a model based on degree days, calibrated to satellite observations, to estimate distribution and long-term trends in ice conditions in Izembek Lagoon. Model results compared favorably with ground observations and 26. years of satellite data, allowing ice conditions to be reconstructed back to 1943. Specifically, periods of significant (limited access to eelgrass areas) and severe (almost complete ice coverage of the lagoon) ice conditions could be identified. The number of days of severe ice within a single season ranged from 0 (e. g., 2001) to 2 ̆ 265 67 (e. g., 2000). We detected a slight long-term negative trend in ice conditions, superimposed on high inter-annual variability in seasonal aggregate ice conditions. Based on reconstructed ice conditions, the seasonally cumulative number of significant or severe <b>ice</b> <b>days</b> correlated linearly with mean air temperature from January until March. Further, air temperature at Izembek Lagoon was correlated with wind direction, suggesting that ice conditions in Izembek Lagoon were associated with synoptic-scale weather patterns.

All values of median volume diameters (MVD) are approximately capped by 70 μm and the typical values are around 15 μm. Supercooled Large Droplets represent approximately 5 %. The vertical profile of icing climatology demonstrates a steady duration of icing events until the level of 60 m.
