40|$|AbstractIn {{an effort}} to create an environmentally-friendly flame {{retardant}} system for rigid polyisocyanurate-polyurethane <b>foams,</b> <b>expandable</b> graphite (EG) combined with aluminum hydroxide (ATH) was firstly used to effectively improve the flame retardancy. Limited oxygen index (LOI) increased to 84. 2 with an incorporation of 24 phr (parts per hundred of matrix) EG and 50 phr ATH into the matrix. Based on scanning electronic microscopy observation and thermogravimetric analysis, it was speculated that ATH could effectively induce “villi” like particles {{on the surface of}} EG, which made the intumescent char denser. The compact char layer could effectively impede the bubbles and heat transport. ATH and EG accelerated the initial degradation and fluffy char was quickly generated on the surface, which results in the slowed down degradation products of the composite and the delayed diffusion of volatile combustible fragments to flame zone...|$|R

A new thermoplastic elastomer bead foam, which is described as expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (ETPU), now exists. Notably, it has an excellent soft touch quality and is ductile. It has also generated widespread interest in both the academic and industrial communities. In this study, three types of ETPU foams with various sample sizes were steam-chest molded. We concentrated on the preparation of the molded ETPU (METPU), which was followed by a mechanical test. Our morphological observations showed that the ETPU bead foams' interfaces had effectively bonded. A high tensile strength of 1. 80 MPa and an elongation at break of 360. 1 % were reached in the METPU sample with a density of 0. 35 g/cm(3). A 200 -fold cyclic compression measurement verified that the compressed METPU sample could recover more than 95 % both in stress and modulus, after 6 days of relaxation. This suggested the presence of excellent interbead bonding in the ETPU bead foams. Based on the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results, we proposed that a formation mechanism for interbead bonding during the ETPU steam-molding process existed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Unconfined compressive strength tests were conducted on 13 sets of samples with different mix proportions that were subjected to changeable freeze-thaw cycles. The purpose is to analyze the compressive strength and deformation characteristics of the lightweight fillers under freeze-thaw conditions. It is found that materials maintain acceptable mechanical behavior after subject to freeze-thaw cycles. Mixture components play different roles in affecting the strength characteristics of materials. Cement component clearly enhances anti-freeze capability of the materials. Components of EPS and fly ash may improve the freeze-thaw resistance of the materials. Water is the main source causing freeze-thaw failure. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} water content be prudentially controlled as long as adequate water supply for cement hydration is provided. The mechanism of materials' freeze/thaw resistance is also discussed. = 通过对不同配合比的 13 组试样在不同冻融循环次数下的无侧限抗压强度试验,研究了冻融循环对轻质填料抗压强度与变形特性的影响. 结果表明,轻质填料经历冻融循环后仍具有良好的力学性能,各组分对轻质填料抗冻融特性的影响程度不同,掺加水泥可有效抵抗冻胀力,EPS颗粒和粉煤灰在掺量适中的情况下,可显著提高轻质填料的抗冻融性能,水分是造成轻质填料冻融破坏的主要因素,在满足水泥水化所需水分的前提下,寒区工程中应用轻质填料需适当降低含水率. 另外,在分析不同控制强度下轻质填料冻融破坏特点的基础上,分析了该轻质填料抗冻融破坏机理.

40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{the effects of}} material, structural and testing parameters of carbon epoxy braided composite tubes were analysed {{with respect to their}} performance in crush and impact conditions. An original method of manufacturing the composite tubes with vacuum infusion together with an <b>expandable</b> <b>foam</b> core to form multi-cellular structures was used. Low cost, 24 k tow carbon fibre braids were used and their performance was compared with that of the more expensive l 2 k tow size fibres. The specimens produced were axially crushed at constant quasi-static low velocities and at higher impact velocities using an instrumented falling weight machine. Load displacement data gathered from such tests were used to evaluate the test specimens with respect to their specific energy absorption values. The effects of a number of parameters including fibre tow size, braid architecture, resin content and loading type were evaluated. From the experimental results analysed from the test specimens it can be concluded that: - The 24 k fibre showed lower specific energy absorption values than specimens made from l 2 k fibre. Epoxy resin content rather than epoxy resin type can significantly affect the specific energy absorption values. In general, specimens tested in impact loading exhibited lower specific energy absorption values than the same specimens test in quasi-static crush.

40|$|The aim is {{to develop}} a {{lightweight}} particleboard with a target density between 300 kg/m' and 500 kg/m' for the furniture industry. Basically, there are two different ways to achieve this objective: 1. Use of lightweight raw material 2. Addition of a lightweight material to fill the pore space within the panel. To implement the first approach, a joint European project called DIPP, in which lightweight particleboards are made from annual and perennial plants such as hemp, sunflower, topinambur, maize and miscanthus. As the stalks of sunflower (Helianthus annuus), topinambur (Helianthus tuberosus) and maize (Zea maize) are filled with light parenchyma cells, they are particularly suitable for the production of lightweight particleboards. Various conventional and natural adhesives like urea- or tannin-formaldehyde resin and PMDI were used, and the properties of the boards produced were compared with reference particleboards made from wood particles. The second approach is pursued in a project funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in which a lightweight particleboard based a <b>foamed</b> adhesives and <b>expandable</b> filler materials is developed. Within this project, three strategies are pursued: Foaming of urea-formaldehyde adhesive using air and surfactants (results are not shown); Mixing of expandable, gas-filled microspheres and polystyrene into ureaformaldehyde resin; Use of formaldehyde-free, foam-generating polyurethane adhesives (results not shown).

The former {{in response to the}} higher damage stability standards recommended following the conclusion of the EMSA III project and the latter in case IMO decided to apply higher damage stability requirements retrospectively, particularly in the aftermath of an accident. Such a framework would provide the motivation for instigating and establishing novel damage stability enhancing paradigms in line with IMO Circular 1455 on equivalents, for alternative compliance. This, in turn, would enable the industry to focus on all credible measures for damage stability enhancement in case of a flooding accident. This represents a step change both in the mind-set of naval architects and in safety legislation but the impact will be immense and mostly positive.

Block Party explores the alchemy of the centuries-old skill of tailoring by presenting work by 15 UK and international artists who push pattern-cutting beyond the fashion garment. The artists Lucy Orta has selected take pattern-cutting as a starting point to produce sculpture, ceramics, textile, moving image and collage. Through experimentation the artists have found new ways to assemble pattern shapes, not to create garments but to manipulate shape to realise new outcomes. Block Party focuses on three themes; Storytelling, Embracing the Future, and Motif and Manipulation. In Storytelling artists use pattern-cutting as a means of expression. Turner Prize-nominated Yinka Shonibare MBE presents a child mannequin, dressed in a historically accurate Victorian outfit crafted from African fabric to reference culture, race and history. Claudia Losi’s 24 m whale made of woollen suit fabric was transported around the world to stimulate discussion and storytelling before being deconstructed and transformed into jackets in collaboration with fashion designer Antonio Marras. In Embracing the Future existing pattern-cutting methods are manipulated and challenged through the use of innovative processes and technologies. Simon Thorogood’s patterns are created using digital programmes whilst Philip Delamore of the Fashion Digital Studio at London College of Fashion seeks to apply the latest developments in 3 D digital design to the garment making process. In Motif and Manipulation the beauty of the paper pattern block is the visual inspiration.

40|$|Lightweight {{boards and}} beams in the wood-based {{construction}} and furniture industry {{are not a}} new topic. The density reduction of panels using sandwich structure with light cores was confirmed by users like doors or mobile homes {{more than three decades}} ago. Today many ways to attain a lighter wooden structure are on offer, partially in industrial application. The first one is the use of light-weight wood species like balsa, lime, pine from southern hemisphere plantations etc. limited by the availability, strength properties, gluability and so on. A second one is the sandwich structure made from hard faces like thick veneer, thin plywood, particleboard or high density thin fiberboard and cores made from honeycomb paper, very light wood species or foams like the polystyrene one. A third way to produce a light structure is to reduce the core drastically, using predesigned skeletons with special shapes and connections to the faces. The engines for these developments are on the one hand the fast growing market of knockdown furniture {{and on the other hand}} the increasing costs for energy and raw materials. Additional factors that make weight saving a primary economical objective for most producers are transportation costs, easier handling and higher acceptance among the end users. Moreover, customers demand more for ergonomical solutions regarding packaging. Many patents were generated by researchers and developers for new one-stage production processes for sandwich panels with wood- and impregnated paper-based facings made from veneers, particles or fibres and a core consisting of <b>expandable</b> <b>foams,</b> particles or embedded hard skeletons. These ideas or prototypes could be integrated in existing continuous pressing lines for wood based panels keeping some of the advantages of the continuous production technique in matters of efficiency.
