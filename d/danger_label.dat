40|$|This article {{considers}} the gendered processes {{of social change}} in Nepal. In particular, I examine how young working class women in urban Nepal articulate their modern subjectivities. In {{the last thirty years}} women have been making significant inroads into Nepal’s public sphere, troubling long-held normative assumptions about women’s place in modern Nepal. In particular, historically dominant high-caste Hindu norms that disapprove women’s public visibility and mobility are challenged by new opportunity structures for women and an emergent structure of feeling advocating women’s equal participation in Nepal’s development projects. Rapid democratization of the political sphere, urbanization, and expansion of capitalist markets has precipitated enormous shifts in Nepal’s social organization including how women from diverse caste and ethnic backgrounds participate in the newly monetized economy as laborers and consumers. Young working class women have unprecedented access to disposable income. With their wages, they enjoy the pleasures of purchasing power and, through consumptive practices, craft their identity as modern commodity consumers. At the same time, as participants in the public sphere of wage labor, working class women are deeply aware of the social risks they are taking as publicly visible women. These risks include the <b>danger</b> of being <b>labeled</b> “over modern” and “open”–descriptors with undertones of sexual immorality. Drawing on 20 months of ethnographic research conducted with one group of young working class women: female trekking guides, I contextualize my informants’ experiences of wage earning and consumption. I explore the justifications my informants use to legitimate their public visibility and the pleasure they take in commodity consumption as well as the strategies they deploy to counter negative stereotypes associated with their status as public women. I end with a discussion of anxiety as a productive force in the lives of my informants and show how tensions between the pleasures of purchasing power and the <b>dangers</b> of being <b>labeled</b> “over modern” bracket their experiences of day-to-day living...|$|R
40|$|HCI is {{increasingly}} working with ‘vulnerable’ people {{yet there is}} a <b>danger</b> that the <b>label</b> of vulnerability can alienate and stigmatize the people such work aims to support. We report our study investigating the application of interaction design to increase rates of hate crime reporting amongst Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender young people. During design-led workshops participants expressed ambivalence towards reporting. While recognizing their exposure to hate crime they simultaneously rejected ascription as victim as implied in the act of reporting. We used visual communication design to depict the young people’s ambivalent identities and contribute insights on how these fail and succeed to account for the intersectional, fluid and emergent nature of LGBT identities through the design research process. We argue that by producing ambiguous designed texts, alongside conventional qualitative data, we ‘trouble’ our design research narratives as a tactic to disrupt static and reductive understandings of vulnerability within HCI...|$|R
40|$|Psychiatric diagnoses are {{commonly}} used in both public and mental health professional discourse. They represent and communicate different distressing mental states. Throughout the ages there have been attempts to capture and communicate these states of being. This is what drives psychiatry’s desire to refine psychiatric diagnosis. To demonstrate this, I will conduct {{an analysis of the}} term ‘mental illness’, and how psychiatry has sought to define, and also treat it. Different therapeutic models and classification systems are described, and their impact on the area critiqued. Particular focus is given to mental health services for young people in acute care. In these settings, professionals are faced with the most distressed and vulnerable young people in society. They must balance the demands of the job; psychiatric diagnosis is an administrative obligation for every mental health professional, with the <b>danger</b> of <b>labelling</b> a young person with a potentially stigmatizing mental illness. As a result, some professionals (e. g. Koehne, Hamilton, Sands & Humphries, 2012) feel conflicted about using psychiatric diagnosis in their daily practice. This leads to the main project aim; to investigate the role of diagnosis in the clinical work of mental health professionals working in acute child and adolescent care. Finally, the study method is outlined and rationale explained. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required. Non university access may be obtained by visiting the University of Sydney Library...|$|R

A ten-year education plan (Clondalkin Partnership, 1999) and a study of school absenteeism (McSorley, 1997) highlighted the problems of young people at risk. Clondalkin Partnershipâs Area Action Plan 2000 - 2006 includes âsupport for young people at risk of exclusion from schoolâ as one of its key community-based initiatives. The Education Working Group of Clondalkin Partnership established the Working Party on Young People exhibiting Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties, to examine the possibility of providing a local area intervention for children in this category. The results of the research are presented in this report. Aims and objectives of the research The aim of this research is to provide a theoretical and practical grounding from which to develop an appropriate and effective intervention for young people exhibiting emotional and behavioural difficulties in Clondalkin.

40|$|The West is the Best? These {{words of}} Jim Morrison echo {{in my mind}} when {{reflecting}} upon popular music practices in China. The words do not point at an evaluative judgement on my site – on the contrary, {{for more than ten}} years, I keep on listening to Chinese rock and pop music. They do point at the position of Chinese musicians who have to face the constant <b>danger</b> of being <b>labelled</b> mere copycats as the perceived origin and authenticator of popular music is located in the West, at least in popular (and, unfortunately so, also academic) discourse. There are sufficient philosophical reasons to mistrust the Western claim to be the origin of rock, as Foucault reminds us, “what is found at the historical beginning of things is not the inviolable identity of their origin; it is the dissension of other things. It is disparity. ” (Foucault 1984, p. 79) Elsewhere I have shown how Chinese musicians, under the scrutinizing eyes of both Western and Chinese journalists and academics, must bear the authenticating proof for their music, a burden that is often translated into an eager Sinification, by invoking in sound and image references to either “ancient China ” or “Communist China ” (De Kloet 2005 a). In this paper I aim to show how, under the accelerated forces of globalization, such localizing aspirations become increasingly polluted. I this paper will analyze the rise o...|$|R
40|$|Background: Oppositional and {{aggressive}} behaviour in children below {{twelve years of}} age is a frequent cause of concern for parents and teachers, and a common reason for referral to child and adolescent psychiatry. Whereas most children outgrow these behaviours, a small subgroup is at risk for developing a persistent antisocial lifestyle. Successfully identifying children at risk could prevent potential human and economic suffering of the child, his/her family, potential victim(s) and society. However, predicting which children are at higher risk for future antisocial behaviours is intricate and associated with the perils of mislabelling. Recently, promising approaches for early identification of boys at risk for future antisocial behaviour have been formulated. These include assessments of risk factors (risk assessments) and evaluation of certain personality traits callous-unemotional (CU) traits. CU-traits are defined as patterns of emotional dysregulation, such as a pronounced lack of empathy, remorselessness and shallow affects. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate whether these structured approaches might improve early identification of clinic-referred boys at risk for future antisocial behaviour and to explore clinical child psychiatric work with these children and their families. Method: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies was used. A prospective longitudinal multicentre project was initiated in mid-Sweden during 2001. Parents of clinic-referred boys (n = 76) completed questionnaires and participated in a semi-structured researcher-led interview at baseline, yielding information to evaluate the risk for future antisocial behaviour. Parents were then interviewed again after six and thirty months. At the thirty-month follow-up we also included teachers as informants. Child clinicians at each clinic were asked to fill in separate evaluations of the boys risk. Furthermore, a qualitative {{study was conducted in}} which narrative interviews with 16 clinicians from seven child psychiatric teams enabled exploration of clinical work with conduct-disordered boys. Results: Assessments of risk for future antisocial behaviour, based on the risk assessment tool Early Assessment Risk List for Boys (EARL- 20 B), demonstrated acceptable interrater reliability (Paper I). EARL- 20 B-based assessments were associated with concurrent and prospective estimates of antisocial behaviour (Paper I-II). Combinations of EARL- 20 B risk factors were tentatively identified through cluster analysis, distinguishing between boys with high and low levels of antisocial behaviour (Paper I). Comparing the EARL- 20 B-based baseline evaluations with unstructured clinical baseline evaluations of risk and baseline DSM-IV Conduct Disorder (CD) indicated incremental predictive validity of the EARL- 20 B. The AUC estimate of CD-diagnosis at the thirty-month follow-up was of good accuracy (. 87) for the EARL- 20 B. Further, conduct problem boys (n = 41) high on CU-traits had significantly more pervasive, varied {{and aggressive}} disruptive behavioural problems than boys low on these traits. This finding was not explained by the presence of DSM-IV AD/HD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) /CD symptoms. Boys with CU-traits experienced poorer household circumstances, lived in families under high stress and received less help in school from special teachers than boys low in CU-traits (Paper III). The qualitative study suggested that child psychiatry clinicians consider a multitude of case characteristics when working with antisocial boys (Paper IV). The behaviour of the boys sometimes evoked feelings of fear among caregivers, signalling the need for instant interventions. The teams described a lack of consent and collaboration with other agencies, with unclear responsibilities across organisations. Conclusions: The results suggest that structured assessments of risk and the evaluation of CU-traits can be valuable for identifying severe antisocial behaviour in boys. Early identification procedures touch upon the delicate balance between discerning children at risk to prevent them from repeated violent and norm-breaking behaviours, and the <b>dangers</b> of <b>labelling.</b> When addressing either risk for violence or CU-traits in boys, the purpose, due to ethical considerations, should therefore be to prevent serious antisocial behaviours from occurring through the provision of treatment and other interventions. Over the years, researchers and clinicians have pointed to a need for improved management of antisocial behaviour in child psychiatric services. Improved collaboration and clearer responsibilities among agencies still seem necessary to enable good care and management...|$|R
