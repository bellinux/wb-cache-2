25|$|When Home Box Office (HBO) began {{scrambling}} its signal on a 24-hour {{basis on}} January 15, 1986, it offered subscriptions to home dish owners for $12.95 per month ($28.92 in 2017 dollars), which was either {{equal to or}} slightly higher than what cable subscribers paid. HBO also advised viewers that purchasing a descrambler for $395 ($882.21 in 2017 dollars) would (along with the monthly fee) allow them to continue watching HBO. Several satellite dish dealers across the United States closed their stores {{as a result of}} a reduction <b>in</b> <b>dish</b> sales, caused by the rise in signal scrambling. Satellite dish owners began protests over scrambling, saying that clear signals from cable channels would become difficult to receive. One such protest was by members of the Satellite Television Industry Association, who converged on Washington, D.C., in March 1986 to urge the United States Congress to protect access to satellite transmissions.|$|E

Craig Moffett, senior analyst of U.S. telecommunications, U.S. cable, and satellite broadcasting at Sanford C. Bernstein once requested time with management to learn about how Dish does business. Ergen told him, “We’re too busy creating value around here {{to sit down and}} talk about it. Thanks but no thanks.” Chris Marangi, a money manager for Gamco Investors, which held about 4 millions shares <b>in</b> <b>Dish,</b> said that the company is very uncooperative. He says that despite traveling to Denver frequently has never been able to get a meeting with Ergen or any other Dish senior manager. “They’re probably the least transparent company of any I’ve ever dealt with." [...] Dish sends out press releases on its earnings deliberately late enough to be of little or no use to analysts and investors whom are then forced to sort through complicated filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.|$|E

50|$|Most {{dishwasher}} detergent contains complex phosphates, as {{they have}} several properties that aid in effective cleaning. However, the same chemicals {{have been removed from}} laundry detergents in many countries as a result of concerns raised about the increase in algal blooms in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels (see eutrophication). Seventeen US states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates <b>in</b> <b>dish</b> detergent, and two US states (Maryland and New York) ban phosphates in commercial dishwashing. Detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans (although detergents are typically formulated for local markets), and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all dishwasher detergents.|$|E

50|$|On May 20, 2010, Dish Network {{announced}} that it was dropping The Weather Channel at midnight ET that day in favor of its own similar weather information channel, The Weather Cast.

As of May 24, The Weather Channel stated that it had come to an agreement with Dish Network that would result <b>in</b> <b>Dish</b> Network carrying The Weather Channel for the next several years.
