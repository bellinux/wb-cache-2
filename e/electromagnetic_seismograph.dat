40|$|We review {{historical}} earthquake {{research in}} Northern Europe. 'Historical' {{is defined as}} being identical with seismic events occurring in the pre-instrumental and early instrumental periods between 1073 and the mid- 1960 s. The first seismographs in this region were installed in Uppsala, Sweden and Bergen, Norway in 1904 - 1905, but these mechanical pendulum instruments were broad band and amplification factors were modest at around 500. Until the 1960 s few modern short period <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>seismographs</b> were deployed. Scientific earthquake studies in this region began during {{the first decades of}} the 1800 s, while the systematic use of macroseismic questionnaires commenced at the end of that century. Basic research efforts have vigorously been pursued from the 1970 s onwards because of the mandatory seismic risk studies for commissioning nuclear power plants in Sweden, Finland, NW Russia, Kola and installations of huge oil platforms in the North Sea. The most comprehensive earthquake database currently available for Northern Europe is the FENCAT catalogue covering about six centuries and representing the accumulation of work conducted by many scientists during the last 200 years. This catalogue is given in parametric form, while original macroseismic observations and intensity maps for the largest earthquakes can be found in various national publications, often in local languages. No database giving intensity data points exists in computerized form for the region. The FENCAT catalogue still contains some spurious events of various kinds but more serious are some recent claims that some of the presumed largest historical earthquakes have been assigned too large magnitude values, which would have implications for earthquake hazard levels implemented in national building codes. We discuss future cooperative measures such as establishing macroseismic data archives as a means for promoting further research on historical earthquakes in Northern Europe...|$|R
50|$|In 1947, {{the central}} office of the Weather Bureau was moved to Marsman Building (opposite Pier 15 at the Port Area of Manila), while the Forecasting Center was {{transferred}} to the old Balagbag terminal (site of the first terminal of the Manila International Airport) and became the Manila Main Meteorological Office (MMMO). The first post-war geophysical observatory of the Bureau was established in 1949 behind the campus of the University of the Philippines in Diliman. In 1948, a set of <b>electromagnetic</b> photorecording <b>seismographs</b> was installed in order to improve its seismological services. On April 5, 1949, the Philippines was admitted into the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with the Weather Bureau as its National Meteorological Service. In the same year, temperature, relative humility and pressure observations in the upper atmosphere were made twice daily by the Laoag, Cebu and Zamboanga field stations.|$|R
40|$|The high {{sensitivity}} tripartite observation {{has been}} carried out since November, 1965 up to the present, at Hoshina, Nagano Prefecture, with a view to investigate the activities of micro- and ultra micro-earthquakes in the area of Matsushiro Earthquakes. The observational results in the periods from October 31 to December 18, 1965, from February 20 to June 20, 1966 and from June 21 to September 20, 1966 {{have been reported in the}} previous papers. Following from these papers, the present paper will report the results obtained at Hoshina in the period from the latter part of September to November, 1966. In addition the observational result obtained at the Sanada station, which was newly established in September 1966, will be reported together with a description of the observational and analytical method adopted there. At the present time, the Matsushiro earthquakes are observed by the temporary seismographic network with the acceleration seismographs and the HES <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>seismographs</b> set up at Hoshina, Akashiba, Zozan, Mori, Sakaki, etc. Besides this ordinary method of observation, the high sensitivity tripartite observation is carried out in and near the area of Matsushiro Earthquakes, i. e., at Hoshina (36 ° 35 'N, 138 ° 16 'E), Sanada (36 ° 26 'N, 138 ° 18 'E), Kamimuroga (36 ° 24 'N, 138 ° 9 'E) and Asakawa (36 ° 41 'N, 138 ° 11 'E). Analysing the observational data from these seismographic stations, we found that the hypocenters could not be determined consistently with all observational data if we assume a uniform underground structure. However, we found it difficult, at the same time, to determine or assume any complicated structure immediately. Therefore we adopted as before the assumption of the uniform structure as a first approximation when determining the hypocenters. The hypocenters of the Matsushiro earthquakes should be determined more exactly on the basis of the most suitable underground structure, so our intention is to make further study on this problem using all data obtained at various stations in the area of Matsushiro. The results of this study will be reported at the next opportunity. 松代地震地域における微小及び極微小地震の活動を調べる目的で,高感度 3 点方式による地震観測が,若穂町保科において, 1965 年 11 月から行なわれている. その結果はすでに第 1 報～第 3 報で報告してある. 今回はその続きとして, 1966 年 9 月下旬～ 11 月下旬の期間の若穂町保科での観測結果と同年 9 月に新設された真田町・長での観測結果の報告である. 若穂町保科での観測及び解析の方法は以前と重復するのでここでは省き,ここでは新しく始められた真田町・長での観測及び解析の方法についてのみ観測結果と共に報告する...|$|R

40|$|Luigi Palmieri (Faicchio 1807 -Naples 1896), was {{appointed}} Director of the Vesuvius Observatory in 1855. He rea 1 ized {{the first model}} of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>seismograph</b> and the uninterrupted use at the Observatory of this instrument represented the first step towards a geophysical sensu strictu surveillance of Mt. Vesuvius area. Already {{at the end of}} the 18 th century, Ascanio Filomarino had built a mechanical seismograph which was ab 1 e to record the amplitude of the seismic waves, the incoming direction of the earthquake and its starting time. In 1862 Michele Baldacchini proposed to the Neapolitan scientific community a question about the possibility to use the study of precursory signs of the Vesuvian eruptions to inform in advance people living near the vo 1 cano. Palmieri answered Baldacchini's request, giving proof of extreme far-sightedness from the scientific point of view but, similarly, much concreteness from the practica 1 point of view: he described, with modern ideas, the things to do in order to carry out the surveillance in the Mt. Vesuvius area, but concluded thus: "Till we have not the (economic and instrumental) means we have spoken above, I think it is useless to entertain the Academy about the nature and the method of the observations and investigations to be performed"...|$|E
40|$|The Vesuvius Observatory, first volcanological {{observatory}} in the world, {{was built}} in 1841 by King Ferdinand II of Bourbon. It is now the Naples section of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV). Since its foundation it has been not only a reference point for national and international scientific community, but also a place of information and dissemination for {{the population in the}} field of research and monitoring of volcanic phenomena. Always museum activities, guided tours through the collections of scientific instruments, rocks and minerals have been carried out in it. Since 2000 scientific and historical collections located into the old building of Vesuvius Observatory have been organized in the exhibition "Vesuvius: 2000 years of observations", which describes the eruptive history of Somma-Vesuvius, with the aim of providing updated information about monitoring of active volcanoes, on eruptive phenomena and related hazards, educating the population of areas exposed to volcanic hazards. The museum path is targeted to public of any geographical origin and cultural background and could be considered a journey through the history of volcanology from the beginning until the present day. In the exhibition, Vesuvius is the backdrop to an exhibition in which purely scientific elements coexist with historical, archaeological, literary, artistic aspects, thanks to the support of images, documents such as the geological map of Henry James Johnston-Lavis and the book "Campi Flegrei" by William Hamilton, specimens of rocks and minerals and old scientific instruments, used in the past for monitoring volcanic activity, including the first <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>seismograph</b> made by Luigi Palmieri. The first part of this work is focussed on the description of the existing exhibition. Since 2000 the statistical survey of the public of the museum has been carried out through an evaluation procedure form. The findings relate to the monthly and annual attendance, geographical origin and kind of visitors. In the second part of this work results for the five years from 2005 to 2009 are described. The characterization of different audiences in the museum means that, from time to time, the path of the visit could be arranged according to the expectations and needs of visitors; in this context, the museum educator plays the delicate role of mediator, with accurate language, between the contents of the museum and those who interact with it...|$|E
40|$|The {{museum of}} Vesuvius Observatory was created through the {{enlargement}} and updating {{of a permanent}} exhibition, set up in 2000 {{with the aim of}} make citizens aware of volcanic phenomena, volcanic hazard and surveillance of active volcanoes in high risk areas, such as Naples and surroundings. The museum is located into the historical building of the Vesuvius Observatory, the first volcanological observatory in the world, currently part of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV). In the museum the dominant theme is Vesuvius: scientific issues are strictly interlaced with historical, archaeological and literary topics. The exhibition path goes from the presentation of volcanic hazard to volcanological methodologies used to define the eruptive history of a volcano. It traces the eruptive history of Somma-Vesuvius pointing out the most famous eruptions of 79 AD and 1944. Volcanic products are also displayed. The path is enriched by the exhibition of historical documents as the geological map of Somma–Vesuvius by Johnston-Lavis and copies of Ercolano and Pompeii casts. Also historical scientific instruments are shown, including the first <b>electromagnetic</b> Palmieri <b>seismograph.</b> The tour ends with a practical experience of simulation of an earthquake. Since the year 2000 checking of visiting public was carried out. This work presents statistics related to the public of the museum in the years 2005 - 2009. The monthly occurrence of visitors, visitors origin, category of visitors (distinguishing among schools, universities, groups and others) percentage, amount of visitors during weekdays and holidays are presented. Statistics put in evidence that the audience is mostly made up of school groups, coming from the Campania region preferentially in the months of April and May. The accurate identification of the public allows the museum staff to arrange a tour tailored for different types of visitors, enhancing the quality of the communication...|$|R
30|$|To conclude, {{the seismic}} {{parameters}} of three large historical earthquakes, 04.01. 1935 (GMT) 14 : 41 and 16 : 20 (GMT) Marmara Island–Erdek and 18.09. 1963 - 16 : 58 (GMT) Çınarcık-Yalova Earthquakes, which {{occurred in the}} Marmara Region, have been assessed using original records from mechanical and also <b>electromagnetic</b> (Galitzin 1914) <b>seismographs.</b> The epicenter estimations gave the results 40.72 N– 27.72 E and 40.61 N– 27.43 E for the 04.01. 1935 - 14 : 41 (GMT) and 16 : 20 (GMT) Earthquakes, respectively. Furthermore, 18.09. 1963 - 16 : 58 (GMT) Earthquake was located at 40.80 N– 29.18 E. Despite {{the fact that we}} had some deficits in the seismogram quality and limited azimuthal coverage, the fault mechanisms for these events that occurred in 1935 were determined for the first time. Our preferred solution showed that the fault mechanisms for the three events are normal faults and coincide with the seismotectonic structure of the Marmara Region, considering the recent studies (Korkusuz Öztürk et al. 2015; Karabulut et al. 2002, 2011; Tunç et al. 2011; Örgülü and Aktar 2001). These findings may be developed by analyzing also other historical earthquakes in the Marmara Region and attribute to understanding of its complicated seismotectonic structure and seismic hazard analysis.|$|R
40|$|The Matsushiro {{earthquake}} swarm commenced in August 1965 and continues even at present {{when more than}} a year and a half has passed since the outbreak. For the sake of convenience, we divided the activity of this {{earthquake swarm}} into four stages. The first stage of activity: This was the period from the outbreak of the earthquake swarm to February 1966, the highest peak of the activity occcurring in November 1965. The main shocks took place around Mt. Minakami, especially on its southwestern side, during this period. Shocks were not felt so frequently as later at Hoshina at that time. The second stage of activity: This began in March 1966 and continued to the beginning of June 1966. The activity at this time was most violent throughout the whole period, the area of seismic activity extending to a broader area of Matsushiro and Wakaho. In April 1966, the frequency of earthquakes reached the maximum throughout the whole period and large shocks with intensity of IV or V on the JMA scale took place frequently, inflicting some damage on dwelling houses and other constructions in this area. The third period of activity: This continued from August to October 1966. The seismic active area in this period was mainly at Matsushiro and Wakaho as was in the second period but it extended gradually to the eastern part of Koshoku and to the northern part of Sanada. Large shocks with intensity of IV or V on the JMA scale also occurred during this period. In November 1966, the frequency of earthqakes decreased greatly compared with the previous month and large shocks also did not take place. The fourth stage of activity: We call the period from January to the present the fourth stage of activity. The special feature of this stage was that the earthquakes that had clustered in the area of Matsushiro in the earlier stages of activity decreased in number remarkably, while the seismic area extended widely northeastward and southwestward, many shocks taking place in a part of Wakaho and in the southern part of Mt. Kamuriki. This paper will compile the result of our seismographic observation carried out during the period from December 1966 to February 1967 as the fourth report continuing from our previous ones. The seismographs used at each station were the HES 1 - 0. 2 <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>seismograph</b> and the Ishimoto acceleration seismograph, of which the constants were indicated in Table 1 in our second report. The members of the Institute who participated in the field observation were: T. Hagiwara S. Saito, I. Karakama, M. Watanabe, T. Takahashi and Y. Ishikawa and the members of the Institute engaged in interpretation and analysis of seismograms being: T. Hagiwara, T. Iwata, K. Makino, N. Kamata, M. Kino, Y. Miura and R. Kawashima. 1965 年 8 月 3 日に始まる長野県松代町地域の群発地震は, 1967 年 2 月 28 日に至る 19 カ月を, 4 つの地震活動期に分けて考えることができよう. 第 1 期の地震活動 発生より 1965 年 11 月に至る期間で,このときの主な有感地震の発生地域は皆神山の周辺,特にその南西部で,大きな地震はすべてこの地域に発生した. なお,第 1 期では若穂町保科週辺に極めて少数の有感地震が認められている...|$|E
