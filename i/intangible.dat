40|$|This study investigates how {{firms in}} the Australian {{property}} and construction sector manage their <b>intangibles</b> in order to operationalise sustainable development. Previous research linking <b>intangibles</b> and corporate sustainability has {{tended to focus on}} <b>intangibles</b> as a phenomenon endeavouring to establish links between <b>intangibles</b> and corporate financial performance. This thesis makes a unique contribution to knowledge by drawing a conceptual bridge between the <b>intangibles</b> and corporate sustainability literature using both the phenomenon and practice based approach to <b>intangibles.</b> The practice based approach aims to understand how firms manage and mobilise their <b>intangibles</b> towards a purpose â�� which for this research is sustainable development. A key outcome of this study is a framework to manage firmsâ�� <b>intangibles</b> which outlines how firms identify, measure/value, control, and report their <b>intangibles</b> at various stages of corporate sustainability. The research design is a case study methodology, implemented across two phases, using mixed methods. The first phase focused on the phenomenon of <b>intangibles</b> in the wider Australian property and construction sector. Data was collected using a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews and content analysis. In the second phase, four case studies of individual firms were conducted to study the practice of <b>intangibles.</b> There were two key findings of this research. The first is that the practice based approach to <b>intangibles</b> more accurately reflected how {{firms in the}} Australian property and construction sector manage their <b>intangibles.</b> However, tensions still exist between the more traditional accounting-based phenomenon approach to <b>intangibles</b> and the practice based approach. This is particularly relevant in the business case for sustainability. The second main finding is that firms in the case study sector are actively managing their <b>intangibles</b> to implement organisational change for sustainability. This finding {{led to the development of}} the â��inside- outâ�� approach to operationalising sustainable development which focuses on managing a firmâ��s <b>intangibles</b> rather than just its environmental and social performance...|$|R

5|$|The UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the <b>Intangible</b> Cultural Heritage {{took place}} in 2003 and South Korea joined the program a year later. In 2005 China {{declared}} some 1200 properties as <b>intangible</b> cultural heritage, with 16 items belonging to the Korean minority of the country, including the traditional wedding ceremony, Arirang (a folk song) and nolttwigi (a traditional seesaw game).

Others were added based on the opinions of researchers and also included winners of the annual folk tradition competitions. The recommendation of local administrations was also sought.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{construct}} and propose a definition for <b>intangibles</b> derived from the resource‐based view (RBV) of the firm for use in academic research and practical applications. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Intangibles</b> are defined as a subset of corporate resources. In this paper, various definitions for <b>intangibles</b> are tested against the RBV framework. Findings – The majority of definitions in the extant literature are (implicitly or explicitly) in synchronization with the RBV. Thus, it is possible to find and propose a common definition for <b>intangibles.</b> Research limitations/implications – Some researchers argue that the field is still in its embryonic stages and thus the concepts might still be too fresh in order to find a stable common definition. Practical implications – The paper offers a conceptual lens through which one can clearly link <b>intangibles</b> to strategy and offers a proposed definition of <b>intangibles</b> that incorporates a meta‐review of the literature. Originality/value – The paper shows that it is in fact possible to accommodate various definitions of <b>intangibles</b> under one common framework and propose a unified characterization...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Based on the {{literature}} devoted to family firms and the intellectual capital-based {{view of the}} firm, {{the purpose of this}} paper is not only to identify the most important human capital <b>intangibles</b> owned by family firms but also to show a number of indicators that can help measure them. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative case-study-based research approach was adopted taking as reference: 25 family firms belonging to different sectors; previous works existing in {{the literature}}; and the intellectus model. Findings – The present study identifies ten <b>intangibles</b> associated with the human capital of family firms and shows 60 indicators that can be used to measure them. It additionally provides empirical evidence and gives examples of these <b>intangibles</b> through the analysis of 25 international family firms. Research limitations/implications – The difficulty in collecting all the human capital <b>intangibles</b> of family firms; the problems associated with the creation of accurate indicators; and those specific to the research methodology adopted. Practical implications – Identifying the human capital <b>intangibles</b> of family firms and their indicators can help managers become aware of their importance, and this will consequently help them improve their management. This could be an interesting starting point to value these <b>intangibles</b> in the balance sheet as well as to draw comparisons between family and non-family organisations. Originality/value – The framework provided by family firms sheds light on several <b>intangibles</b> specific to these firms – precisely for their condition as “family” firms.

The results show a significant decrease in the relevance of the traditional accounting information, based on earning per share, in the firm's evaluation. However, the <b>intangibles</b> enhance the value of firms enjoying high growth rates. Finally, the results confirm the importance of information pertaining to earning per share and <b>intangibles</b> to the investors' decisions. accounting information relevance; earning per share; intangibles; firm evaluation; fair value; accounting evaluation; Paris stock exchange; France; investor decision making. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} {{in this paper}} is whether the inclusion of <b>intangibles</b> is meaningful in a credit decision context. To examine this issue we conducted an experiment with forty loan officers. The loan officers were presented with a situation {{of a company that}} required a credit of 5 million Swedish kronor. Half of the loan officers were given a traditional annual statement in which <b>intangibles</b> were treated as costs while the other half received a balance sheet in which brand, R&D and education were capitalized. The loan officers were asked to give their opinion regarding the credit decision and the importance of extra information. They were also confronted with four short cases where extra information about the company appeared. Statistical analysis revealed that none of three hypotheses relating to the statement that ‘accounting for <b>intangibles</b> does not matter’ could be falsified. Still, the acquired qualitative data that emerged from the study makes it possible to suggest another finding. The study shows that accounting for <b>intangibles</b> is accepted if the accounts were seen as reliable. The conclusion is that if it is possible to create reliable data about <b>intangibles,</b> accounting for <b>intangibles</b> is meaningful for credit decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{decline in}} the {{usefulness}} of financial reports and the invisibility of <b>intangibles</b> information in those reports {{has resulted in a}} growing effort to expand disclosure by way of voluntary reporting to reduce the information asymmetry problem. Prior studies on <b>intangibles</b> disclosure have successfully created awareness about the importance of <b>intangibles.</b> However, the literature argues that clear results on the determinants of differential disclosure are still scarce and that prior research does not offer a strong theoretical basis to interpret the motives for disclosure. A direct comparison of disclosure behaviour between firms with and without a capital-raising motive provided by this study should provide an understanding of how these firms signal their <b>intangibles</b> information. Focusing on the top 200 Australian firms (based on market capitalisation) in 2006 - 2008, this study aims to determine whether financing decisions provide a strong incentive for firms to signal a greater variety of <b>intangibles</b> information, a higher level of disclosure and more intense information to the capital market. Content analysis of annual reports and prospectuses is carried out to determine the variety, and extent of <b>intangibles</b> disclosure. Incorporating a range of impression management tools in signalling information, this study also explores the concept of intensity of disclosure, which reflects the strength of messages presented based on their type, nature and also their presentation emphasis. The findings, which support signalling theory, provide evidence that capital-raiser firms disclose a greater variety of voluntary <b>intangibles</b> information with a higher level of disclosure in their annual reports immediately prior to capital-raising activity. Further, capital-raisers provide more intense and powerful signals compared to their non-capital-raiser counterparts. In addition to annual reports, these firms also utilise prospectuses to signal <b>intangibles</b> information during capital-raising activity. However, the variety, extent and intensity of disclosure in prospectuses are significantly lower compared to disclosure in annual reports. The overall findings suggest that in order to compensate for the inadequacy of financial reports, capitalraiser firms strive to make <b>intangibles</b> information visible in both annual reports and prospectuses by not only making narrative disclosures but also by emphasising <b>intangibles</b> using pictures and presentation emphasis by way of repetition. This is consistent with the motivation to provide <b>intangibles</b> information that investors will not only recognise but that they will also retain and recall when making investment decisions...|$|R
