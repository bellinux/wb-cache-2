5|$|Beneath the ealdormen, reeves—royal {{officials}} who were noble local landowners—were <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> town or royal estate. The authority {{of church and}} state was not separated in early medieval societies, and the lay officials worked closely with their diocesan bishop and local abbots, who also attended the king's royal councils.|$|E

After his clearance came through, he worked in the AFSWP's Operations Division, writing and reviewing war plans.|$|E

5|$|The Scilly Isles were {{supporters}} of Charles I {{during the civil}} war, and after a short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. Tresco formed a base for Royalists privateers and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining a foothold they could then use against England. In 1651 Parliament sent Sir Robert Blake <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> naval task force to retake the islands.|$|E

5|$|Bakshi {{recognized}} Kricfalusi's talent, {{and wanted}} to put him <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> project that would showcase the young animator's skills. Bakshi and Kricfalusi co-wrote the screenplay Bobby's Girl as a take on the teen films of the era. Jeff Sagansky, president of production at TriStar Pictures, put up $150,000 to develop the project, prompting Bakshi {{to move back to}} Los Angeles. When Sagansky left TriStar, Bakshi was forced to pitch the film again, but the studio's new executives did not understand its appeal and cut off financing. Bakshi and Zingarelli began to develop a feature about Hollywood's Golden Age, and Bakshi Productions crewmembers worked on proposed cartoons influenced by pulp fiction. Bobby's Girl was reworked as a potential prime time series called Suzy's in Love, but attracted no serious interest.|$|E

5|$|By March, however, Brooks' {{unit had}} grown to 110 men and he was {{promoted}} to Second Lieutenant and put <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> band of 40 soldiers, including Duncan. His guerrilla activities expanded to include larger raids, reprisal attacks, and the assassination of more important members of the Nazi regime. He would later earn the Polish Cross of Valor for helping lead over 100 of his men out of a German encirclement to safety without a single casualty.

5|$|During 1166, Neville was {{in charge}} of Staffordshire for the general eyre {{undertaken}} in that year, and also tried the pleas of the forest for Devonshire and Worcestershire, and perhaps elsewhere. The abbot of Battle Abbey in 1167 sent a monk to plead with Waleran of Meulan to intervene and stop Neville's exactions on the abbot's manors. After the Revolt of 1173–74, Neville was <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forest eyre held from 1176 to 1178 which resulted in fines totaling 12,000 pounds from breaches of the forest law during the revolt. It appears that the king intended this eyre to be a punishment, and used the forest law because it was solely dependent on the king's will rather than being based in customary law.|$|E

Horrocks, <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> draft of replacements, joined the 1st Battalion, Middlesex {{as part of the}} British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the BEF's retreat following its baptism of fire at the Battle of Mons.

5|$|In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave {{for a tour}} of France; Rochemont's {{mental health}} had been deteriorating and {{he was no longer}} able to carry out his {{teaching}} duties. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. Although no longer <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often had one or two pupils living with them, who had been recommended by personal friends.|$|E

5|$|In late 1989, Federal Airports Corporation Inspector A. Rohead was put <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bicentennial {{project to}} rename streets in Melbourne Airport to honour the {{original}} inhabitants, European pioneers and aviation history. Information {{on the first}} two categories was provided by Ian Hunter, Wurundjeri researcher, and Ray Gibb, local historian. The project was completed but was shelved, with the only suggested name, Gowrie Park Drive, being allocated, named after the farm {{at the heart of the}} airport. During the 1920s, the farm had been used as a landing site for aircraft, which were parked at night during World War II in case Essendon Aerodrome was bombed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Zvi Aharoni, {{one of the}} Mossad {{agents who}} had been {{involved}} in the Eichmann capture, was placed <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> team of agents tasked with locating Mengele and bringing him to trial in Israel. Inquiries in Paraguay gave no clues as to his whereabouts, and they were unable to intercept any correspondence between Mengele and his wife Martha, then living in Italy. Agents following Rudel's movements did not produce any leads. Aharoni and his team followed Gerhard to a rural area near São Paulo, where they located a European man believed to be Mengele. Aharoni reported his findings to Harel, but the logistics of staging a capture, budgetary constraints, and the need to focus on the nation's deteriorating relationship with Egypt led the Mossad chief to call a halt to the operation in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Myers made {{passenger}} balloons for the St. Louis Fair in 1904. He was {{the superintendent}} of the Aeronautic Concourse of the St. Louis World's Fair. He {{was one of the}} managers <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> purse of $200,000 prize money for various balloon tournaments and races. He pointed out that building airships was very expensive and took knowledge of advanced balloon techniques that basically nobody in America had. Myers used as an example, to win the $20,000 prize of the Aero Club the French balloonist Alberto Santos-Dumont spent more than that amount in six airships he entered into the tournament to win. Myers himself had an over abundance of ideas for balloons, but was short on cash to make many of them a reality even though he had the necessary balloon knowledge. The newspapers printed that Myers was making a balloon capable of holding 75,000 to 100,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.|$|E
