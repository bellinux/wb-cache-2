5000|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>Spade</b> is the codename {{given to}} Israel's latest {{attempt to use}} {{technology}} {{in an effort to}} prevent offensive tunnels being built from Gaza into Israel. It is reported to be based in part on the Iron Dome project. The primary developer of the project is Elbit Systems, with Rafael, developers of Iron Dome also involved in the project.|$|E
50|$|The Kuman {{people of}} this region were horticulturists who used basic tools such as the digging stick, wooden hoe, and wooden spade in their daily lives. Eventually they started to use more {{sophisticated}} tools such as <b>iron</b> <b>spades</b> and pick-axes.|$|R
50|$|In burial 4, nine <b>iron</b> <b>spades</b> and {{a variety}} of other {{artefacts}} such as a wooden axe haft, eight coins, three pottery vessels, a wooden disc, three wooden containers and axehead. A bronze bowl was also found next to the skull.|$|R
50|$|Burial 3 {{included}} three small ring-footed pottery vessels inside the coffin. Three more such vessels were placed outside the coffin {{in front of}} the position of the head. The head of the deceased was placed on a group of socketed <b>iron</b> <b>spades,</b> which were almost identical to those found in Yingshanling. There were more such spades lying beside the left elbow for a total of nine such objects inside the coffin. A socketed bronze spearhead and another arrowhead were found next to the left hand and a wooden disk was placed between the kneecaps of the dead. A circular lacquered box was placed next to the right ankle.|$|R
60|$|So Foy and Martin {{went down}} while Martha, {{hanging over the}} hatchway, held the lighted lamp above them, since they dared not take it near the powder. Moving the bags of salt, soon {{they came to the}} five barrels of {{treasure}} marked B, and, strong though they were, it was no easy task for the pair of them by the help of a pulley to sling them over the ship's side into the boat. At last it was done, and the place of the barrels having been filled with salt bags, they took two <b>iron</b> <b>spades</b> which were provided for such a task as this, and started, Martha steering as before. For an hour or more they rowed in and out among endless islands, at the dim shores of which Martha stared as they passed, till at length she motioned to them to ship their oars, and they touched ground.|$|R
25|$|Peat {{is still}} cut as a fuel {{in many areas}} of Lewis. Peat is usually cut in late spring with a tool called a tairsgeir (that is, a peat <b>iron,</b> peat <b>spade,</b> peat knife or tosg; {{sometimes}} toirsgian) which has a long wooden handle with an angled blade on one end. The peat bank is first cleared of heather turfs. The peat, now exposed, is cut using the tairsgeir and the peats thrown out on the bank to dry. A good peat cutter can cut 1000 peats in a day.|$|R
5000|$|Charles H. [...] "Chuck" [...] Carpenter (March 11, 1898 - June 22, 1960) was an American {{football}} player. He played {{college football}} for the Wisconsin Badgers football {{team of the}} University of Wisconsin-Madison, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American at the center position in 1919. [...] While attending Wisconsin, Carpenter was {{also a member of}} Alpha Delta Phi, <b>Iron</b> Cross, White <b>Spades,</b> Skull and Crescent, Star and Arrow, and Student Council of Defense, captain of the 1919 football team, and president of the Athletic Board.|$|R
5000|$|... "Destiny" [...] is a {{prime example}} of the {{importance}} of the Lechwe Trust's work. With Henry Tayali's seminal painting [...] "Destiny" [...] (1975-1980), writ large is the struggle for identity in a time of progress. In the foreground a myriad of figures scramble and work, carrying <b>iron</b> girders, <b>spades,</b> while they are seemingly penned in by a huge, steam obscured modern city. The city itself is painted in muted greys, browns, mauves however the crowd is dressed in bright colours. According to the catalogue for the exhibition and an article by local magazine The Lowdown, this painting has had a long and well-travelled life. In 1966, the painting was sold to Tim Gibbs, son of then Southern Rhodesian governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs. In 1980, Tayali went to the now independent Zimbabwe to but his painting back. Unsurprisingly, he was turned down but was granted allowance to borrow the painting for exhibitions. [...] "Destiny" [...] did its rounds in London, Zambia and Paris before returning to the Gibbs. By 1989 Henry Tayali had died and [...] "Destiny" [...] was exhibited again in Londonâ€”enter the Lechwe Trust. It took two years but the trust now owns the painting, a linchpin of their impressive collection.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast {{we took a}} {{walk and}} {{inspected}} the Amahagger herds, and also their cultivated lands. They have two breeds of cattle, one large and angular, with no horns, but yielding beautiful milk; and the other, a red breed, very small and fat, excellent for meat, but of no value for milking purposes. This last breed closely resembles the Norfolk red-pole strain, only it has horns which generally curve forward over the head, sometimes {{to such an extent}} that they have to be cut to prevent them from growing into the bones of the skull. The goats are long-haired, and are used for eating only, at least I never saw them milked. As for the Amahagger cultivation, it is primitive in the extreme, being all done by means of a <b>spade</b> made of <b>iron,</b> for these people smelt and work <b>iron.</b> This <b>spade</b> is shaped more like a big spear-head than anything else, and has no shoulder to it on which the foot can be set. As a consequence, the labour of digging is very great. It is, however, all done by the men, the women, contrary to the habits of most savage races, being entirely exempt from manual toil. But then, as I think I have said elsewhere, among the Amahagger the weaker sex has established its rights.|$|R
