40|$|Just {{seven years}} {{after the start of}} what turned into the most {{sustained}} economic downturn in living memory, the UK’s headline employment rate stands at an historic high. So remarkable has been the resilience of the labour market during this downturn and the pace of the subsequent jobs recovery that ‘full employment’ has returned {{to the top of the}} political agenda. Impressive though the <b>headline</b> <b>data</b> is, critics argue that much of the surge in employment has been at the cost of job quality. In part this argument reflects the extremely poor performance of pay and productivity since the crisis, but it also relates to a sense that job insecurity is rising for many workers. Understanding the extent to which this criticism is fair – have we sacrificed quality for quantity? – is likely to be central to the renewed focus on full employment. That’s because, with labour market slack diminishing as the economy strengthens, pushing employment higher still is likely to require not just creating opportunities for the unemployed to move into work but also bringing significant numbers of economically inactive adults into the workforce. Achieving this will in no small part depend on whether the available jobs are of sufficient quality to prove attractive to those who are further away from work. The story on pay is well-established but other aspects of job quality are less routinely measured. Therefore, in this note we return to some commonlyused broad measures of job security and stability, in particular to understand developments over the past two decades and how experiences have differed across genders and the generations...|$|E
40|$|Delving {{deeper into}} key topics, {{such as the}} use of credit and the {{experiences}} of Indigenous consumers, this report updates the CSI 2 ̆ 7 s 2011 report on the lack access to appropriate and affordable financial services and products. In May 2011 the Centre for Social Impact (CSI) published the country’s first measurement of financial exclusion. The report provided detailed data on the extent of the issue and spotlighted the causes and impact of financial exclusion on millions of Australians. We use the following definition of financial exclusion:Financial exclusion exists where individuals lack access to appropriate and affordable financial services and products – the key services and products are a transaction account, general insurance and a moderate amount of credit. This year we return to the same topic, updating the <b>headline</b> <b>data</b> that measures the level of financial exclusion, and delving deeper into key topics, {{such as the use}} of credit and the experiences of Indigenous consumers. We also provide a geographic analysis of financial exclusion data, showing wide differences in the level of financial exclusion across the 58 regions included in the study. This research has been commissioned by National Australia Bank (NAB), with the objective of improving our understanding of financial exclusion and its interaction with social and economic disadvantage in Australia. NAB has also provided access to its internal data on the use of financial services, and we have partnered with Roy Morgan Research to gain access to over 50, 000 face to face interviews with Australian consumers each year.

There were 90 803 patients in the registry, of whom 39 597 died during the study period. Only 8539 (21 %) of these were prescribed opioids {{at the time of}} their death.

The reasons for this acceptance of transdermal fentanyl and reluctance to use oral morphine are unclear, but it seems that more effort in educating healthcare professionals and patients about the use of morphine would be useful.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} we face as policymakers is the availability of data to assess {{the state of the}} economy in real time. Many economic data series [...] . are subject to subsequent revisions that can be quite sizable and can alter our perceptions of the economic situation. ” —James Bullard, President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2011 President Harry Truman’s victory in the 1948 election was first announced by the Chicago Tribune as a loss to New York Governor Thomas Dewey. When even a simple counting of votes can produce such a large error, imagine the tremendous challenges and pressure for timeliness and accuracy facing government and private agencies in computing economic indicators for a $ 14 trillion economy. 1 Collecting the necessary economic information and processing it requires time and patience. Many people, including investors and policymakers, want information about current economic conditions as soon as possible so they can make decisions. However, there is often a trade-off between the timeliness and the accuracy of economic data. 2 For this reason, many data agencies report an initial release based on the available data and staff estimates for the information that is unavailable. The media frequently use the initial <b>data</b> releases for <b>headline</b> news. <b>Data</b> revision is somewhat like revising a college writing assignment. Students usually tur...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{identify}} a typology of heavier drinking styles in Great Britain {{and to identify}} socio-demographic trends in the typology over the period 1978 - 2010. Methods: We applied multiple correspondence analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to beverage-specific quantity-frequency measures of alcohol consumption in the repeated cross-sectional General Lifestyle Survey of Great Britain, 1978 - 2010. The cluster analysis focuses on the 60, 043 adult respondents over this period reporting average drinking levels above the UK Government guidelines. We projected sex, age, income, education, socio-economic status and tobacco consumption variables onto the clusters to inspect socio-demographic trends in heavier drinking. Results: We identified four stable clusters of heavier drinking: (a) high volume beer; (b) beer and spirit combination; (c) all beverage and (d) wine and spirit only. The socio-demographic characteristics of the clusters were distinct from both {{each other and the}} general population. However, all clusters had higher median incomes and higher smoking rates than the population. Increases in the prevalence of heavier drinking were driven by a 5 -fold increase in the contribution of the female-dominated, wine and spirit only cluster. Conclusions: Recent changes in per capita alcohol consumption in Great Britain occurred {{within the context of a}} stable typology of heavier drinking styles and shifting socio-demographics. Identifying these trends is essential to better understand how drinking cultures develop over time and where potentially problematic drinking styles may emerge. Our findings suggest that careful attention to patterns and cultures of consumption is more important than relying on <b>headline</b> consumption <b>data,</b> for both understanding drinking behaviours and targeting interventions. Short Summary: This analysis of alcohol consumption survey data identifies four styles of heavier drinking in Great Britain, which remain unchanged over the period 1978 - 2010. The socio-demographic characteristics of the drinking styles are distinct from both each other and the general population, with increased participation of female and older drinkers over time...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of realizations of euphemization in political discourse. Its focus is on news article <b>headlines.</b> The language <b>data</b> under study have been collected from the Internet news websites published in 2013 – 2014. The aim of the paper is twofold: to give an overview of recent cases of euphemization in news headlines, and to define functions, purpose and means of euphemization. The most frequently euphemized topics this year {{have been found to be}} war, military actions in different countries, politics and economics. The analysis of the news article headlines has showed that one of the main purposes of euphemization of social problems and political issues is to veil and cover up the real names of such phenomena as military actions, massacre, preparation for war, rising prices, unsuitable behavior of various officials, conflicts between leading politicians, bad economic conditions. The sub-topics of euphemization are concerned with the criticism of the behaviour of government leaders, leading politicians who are claimed to have violated ethics, who are arrogant, corrupt and dishonest. The semantics of euphemisms is best reflected describing them according to the means of euphemization, which are generalization, conceptual metaphorization, choice of international terms, periphrasis, pronominalization and litotes. Political euphemisms are part and parcel of the world of diplomacy, international and internal policy; politically correct language is crucial in today’s mass media communication. It seeks to avoid conflict and antagonism, reduce panic and anxiety, and to disguise unpleasant news...|$|R

This study examines the statistical properties of dynamic behaviour of food inflation, non-food inflation and <b>headline</b> inflation. The <b>data</b> {{used in this}} study consist, monthly price indices for all variables from 2003 to 2010. They were collected from Central Bank, Sri Lanka. The empirical analyses are done using descriptive statistics, Confidence ellipse, autocorrelation function, Kernel density function, Box-plot, GARCH model, Granger causality test, co-integration test. The empirical results showed that food, nonfood, overall CPI price series in Sri Lankan are nonlinear, non-stationary series with stochastic trend, 1 (1). Standard deviation of each inflation rate distribution dominates the mean value. Nonfood inflation has fatter tails, has very high kurtosis (k=l 1. 44). Food prices are relatively persistent than non food prices. Food price inflation is not only more volatile (SD= 1. 63 > 0. 81) but also on average higher (0. 99 > 0. 66) than non-food inflation. The overall shape of the confidence ellipse indicates they are highly and positively correlated. The co-integration analysis shows that food and nonfood inflation series have long run relationship (co-integrated -EG test). Granger causality test shows that food inflation granger cause non-food inflation (P= 0. 0031). In Sri Lanka, food inflation runs higher than nonfood inflation. The difference between food and nonfood inflation is statistically significant (P= 0. 04). The empirical results of this study have important implications for policy makers. A policy focus on measures of core Inflation that exclude food prices can mispecify inflation, leading to higher inflationary expectations, downward bias to forecasts of future inflation and lags in policy response...|$|R

40|$|Description of data used: Data {{supplied}} by SIRCA ([URL] The data {{consisted of a}} Reuters Information Code (RIC) that identifies the companies in the data, which make up the Dow 30 of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The DJIA is also provided in the dataset. For each of these companies, information is recorded on Quotes, Trades and News events. These are recorded by a date and time. For the Quotes, a Bid and Ask price is provided. For the Trades, a Price is provided (a trade occurs where the Bid and Ask price match). For the News events, a <b>Headline</b> is provided. <b>Data</b> Analysis: For our submission we chose to analyze {{the ways in which}} the price and volume of trades are affected by the quantity and type of news events that occurred during the given time period. Visualization Technique Applied: We chose to visualize this data by creating a dashboard in Excel. Each of the components are dynamically updated from a external database, so we can see the activity occurring over the entire time period in the given dataset, in just a few minutes. Our first component is an interactive bubble chart that we use to illustrate the influence of news events on stock trades (change in stock price and volume). An analyst can select one or more companies and compare their behavior. A radar chart is used to indicate the frequency particular words appear in news headlines that occur during the given time period. The radar chart provides summary of the type of news that is occurring by distinguishing between positive, negative and neutral words. Finally a column graph shows the number of news events that have occurred for each company prior to the current date and the total so far for the current date and time. This illustrates what news events are occurring and to which companies. An analyst might use this to select companies to show in the interactive bubble chart. Main Insights Gained: Through our visualization it is clear that following October 1 st, 2008, many components of the Dow 30 headed into a steady decline in price. Increases in news events in particular lead to an increase in trade volume. It also appears that following the initial decline in prices, the decline continued and appeared to be fueled by continual media coverage of the negative news relating to the financial crisis. We also noticed through our visualization that an increase in news events often leads to an increase in the volume of trades. This occurs regardless of the type of words used in the news event. From the bar chart we can see that there is also a particular news focus on large banks such as Citibank and the Bank of America and the investment bank JP Morgan prior to and on October 1 st. It is difficult to tell from the limited data if this is a usual occurrence or an indication of events that were to follow. However, we notice that as the crisis sets in on October 2 nd, the high number of news events extends beyond banks to also include automotive manufacturer General Motors. This is perhaps an indication of one company that proved to be quite vulnerable to changes in the financial markets...|$|R
