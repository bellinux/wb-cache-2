In this study, we found that subcutaneously transplanted human BMMSCs are capable of organizing hematopoietic progenitors of recipient origin. These hematopoietic cells expressed multiple lineages of hematopoietic cell associated markers and were able to rescue lethally irradiated mice, with successful engraftment in the recipient, suggesting a potential bone marrow (BM) resource for stem cell therapies. Furthermore, we found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) promotes the formation of BMMSC-generated BM niches through upregulation of β-catenin, implying that the PDGF pathway contributes to the formation of ectopic BM. These results indicate that the BMMSC-organized BM niche system represents a unique hematopoietic progenitor resource possessing potential clinical value.

40|$|Acute <b>graft-versus-host</b> <b>diseases</b> (GVHD) is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortal-ity in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). T helper 1 (Th 1) -type cytokines such as interferon-g or tumor necrosis factor-a have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD. TAK- 603 is a new quinoline deriva-tive, which is now in clinical trials for use as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. In preclinical studies, it inhibited delayed-type hypersensitivity, but not Arthus-type reaction, in mice, and selec-tively suppressed Th 1 cytokine produc-tion. Thus, the present study was de-signed to investigate whether the Th 1 inhibitor (TAK- 603) ameliorates lethal acute GVHD in a mouse model. Adminis-tration of TAK- 603 into BALB/c mice given 10 Gy total body irradiation followed by transplantation of bone marrow and spleen cells from C 57 BL/ 6 mice markedly reduced the mortality in association with minimal signs of GVHD pathology in the liver, intestine, and skin. TAK- 603 re-duced not only the production of Th 1 -type cytokines, but also the proportion of Th 1 cells in CD 41 helper T cells in this GVHD mouse model. These results suggest that TAK- 603 could be a potent therapeutic agent for acute lethal GVHD. (Blood. 2001...|$|R
40|$|Stem cell-derived {{tissues and}} organs have the {{potential}} to change modern clinical science. However, rejection of allogeneic grafts by the host’ s immune system is an issue which needs to be addressed before embryonic stem cell-derived cells or tissues can be used as medicines. Mismatches in human leukocyte class I antigens and minor histocompatibility antigens are the central factors that are responsible for various <b>graft-versus-host</b> <b>diseases.</b> Traditional strategies usually involve suppressing the whole immune systems with drugs. There are many side effects associated with these methods. Here, we discuss an emerging strategy for manipulating the central immune tolerance by naturally “ introducing” donor antigens to a host so a recipient can acquire tolerance specifically to the donor cells or tissues. This strategy has two distinct stages. The first stage restores the thymic function of adult patients with sex steroid inhibitory drugs (LHRH-A), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), interleukin 7 (IL- 7) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT 3). The second stage introduces hematopoietic stem cells and their downstream progenitors to the restored thymus by direct injection. Hematopoietic stem cells are used to introduce donor antigens because they have priority access to the thymus. We also review several clinical cases to explain this new strategy...|$|R

25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation). Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment) patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of white blood cells to help fight infection. This puts a patient {{at high risk of}} infections, sepsis and septic shock, despite prophylactic antibiotics. However, antiviral medications, such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of herpetic infection in seropositive patients. The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of <b>graft-versus-host</b> <b>disease</b> further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of <b>graft-versus-host</b> <b>disease.</b> Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E
40|$|Paneth {{cells are}} {{important}} {{contributors to the}} intestinal antimicrobial barrier through synthesis and release of antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Animal studies indicate that Paneth cell numbers, location and granule morphology are altered by infection and zinc status. We examined human tissue to determine whether Paneth cell numbers, distribution or granule morphology are altered in infective, inflammatory and nutritional disorders. Archival sections from infective disorders (giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, HIV, helminth infection) were compared with active inflammatory conditions (coeliac, Crohn's and <b>graft-versus-host</b> <b>diseases)</b> and histologically normal tissues. A subset of tissues was studied by electron microscopy and TUNEL staining for apoptosis. Human defensin- 5 (HD 5) peptide and mRNA was analysed by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sections from a tropical population cohort study were then analysed to determine the relationship of granule depletion to infection, nutritional status and plasma zinc concentration. In HIV-related cryptosporidiosis, but not other disorders, Paneth cells were reduced in number and markedly depleted of granules. Paneth cell granule depletion was associated with reduced HD 5 immunoreactivity, {{but this was not}} due to apoptosis and there was no reduction in mRNA transcripts. In the tropical population studied, depletion of granules was associated with reduced body mass index, reduced plasma zinc levels and HIV infection. Paneth cell granules in human small intestine may be depleted in response to infective and nutritional stress.

40|$|Proportional {{changes of}} {{lymphocyte}} subsets in the peripheral blood were monitored by two-color flow-cytometry in seven leukemia {{patients who had}} received allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Lymphocyte counts, and proportions of T and B-cells returned to normal ranges between the 2 nd and 12 th months after BMT. Activated T-cells prominently increased after BMT, and the values gradually returned toward normal. As to lymphocyte subsets, the proportions of CD 4 + cells had remained low, while those of CD 8 + cells high for a whole observation period after BMT. The changes of CD 4 + cells were caused by the decrease of suppressor-inducer T-cells (CD 4 + Leu 8 +). High proportion of CD 8 + cells was mainly associated with increased suppressor T-cells (CD 8 + CD 11 +). Among natural killer (NK) cells, highly active NK cells (CD 16 + CD 57 -) markedly increased shortly after BMT, and gradually returned to normal. CD 16 -CD 57 + NK cells increased beyond normal ranges after the 2 nd month. The incidence or degree of acute and chronic <b>graft-versus-host</b> <b>diseases</b> (GVHD) did not correlate with the changes of any lymphocyte subsets. The present {{results suggest that the}} increase of activated T-cells shortly after BMT reflects lymphocyte reconstitution. The prolonged immune deficiency after BMT might be related to either deficient expression of homing receptor (Leu 8 antigen) on CD 4 + cells or increased suppressor T-cells (CD 8 + CD 11 +). In addition, the early increase of NK cells after BMT may compensate for the immune deficiency in BMT patients. </p...|$|R

The recipients of the 2 groups were matched for hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology, sex, age, underlying hematological diseases, conditioning regimen, and prophylaxis against <b>graft-versus-host</b> <b>diseases.</b> Eight (44. 4 %) recipients in group 1 and 2 (11. 1 %) in group 2 suffered from HBV- related hepatitis posttransplant (P =. 03). Furthermore, HBV-related hepatic failure was seen in 6 group 1 patients, but in none of the group 2 patients (P =. 007). Five of the 9 (55. 5 %) HBsAg-negative recipients in group 1 became positive after receiving HBsAg-positive marrow. Serum HBV DNA was positive in all 5 donors of these patients, but in none of the donors of recipients who remained HBsAg negative (P =. 008).

40|$|The deoxyspergualin {{derivative}} LF 15 - 0195 {{has demonstrated}} some efficacy in animal models of autoimmune and <b>graft-versus-host</b> <b>diseases</b> {{and is currently}} tested in clinics. The molecular mecha-nisms of LF 15 - 0195 immunosuppressive activity remained unknown. We show that exposure to LF 15 - 0195 sensitizes Jurkat T cells to apoptosis induced by an agonis-tic anti-CD 95 antibody (CH 11 clone) and by the cytokine TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. LF 15 - 0195 does not dem-onstrate any {{significant effect on the}} post-mitochondrial activation of caspases, nor does it modify overall expression of CD 95, Fas-associated death domain, and pro-caspase- 8. The compound facilitates the recruitment of these molecules to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and enhances caspase- 8 and- 10 activa-tion, thus increasing cytochrome c and direct IAP binding with low pI (DIABLO) / Smac mitochondrial release. LF 15 - 0195 also sensitizes Jurkat T cells to CD 3 -mediated apoptosis, an in vitro model for activation-induced T-cell death (AICD). LF 15 - 0195 –mediated sensitization to AICD was further confirmed in human periph-eral T cells exposed to anti-CD 3 antibod-ies, then cultured in the presence of inter-leukin- 2. In these cells, LF 15 - 0195 increased apoptosis triggered by either anti-CD 95 antibodies or CD 3 restimula-tion, whereas no effect was observed on “passive apoptosis. ” Finally, in bone mar-row recipient mice, LF 15 - 0195 enhanced allogeneic donor T-cell death, which re-quired a functional CD 95 pathway. These results suggest that LF 15 - 0195 sensi-tizes T cells to AICD by increasing caspase activation at the DISC level in response to CD 95 engagement. This origi-nal mechanism, together with LF 15 - 0195 efficacy in various disease models, makes this compound a promising immunosup-pressive drug.
