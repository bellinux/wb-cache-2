25|$|The port prospered {{with trade}} from {{immediately}} after its opening. The initial trade consisted of exports supplied by Japanese merchants to foreign ones, and imports sold from foreign merchants to Japanese ones. This was because foreigners {{were not allowed}} to buy export goods or sell their own imports outside the settlement, while Japanese merchants lacked the <b>know-how</b> <b>to</b> conduct business directly with businessmen overseas. Japanese merchants trying to sell goods to foreigners or buy goods from them carried out their negotiations through intermediaries, either Japanese clerks or Chinese baiben. As many of the foreign merchants were high-handed and forceful in their negotiations, and the Japanese were unaccustomed to trading with foreign countries and unfamiliar with the state of the world outside Japan, Japanese merchants were frequently manipulated into buying and selling goods at disadvantageous prices.|$|E

25|$|Sorensen {{was one of}} the {{consultants}} who brought American <b>know-how</b> <b>to</b> the USSR during this era, before the Cold War made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the contribution that American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. Anti-communism had always enjoyed widespread popularity in America, and anti-capitalism in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies or ideas might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen.|$|E
25|$|The design {{came from}} Pininfarina. The design team at Pininfarina {{consisted}} of Ian Cameron, Guido Campoli, Diego Ottina and Emanuele Nicosia. With little surprise, they {{were led by}} design chief Leonardo Fioravanti, the designer of many contemporary Ferraris. The design was originated by Nicosia, but the guidance of Fioravanti was equally important. Being a trained aerodynamist, Fioravanti applied his <b>know-how</b> <b>to</b> set the aerodynamics layout of the car. This meant the large side intakes were not only a statement of style but actually functional – they drew clean air to cool the side radiators and then went upward and left the car through the ventilation holes located at the engine lid and the tail. As a result, the Testarossa did not need a rear spoiler like Lamborghini's Countach yet produced zero lift at its rear axle. The aerodynamic drag coefficient of 0.36 was also significantly better than the Lamborghini's 0.42.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of {{political}} abuse {{can be achieved}} through the reformation of institutions associated with the government. Training and monitoring the security forces (e.g. army or police) help to make them an unbiased protector of the people rather than a weapon of suppression for the ruling government. Hopefully this training can bring trust by the people for the security establishment. UN forces can also run and monitor elections {{in order to ensure}} a fair process. In other cases, the UN may provide a neutral interim government to administer the country during a transitional period wherein the associated government institutions are being retrained, reformed or better developed. Lastly, military groups such as armed rebels can be encouraged to put down their weapons and transformed into political organisations using appropriate non-violent means to mete out their grievances and compete in the election cycle. This is especially important as many of these groups serve as the chief opposition to a given government, but lack the means or <b>know-how</b> <b>to</b> operate effectively as political organisations.|$|E

2500|$|For most of {{its history}} in the modern era, the Israeli wine {{industry}} was based predominantly on the production of Kosher wines which were exported worldwide to Jewish communities. The quality of these wines were varied, with many being produced from high-yielding vineyards that valued quantity over quality. Many of these wines were also somewhat sweet. In the late 1960s, Carmel Winery was the first Israeli winery to make a dry table wine. It {{was not until the}} 1980s that the industry at large saw a revival in quality winemaking, when an influx of winemaking talent from Australia, California and France brought modern technology and technical <b>know-how</b> <b>to</b> the growing Israeli wine industry.

2500|$|As {{early as}} the 14th century, Basque whalemen may have made [...] "seasonal trips" [...] to {{southern}} Ireland and the English Channel – where they undoubtedly targeted right whales. These regions became particularly well-known {{to them by the}} 16th century. By {{the first decade of the}} 17th century, Basque whaling had reached Brazil, not on its own initiative, but on that of the colonial government. With imports of whale oil from the Basque region and Cape Verde not meeting the demands of the expanding colonial sugar industry, they saw a solution in the humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) that inhabited their coastal waters. Lacking the technical <b>know-how</b> <b>to</b> hunt them, they sought help abroad. In 1602, two Basque whalers accompanied Diogo Botelho, the newly appointed governor general of Brazil, to the colonial capital of Bahia de Todos os Santos. It was their crews that introduced commercial whaling to colonial Brazil. Each year for nearly a decade Basque ships made runs from Biscay to Brazil, where the oil they produced supplied sugar mills (engenhos) with a dependable source of fuel for nocturnal grinding, as well as oil for lubricating machinery and caulking boats and ships. This ended in 1610, when one of the Basque captains tried to smuggle Brazilwood out of the country. He was discovered and imprisoned – as were his men. The same year the crown declared whaling to be a royal monopoly.|$|E
