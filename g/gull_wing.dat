5|$|The He 111 was a {{twin-engine}} {{version of}} the Blitz, preserving the elliptical inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wing,</b> small rounded control surfaces and BMW engines, so that the new design was often called the Doppel-Blitz ("Double Lightning"). When the Dornier Do 17 displaced the He 70, Heinkel needed a twin-engine design to match its competitors. Heinkel spent 200,000 man hours designing the He 111. The fuselage length was extended to just over 17.4m/57ft (from 11.7m/38ft 4½in) and wingspan to 22.6m/74ft (from 14.6m/48ft).|$|E
5|$|The nine Fiat G.50bis fighters {{took off}} from Turin-Fiat Aviazione on 12 June 1942, but before {{crossing}} the border they were stopped by an order from Capo di Stato Maggiore Cavallero, that was afraid the ZNDH pilots could defect with the new Fiat aircraft. The G.50 aircraft {{had to wait until}} 25 June before being delivered to the 16th Squadron at Banja Luka, but during the course of 1942, five were transferred to the 1st Squadron stationed in Zagreb in order to strengthen the defence of the NDH capital. Their deployment between the two squadrons was aimed to further familiarise the ZNDH fighter pilots with more sophisticated aircraft. Until that time, the only fighters available in numbers were the seven ancient Avia BH-33E biplanes and four Ikarus IK-2 <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> fighters (for which there were very few spares), as well as 11 Rogožarski R-100 parasol wing fighter-trainers.|$|E
25|$|The Maeda 703 {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{indigenous}} Japanese gliders, a high performance single seat aircraft which first flew in 1940. Three were built, two with <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> wings; one of these set a national endurance record in 1941.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a version}} of Corvette coupe {{designed}} by Giorgetto and Fabrizio Giugiaro of Italdesign, commemorating 50 years of the Chevrolet Corvette. It included 6.0 litre V8 engine, door window half dome, <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> door hinged to the rear pillar.|$|E
25|$|The AT-21 {{proved to}} be {{unsuitable}} {{for use as a}} trainer due to vibration and oscillation tendencies as well as an inherent instability caused by the short distance between the rudders and the <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> resulting in unacceptable yaw even when slight rudder movements were made.|$|E
25|$|The wing had {{a span of}} , with a {{wing area}} of 279 sq ft (29.6 sq m). It was {{designed}} {{with a small amount}} of inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> bend; the inner sections had a 1° anhedral, while the outer sections, attached just outboard of the undercarriage legs, had a dihedral of 5½°. The airfoil was a NACA 22 wing section, with a thickness to chord ratio of 19.5% at the root tapering to 12% at the tip.|$|E
50|$|Second design had a {{vertical}} tail and <b>gull</b> <b>wings.</b> This was the single-seat, all weather, heavy fighter {{with the same}} intended engines as the P.1079A.|$|R
50|$|Two Proctors were {{modified}} with angular <b>gull</b> <b>wings</b> {{to resemble}} Junkers Ju 87 Stukas for the 1969 film Battle of Britain, and were dubbed Proctukas.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{most notable}} {{feature of the}} Stuka was its {{inverted}} <b>gull</b> <b>wings,</b> as shown in this photograph. Also visible are the two separate sliding [...] "hoods" [...] of the canopy.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was fitted with five gun turrets, and bomb bays {{that were in}} the engine nacelles. The <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> was of cantilever design, and featured clean aerodynamics with an unbraced twin tail. The PBM-1 was equipped with retractable wing landing floats that were hinged outboard, with single-strut supported floats that retracted inwards to rest beneath the wing, with the floats' keels just outboard of each of the engine nacelles. The PBM-3 had fixed floats, and the fuselage was three feet longer than that of the PBM-1.|$|E
25|$|Lippisch {{began the}} design of the Fafnir 2 in 1934. Apart from being a wood and fabric {{aircraft}} with a strongly tapered cantilever <b>gull</b> <b>wing,</b> it had little in common with the Fafnir of 1930, though lessons had been learned from that design. During 1934 the RRG was disbanded and its technical section, led by Lippisch, moved from the Wasserkuppe to Darmstadt to become the DFS, so the new glider was sometimes known as the DFS Fafnir 2. It was Lippisch's last conventional glider design.|$|E
25|$|To {{accommodate}} a folding wing the designers considered retracting the {{main landing gear}} rearward but, for the chord of wing that was chosen, {{it was difficult to}} make the landing gear struts long enough to provide ground clearance for the large propeller. Their solution was an inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wing,</b> which considerably shortened the required length of the main gear legs. The anhedral of the wing's center-section also permitted the wing and fuselage to meet at the optimum angle for minimizing drag, without using wing root fairings. The bent wing, however, was heavier and more difficult to construct, offsetting these benefits.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, three Proctors were remodelled with {{inverted}} <b>gull</b> <b>wings</b> {{and other}} cosmetic alterations to represent Junkers Ju 87s {{in the film}} Battle of Britain but, in the event, radio-controlled models were used instead.|$|R
50|$|The RRG Fafnir, {{named after}} the legendary dragon, was a single seat German high {{performance}} glider designed by Alexander Lippisch. It won the Rhön competition in 1931 and made several outstanding flights as well as setting a fashion for <b>gull</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} <b>gull</b> <b>wings</b> {{were constructed}} as a divided pair, with diagonal supplementary spars and plywood skinned leading edge D torsion box. The fuselage was constructed as a semi-monocoque shell, with integral fin carrying the rudder and all-flying tailplane. A pneumatically-sprung nose skid formed the undercarriage.|$|R
25|$|The Rhönbussard had its wing {{over the}} cockpit, {{limiting}} the pilot's view, {{but on the}} Rhönsperber it was lowered to mid fuselage. It is an entirely wood and fabric aircraft with a wing built around a single spar. Forward of the spar the wing is plywood covered around the leading edge, forming a torsion-resisting D-box. Aft of the spar, the covering is fabric. Each wing has two sections, a parallel-chord centre section and a double straight tapered outer panel, ending with semi-elliptical tips. The only dihedral, 5°, is on the centre section, forming the <b>gull</b> <b>wing.</b> Airbrakes are centrally placed on the upper centre section surface and fabric-covered ailerons fill the trailing edges of the outer panels.|$|E
25|$|Mitsubishi {{assigned}} {{the task of}} designing the new fighter to {{a team led by}} Jiro Horikoshi (original creator of the similar but unsuccessful Mitsubishi 1MF10, and later responsible for the famous A6M Zero). The resulting design, designated Ka-14 by Mitsubishi, was an all-metal low-wing fighter, with a thin elliptical inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> and a fixed undercarriage, which was chosen as the increase in performance (estimated as 10% in drag, but only a mere 3% increase in maximum speed) arising from use of a retractable undercarriage was not felt to justify the extra weight. The first prototype, powered by a 447kW (600hp) Nakajima Kotobuki 5 radial engine, flew on 4 February 1935. The aircraft far exceeded the requirements of the specification, with a maximum speed of 450km/h (279mph) being reached. The second prototype was fitted with a revised, ungulled wing, and after various changes to maximize maneuverability and reduce drag, was ordered into production as the A5M.|$|E
25|$|The 703 was a wood framed {{aircraft}} {{covered with}} a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its cantilever mid-mounted wing had a single spar and an associated D-box, skinned in plywood, formed the leading edge. The wing was fabric covered behind the spar. The leading edge was straight from root to tip, with slight sweep-back. From root out almost to half-span the wing tapered in plan only gently but further out, where the trailing edge was entirely formed by the aileron the wing tapered more strongly to a rounded tip. The NACA-derived airfoil provided a high maximum lift coefficient and small pitching moments and the wing had washout to avoid tip stall. There were Schempp-Hirth style airbrakes mounted on the rear of the spar in the central section, extending above and below the wing. On the first two 703s the central sections were set with strong (6.5°) dihedral and the outer section with none, forming a <b>gull</b> <b>wing.</b> The third 703 had the same wing but with constant dihedral from root to tip.|$|E
50|$|It {{was made}} out of wood and fabric with {{cantilevered}} <b>gull</b> <b>wings.</b> A B-version in 1938 had thinner wings with a modified section and the gulls kink in a different place. The undercarriage was non-retractable. It was the first glider built to carry water-ballast in a tank behind the pilot.|$|R
50|$|The Ba.201 was a single-engined {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction. It had inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wings,</b> with {{split flaps}} that doubled as dive-brakes and was {{fitted with a}} retractable tailwheel undercarriage. It had a long slim fuselage, with a low mounted tailplane. The cockpit was set as far forward as possible to give a good view for the pilot.|$|R
5000|$|The DFS Seeadler (Sea Eagle) was a German {{flying boat}} {{sailplane}} designed by Hans Jacobs of the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS). It was {{version of the}} 1935 DFS Rhönadler, with a new fuselage and strongly <b>gulled</b> <b>wings</b> to keep them clear from spray. [...] The aircraft was first flown {{in the summer of}} 1935, test piloted by Hanna Reitsch, and towed by a Dornier Do 12.|$|R
500|$|The new design, {{given the}} company {{designation}} B-48, was known unofficially by Blackburn as the [...] "Firecrest" [...] but was always {{known by its}} specification number by the Air Ministry and Navy. It was a low-winged, single-seat, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame. The cockpit of the Firecrest was moved forward and raised the pilot's position so that he now looked over the wing leading edge, and down the nose. The canopy was adapted from the Hawker Tempest fighter. In the rear fuselage was a single [...] fuel tank with two [...] fuel tanks in the centre wing section. The aircraft had a redesigned, thinner, inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> of laminar flow aerofoil section. The wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with just over 6.5 degrees of anhedral and outer panels with 9 degrees of dihedral. It could be hydraulically folded in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. Four Fowler flaps were fitted to give good low-speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces. In {{the course of the}} redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by 1,400lb (635kg) and even after the fuel capacity was increased by [...] the gross weight was still [...] less than that of the Firebrand.|$|E
2500|$|The ANF Les Mureaux 180 was a {{prototype}} French fighter aircraft of the 1930s. {{designed and built}} by Les Ateliers de Construction du Nord de la France et des Mureaux [...] It was a single-engined, two-seat, <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> monoplane, only one was built and the programme was abandoned as obsolete.|$|E
2500|$|The design {{features}} a cantilever mid-wing, two seats in side-by-side configuration, retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} made from titanium and a single [...] Rotax 912ULS four cylinder, liquid and air-cooled, four stroke engine in tractor configuration. Cockpit access is by two <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> doors hinged at the top. The aircraft was designed to meet aerobatic category requirements, including +9 and -4.5 g.|$|E
50|$|Chief Engineer Rex Beisel {{began in}} 1938 {{to develop the}} XF4U, {{recognized}} by its distinctive inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wings.</b> After its first flight in 1940, thousands of F4U Corsairs were produced for the Navy and Marines in World War II. By {{the end of its}} production in 1952, Vought, Goodyear, and Brewster had all produced the Corsair fighters. Vought was reestablished as a separate division in United Aircraft in 1942.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 September, Worcester's radar {{picked up}} an {{unidentified}} contact at 1331. The combat air patrol—four Vought F4U Corsairs from Valley Forge—soon reported the stranger as being a twin-engined bomber with a pointed nose, a single tailfin, and high inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wings.</b> It also bore red star markings. At 1345, the F4U's vectored to the [...] "bogey" [...] by Fletcher (DDE-445), unceremoniously splashed the stranger 49 miles away.|$|R
50|$|Most {{aircraft}} {{have been}} designed with planar wings with simple dihedral (or anhedral). Some older aircraft such as the Vought F4U Corsair and the Beriev Be-12 were designed with <b>gull</b> <b>wings</b> bent near the root. Modern polyhedral wing designs generally cant upwards near the wingtips (also known as tip dihedral), increasing dihedral effect without increasing the angle the wings meet at the root, which may be restricted to meet other design criteria.|$|R
2500|$|The elegant Do 26, {{sometimes}} referred to as the [...] "most beautiful flying-boat ever built", was of all-metal construction. The hull had a central keel and a defined step; the wings were of <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> configuration, the outer sections being equipped with fully retractable narrow stabilising wing-floats, instead of Dornier's famous [...] "water-wing" [...] sponsons extending from the lower hull for lateral stabilization.|$|E
2500|$|The ANT-44 was {{designed}} as a long-range maritime reconnaissance/bomber flying boat. Construction of the first two prototype began in 1934. [...] The initial design employed [...] an all-metal construction with a shoulder-mounted <b>gull</b> <b>wing.</b> The ANT-44 incorporated four 604kW (810hp) Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major 14Kdrs M-85 radial engines as well as underslung stabilizing floats. [...] After a month of factory trials, in December 1937 designers changed the Mistral Major radial engines for the higher rated and more powerful Tumansky M-87 627kW (840hp) engines. In 1938, they further modified the prototype to be amphibious, and the aircraft was refitted with updated 709kW (950hp) M-87A engines.|$|E
2500|$|The P.8 was {{loosely based}} on the P.1, {{retaining}} the slab-sided fuselage and strut braced <b>gull</b> <b>wing</b> characteristic of Pulawski's fighters throughout the 1930s. Despite official preference toward radial engines Pulawski won authority {{to develop a new}} fighter powered by V-12 engines up to [...] The two fighter designs which emerged were designated P.8 and P.9, re-using the designations of two seaplane designs that had been rejected by the Polish Navy. Two power-plants were fitted to the two prototypes; the P.8/I was fitted with a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Mc; the P.8/II was fitted with a [...] Lorraine 12Hfrs Pétrel Chasse.|$|E
5000|$|Development of the Ki-8, (a.k.a. Nakajima DF), {{began in}} 1933, {{based on an}} {{all-metal}} two-seat aircraft, featuring low inverted <b>gull</b> <b>wings,</b> with fixed and spatted landing gear, powered by a single [...] Nakajima Kotobuki Ha-1-3 radial engine. Proposed armament consisted of twin 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns firing from between the engine cylinders and a third 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine gun on a flexible mount {{on the back of}} the rear cockpit.|$|R
50|$|The Eliica weighs 2400 kg and seats {{the driver}} and three passengers. The body was tested in a wind tunnel. The front doors open forward and the rear doors open upward like <b>gull</b> <b>wings.</b> The car's {{platform}} contains 4 tracks of 80 batteries, which make up {{one third of the}} vehicle's cost. They currently require about 10 hours of recharging at 100 volts from empty to full charge, and can be easily charged off a residential power grid.|$|R
50|$|The Slingsby Petrel was a {{development}} of the German DFS Rhonadler designed by Hans Jacobs. It was a single-seat high-performance sailplane with a span of a little under 18 metres, built of wood {{with a mixture of}} plywood and fabric covering. It had high cantilever <b>gull</b> <b>wings,</b> though the inner section dihedral was modest. They carried straight taper to fine and rounded tips and ailerons that extended over more than half the span. There were neither flaps nor airbrakes.|$|R
