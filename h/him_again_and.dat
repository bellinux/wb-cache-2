Billy finds <b>him</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> takes him to Dr. Whitaker, who uses him to find a cure for the virus (he inherited his mother's ability to fight off the infection).

5|$|At night, Evelyn {{takes the}} Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally {{awakening}} Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows {{them with the}} help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only {{out of the public}} eye but in greater intensity). Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing <b>him</b> <b>again</b> <b>and,</b> as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 26 October 1978, {{about a week after}} the {{extermination}} threat, George Burkitt and his 20-year-old son Philip were working on Philip's Triumph Spitfire car in front of their house. At around 7pm, annoyed by the noise they were making, Williams shot them both with a 9mm, Smith & Wesson automatic pistol. George died where he fell and Philip, wounded, ran into the house. Williams followed him, shooting <b>him</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> killing him. He then shot and killed George's wife, Iris. The Burkitts' 17-year-old daughter was hit four times in the back and once in the thigh, but survived. Two other neighbours, a married couple who had witnessed the attack on the Burkitts, also survived being shot. The injured were treated at Birmingham General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Phil calls Sal, wanting Louise's (now {{played by}} Tilly Keeper) address, {{and when he}} goes to her house, Peggy is there, having {{returned}} a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to admit that he has cirrhosis of liver, but she refuses to see <b>him</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try and make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fall}} of Thessalonica {{appeared}} imminent, Pope Honorius excommunicated Theodore, ordered an embargo on horses, troops, and supplies from the Adriatic ports, and sent letters to Constantinople urging assistance to Demetrius. Demetrius himself went to Italy to seek aid, being received by the Pope in Rome in March 1222 and by Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) soon after. A crusade was proclaimed against Theodore, and troops began to gather in Italy. In the meantime, the Latin Empire, now under Robert of Courtenay (r. 1221–28), was once more embroiled in warfare with Nicaea as it supported Laskaris' brothers in their challenge against the new Nicaean emperor, John III Doukas Vatatzes (r. 1222–54). The first detachments of the assembling crusade, under Count Oberto II of Biandrate, arrived at Thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined the de facto regent, Guy Pallavicini. Theodore now hastened his move against Thessalonica. After preliminary operations in late 1222, in early 1223 he laid siege to the city. Honorius excommunicated <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> redoubled his effort to promote the crusade, which {{had come to a}} standstill in the meantime. At the Pope's urging, Venice and Emperor Frederick promised aid. Robert of Courtenay also pledged to assist, while Honorius called upon the Latin princes of southern Greece to join in the effort. The crusade finally assembled at Brindisi in March 1224. In his instructions to his legate, however, Honorius did not rule out the possibility of Theodore {{coming to terms with the}} Crusaders. True to his word, in April 1224 Robert of Courtenay sent an army to besiege Serres. During the siege, the Latin generals learned of the disastrous defeat of the main Latin army at the hands of John III Doukas Vatatzes at the Battle of Poimanenon. They lifted the siege and hastened back to Constantinople, only to be intercepted by Theodore's men; most of the Latin army were killed or taken prisoner.|$|E

Dia, {{stationed}} with the RUF garrison there, is confronted by Vandy, but having been brainwashed he refuses to acknowledge his father.
