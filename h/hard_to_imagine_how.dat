Eurogamer's Kristan Reed pointed out that, graphically, [...] "it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> Amusement Vision {{could have done a}} better job". Matt Casamassina of IGN praised the developers' work commenting they have [...] "done a fine job of taking Nintendo's dated franchise and updating it for the new generation" [...] and summed up the general opinion by stating that [...] "For some, GX will be the ultimate racer.

500|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{was given}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according}} to Metacritic. Several reviews praised {{the amount of}} value that Metroid Prime Hunters offered on the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. GameZone considered the game phenomenal, and believed that it used the DS to its maximum potential regarding graphical ability and innovation. The Toronto Sun remarked that the graphics were big enough selling points on their own for the game, and The Press called Metroid Prime Hunters the best-looking game for the Nintendo DS. The Australian agreed that the graphics are [...] "outstanding" [...] and push the Nintendo DS to its limits, and The Independent asserted that Metroid Prime Hunters was perhaps the best first-person shooter ever for a handheld console. GamePros review stated that [...] "it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> Nintendo squeezed Hunters into a tiny DS cartridge." [...] Despite a few [...] "small quirks", the magazine noted that Hunters [...] "is a very polished game". The Times concurred with these claims, remarking, [...] "A lot of thought has clearly gone into {{making the most of}} the DS's touch-screen capability here, and it works gloriously." ...|$|E

GameSpot called the game a [...] "significant step forward" [...] for the Mario Kart series, partly {{because it is the}} first in the series to feature online play. Game Revolution remarked that the game [...] "goes the distance" [...] with its single-player and multiplayer modes. 1UP.com complimented the [...] "surprisingly compelling package", describing it as a [...] "portable racing game on par with anything ever to appear on a console". Video game magazine GamePro was pleased with the variety of racers, courses, modes, and multiplayer options offered, toting the game as a [...] "must play" [...] for any Nintendo fan and a requisite for any Nintendo DS owner to purchase. Computer and Video Games described Mario Kart DS as the [...] "most complete" [...] Mario Kart game, despite a few graphical shortcomings. Eurogamer enjoyed the game's multiplayer mode, calling it [...] "genuinely practical to play with other people". British publication GamesTM criticized the game for being simply a [...] "polishing of the Mario Kart concept and little else", and video game website Nintendophiles was disappointed with the [...] "fairly repetitive" [...] single-player mode and the [...] "cheap computer players".|$|E

The Kazakhs switched from {{playing in the}} Asian junior tournament, to the European. [...] There was no {{shadow of a doubt}} that they were a much better team than was suited for this level, scoring over 150 goals in five games.

Namely, for three years he {{was the president of}} the country whose very existence was something that the party of which he's a vice-president (DPS) strived to end. Seeing as how DPS is the leading force in Montenegrin separatist movement and his party president Milo Đukanović a public face of the part of Montenegro pushing to end the union, it was very <b>hard</b> for many <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> Marović reconciled those views with his duties of furthering union's interests in the role of its President.|$|R

40|$|Chaos, lawlessness, corruption, distress, {{and greed}} {{undermined}} {{any possibility of}} a peaceful and prosperous life {{for the people of}} early China. This period of time was referred to as the Period of the Warring States. Both Han Fei Tzu and Confucius were thoughtful men, driven by the troubles of their time to find an answer to how a ruler should act. Each man proposed a blueprint for an ideal society, including instructions on how a ruler should act. These instructions were included within philosophies that would appear to be completely at odds. Individually, these philosophies could not be successfully realized. Yet, interestingly enough, successful incorporations of both doctrines played an influential role in shaping a society, a culture, and a way of living. We live in such a state of order compared the people of ancient China, that it’s <b>hard</b> for us <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> horrific and terrifying it was to live without laws and morality. The period of the Warring States, which lasted from about 475 BC to the unification of China under the Qin Dynasty in 221 BC, was a period of social anarchy.

This so-called filter-bubble problem, coined by Eli Pariser, co-founder of the viral video site Upworthy, is the idea that the internet can contribute to the insularity of certain communities. Filter bubbles have been blamed for the spread of misinformation during the 2016 presidential election and for the failure of pundits in the U.K. to anticipate Brexit... Wikipedia's filter-bubble problem is a particularly acute threat for an organization whose stated mission is 'to empower and engage people around the world.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{need for}} a {{complete}} method of determining what lesser offenses are included within a charged offense is particularly great where, as here, the statute at issue is {{one that can be}} violated in a number of ways," [...] Flaum wrote. [...] "Indeed, the past several years have seen the enactment of a number of criminal statutes that can be violated in various ways, and that in fact are specifically predicated on violations of any number of other legal provisions" [...] such as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). [...] "They are exactly the type of offenses for which consideration of lesser offenses is appropriate under Rule 31(c), but it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> any lesser included offense could ever be considered under the elements test, precisely because these 'greater' offenses are so broadly defined."

2500|$|On March 14, {{clips of}} {{controversial}} sermons from Obama's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, resurfaced on YouTube and received heavy airtime on cable news television. Among other things, Wright said, [...] "God damn America for treating our citizens {{as less than}} human. God damn America {{for as long as}} she acts like she is God and she is supreme." [...] Four days later, Obama responded to the controversy in a 37-minute speech, speaking openly about race and religion in the United States. He denounced Wright's remarks while refusing to condemn the pastor himself, and he attempted to pivot from the immediate circumstances to address the larger theme of [...] "A More Perfect Union." [...] The speech was regarded as [...] "breathtakingly unconventional" [...] in its political strategy and tone, and it received generally positive reviews in the press. The New York Times weighed in with an editorial: [...] "Senator Barack Obama, who has not faced such tests of character this year, faced one on Tuesday. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> he could have handled it better." [...] Ten days later, the speech had been watched at least 3.4 million times on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|With 2002's Scrisori din Washington, Tismăneanu {{constructs}} {{a retrospective}} {{overview of the}} 20th century, which he sees as dominated by the supremacy of communism and fascism. Structured around reviewed Deutsche Welle broadcasts, it also includes short texts on diverse subjects, such as essays about Marxist resistance to established communism, {{an analysis of the}} Western far right, conclusions about the Kosovo War, a debate around the political ideas of interwar novelist Panait Istrati, and praises of the Romanian intellectuals Virgil Ierunca and Dan Pavel. Mircea Iorgulescu criticizes the work for not discussing other relevant phenomena (such as the successes of feminism, decolonization and the environmental movement), and argues that many of the pieces seem American-centered, unfocused or outdated. Iorgulescu also objects to the book's verdict on Istrati's political choices after his split with communism, claiming that Tismăneanu is wrong in assuming that Istrati eventually moved to the far right. He nevertheless argues: [...] " [...] provides an impressive image of the extraordinary American effort to research, analyze and interpret communism and post-communism." [...] Iorgulescu, who views Tismăneanu as a Romanian equivalent to Michnik, adds: [...] "The circumstance of his living in the United States [...] protects him, for it is not <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>how</b> one would have viewed and behaved toward a Romanian from Romania who has the courage to speak, for instance, about the existence of an anti-Bolshevik Bolshevism.

Along the sea-level, which the town mostly keeps, the war-like harness of the stronghold shows through the civil dress of the town in barracks and specific forts and gray battle-ships lying at anchor in the docks.

6000|$|At {{the same}} moment, when she {{bestowed}} that glance on me which said so much, {{a look of}} intelligence passed over {{the faces of the}} other people in the room.

Tender glances, soft whispered words, hand-touchings, and a thousand little personal attentions, showing which way the emotions tend, would scarcely have been practicable in such a place and in such conditions, and new signs and symbols would have to be invented to express the feelings of the heart. And doubtless these Orientals, living all together in one great room, with their children and pets, like our very ancient ancestors, the pastoral Aryans, do possess such a language. And this pretty language I should have learnt from the most willing of teachers, if those venomous vinchucas had not dulled my brain with their persecutions and made me blind to a matter which had not escaped the observation of even unconcerned lookers-on.
