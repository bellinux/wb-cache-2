5|$|Abantiades latipennis, {{known as}} the Pindi moth, is a species of moth in the Hepialidae family. It may also be {{referred}} to as a swift moth or a <b>ghost</b> <b>moth,</b> as this is a common name associated with Hepialidae. Endemic to Australia and identified in 1932, it is most populous in temperate rainforest where eucalypti are prevalent, as the larvae feed primarily on the roots of these trees. Females lay eggs during flight in a scattering fashion. The larvae live for over eighteen months underground, while adult moths survive for approximately one week, as they have no mouthparts with which to feed. The moths are preyed upon by a number of predators, including bats and owls. Brown in colour overall, males are paler and the identifying silver bars of the male's wings are more prominent than those of the female's, with dark margins. Male adults are generally smaller.|$|E

25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, <b>ghost</b> <b>moth</b> and large yellow underwing.|$|E

25|$|In {{the higher}} groups with two {{functional}} pairs of wings, both pairs are linked together mechanically in various ways, and {{function as a}} single wing, although {{this is not true}} in the more primitive groups. There are also exceptions to be found among the more advanced Neoptera; the <b>ghost</b> <b>moth</b> is able to unlock its pair of wings and move them independently, allowing them to hover like dragonflies. What all Neoptera share, however, is the way the muscles in the thorax work: these muscles, rather than attaching to the wings, attach to the thorax and deform it; since the wings are extensions of the thoracic exoskeleton, the deformations of the thorax cause the wings to move as well. A set of dorsal longitudinal muscles compress the thorax from front to back, causing the dorsal surface of the thorax (notum) to bow upward, making the wings flip down. A set of tergosternal muscles pull the notum downward again, causing the wings to flip upward.|$|E

60|$|It is a {{singular}} {{fact that no}} British moths, nor as far as I can discover hardly any foreign species, which are brilliantly coloured, differ much in colour according to sex; though {{this is the case}} with many brilliant butterflies. The male, however, of one American moth, the Saturnia Io, is described as having its fore-wings deep yellow, curiously marked with purplish-red spots; whilst the wings of the female are purple-brown, marked with grey lines.[516] The British moths which differ sexually in colour are all brown, or various tints of dull yellow, or nearly white. In several species the males are much darker than the females,[517] and these belong to groups which generally fly about during the afternoon. On the other hand, in many genera, as Mr. Stainton informs me, the males have the hind-wings whiter than those of the femaleâ€”of which, fact Agrotis exclamationis offers a good instance. The males are thus rendered more conspicuous than the females, whilst flying about in the dusk. In the <b>Ghost</b> <b>Moth</b> (Hepialus humuli) the difference is more strongly marked; the males being white and the females yellow with darker markings. It is difficult to conjecture what the meaning can be of these differences between the sexes in the shades of darkness or lightness; but we can hardly suppose that they are the result of mere variability with sexually-limited inheritance, independently of any benefit thus derived.|$|E
2500|$|The {{family was}} first erected by the Austrian {{entomologist}} [...] Anton Handlirsch in 1908. Like Butler, Handlirsch insisted that palaeontinids {{were members of}} lepidopteran Heteroneura (butterflies and moths). Palaeontinids were then only known mostly from poorly preserved specimens like Palaeontina and Eocicada. He claimed they {{were related to the}} extant family Limacodidae (slug moths). The [...] English entomologist Edward Meyrick supported the lepidopteran conclusion, though he believed they belonged to the family Hepialidae (<b>ghost</b> <b>moths)</b> instead. He said [...] "There is little doubt that it [...] belongs to the Hepialidae." ...|$|R
5000|$|Phymatopus (Originally: Noctua [...] Linnaeus, 1758) is a genus of moths {{belonging}} to the hepialidae family (commonly referred to as swift <b>moths</b> or <b>ghost</b> <b>moths),</b> which consists of around 500 species and 30 genera. [...] They can be found across Eurasia and North America. Species can be distinguished by the different morphology of male genitalia and different forewing patterns, which vary in stripe colour and size and arrangement of spots. The stripes themselves consist of spots separated by dark veins which are fringed by thin black lines from both inner and outer sides.|$|R
50|$|The name timber moths {{was coined}} by the Queensland naturalist Rowland Illidge in 1892, later {{published}} in 1895, and serves to distinguish these moths from other wood-boring Australian <b>moths</b> such as <b>ghost</b> <b>moths</b> (Hepialidae) and giant wood moths (Cossidae), which feed on sap or wood. It {{refers to the}} fact that the larvae of most members of this family are arboreal, whether they burrow into branches, bore into flower heads, tunnel under bark, or feed on lichens. Moths of the genus Maroga are pests of wattles (Acacia) and have crossed over from their wild host-plant to become serious pests of cultivated stone fruit trees, particularly cherries.|$|R
60|$|As sexual {{selection}} primarily depends on variability, {{a few words}} must be added on this subject. In respect to colour there is no difficulty, as any number of highly variable Lepidoptera could be named. One good instance will suffice. Mr. Bates shewed me {{a whole series of}} specimens of Papilio sesostris and childrenÃ¦; in the latter the males varied much in the extent of the beautifully enamelled green patch on the fore-wings, and {{in the size of the}} white mark, as well as of the splendid crimson stripe on the hind-wings; so that there was a great contrast between the most and least gaudy males. The male of Papilio sesostris, though a beautiful insect, is much less so than P. childrenÃ¦. It likewise varies a little in the size of the green patch on the fore-wings, and in the occasional appearance of a small crimson stripe on the hind-wings, borrowed, as it would seem, from its own female; for the females of this and of many other species in the Ã†neas group possess this crimson stripe. Hence between the brightest specimens of P. sesostris and the least bright of P. childrenÃ¦, there was but a small interval; and it was evident that as far as mere variability is concerned, there would be no difficulty in permanently increasing by means of selection the beauty of either species. The variability is here almost confined to the male sex; but Mr. Wallace and Mr. Bates have shewn[519] that the females of some other species are extremely variable, the males being nearly constant. As I have before mentioned the <b>Ghost</b> <b>Moth</b> (Hepialus humuli) as one of the best instances in Britain of a difference in colour between the sexes of moths, it may be worth adding[520] that in the Shetland Islands, males are frequently found which closely resemble the females. In a future chapter I shall have occasion to shew that the beautiful eye-like spots or ocelli, so common on the wings of many Lepidoptera, are eminently variable.|$|E
6000|$|That sad day of {{very small}} {{things for the}} sportsman is, however, not near, nor within {{measurable}} distance; or, so {{it seemed to me}} when, an hour ago, I strolled round the garden, curiously peering into every shrub, to find the visible and comparatively noble insect-life in great abundance. Beetles were there--hard, round, polished, and of various colours, like sea-worn pebbles on the beach; and some, called lady-birds in the vernacular, were bound like the books that Chaucer loved in black and red. And the small gilded fly, not less an insect light-headed, a votary of vain delights, than in the prehistoric days when a white-headed old king, discrowned and crazed, railed against sweet Nature's liberty. And ever waiting to welcome this inconstant lover (with falces) there sits the solitary geometric spider, an image and embodiment of patience, not on a monument, but a suspended wheel of which he is himself the hub; and so delicately fashioned are the silver spokes thereof, radiating from his round and gem-like body, and the rings, concentric tire within tire, that its exceeding fineness, like swift revolving motion, renders it almost invisible. Caterpillars, too, in great plenty--miniature porcupines with fretful quills on end, and some naked even as they came into the world. This one, called the earth-measurer, has drunk himself green with chlorophyll so as to escape detection. Vain precaution! since eccentric motion betrays him to keen avian eyes, when, like the traveller's snake, he erects himself on the tip of his tail and sways about in empty space, vaguely feeling for something, he knows not what. And the mechanical tortrix that rolls up a leaf for garment and food, and preys on his own case and shelter until he has literally eaten himself stark naked; after which he rolls up a second leaf, and so on progressively. Thus in his larval life does he symbolize some restless nation that makes itself many successive constitutions and forms of government, in none of which it abides long; but afterwards some higher thing, when he rests motionless, in form like a sarcophagus, whence the infolded life emerges to haunt the twilight--a grey <b>ghost</b> <b>moth.</b> There is no end to rolled-up leaves, and to the variety of creatures that are housed in them; for, just as the [...] "insect tribes of human kind" [...] in all places and in all ages, while seeking to improve their condition, independently hit on the same means and inventions, so it is with these small six-legged people; and many species in many places have found out the comfort and security of the green cylinder.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{singular}} {{fact that no}} British moths which are brilliantly coloured, and, as far as I can discover, hardly any foreign species, differ much in colour according to sex; though {{this is the case}} with many brilliant butterflies. The male, however, of one American moth, the Saturnia Io, is described as having its fore-wings deep yellow, curiously marked with purplish-red spots; whilst the wings of the female are purple-brown, marked with grey lines. (19. Harris, 'Treatise,' etc., edited by Flint, 1862, p. 395.) The British moths which differ sexually in colour are all brown, or of various dull yellow tints, or nearly white. In several species the males are much darker than the females (20. For instance, I observe in my son's cabinet that the males are darker than the females in the Lasiocampa quercus, Odonestis potatoria, Hypogymna dispar, Dasychira pudibunda, and Cycnia mendica. In this latter species the difference in colour between the two sexes is strongly marked; and Mr. Wallace informs me that we here have, as he believes, an instance of protective mimicry confined to one sex, as will hereafter be more fully explained. The white female of the Cycnia resembles the very common Spilosoma menthrasti, both sexes of which are white; and Mr. Stainton observed that this latter moth was rejected with utter disgust by a whole brood of young turkeys, which were fond of eating other moths; so that if the Cycnia was commonly mistaken by British birds for the Spilosoma, it would escape being devoured, and its white deceptive colour would thus be highly beneficial.), and these belong to groups which generally fly about during the afternoon. On the other hand, in many genera, as Mr. Stainton informs me, the males have the hind-wings whiter than those of the female--of which fact Agrotis exclamationis offers a good instance. In the <b>Ghost</b> <b>Moth</b> (Hepialus humuli) the difference is more strongly marked; the males being white, and the females yellow with darker markings. (21. It is remarkable, that in the Shetland Islands the male of this moth, instead of differing widely from the female, frequently resembles her closely in colour (see Mr. MacLachlan, 'Transactions, Entomological Society,' vol. ii. 1866, p. 459). Mr. G. Fraser suggests ('Nature,' April 1871, p. 489) that at the season of the year when the ghost-moth appears in these northern islands, the whiteness of the males would not be needed to render them visible to the females in the twilight night.) It is probable that in these cases the males are thus rendered more conspicuous, and more easily seen by the females whilst flying about in the dusk.|$|E

40|$|Native Mediterranean {{forests in}} Australia are {{dominated}} by two tree genera, Eucalyptus and Acacia, while Pinus and Eucalyptus dominate plantation forestry. In native forests, {{there is a high}} diversity of phloem and wood borers across several families in the Coleoptera and Lepidoptera.

This chapter reviews the importance of these borers in Australian forests primarily from an economic perspective (i. e. those species that cause damage to commercial tree species) and highlights a paucity of native forest species that commonly kill trees relative to the large scales regularly seen in North America and Europe...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the timing of}} the crepuscular lekking flight of male <b>ghost</b> swift <b>moths</b> in southern Sweden with respect to variations in: (i) the quality of the visual mating signal; and (ii) the behaviour of potential vertebrate predators (mainly bats). The moths' display flights started ca. 57 min after sunset, and occurred during 20 â€“ 30 min at incident light intensities between 10. 0 and 2. 0 lux. Owing to the falling and more shortwave ambient light after sunset, the brightness contrast between the moth wings and the background (grass) increased steeply at the time of display onset. The silvery white male wing colour thereby seems to maximize conspicuousness, and may be a secondary adaptation that facilitates visibility at low light intensities. The display timing itself is probably determined by other factors, possibly predation. By displaying only for a short period at dusk, the moths seem to avoid most birds, which normally do not forage at these light levels, and gleaning bats, which typically do not start to feed until the light intensity has fallen even further. Nevertheless, aerial-hawking bats were often (54 % of the evenings, n = 22) seen at the leks, and one species (Eptesicus nilssonii) frequently fed on the displaying moths (22 % of the moths observed, n = 83). H. humuli represents an ancient clade among the Lepidoptera. By restricting its sexual behaviour to a short time window at dusk, when predation risk may be minimized (but still high), it may to some extent compensate for the lack of sophisticated predator defence systems such as aposematic or mimetic coloration, manoeuvrable flight, and ultrasonic hearing, which predominate among the more recent Lepidopteran clades. However, the time window solution restricts the moths' activities considerably and the lack of defence still carries a considerable cost in terms of predation...|$|R
