40|$|Existing models <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> do {{not easily}} {{accommodate}} victims of crime. Therefore, {{this article presents}} {{an examination of the}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> from the perspective of crime victims. A grounded theory approach was adopted to analyse the data from a series of semi-structured interviews carried out with victims of serious violent offences. Results indicated that victims generally thought forgiveness was both positive and beneficial. Whereas major models <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> emphasize the interpersonal nature <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness,</b> victims <b>of</b> crime conceived of the construct as strongly intrapersonal. <b>Forgiveness</b> was comprised <b>of</b> four parts: self-awareness, letting go, perspective-taking and moving on. Each of these aspects was examined in light of the data and contrasted with existing literature. This study establishes a new area <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> research and provides further insight into the psychological experience of victims of crime...|$|R

5|$|In {{his final}} period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and {{completed}} three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, {{as well as}} the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the <b>forgiveness</b> <b>of</b> potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.|$|E
5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain <b>forgiveness</b> <b>of</b> sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E

Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for <b>forgiveness</b> <b>of</b> sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not killing newborn girls.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the <b>forgiveness</b> <b>of</b> sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E

40|$|Testing {{the idea}} that the process <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> is {{intrinsically}} different across diverse relationships, this study examined the role <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> in different family relationships. In 2 laboratory sessions 1 year apart, 114 families (each including 2 parents and 1 child) completed a new measure <b>of</b> family <b>forgiveness</b> and many individual-level, relationship-level, and family-level variables that have been previously linked with forgiveness. After validating the measure <b>of</b> family <b>forgiveness</b> in cross-sectional analyses, investigators performed longitudinal analyses to examine the role <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> in each family relationship over the 1 -year interval. Results indicated many important positive consequences <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> on individual traits, aspects of each family relationship, and general family environment. However, there were also important asymmetries in associates <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> across parent-child and parent-parent relationships, demonstrating the relationship-bound nature <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness...</b>|$|R

40|$|Concepts <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> {{explore the}} sum of the parts of any {{individual}} within any context or belief system an individual is a part of. The sum of these parts involve forgiveness within the context of an entire person, empathy being at the heart <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness,</b> forgiveness as a relationship and <b>forgiveness</b> being that <b>of</b> a personal commitment. Forgiveness is an art within the process toward emotional maturity and is a part of any aspect of the human experience toward achieving self-acceptance. Applications <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> are therapeutic and can be a way in which personal healing can take place. In addition, therapeutic benefits <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> counseling can allow a person to move forward from the past and become able to look toward to a better future.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>forgiveness,</b> quality <b>of</b> romantic attachment with altruism in parents of children with special needs and regular school children. In this study, 275 individuals (144 parents of regular school children using cluster sampling and 131 parents of children with special needs using available sampling[procedure) were selected. In this study Enright forgiveness inventory (Enright, 1977), Adult Attachment Inventory (Hazen& Shaver, 1987), and altruism (Ashton & et al., 1998); were used. Analysis of data was performed by using multiple regression analysis. Results of the analysis revealed that in parents of regular school children there was a significant negative correlation between insecure attachment to spouse and cognitive, emotional and behavioral domain <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness.</b> Whereas in parents of exceptional children there was a significant negative correlation between insecure attachment to spouse and cognitive and behavioral dimensions <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness.</b> Multiple regression analysis revealed that in mothers of children with special needs and regular school children quality of attachment to the spouse was a significant variable in determining the forgiveness (cognitive, behavioral and emotional dimension <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness).</b> The quality <b>of</b> attachment is a significant variable in determining the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article compares Enright's cognitive-developmental model <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> (Enright et al., 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994) {{with a model}} <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> {{based on}} {{communication}} between the wronged and the wrongdoer. While unilateral forgiveness is unconditional and is a process which happens wholly within {{the person who has}} suffered an injustice, negotiated <b>forgiveness</b> requires <b>of</b> the wrongdoer (1) confession; (2) ownership; and (3) repentance for their actions. Unilateral forgiveness is built upon the principle of identity; in contrast, negotiated forgiveness begins with, and extends Piaget's principle of ideal reciprocity. Enright's highest stage <b>of</b> <b>forgiveness</b> reasoning is one in which considerations of social context are transcended; in the model <b>of</b> negotiated <b>forgiveness,</b> such understanding <b>of</b> context is central.
