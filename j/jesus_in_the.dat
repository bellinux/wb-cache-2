5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to <b>Jesus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even {{go so far as to}} be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E

5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of <b>Jesus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of <b>Jesus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} {{demolished}} by 30 September 1937 {{for the construction}} of Via della Conciliazione. Its art was given to the Capitolo di San Pietro and then to the Museo Petriano; some chapel frescoes are on display at the Museo di Roma. Elements of the facade, including the 17th-century travertino portal decorated with cherubs, are in the comune storehouse at the Bastione Ardeatino. The two relics (of Isaac's sacrifice and the presentation of <b>Jesus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temple) were placed in the church of the Santi Michele e Magno, the national church of the Dutch in Borgo, during the early 1990s; the latter is now the church's main altar.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} stories were both seen in Medieval- and Renaissance {{theology}} as prefiguring the Crucifixion of <b>Jesus.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{story of the}} Brazen Serpent, the people of Israel become dissatisfied and grumble at God. As punishment they receive a plague of venonous snakes. God offers the people relief by instructing Moses to make a snake of brass and set it up on a pole, the sight of which gives miraculous healing. Michelangelo chooses a crowded composition, depicting a dramatic mass of suffering men, women, and writhing snakes, separated from redeemed worshipers by the snake before an epiphanic light.|$|E

More recently, he has performed solo concerts concurrently with his latter career in Deep Purple, and his work and affinity with Armenia, combined with his continued friendship with Tony Iommi since his brief time in Black Sabbath, has led him to form the supergroup WhoCares with Iommi. His solo career outside of Deep Purple was given a comprehensive overview with the Gillan's Inn box set in 2006.|$|E
