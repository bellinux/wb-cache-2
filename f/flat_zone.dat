40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a class of {{morphological}} filtering tools called connected operators. These operators act by merging <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> that do not fulfill a given simplification criterion. This filtering approach offers the advantage of simplifying the image, because some <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> are removed, as well as preserving contour information, because the <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> that are not removed are perfectly preserved. However, for some applications, connected operators present a drawback {{in the way they}} restore the areas where <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> have been merged. These areas may be perceptible in the filtered image appearing as single <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> inside smoothed regions or across edges. To overcome such drawback, this paper proposes a solution based on the use of image inpainting. Pages: 227 - 23...|$|R
40|$|This {{correspondence}} {{deals with}} the notion of connected operators. Starting from the definition for operator acting on sets, it is shown how to extend it to operators acting on function. Typically, a connected operator acting on a function is a transformation that enlarges the partition of the space created by the <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> of the functions. It is shown that from any connected operator acting on sets, one can construct a connected operator for functions (however, it is not the unique way of generating connected operators for functions). Moreover, the concept of pyramid is introduced in a formal way. It is shown that, if a pyramid is based on connected operators, the <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> of the functions increase with the level of the pyramid. In other words, the <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> are nested. Filters by reconstruction are defined and their main properties are presented. Finally, some examples of application of connected operators and use of <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> are described. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

For binary im-ages, the <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> are the foreground and background grains (connected components) of the image. The <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> constitute a partition of the underlying space. A connected operator is an operator that makes this par-tition coarser. A grain operator is a connected operator that is uniquely specified by two grain criteria, one for the foreground and one for the background components. This paper contains a brief discussion of connected op-erators and grain operators with an emphasis on con-nected filters, all in the context of binary images. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a class of {{morphological}} operators called connected operators. These operators filter the signal by merging its <b>flat</b> <b>zones.</b> As a result, they do not create any new contours and are very attractive for filtering tasks where the contour information has to be preserved.

A formal definition of the various processing steps involved in the operator is proposed and, as a result, several lines of generalization are developed. First, the notion of connectivity and its definition are analyzed. Several modifications of the traditional approach are presented.

40|$|Classical {{adaptive}} mathematical morphology {{is based}} on operators which locally adapt the structuring elements to the image properties. Connected morphological operators act {{on the level of}} the <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> of an image, such that only <b>flat</b> <b>zones</b> are filtered out, and hence the object edges are preserved. Area opening (resp. area closing) {{is one of the most}} useful connected operators, which filters out the bright (resp. dark) regions. It intrinsically involves the adaptation of the shape of the structuring element parameterized by its area. In this paper, we introduce the notion of reference-driven adaptive area opening according to two spatially-variant paradigms. First, the parameter of area is locally adapted by the reference image. This approach is applied to processing intensity+depth images where the depth image is used to adapt the scale-size processing. Second, a self-dual area opening, where the reference image determines if the area filter is an opening or a closing with respect to the relationship between the image and the reference. Its natural application domain are the video sequences...|$|R

50|$|The Arauca {{is typical}} of the rivers that flow east across the Llanos Orientales {{starting}} as a swift mountain stream and becoming wider and slower as it crosses the plains. It starts high in the Andes, in the Páramo del Almorzadero at over 4000 m above sea level. Initially it is called the Chitagá, it receives inflows from the Carabo and the Cacota, and then twists its course towards the east joining with the Culaga and the Bochaga. At which point its name changes to the Margua. The Negro, the Colorado and the San Lorenzo then flow into it. From the right bank come the Cubugón and the Cobar from the Sierra Nevada de Chita. In this stretch the Tunebo Indians call the river the Sarare. Now flowing across a <b>flat</b> <b>zone,</b> it divides to form the Charo Island. Serving as the demarcation line between Colombia and Venezuela for 296 km of border, on the right side the rivers Royata, Bojabá and Banadía flow in, whereas on the left the Cutufí river enters. From this point it takes the name Arauca in tribute to the Araucana tribe who inhabited the mountain ranges of the upper course and belonged to the great Arawak family. Now in the savannas of the Llanos Orientales it often becomes a braided river with the main course splitting to form the subsidiary channels, such as the one called Agua Limón. Various subsidiary channels are extensively used for transportation from the town of Arauca down to its mouth on the Orinoco. The course of the river is 80 percent navigable in small boats.|$|E

Another drawback concerned to the additive noise effect occurs on the <b>flat</b> spectral <b>zones</b> which are usually raised. These combined effects on both the peaked and the <b>flat</b> spectral <b>zones</b> can be alleviated by trying to restore its original structure, which assumes noise knowledge.

The noise estimate is then used to restore both the peaked and the <b>flat</b> spectral <b>zones</b> of the speech spectrum. This algorithm was implemented over a baseline spectral normalisation method. This method was developed by taking into consideration that, while the speech regions with less energy need more robustness, since in these regions the noise is more dominant, the “peaked ” spectral regions which are the most reliable due to the higher speech energy must also be preserved as much as possible by the feature extraction process...|$|R
