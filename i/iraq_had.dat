5|$|The DRFLA was {{undermined}} by its {{links with the}} Iraqi government after it emerged that <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> sponsored the training and equipping of the hostage-takers. The Iran–Iraq War started {{five months after the}} end of the siege and continued for eight years. The campaign for autonomy of Khūzestān was largely forgotten in the wake of the hostilities, as was the DRFLA.|$|E
5|$|While the {{tensions}} between NATO members from the build-up to the invasion of <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> dissipated, the NATO summit, and the months preceding the summit, were marked by divisions between the United States and the United Kingdom {{on the one side}} and France, Germany, Italy and Spain on the other. Two rifts existed, one about the military contributions to the war in Afghanistan, and the other concerning whether or not NATO should assume a more global role.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} that <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose {{to develop the}} electromagnetic process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq {{was estimated to be}} two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed in the Gulf War. Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.|$|E
50|$|For example, two tested {{hypotheses}} {{could be}} that <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> WMD or <b>Iraq</b> does not <b>have</b> WMD. If the evidence showed {{that it is more}} likely there are WMDs in Iraq then two new hypotheses could be formulated: WMD are in Baghdad or WMD are in Mosul. Or perhaps, the analyst may need to know what type of WMD Iraq has; the new hypotheses {{could be that}} <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> biological WMD, <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> chemical WMD and <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> nuclear WMD. By giving the ACH structure, the analyst is able to give a nuanced estimate.|$|R

5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{forces in}} this period {{comprised}} small bodies of professional troops, which were augmented by volunteers and conscripts in times of war. The largest of the Muslim states at the time, the Turkish Great Seljuk Sultanate, which ruled most of what is modern Iran and <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> about 10,000 full-term soldiers. The number of troops available to the Syrian states was much smaller. The core of the professional troops were the ghulam or mamluk, who were trained for war since childhood. The cost of raising and training a mamluk was about 30 dinars (by contrast, a good horse in Syria went for about 100 dinars).|$|E
25|$|<b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> been {{listed as}} a State sponsor of {{terrorism}} by the U.S. since 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its war with Iran. Hussein's regime had {{proven to be a}} problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds in the 1980s.|$|E
