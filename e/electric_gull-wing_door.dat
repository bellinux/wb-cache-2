2500|$|Despite {{the common}} {{misconception}} that the <b>gull-wing</b> <b>doors</b> are mere stylistic affectations, {{the design is}} a very practical one in a tight urban parking space.

The most obvious downside to having <b>gull-wing</b> <b>doors</b> is that, should the car roll over and come to rest on its roof, exit by the doors would be impossible, requiring a large windscreen opening to escape. The Mercedes SLS solved this problem by fitting explosive bolts in the hinges, that would blow up {{in the event that}} the car rolls over.|$|R
