5|$|After peak intensity, {{the forward}} speed of Dean {{continued}} to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter, Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph (105km/h). Later that day, Dean emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{went into}} {{the final day of}} the {{competition}} knowing a draw was enough to win the Emirates Cup. Alexandre Lacazette started for Arsenal, as did Mesut Özil, while Ben Yedder continued to lead the line for Sevilla in a front three – either side of Nolito and Joaquín Correa. After an uneventful first half which saw both sides create few chances, Sevilla took the lead when Ben Yedder's reverse ball found an incoming Correa who slotted the ball past Petr Čech. Lacazette equalised for Arsenal, but the hosts went behind again after Steven N'Zonzi's long shot looped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> top corner. Sevilla held on to win, but despite a 100% record they finished second because Arsenal's points and goal difference was identical to theirs, and the Spanish club had scored fewer goals over the two days.|$|E

5|$|By August28, {{the storm}} began to re-intensify, after curving north-northwestward near The Bahamas. At 0000UTC on the {{following}} day, Faith peaked as a 125mph (205km/h) Category3 hurricane Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Eventually, the storm weakened back to a Category2 hurricane and re-curved to the northeast. One person drowned in the western Atlantic after his ship sank. Heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted Bermuda, though no damage occurred. The storm maintained nearly the same intensity as a Category2 hurricane for several days, while tracking northeastward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> North Atlantic Ocean. Faith finally weakened while north of Scotland and became extratropical near the Faroe Islands on September6. Three other drowning deaths occurred in the North Sea near Denmark. A fifth death occurred after a man succumbed to injuries sustained during a boating incident related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|In the 66thminute, Alex Ferguson {{completed}} his attacking quartet by bringing Dimitar Berbatov on {{in place of}} Park. Ronaldo was penalised for a high elbow when challenging for a header with Puyol a minute later, before Rooney forced another corner off Piqué in the 69thminute. However, United's numbers up front in search of another goal left them wanting in defence; a weak clearance from Van der Sar was cut out by Puyol who played the ball to Eto'o {{on the right side}} of the penalty area. The ball broke to Xavi on the edge of the area, who crossed for Messi to send a looping header over the United goalkeeper and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> side of the goal for a two-goal lead. Immediately after the goal, Henry was replaced by Seydou Keita, allowing Barcelona to adopt a more defensive stance.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's first {{opportunity}} came a minute later, after West Ham midfielder Carl Fletcher conceded a free kick for a foul on Gerrard. However, the resulting free kick was hit {{into the wall}} of players {{in front of the}} West Ham penalty area. A few minutes later, West Ham scored the first goal of the match; Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso gave the ball away to Benayoun, who played it inside to Ashton. Ashton then played a through-ball to Lionel Scaloni on the right flank, before the Argentine's low cross was put into his own goal by Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher to give West Ham a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later, West Ham extended their lead, when Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina fumbled a shot from Etherington into the path of Ashton, who squeezed the rebound under Reina <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> corner to make it 2–0. Liverpool looked to have reduced the defect in the 30th minute, but Peter Crouch's shot from a Gerrard free kick was disallowed as Crouch was offside.|$|E

5|$|Murray's {{contract}} was cancelled {{to allow him}} to join Northern Premier League Division One North club Scarborough Athletic. York dropped into the relegation zone in 23rd place after being beaten 2–0 at home by fellow strugglers Dagenham & Redbridge, who scored in each half through Jamie Cureton. Having only made appearances as a substitute during two months with York, Morris returned to Norwich after his loan expired. York took a 2–0 lead away to Luton, Carson and Sinclair scoring within five minutes of each other early in the second half. However, Hyde was sent off for a tackle on Nathan Doyle before Mark Cullen scored twice for Luton, the match finishing a 2–2 draw. Winfield, who had made only five appearances for York, signed for AFC Wimbledon on a one-month loan. York moved out of the relegation zone and above their opponents Tranmere after a 2–0 home victory, which was the team's first win in eight matches. Fletcher scored both goals in each half, the first coming after he met Halliday's low cross at the back post and the second came after collecting Coulson's pass, cutting inside and shooting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> corner.|$|E
5|$|Six {{minutes into}} the match, Ronny Johnsen fouled Bayern striker Carsten Jancker just outside the area, and Mario Basler placed a low free kick around the United wall to score the first goal. Contrary to popular belief, the free kick was not a deflection, but rather swerved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> bottom corner of Peter Schmeichel's goal. Despite the bad start, United began to {{dominate}} possession but failed to create any clear cut chances despite David Beckham's tireless running. They seemed to be badly missing influential midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. The Bayern defence remained strong and well organised, as Andy Cole found out when his close-range effort was quickly closed down by three defenders. As Bayern began to look increasingly more dangerous on the counter-attack than their opponents did in possession, Jancker repeatedly tested the United back four {{with a number of}} clever runs, some of which were flagged offside.|$|E
5|$|São Paulo's {{pressure}} {{resulted in}} them {{taking the lead}} in the 27th minute. A chipped pass from Aloísio to Mineiro found the midfielder in space who put the ball beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina to give the Brazilians a 1–0 lead. It was the first goal Liverpool had conceded in over 1,041 minutes of play. Immediately afterwards, Liverpool had a corner, which almost resulted in a goal. Xabi Alonso took the corner which found García, but his shot hit the woodwork. Liverpool had another chance 30 minutes into the match, but again he failed to score with a header. Gerrard had a chance to equalise five minutes later, but he put his shot wide after Harry Kewell had passed him the ball. Liverpool continued to create chances and in the 39th minute García saw his header <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> corner saved by São Paulo goalkeeper Rogério Ceni. From the resulting corner Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä shot straight at Ceni. He had another chance late in the first half, but his header was saved by Ceni.|$|E

5|$|York moved {{two points}} above the relegation zone with a 3–0 away win over Cambridge, Fletcher giving York {{the lead on}} 43 minutes after {{collecting}} a loose ball {{on the edge of}} the penalty area and scoring with a powerful shot. Coulson scored soon after the second half began when his deep cross dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> corner of the goal, and Hyde finished the scoring in the 55th minute when diverting Fletcher's shot from inside the six-yard box. York went behind away to AFC Wimbledon when Deji Oshilaja scored a header in the 19th minute, before Hyde scored an equaliser after goalkeeper Joe McDonnell dropped Sinclair's cross in the 43rd minute. However, Jack Smith scored the winning goal for the home team with a volley in the 90th minute, meaning the match ended in a 2–1 win for AFC Wimbledon. Shaq Coulthirst, who scored Southend's winning goal against York in January, joined on loan from Tottenham Hotspur for the rest of the season, after Fletcher was ruled out for six weeks with a hamstring injury. York drew 0–0 at home to relegation rivals Carlisle, and the team's best chances came in the 74th minute when Coulson and Sinclair had shots cleared off the line. Having made nine appearances for York, Benning was recalled by Walsall due to an injury to Andy Taylor. Tom Soares scored early as York were beaten 1–0 at home by Bury, resulting in the team only being above the relegation zone on goal difference.|$|E
