5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13December, and he would not be seeking <b>interim</b> <b>supply</b> for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.|$|E
500|$|On March 11 or 12, Cockroft's {{replacement}} as Provincial Treasurer, Solon Low, {{introduced the}} government's budget. It included no implementation of social credit, and {{was attacked by}} the opposition parties as [...] "the default budget" [...] and by insurgent Social Crediters as a [...] "banker's budget" [...] (a harsh insult given Social Credit's dim view of the banking industry). Ronald Ansley rose immediately to attack it as containing [...] "not one single item that even remotely resembled Social Credit." [...] Blue, again echoing Duggan, threatened on March 16 {{to vote against the}} government's <b>interim</b> <b>supply</b> bill, the defeat of which, under the conventions of the Westminster parliamentary system, would force the government's resignation. In response, Aberhart praised Blue's courage in speaking his mind, and called him a worthy Social Crediter.|$|E
500|$|On March29, in the {{aftermath}} of the insurgent victory on Brown's adjournment motion, Aberhart gave notice of closure on the budget debate. Belatedly realizing that this move would be risking his government in a vote that he might very well lose, he then announced that he would seek the consent of the legislature to withdraw his closure motion and move an <b>interim</b> <b>supply</b> motion instead. The unanimous consent needed to withdraw the closure motion was refused, and the motion itself was defeated. That evening, Aberhart negotiated with the insurgents for four hours until a compromise was accepted: the insurgents would support the supply bill, in exchange for which the cabinet would introduce a bill amending the Social Credit Measures Act to establish a board of MLAs empowered to appoint a commission of [...] "experts" [...] to implement social credit.|$|E
40|$|Australia {{needs to}} end its {{reliance}} on fossil fuels. The Australian Sex Party accepts that this can’t happen immediately, and that <b>interim</b> energy <b>supplies</b> are needed. If unconventional gas continues to be used, it {{should be seen as}} a short-term solution only, using industry best-practice, following environmental reports and should not include hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Hydraulic fracturing poses an unacceptable risk to Australian farming. Prohibit the future use of hydraulic fracturing and ensure that environmental damage associated with future unconventional gas projects is minimised.  ...|$|R

As of 2016, the project purchased , a commercial container ship, and is converting the vessel into an auxiliary naval replenishment ship that will be rented by the Royal Canadian Navy. The conversion was expected to be completed and the ship active in service by 2017.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2008, Newcrest Mining {{lowered the}} mine's annual gold output targets. Newcrest said, [...] "At Telfer, {{mechanical}} {{availability of the}} open pit mining fleet and the processing of harder ores are impacting the expected production profile for the full year. Telfer site cash costs are expected to rise over guidance by 8-9 per cent." [...] In June, the mine was affected by the statewide gas crisis caused by an explosion at Varanus Island. The mine lost 20,000 to 25,000 troy ounces of gold output for June. Newcrest obtained <b>interim</b> gas <b>supply</b> from Woodside Petroleum until August, when gas supply from Varanus Island resumed.|$|R
50|$|In June 2015, the Conservative {{government}} {{changed a}} line in contracting regulations that govern Cabinet spending {{that allowed them to}} award a sole-sourced contract when operationally necessary and fulfills an interim need. It was announced shortly thereafter that the government had entered into discussions with Chantier Davie Canada on whether it could provide an <b>interim</b> <b>supply</b> ship until the new Queenston-class vessels were ready.|$|E

It is proposed that partial transition to one, or a mixture, of these alternative fuels may provide an operational <b>interim</b> option when <b>supplies</b> of Avtur become prohibitively expensive.

50|$|Rothstein died in 1928 and Gordon's {{position}} {{began to}} decline. He made {{an alliance with}} future National Crime Syndicate founders Charles Luciano, Louis Buchalter, and Meyer Lansky. Gordon, however, constantly fought with Lansky over bootlegging and gambling interests and soon a gang war began between the two; several associates on each side were killed. Lansky, with Luciano, <b>supplied</b> <b>interim</b> United States Attorney Thomas E. Dewey with information leading to Gordon's conviction on charges of tax evasion in 1933.|$|R

5000|$|The {{program to}} replace the Protecteur class was revived {{as part of the}} National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. The new s were {{intended}} to enter service in 2020. [...] was intended to be in service until 2017 and [...] until 2016, however a catastrophic fire aboard Protecteur in 2014 led to her early decommissioning and an engineering survey discovered high levels of corrosion in Preserver that led to her being kept alongside in Halifax. This left a significant operational gap for the RCN. The Navy set about trying to fill the gap, renting the replenishment services of other navies, specifically the Chilean [...] on the Pacific coast and for the Atlantic coast, inquiring into renting a ship from Spain. In 2014 Chantier Davie pitched a unsolicited plan for an <b>interim</b> <b>supply</b> ship to the Conservative government. Following that, Seaspan and Irving Shipbuilding also submitted proposals that were ultimately unsuccessful. Chantier Davie's plan was chosen and the Conservative government began exploring their proposal.|$|E

40|$|MBA Professional ReportThis {{project is}} {{designed}} to provide a policy recommendation for transitioning custody of NAVSEA's <b>Interim</b> <b>Supply</b> Support to NAVSUP based on the analysis of current business practices at NAVSEA, NAVICP-P and NAVAIR. NAVSEA has identified that it has OMandS valued at 7. 386 billion dollars; ISS is a subset of OMandS. Decisions made in the ISS phase may result in the Navy buying parts that will receive zero demand. In effect, ISS is a birthplace, but not the only birthplace, of some OMandS that are eventually categorized as excess material. A more efficient ISS process would result in lower excess material and financial savings. The data set analyzed contained ISS purchased by both NAVAIR and NAVSEA, as well as demand data. Additionally, analysis of current ISS processes at NAVAIR and NAVSEA was conducted. The research resulted in finding that NAVAIR and NAVICP-P have partnered in ISS management. The recommendations are that, in transitioning NAVSEA's ISS to NAVSUP, a partnership must be formed that develops clear business rules allowing NAVSEA input into ISS management, and that NAVICP-M should develop a dedicated staff to provide ISS support to NAVSEA's Program Management Offices.
