By special decree on 26 June 1942, the gendarmerie, which had previously {{been a part of}} the Home Guard, became part of the Ustaše militia and was placed under the command of a young Ustaše colonel, Vilko Pečnikar. In July and August 1942, the militia took control of all armed forces of the NDH other than the Home Guard, navy and air force. The militia then consisted of the regular militia, Pavelić's personal guard, the railroad security troops, the gendarmerie, the regular police, the Ustaša Surveillance Service, the Ustaša educational establishment, the Ustaša preparatory service and the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>court.</b> The Ustaša Surveillance Service included the Ustaša Defence Brigades, which had been established in late 1941. The Defence Brigades engaged in operations against both the Chetniks and Partisans, engaged in mass terror against the Serbian, Jewish and Romani segments of the NDH population, and administered the Ustaša concentration camps, including Jasenovac.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} {{informed}} consent {{had previously been}} controversial in German medicine in 1900, when Dr. Albert Neisser infected patients (mainly prostitutes) with syphilis without their consent. Despite Neisser's support {{from most of the}} academic community, public opinion, led by psychiatrist Albert Moll, was against Neisser. While Neisser went on to be fined by the Royal <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>Court,</b> Moll developed [...] "a legally based, positivistic contract theory of the patient-doctor relationship" [...] that was not adopted into German law. Eventually, the minister for religious, educational, and medical affairs issued a directive stating that medical interventions other than for diagnosis, healing, and immunization were excluded under all circumstances if [...] "the human subject was a minor or not competent for other reasons", or if the subject had not given his or her [...] "unambiguous consent" [...] after a [...] "proper explanation of the possible negative consequences" [...] of the intervention, though this was not legally binding.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the whole disciplinary procedure {{for the police}} officers in the Republic of Croatia, including statistical data for the procedures conducted from 2002 to 2005 at the Department of Disciplinary Procedures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In {{the introductory part of}} the paper, the author has emphasised the importance of police service as well as of respect for the duties of the police officers, stressing that police officers are held responsible for improper behaviour both at and outside work. The concept and character of disciplinary responsibility of police officers, general prerequisites for disciplinary responsibility, bodies in charge of conducting the procedure, and the parties to the procedure are analysed next. Analysing procedural provisions according to which disciplinary procedure is conducted, the author emphasises the inadequacies in implementation of the Law on Criminal Proceedings and the Law on General Administrative Procedure, and stresses the necessity of passing a special law that would regulate that area comprehensively. Then follow the chapters on instituting the procedure, oral hearing, procedure costs, statute of limitations for institution and conduct of the procedures, types of disciplinary offences and disciplinary sanctions, legal remedies, and court protection. Statistical analysis of the work performed at the Department of Disciplinary Procedures (Ministry of Internal Affairs) outlines all disciplinary procedures conducted against police officers. The author analyses individual institutes and identifies previous regulations, regulations concerning disciplinary responsibility of other state civil servants, judges and district attorneys, normative solutions in comparative legislation, and judgements of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>courts</b> of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Administrative Court, the Constitutional Court, and the European Court of Human Rights. Finally, the author suggests changes of certain regulations in order to ensure efficiency and eliminate normative dilemmas in the conduct of disciplinary procedures. He is of the opinion {{that it is necessary to}} retain specialised <b>disciplinary</b> <b>courts</b> within the Ministry of Internal Affairs due to the specific nature of police service and the required efficiency and legality of its functioning...|$|R

40|$|After the Second World War, {{a process}} of {{what we now call}} {{transitional}} justice was initiated in The Netherlands to deal with crimes committed during the German occupation. ‘Extraordinary justice’ (bijzondere rechtspleging) as it was called, had criminal, administrative and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals with special jurisdiction over collaboration, treason and their consequences. It was {{based on the assumption that}} the good could be clearly separated from the bad, and aimed at ridding the country of all who had made the ‘wrong choice’. This right–wrong dichotomy persisted for many decades and is even present in public discourse in The Netherlands today. Concomitantly, it has been very difficult to publicly debate sensitive issues such as the permanent shunning of collaborators, the virtual destruction of Dutch Jewry, the cold reception of the few Jewish survivors and the bystander-role of the Dutch population during the deportations. This contribution asks how, in the socio-political context of the time, extraordinary justice coloured perceptions of events, allowing some to flourish and creating a great silence and social division around others. How did those perceptions change, and with them, the nature of public debate? With the benefit of hindsight, the legacy of extraordinary justice may help us understand more about the significance — and limits — of criminal law in processes of transition...|$|R

40|$|It {{the present}} article legal bases of {{university}} courts, which worked in the pre-revolutionary Russian universities since 1757 is researched. In the article, in the chronological order main decrees and statutes regulating activities of the university courts are analyzed. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the university statute of the year 1804 and 1863, as well as projects and decrees that resulted after the First Russian Revolution of 1905 - 1907. Peculiarities of the university courts work in the universities that had their own charters: Dorpat (Yuriev), Kharkov are researched. In the article Rules on the procedures of university courts, which ware developed in each university, approved by the trustee of the study district and which differed in some provisions, in particular, on the list of punishments and penalties for students in case of breaking rules are analyzed. It is shown that university teachers and students during existence of university courts did not extend to general civil jurisdiction. Existence of university courts is considered in the article as one of the conditions for existence of university autonomy. In conclusion, author notes that activities of university <b>disciplinary</b> <b>courts</b> were viewed {{from the standpoint of the}} general proceedings. But such approach leads to the fact that existence of a "backup" judicial authority in the university becomes impractical. The confirmation is the absence of provisions on the university court in the projects of university regulations, developed in the early XX century...|$|R
