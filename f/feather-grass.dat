5000|$|Mountain <b>feather-grass</b> heath — a botanical nature {{monument}} {{located near}} Upper and Lower Bardym village.|$|E
50|$|About {{twenty percent}} of Chechnya is covered by beech, birch, {{hornbeam}} and oak forest. In the north, desert and semi-desert vegetation is noted, including sagebrush, saltwort and <b>feather-grass.</b> Acorns, wild fruits, berry bushes, medicinal herbs and mushrooms are recorded on the left bank of the Terek River. Deciduous forests are noted at elevations of 1800 to 2000 m, while sub-alpine and alpine meadows are noted at higher elevations. In the Terek-Kuma Lowland, there are approximately 50 species of mammals and 150 types of birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{the country}} consists of semi-desertic sagebrush species in the Nogai Steppe, which also has no vegetation in its sand dunes. <b>Feather-grass</b> steppe and chestnut species are found in black earth soils and in the Terek River and Sunzha River regions, with beech, hornbeam, and oak forming broad-leaved dense forests on the mountain slopes. Above 6,500 feet, the vegetation type changes to coniferous forests succeeded by alpine meadows at further higher elevations. Other plant species noted {{in the country}} are yew-trees, pine, apple, cherry, pear, berry, wild strawberry, and ramsons.|$|E
50|$|Aristida behriana is {{a native}} Australian species of grass {{commonly}} known as bunch wire grass or brush wire grass. It is a bright green perennial plant forming short, tufted tussocks up to 40 cm high. Its seeds have three long, radiating awns; it {{is a member of}} genus Aristida, grasses known commonly as three-awns. The species favours low fertility and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mallee woodlands and plains, where it grows on sunny slopes. Superficially, the flower heads resemble those of the invasive weed African <b>feather-grass</b> (Pennisetum villosum). A. behriana is found in all mainland Australian States.|$|E
50|$|Kajaran {{is a part}} of Holarctis floristic province, Zangezur region, Voghji-Geghi area, characterised by {{prevalence}} of mesophytic, eurivalent and xerophytic plants.The area around the town is mostly covered by deciduous forests. The prevailing tree species are oak and hornbeam. Subalpine and alpine flora is represented by Gramieae, Poaceae Papilionacenae and Cyperaceae (<b>feather-grass,</b> brome-grass, cereals, sedge). The vegetation period is short. high humidity contributes to humus formation. Currently there are about 877 described plant species from 4 classes (Equisetophyta, Polipodiophyta, Pinophyta, Magnoliophyta), 57 families and 33 genera. The analysis of the local plant species confirmed that these include 4 Caucasian endemic and 2 Armenian endemic species.The habitats of the fauna in the area around the city include forests, sub-alpine and alpine zones with their characteristic flora. According to Dahl (1954) this area is a home to 2 described amphibia, 8 reptile, 52 bird and 16 mammal species.Deciduous forests are predominantly inhabited by small rodents; there are also bears, roes, wildcats, bats and other animals.|$|E

Characteristics of some six syntaxons of the coastal zone weregiven.

40|$|The Ukrainian <b>feather-grass</b> steppe {{ecosystems}} are highly vulnerable to climate changes. To study {{the impact of}} climatic factors on steppe ecosystems’ productivity, the correlation and stepwise regression analysis between ANPP and other variables were provided. The correlation of bioclimatic variables (month precipitation, relative humidity and air and soil temperatures) and above-ground net primary production (ANPP) were investigated for three study plots that represent major steppe microrelief: plain, slope and lowland. The results of multiple regression analysis showed the major components that influenced the ANPP {{at each of the}} study plots ‘Plain’, ‘Slope’ and ‘Lowland’. The precipitation and relative humidity in the months before the vegetation peak were most important for ANPP accumulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{studying}} of the structural and semantic peculiarities of phytonymical vocabulary as a writing stylistic feature of the representative of Ukrainian Literature – the man of the sixties MykolaVinhranovskyi. An artistic depiction of plants as indigenous environmental signs {{is considered to be a}} traditional description of landscape where trees act as artistic details, reproducing the times of the seasons, and to some extent indirectly - a natural phenomenon. Parallelism is conventional as it meets folk tradition, the meaning of which is that trees reflect the internal state of nature comparable to the human condition, age, etc. The phytonymical code is represented by such locus names as forest, heath, garden, field, which are interpreted as indigenous signs of Ukrainian environment, and symbols (both traditional and authors). The great associative field contributed to the introduction of a significant number of symbolic meanings, among which the idioethnic ones are the most functional (Ukraine, the birthplace as the home, fate / will). The function of such phytonym as wood is limited, while the species names are widely used. The poet’s individual style is distinguished by the differentiation of such locus names as forest / garden / forest-steppe (steppe). The trees are distinguished within the locatives: forest trees (oak, maple, ash, pine, birch); trees common in the forest-steppe (poplar, willow); garden trees (apple, pear, plum). The forest is most frequently presented by such phytonyms as oak and birch in the poetic works of MykolaVinhranovskyi. The locus name forest also represents the nomen grove (small, mostly deciduous forest) having differential semes of species mentioned. The Ukrainian art world view interprets the symbol of garden through the personal world view and spiritual progress that enables the correlation of garden between the soul grace and the high internal culture, etc. The observations on the linguistic material allowed to conclude that the poetic speech of Mykola Vinhranovskyi paints the image of cherry for: a) poetizing of the elements of life; b) reproducing the correlation between the internality of a human being / age / fate and nature. Despite the national clearness of such phytonym as cherry, the reflection in reproducing the internality of the Ukrainian linguistic and culture must be pre asisstated. The phytonym of apple represents the image of a woman, her emotional experiences, embodying feminine destiny, the fate of the Ukrainians. The Ukrainian field with the adjective <b>feather-grass</b> realizes the additional value of not only the indigenous space, but also the background one – the will that we associate with phytonymical symbols (<b>feather-grass</b> / wind / will). The further research is based on the dynamics of the lexical set flowers in the Ukrainian cultural discourse from the perspective of diachrony...|$|E
