25|$|A study {{published}} in 2008 surveyed 25 different existing transcript reconstruction protocols. Its evidence suggested that existing methods are generally weak in assembling transcripts, though the ability to detect individual exons are relatively intact. According to the estimates, average sensitivity to detect exons across the 25 protocols is 80% for Caenorhabditis elegans genes. In comparison, transcript identification sensitivity decreases to 65%. For human, the study reported an exon <b>detection</b> <b>sensitivity</b> averaging to 69% and transcript <b>detection</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{had an average of}} mere 33%. In other words, for human, existing methods are able to identify less than half of all existing transcript.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} diameter (ID) of an HPLC column {{is an important}} parameter that influences the <b>detection</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and separation selectivity in gradient elution.

25|$|Liquid chromatography–mass {{spectrometry}} (LC-MS) is {{an analytical}} chemistry technique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography (or HPLC) with the mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry (MS).

While liquid chromatography separates mixtures with multiple components, mass spectrometry provides structural {{identity of the}} individual components with high molecular specificity and <b>detection</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> This tandem technique {{can be used to}} analyze biochemical, organic, and inorganic compounds commonly found in complex samples of environmental and biological origin. Therefore, LC-MS may be applied {{in a wide range of}} sectors including biotechnology, environment monitoring, food processing, and pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and cosmetic industries.|$|E

40|$|Total {{reflection}} {{x-ray fluorescence}} (TXRF) spectroscopy {{has seen a}} remarkable progress over the past years. Numerous applications in basic and applied sciences prove its importance. The large spectral background which is a major detrimental factor in the conventional x-ray fluorescence technique, limits the element <b>detection</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the technique to ppm range. This spectral background reduces {{to a great extent}} in the TXRF technique due to the low extinction depth of the primary incident x-ray beam. In synchrotron radiation (SR) based TXRF measurements the spectral background reduces further because of the polarization of the synchrotron x-ray beam. Here, we discuss in detail the influence of synchrotron polarization on the spectral background in a fluorescence spectrum and its significance towards TXRF <b>detection</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> We provide a detailed theoretical description and show that how anisotropic scattering probability densities of the Compton and Elastic scattered x-rays depend on the scattering angle (θ) and azimuthal angle (ϕ) in the polarization plane of the SR beam...|$|R

50|$|Generally {{the goal}} of this type of sample cell is to improve <b>detection</b> <b>sensitivity</b> by {{increasing}} the total optical path length that travels through a small, constant sample volume. In principle, a longer path length results in greater <b>detection</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Focusing mirrors must be used to redirect the beam at each reflection point, resulting in the beam being restricted to a predefined space along a controlled path until it exits the optical cavity. The output of the cell is the input of an optical detector (a specialized type of transducer), which senses specific changes in the properties of the beam that occur during interaction with the test sample. For instance, the sample may absorb energy from the beam, resulting in an attenuation of the output that is detectable by the transducer. Two conventional multipass cells are called the White cell and Herriott cell. The presently popular and commercially used multipass cell also known and the Circular Multipass Cell are widely used in Trace gas sensing, Environmental and Industrial processes.|$|E
