25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game. But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell {{came to me and}} said there was trouble at the top of the order and asked if I would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} restarted in 2005, {{there was}} a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception. The popcorn moments were in there to justify the budget and bring target audiences into the theater. Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day, the theme of the film will be easier to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E
50|$|Recent solo shows include Who <b>I</b> <b>Think</b> <b>I</b> Am <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Walter Philips Gallery, Banff, Canada (2010). Terada has {{exhibited}} {{recently in the}} group show It Is What It Is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> National Gallery of Canada (2010).|$|R
6000|$|... "Of an Egyptian sorceress, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> low, broad forehead, the curling hair, {{the full}} lips, and the inscrutable {{look of the}} face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, therefore, {{that is out}} of the question. You {{will have}} a {{fortnight}} or three weeks in London, in all the bustle of their departure, and <b>I</b> declare <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last moment you will go with them." ...|$|R
2500|$|The City Council was {{considering}} whether to remove the stone {{in order to try}} and stop the bad luck which had struck the city. However Kevin Carlyon, the self-titled [...] "high priest of the British white witches" [...] proclaimed that such actions would give the curse more power. He commented that: [...] "A curse can only work if people believe in it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment the sculpture is a nice piece of history, but if the council destroys it, they would be showing their belief in the curse." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{ten years}} of living, recording, and touring together, Europe {{decided to take a}} break {{at the end of the}} 1992 tour. [...] "I {{remember}} in the tour bus afterwards we were talking about where the whole thing was going and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time the consensus of the band was we really felt ready for a break," [...] Tempest said, [...] "We felt that it was time to put some roots down and I was really into the idea of making my own solo album." [...] In that time, Tempest and Marcello released solo albums whilst the other members participated in several different projects and bands. In return, Europe was dropped from Epic Records.|$|E
2500|$|Evanescence paused their tour to {{take part}} in the Carnival of Madness Tour {{alongside}} Halestorm, Cavo, New Medicine and Chevelle. This tour began on July 31, 2012, in Springfield, Illinois, and ran through September 2, 2012, ending in Buffalo, New York. The Evanescence Tour resumed in October 2012 with stops in South America, Costa Rica and Panama. The tour wrapped with a series of shows in England, ending on November 9, 2012, in London's Wembley Arena. Lee stated the band plans to take an extended break after the tour, saying, [...] "At the end of any really long tour you need to get your head in order. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the run we'll go on a break for a while and figure things out." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Night Shades {{definitely}} has something for everyone. For me personally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we're <b>at</b> <b>the</b> point where {{people listen to}} mixes much more than they actually listen to full albums. I kind of want to make records that feel like they're mixtapes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be frightened, Myra," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{sure that}} it is nothing serious. It struck a rib and glanced off, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> worst it has only broken the bone. You go in and attend to your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{get used}} to it," [...] said the hero, simply. [...] "Hottest time <b>I</b> had <b>I</b> <b>think</b> was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{bombardment}} of Alexandria. I stood alone. All the men who hadn’t been shot down had fled, and the shells were bursting round me like—like fireworks." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind. This music is going to just ruin your life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} Mr. Starling quite well," [...] Arnold said. [...] "We met also, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Milan Hotel, a {{few minutes}} after the murder of Mr. Rosario." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{want to see}} {{you about}} a {{frontispiece}} to our first [...] "Clock" [...] volume, which will come out (<b>I</b> <b>think)</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of September, and about other matters. When shall we meet and where? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew <b>the</b> hounds met <b>at</b> Patten Brig, but Jim {{was sure}} they'd go down-stream!" [...] she cried breathlessly. [...] "They're coming up! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pool below the village! Get two poles--you'll find {{some in the}} tool-shed--and come along at once!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{here are}} the cards themselves!" [...] cried he; and he pulled a brown towel from {{something}} in {{the centre of the}} sideboard. Sure enough it was a pile of playing-cards--forty packs, <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> least--which had lain there ever since that tragic game which was played before I was born.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. Anne {{was born}} in the June month of {{eighteen}} hundred and twenty-seven--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he came <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of April or the beginning of May." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After all," [...] he said, [...] "it is {{possible}}--yes, it {{is possible}} that you may succeed. Adventures wait for us everywhere, if only we go about in a proper frame of mind. We will lunch, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Café Grand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Harold Smith {{has just}} joined the Government as Lord Petty Bag, and could, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> present moment, get this for asking. He cannot well refuse me, and, {{if you will}} say the word, I will speak to him. You had better come up yourself; but say the word 'Yes,' or 'No,' by the wires.|$|E
6000|$|He agreed eagerly to this: [...] "Yes! Yes! Let me begin. Helena met you, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station. Of course, I {{remember}} that; it only {{happened a}} few hours since. Well?" [...] he went on, with a change in his manner to parental pride, which it was pleasant to see, [...] "did you think my daughter a fine girl? I hope Helena didn't disappoint you?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{time that}} the old baronet might have written the letter for me, {{as he had been}} a friend of my father's in former days; but he did not, and I started for Ballyglass with no other {{introduction}} to any one in the county than that contained in Sir P-'s promise that I should soon know Mr. Thomas O'Conor.|$|R
60|$|But all the donkeys in Christendom, {{and most}} of the Egyptian boys, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door, and there is some noise going on, not to put it in {{stronger}} language.--We are about starting to the illustrious Pyramids of Egypt, and the donkeys for the voyage are under inspection. I will go and select one before the choice animals are all taken.|$|R
60|$|Matthew, therefore, and Levi or James, {{were both}} Publicans, and, as <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> called both <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time;6 were both Publican-Jews, and made by grace the apostles of Jesus Christ.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lord Hampstead, [...] "I am {{very fond}} {{of this kind of}} thing. That fox has broken, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other side of the cover." [...] Then he trotted off down a little lane between two loose-built walls, so narrow that there was no space for two men to ride abreast. His object at that moment was to escape Crocker rather than to look after the hounds.|$|E
6000|$|The next tale, {{entitled}} [...] "The Two Drovers," [...] I {{learned from}} another old friend, the late George Constable, Esq. of Wallace-Craigie, near Dundee, whom I have already introduced to my reader {{as the original}} Antiquary of Monkbarns. He had been present, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trial at Carlisle, and seldom mentioned the venerable judges charge to the jury, without shedding tears,--which had peculiar pathos, as flowing down features, carrying rather a sarcastic or almost a cynical expression.|$|E
60|$|With {{that word}} {{the wind blew}} out the banner fringe, and so {{suddenly}} that, though I saw the matter, I scarce knew how it was done, the whole host swarmed up and on, ladders, lifted, and so furiously went they, that they won the wall crest and leaped within the fort. Then the more part of the English, adread, as <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight of the Maid whom they had deemed slain, fled madly over the drawbridge into Les Tourelles.|$|E
60|$|DAISY. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{first moment}} I {{believed}} it. And then I {{thought it over}} and I knew it couldn't be true. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> you'd do anything underhand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lieutenant Gordon, I am {{shocked to}} hear that an officer of my {{regiment}} should gamble {{to such an extent}} as you have done. You will, of course, be called tomorrow. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> best, you will be advised to change into another regiment. I need not say that, after this exposure, the chits that you have given to Captain Sanders become null and void.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} certain," [...] {{returned}} Ada with a bashful simplicity {{that would have}} won my heart {{if she had not}} won it long before, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's waiting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord was so well {{satisfied}} with my services that {{he refused to}} be attended by any of my elders and betters in the profession. Little did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, that I had received {{the last of the}} favours which Fortune was to bestow on me. I enjoyed the confidence and goodwill of a man possessing boundless social influence; and I was received most kindly by the ladies of his family. In one word, at the time when my professional prospects justified the brightest hopes that I could form, sudden death deprived me of the dearest and truest of all friends--I suffered the one dreadful loss which it is impossible to replace, the loss of my mother. We had parted at night when she was, to all appearance, in the enjoyment of her customary health. The next morning, she was found dead in her bed." ...|$|E
60|$|The American Constitution is now, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{crisis of}} its severest trial. I {{conceive}} {{it to be}} by no means perfect, even for the wants {{of the people who}} use it; and I have already endeavored to explain what changes it seems to need. And it has had this defect-- that it has permitted a falling away from its intended modes of action, while its letter has been kept sacred. As I have endeavored to show, universal suffrage and democratic action in the Senate were not intended by the framers of the Constitution. In this respect the Constitution has, as it were, fallen through, and it is needed that its very beams should be restrengthened. There are also other matters as to which it seems that some change is indispensable. So much I have admitted. But, not the less, judging of it by the entirety of the work that it has done, I think that we are bound to own that it has been successful.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was not so}} with myself. Much of the {{information}} which Mr Whitlaw had unconsciously conveyed to me was quite new, for although I had, as a youth, read and commented on the late American war while it was in progress, I had not given to its details that amount of close study which is necessary {{to the formation of}} a reasonable judgment. At first I could not resist the conviction that my skipper must have been indulging in a small amount of exaggeration, especially when I reflected on the great strength and apparent invulnerability of such massive vessels as our Thunderer; but knowing the sedate and truthful character of Mr Whitlaw, I felt perplexed. Little did <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that I should live to see, and that within the year, the truth of his statements corroborated with my own eyes. I meditated long that night on war and its results, as well as the various processes by which it is carried on; and I had arrived at a number of valuable conclusions, which I would have given worlds {{to have been able to}} jot down at the moment, when I was overtaken by that which scattered them hopelessly to the winds: I fell sound asleep! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, my dear, for {{a pretty}} compliment. I can trust my memory. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> hinted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> obvious {{objections}} to an engagement. You and Carmina are cousins; and you belong to different religious communities. I may add that a man with your brilliant prospects has, in my opinion, no reason to marry unless his wife {{is in a position}} to increase his influence and celebrity. I had looked forward to seeing my clever son rise more nearly to a level with persons of rank, who are members of our family. There is my confession, Ovid. If I did hesitate on the occasion to which you have referred, I have now, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> told you why." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wappers {{permitted}} {{us to see}} his own painting-room. He is of {{the school}} of the great Flemish masters, and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> quite <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of his profession, in many of its leading points. It was curious to trace in the works of this young artist the effects of having Rubens and Vandyke constantly before him, corrected by the suggestions of his own genius. His style is something between the two; broader and bolder than Vandyke, and less robust than Rubens.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. It was {{a stupid}} question, Bertha; <b>I</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment that {{it is home to}} you, and that you have known no other since you were a little child. But to my mind it would be a dull sort of life to live here always." ...|$|R
