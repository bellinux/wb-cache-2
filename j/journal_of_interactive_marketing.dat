However, individual consumers differ in their predisposition to interact online with others. Whereas an impressive stream of research has investigated media interactivity, the existence of individual differences in the use of different online media, that is, differences in general online social interaction propensity, has so far received less research attention. An individual's predisposition to interact online affects many important consumer behaviors, such as online engagement and participation. Thus, in this paper, we propose and conceptualize general online social interaction propensity as a trait-based individual difference that captures the differences between consumers in their predisposition to interact with others in an online environment. Based on eight studies, we develop and validate a scale for measuring general online social interaction propensity and demonstrate its usefulness in understanding diversity in levels of engagement and in predicting online interaction behaviors. •Consumers differ in their predisposition to enter in online communication. •We conceptualize an individual difference trait termed GOSIP. •We empirically develop and validate a scale to measure GOSIP. •We show GOSIP's importance as antecedent of engagement and online behavior. •Interactive marketers can use GOSIP to assess consumer differences in online behavior...|$|E

In this study, an instrument for the measurement of perceived ubiquity reﬂecting the beneﬁts derived from continuity, immediacy, portability, and searchability is developed using a multiple stage approach. In the initial stage, perceived ubiquity is conceptualized through interdisciplinary perspectives as a multidimensional, 32 item eight factor construct. In the second stage, the original measurement is pretested on a student sample and recalibrated into a 16 item four factor instrument. In the third stage, general consumers are invited to complete a task in which they are asked to perform a search with a mobile device before rating the measurement items. A conﬁrmatory factor analysis produces a 12 item four factor instrument.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{convergence}} of online games and advertising {{in the form of}} "Advergames". As such, this topic discusses a relatively new arena in which businesses from many diverse industries are taking an interest in video games simply for their ability to serve as online advertising vehicles. Because it deals with an aspect of gaming that is having a growing impact in the business world, this paper is applicable to the "Industry and the Academy" theme of the DiGRA 2005 conference. [...] - The Internet offers us many novel ways to spend our idle time, and increasing numbers of Americans are taking advantage of these opportunities. A growing trend toward turning off the television and tuning in to the Internet is forcing many marketers to enter a relatively unexplored advertising arena where the best methods of reaching and influencing customers are as yet unknown. Studies have found that many Internet users spend their online time playing video games, a realization that has led some major marketers to launch into a new marketing format that merges games with advertisements into a hybrid form of branded entertainment called "Advergames". The advergame advertising format has a strong potential to overcome the weaknesses of previous forms of online advertising that marketers have been struggling with, such as banner ads and pop-ups. Studies investigating the viewing behavior of visitors to Websites have utilized eye-tracking devices to discover that the average individual looks at less than half of all banner advertisements to which they are exposed, a fact that appears to stem from an intentional avoidance of the ads (Dreze and Hussherr, 2003; Chan, Dodd, and Stevens, 2004). Advertisements that people purposely avoid viewing simply do not have an opportunity to make an impression. More intrusive advertising vehicles, such as pop-ups, {{have been found to be}} even less appreciated by online consumers. A recent study found that 35 percent of pop-up ads are completely ignored with 50 percent being closed before the ad has had the time to fully load onto the viewer‘s screen. In addition, this study found that these intrusive ad formats are regarded as distracting, irritating, and even insulting, resulting in very negative attitudes that have the potential to actually damage a viewer’s impression of a brand (Chan, Dodd, and Stevens, 2004). It is worth noting that negative consumer reactions to these forceful persuasion attempts is exactly what would be expected according to past research on reactance theory and advertising (Clee and Wicklund, 1980; Friestad and Wright, 1994). This theory and its supporting studies suggest that the more blatantly aggressive an advertisement is, the more likely viewers are to disregard the ad and to develop negative impressions of both the advertiser and the advertisement itself. Advergames, on the other hand, represent an advertising format that has a potential to overcome this resistance to marketing messages by providing consumers with an enjoyable and interactive experience. Studies of other interactive ad formats have found that interactivity and animation tend to produce positive attitudes (Raney, Arpan, Pashupati, and Brill, 2003; Dynamic Logic, 2003; Dynamic Logic, 2002). This enjoyable experience can be expected to result in positive feelings toward the advertised product and the advertisement itself, an affective reaction that has been found to influence brand attitudes and intentions to purchase the product (Brown and Stayman, 1992). In addition to providing an advertisement that consumers are likely to enjoy, building a video game around a marketing message offers several unique characteristics. First, the consumer that chooses to play an advergame does so by their own volition; it is something that they want to do (quite unlike looking at banner ads or pop-ups). A second unique characteristic is that exposure to an advergame involves active participation and interaction with the marketing message, something that cannot be accomplished via television, magazines, radio, etc. Also, players that enjoy an advergame will continue to expose themselves to the advertisement for as long as they are having fun. Depending on the quality of the game, this exposure can last from several minutes to the better part of an hour, a span of time much greater than can be achieved through traditional media (such as a 15 or 30 second television spot). This new advertising format appears promising, but little research has been conducted that proves its effectiveness or justifies its widespread adoption. This lack of evidence supporting its ability to generate brand equity has led to the research question, "Does the use of branded online games (a. k. a. Advergames) generate a higher rate of advertising recall than the use of traditional banner advertisements?" In order to shed some light on this question, an exploratory study of the relative merits of these two advertising mediums was conducted. A sample of online gamers played a branded advergame and an unbranded game that was coupled with a banner ad, and were then queried to determine their ability to remember the brands to which they had been exposed. Not surprisingly, the advergame yielded a much higher rate of recall than the banner advertisement (68 percent versus 16 percent, respectively). While the results were very positive, the study also resulted in the identification of several variables that future marketing research involving advergames will need to consider when developing a study design. These included the need for a sample that is as representative of the overall online game playing population as possible, exposing respondents to the advergame and the banner ad for equal lengths of time, and using an advergame and comparative media that are roughly equivalent in their entertainment value, and that have not been previously seen by respondents. In summary, this paper shows that advergames have a promising future as an Internet advertising vehicle. Interest in this medium can be expected to grow for many years to come as academics and marketers alike continue to explore its potential to solve the need for an effective method of reaching the vast and growing population of online consumers.

40|$|Introduction Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{familiar}} and congruent spokes-characters increase young children’s preference for healthy snacks (De Droog, Valkenburg, & Buijzen, 2010; De Droog, Buijzen, Opree, & Valkenburg, 2011; De Droog, Buijzen, & Valkenburg, 2012, De Droog, Buijzen, & Valkenburg, 2014). However, few studies have examined the impact of endorser-type on children’s relative preference for healthy over unhealthy foods and actual food consumption. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to investigate which type of endorsing character is superior in increasing young children’s (4 - 6 years old) relative preference for an endorsed healthy snack (mini-carrots) compared to a similar, yet unendorsed unhealthy snack (candy carrots). Prior experiments testing the processing fluency theory have shown that familiar and congruent marketing stimuli facilitate consumers’ advertising processing, which arouses positive affect that transfers to the brand (e. g. De Vries & Van Rompay, 2009; Reber, et al., 1998; Van Rompay, et al., 2010). Consequently, it was expected that children’s preference for, and consumption of a healthy snack over a similar unhealthy snack would significantly increase when the healthy snack is endorsed by familiar and/or congruent characters. Method These hypotheses were investigated using a 2 (mini-carrots vs candy carrots) x 2 (familiar vs unfamiliar endorser) x 2 (congruent vs incongruent endorser) x 2 (exposure-order) mixed design. The children were asked to evaluate both the mini- and candy carrots. The healthy snack consisted of sliced carrots presented in a transparent packaging featuring a sticker of one of the following pretested characters (N = 20) : Bobo the rabbit (familiar/congruent), Cars (boys) and Dora The Explorer (girls) (familiar/incongruent), an unfamiliar rabbit (congruent), and an unfamiliar monkey (incongruent). The unhealthy snack consisted of candy carrots presented in an unendorsed transparent packaging. The data were collected in 11 Dutch elementary schools during February and March 2015. A sample of 250 Dutch children between 4 and 6 years old were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the eight conditions (N = 250, 57 % girls, Mage = 4. 93, SD = 0. 76). The children were individually shown pictures of the different character-food combinations on a tablet. The healthy snack (mini-carrots) featured one of the endorsing characters, whereas the unhealthy snack (candy carrots) remained unendorsed. Children’s food liking and pester intentions were assessed using smiley-scales. After completing the online questionnaire, the children were ‘rewarded’ with two identical bowls filled with an equal amount of pre-counted sliced carrots and candy carrots. Children’s consumption was assessed by counting the amount of carrots eaten per child. Results A mixed ANCOVA was conducted with food liking as the dependent within-subjects variable, character-familiarity, character-congruence, and gender as between-participant factors, and age and level of hunger as covariates. Against expectations, the main effects of food type, character-familiarity, and character-congruence were not significant. The analysis revealed a significant negative relation between age and food liking (F(1, 242) = 5. 1, p =. 025; b = -. 62, p =. 004) for actual carrot slices, but not for candy carrots. With regard to pester intent, the main effect of food type was significant F(1, 239) = 4. 39, p =. 037). Children’s pester intentions were higher for candy carrots compared to carrot slices (Mcarrots = 2. 3, SD = 0. 91; Mcandy-carrots= 2. 35, SD =. 82, range = 1 - 3). Older children reported significantly lower pester intentions for carrot slices compared to younger children (F(1, 239) = 7. 06, p =. 008; b= -. 27, p = <. 0001). With regard to children’s actual carrot consumption, the mixed ANCOVA showed that children’s consumption did not differ significantly between actual carrots and candy carrots (F(1, 238) =. 55, p =. 461). However, the between-subjects effect of character-congruence was significant (F(1, 238) = 8. 48, p =. 004). Children ate significantly more carrots overall when the endorsing character was conceptually congruent (Mcongruent =. 56, SD =. 16, Mincongruent =. 49, SD =. 19, Mdiff = -. 064, SE =. 022, 95 % CI [- 1. 07 - -. 021]). Conclusion Against expectations, results revealed that pairing familiar and/or conceptually congruent endorsing characters with a healthy snack did not increase young children’s liking of, pester intentions for, and consumption of a healthy snack relative to a similar unendorsed, unhealthy snack. Overall, children consumed more carrots when the healthy carrot slices were endorsed by a matching character. These findings suggest that employing endorsing characters in order to increase children’s preference for healthy foods might actually backfire by stimulating children’s general snacking behavior.

40|$|Towards Understanding Consumer Processing of Negative Word-of-Mouth Communication: The Roles of Opinion Agreement and Organizational Response Chung Hun Lee School of Hospitality Management The Pennsylvania State University and David Cranage School of Hospitality Management The Pennsylvania State University ABSTRACT The {{proliferation}} of the Internet has {{given birth to}} a number of complaint Web Sites where dissatisfied and frustrated consumers can easily articulate their opinions and comments on products, services, or companies. Online consumer reviews can have strong effects on consumers’ evaluations in addition to product attribute information, especially when they are negative. Many organizations struggle with the question how to deal with online forums that discuss their products and services. Nevertheless, little attention has been directed to identifying the influence of online complaint on potential consumers’ behaviors as well as the influence of corporate response strategies to online complaints. In an attempt to bridge this gap, this study examines the process by which consumers integrate online complaint messages and attribute information into their service evaluations and how consensus in messages affects this process. Additionally, it will examine how a company’s response strategies to online complaints affect the perception of potential consumers on attribution as well as their evaluations about the company’s service. Keywords: online consumer reviews, opinion consensus, response strategies, attitude change. INTRODUCTION This study seeks to understand the process by which consumers integrate online critic opinions and assimilate information (i. e., electronic negative word-of-mouth communication) into their service evaluations and subsequent purchasing decisions. The study also will examine how critic consensus and organizational responses to critic opinions affect this process. This is an increasingly important research area because as the Internet and other information technologies have become a central platform for consumers’ daily activities, very large amounts of negative information about brands and companies have been generated and have become widely prevalent in the marketplace. The resulting negative impact on profitability has become devastating, especially in the hospitality industry. Nevertheless, there has been limited systematic academic and practical investigation into how consumers process negative information about the brands they like, and further translate it into attitude change. This research intends to start a theory-based stream of research addressing these issues. Based on this theoretical understanding of how consumers process negative information, we aim to develop organizational strategies for handling negative information. Prior research suggests that negative word of mouth (NWOM) has a significant detrimental effect on a company’s image, reputation, and sales (Herr et al., 1991). Never has this NWOM effect been as powerful as it is today. The expansion of the Internet has created a platform for broadcasting virtual opinions (or electronic WOM (eWOM) communication) to consumers, and for incrementally disseminating eWOM to a wider array of people (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004). Given the increasing possibility of consumers being exposed to negative eWOM about a company and its offerings, and the potential devastation it can have on a company’s reputation, market share, and profitability, {{it is very important to}} understand the following questions: How do consumers process NWOM and react to it? To what extent does NWOM damage positive attitudes towards a company and its offerings and purchasing confidence? How should a company respond to NWOM in order to preserve its reputation? SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATION OF STUDY Addressing these questions bridges research gaps that have not been adequately addressed regarding consumer behavior. First, although prior research has emphasized the impact of negative information about a company and its offerings on consumer purchasing decisions and company sales (Chevalier 2 ̆ 6 Mayzlin, 2006), few have attempted to identify the process by which consumers integrate negative information into product evaluation. Literature in public relations and publicity has addressed this issue to some extent, and a “negativity effect” has been discovered (e. g., Ahluwalia, Burnkrant, 2 ̆ 6 Unnava, 2000). That is, when presented with both positive and negative information during the evaluation process, consumers place more weight on the negative than the positive and shift their attitudes in the negative direction. Herr et al. (1991) argue that this effect may arise because consumers find the negative information to be more diagnostic, useful, and informative than the positive information for categorizing targets into evaluative categories, and because positive or less negative information is commonly provided for all products, including those of high-, average-, and low-quality (Skowronski 2 ̆ 6 Carlston, 1987). However, the question that needs to be addressed is whether the negativity effect found in the context of negative publicity can be also observed in the context of WOM communication. Although some consumer WOM researchers have found a stronger influence of NWOM on consumer brand evaluation (Ahluwalia, 2002) and on the purchase intentions of prospective consumers (Park 2 ̆ 6 Lee, 2009), it has been tested in conditions where consumers are given either positive or negative WOM, but not a mixture of both. This research will examine the negativity effect when a combination of positive and negative WOM is provided by manipulating the proportion of NWOM. Second, the Internet has created an online WOM platform where consumers share their opinions with other unknown customers. Compared to traditional face-to-face WOM communication, the online WOM platform has unique characteristics that may influence the way consumers process WOM and make purchasing decisions (Lee, Park, 2 ̆ 6 Han, 2008). For example, the online consumer review forum enables consumers to view both positive and negative WOM simultaneously from various sources. In addition, given that online consumer reviews are written and accumulated in the collection, they are measurable. That is, consumers are easily able to count the number of positive and negative opinions and evaluate the quality of products/service. These features of online WOM have opened a new research venue: opinion consensus and conformity effect. Current study pursues this research area by examining the effect of the proportion of NWOM regarding a company’s service on the consumer evaluation process and purchasing decisions in an online WOM communication environment. Third, few studies have been interested in how organizations should handle negative information. In service failure and recovery literature, organizational responses to negative situations (i. e., service failures and customer complaints) have gained a lot of attention as potential recovery strategies have been developed to soothe dissatisfied customers and prevent further negative consequences such as NWOM and switching behavior. However, work investigating how an organization’s response to NWOM influences potential customers while evaluating a company and deciding to purchase its product or service has been very limited. Recognizing the influence of WOM is important to marketing decisions regarding customer service, especially in regard to justifying expenditures on complaint handling, customer retention, and service recovery, as well as preventing potential customers from choosing other alternatives. Thus, this study seeks evidence of whether the organizational response to NWOM has a significant effect on the attitudes and purchasing probability of potential consumers. Specifically, we would like to know whether responding to an online review is more effective than not responding to it. And, if organizations choose to respond online to negative reviews, what constitutes an appropriate and effective response? This research has both academic and practical contributions. First, it proposes a model that facilitates an understanding of causal attribution in the online context by examining complaint messages as well as responses from both consumers and companies.
