40|$|We empirically {{examine the}} impact of trading {{activities}} on the liquidity of individual equity options measured by the proportional bid-ask spread. There are three main findings. First, the option return volatility, defined as the option price elasticity times the stock return volatility, has a much higher power in explaining the spread variations than the commonly considered liquidity determinants such as the stock return volatility and option trading volume. Second, after controlling for all the liquidity determinants, we find a maturity-substitution effect due to <b>expiration</b> <b>cycles.</b> When medium-term options (60 - 90 Â days maturity) are not available, traders use short-term options as substitutes whose higher volume leads to a smaller bid-ask spread or better liquidity. Third, we also find a moneyness-substitution effect induced by the stock return volatility. When the stock return volatility goes up, trading shifts from in-the-money options to out-of-the-money options, causing the latter's spread to narrow.

40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} for monitoring the respiratory {{process in which}} the gas flow rate and the frequency of respiration and <b>expiration</b> <b>cycles</b> can be determined on a real time basis. A face mask is provided with one-way inlet and outlet valves where the gas flow is through independent flowmeters and through a mass spectrometer. The opening and closing of a valve operates an electrical switch, and the combination of the two switches produces a low frequency electrical signal of the respiratory inhalation and exhalation cycles. During the time a switch is operated, the corresponsing flowmeter produces electric pulses representative of the flow rate; the electrical pulses being at a higher frequency than that of the breathing cycle and combined with the low frequency signal. The high frequency pulses are supplied to conventional analyzer computer which also receives temperature and pressure inputs and computes mass flow rate and totalized mass flow of gas. From the mass spectrometer, components of the gas are separately computed as to flow rate. The electrical switches cause operation of up-down inputs of a reversible counter.

40|$|Introduction: Model-based {{methods can}} be used to characterise patient-specific {{condition}} and response to mechanical ventilation (MV) during treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Conventional metrics of respiratory mechanics are based on inspiration only, neglecting data from the <b>expiration</b> <b>cycle.</b> However, it is hypothesised that expiratory data {{can be used}} to determine an alternative metric, offering another means to track patient condition and guide positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) selection. Methods: Three fully sedated, oleic acid induced ARDS piglets underwent three experimental phases. Phase 1 was a healthy state recruitment manoeuvre. Phase 2 was a progression from a healthy state to an oleic acid induced ARDS state. Phase 3 was an ARDS state recruitment manoeuvre. The expiratory time-constant model parameter was determined for every breathing cycle for each subject. Trends were compared to estimates of lung elastance determined by means of an end-inspiratory pause method and an integral-based method. All experimental procedures, protocols and the use of data in this study were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Liege Medical Faculty. Results: The overall median absolute percentage fitting error for the expiratory time-constant model across all three phases was less than 10 % for each subject, indicating the capability of the model to capture the mechanics of breathing during expiration. Provided the respiratory resistance was constant, the model was able to adequately identify trends and fundamental changes in respiratory mechanics. Conclusion: Overall, this is a proof of concept study that shows the potential of continuous monitoring of respiratory mechanics in clinical practice. Respiratory system mechanics vary with disease state development and in response to MV settings. Therefore, titrating PEEP to minimal elastance theoretically results in optimal PEEP selection. Trends matched clinical expectation demonstrating robustness and potential for guiding MV therapy. However, further research is required to confirm the use of such real-time methods in actual ARDS patients, both sedated and spontaneously breathing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} for the {{extraction}} of features from stationary stochastic processes {{has been applied to}} a medical detection problem. It illustrates a practical application of automatic time series modeling. Firstly, the model type and the model order for two time series prototype models are selected. The prototypes represent the lung noises of a single healthy subject, before and after the application of methacholine. Using the model error ME as a measure for the difference between time series models, new data can be divided into classes that belong to the prototype models for this person. The prototype models are obtained from a few <b>expiration</b> <b>cycles</b> under known conditions. This is sufficient to detect the presence of methacholine in new data of the same subject if he is able to maintain stationary conditions by following accurately the prescribed breathing pattern. It is not necessary to use the same model type and the same model order for the prototypes and for new data. Automatically and individually selected models for prototypes and data give a good detection of methacholine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that within-breath respiratory impedance measurements performed using the forced oscillation technique may help to noninvasively evaluate respiratory mechanics. We investigated the influence of airway obstruction on the within-breath forced oscillation technique in smokers and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} patients and evaluated the contribution of this analysis to the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS: Twenty healthy individuals and 20 smokers were assessed. The study also included 74 patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We evaluated the mean respiratory impedance (Zm) as well as values for the inspiration (Zi) and <b>expiration</b> <b>cycles</b> (Ze) at the beginning of inspiration (Zbi) and expiration (Zbe), respectively. The peak-to-peak impedance (Zpp=Zbe-Zbi) and the respiratory cycle dependence (&# 916;Zrs=Ze-Zi) were also analyzed. The diagnostic utility was evaluated by investigating the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 01888705. RESULTS: Airway obstruction increased the within-breath respiratory impedance parameters that were significantly correlated with the spirometric indices of airway obstruction (R=&# 8722; 0. 65, p 90 %). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude the following: (1) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease introduces higher respiratory cycle dependence, (2) this increase is proportional to airway obstruction, and (3) the within-breath forced oscillation technique may provide novel parameters that facilitate the diagnosis of respiratory abnormalities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} work, systolic time intervals and stroke volume were extracted through {{the processing of}} recorded mechanical cardiac vibrations from the sternum, seismocardiogram (SCG). These hemodynamic parameters were extracted based on the physiological characterization of SCG with different modalities including echocardiography, ballistocardiography, Doppler ultrasound, and finite element modelling. For the first time, an extensive evaluation of the SCG estimation of systolic time intervals compared to those from Doppler ultrasound and impedance cardiogram was performed (n= 25). It was shown that SCG can estimate pre-ejection period (p-value= 0. 16), left ventricular ejection time (p-value= 0. 93), and QS 2 (p-value= 0. 91). In a novel approach, the effects of respiration on SCG was studied on 45 participants. As {{the results of this}} study it was found that there is a difference between SCG cycles during inspiration and the ones during expiration (p-value< 0. 01). It was also shown that <b>expiration</b> <b>cycles</b> are more similar to each other compared to inspiration cycles. Based on this finding, a new averaging algorithm for SCG was proposed based on the consideration of the respiration effect on SCG. The previously defined IC point, isotonic contraction, on SCG was redefined to correspond to the point of maximum acceleration of blood in the aorta. This finding was confirmed using Doppler ultrasound (n= 23, r= 0. 85) and ultra low frequency ballistocardiography (n= 5, p-value= 0. 95) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Several {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} the high {{potential of the}} forced oscillation technique {{for the assessment of}} respiratory modifications related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, most of these studies did not employ within-breath analyses of the respiratory system. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze respiratory impedance alterations in different phases of the respiratory cycle of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and to evaluate their clinical use. METHODS: 39 individuals were evaluated, including 20 controls and 19 individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who experienced severe airway obstruction. Weevaluated the mean respiratory impedance (Zm) as well as values for inspiration (Zi) and <b>expiration</b> <b>cycles</b> (Ze), at the beginning of inspiration (Zbi) and expiration (Zbe). The peak-to-peak impedance (Zpp), and the impedance change (DZrs) were also analyzed. The clinical usefulness was evaluated by investigating the sensibility, specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: The respiratory impedance increased in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in all of the studied parameters (Zm, Zi, Ze, Zbi, Zbe, DZrs and Zpp). These changes were inversely associated with spirometric parameters. Higher impedanceswere observed in the expiratory phase of individualswith chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All of the studied parameters, except for DZrs (area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0. 8), exhibited high accuracy for clinical use (area under the receiver operating characteristic. 0. 90; Sensibility $ 0. 85; Sp $ 0. 85). CONCLUSIONS: The respiratory alterations in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be identified by the increase in respiratory system impedance, which is more evident in the expiratory phase. These results confirm the potential of within-breath analysis of respiratory impedance for the assessment of respiratory modifications related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{oscillation}} imposed {{onto the}} gill arches could modify the respiratory rhythm in the carp Cyprinus carpio.

When the gill arches were maximally abducted artificially at the end of inspiration or early in <b>expiration,</b> the breathing <b>cycle</b> was shortened. A slight lengthening occurred when maximal gill arch abduction fell {{during the second half of}} expiration or during the first half of inspiration.

30|$|In this work, {{we choose}} {{to focus on the}} {{pressure}} support mode since it is available in any device from the market and is the most often used mode at home [25]. This ventilation mode consists in a partial support provided by a positive pressure cycle ideally synchronized with patient’s breathing cycles. It offers numerous advantages among which {{the fact that it is}} often easily accepted by the patients [26]. This mode is labeled in various ways in the different ventilators we tested. Thus, it is mode “S” in the Trilogy 100 (Philips Respironics), the BiPAP A 40 (Philips Respironics), the S 9 VPAP ST (ResMed), the Stellar 100 (ResMed), and the SOMNOvent autoST (Weinmann). It is mode “PS” in the Elisée 150 (ResMed), and mode “PSV” in the Vivo 50 (Breas), the Monnal T 50 (Air Liquide Medical Systems) and the Smartair ST (Covidien). Typically, this mode is based on two phases, one with a high pressure during the inspiration and one with a low pressure during the <b>expiration.</b> One pressure <b>cycle</b> was therefore associated with a detection of the inspiratory effort that triggers the pressure rise from the low to the high pressure level, and a detection of the relaxation of the inspiratory demand for triggering the pressure release from the high to the low pressure level. This mode gives priority to the synchronization between the patient breathing cycles (here simulated by the mechanical lung) and the pressure cycles delivered by the ventilator. It is therefore necessary to introduce a terminology that clearly distinguishes the patient breathing cycles from the ventilator pressure cycles.|$|R
40|$|To date, image {{localization}} {{of mobile}} tumors prior to radiation delivery has primarily {{been confined to}} 2 D and 3 D technologies, such as fluoroscopy and 3 D cone-beam CT (3 D-CBCT). Due to the limited information from these images, larger volumes of healthy tissue are often irradiated {{in order to ensure}} the radiation field encompasses the entirety of the target motion. Since the overarching goal of radiation therapy is to deliver maximum dose to cancerous cells and simultaneously minimize the radiation delivered to healthy surrounding tissues, it would be ideal to use 4 D imaging to obtain time-resolved volume images of the tumor motion during respiration. 4 D-CBCT imaging has been previously investigated, but has not yet seen large clinical translation due to the obstacles of long acquisition time and large image radiation dose. Furthermore, 4 D-CBCT currently requires the use of external surrogates to correlate the patient's respiration with the image acquisition process. This correlation has been under question by a multitude of studies demonstrating the uncertainties that exist between the surrogate and the actual motion of the internal anatomy. Errors in the correlation process may result in image artifacts, which could potentially lead to reconstructions with inaccurate target volumes, thereby defeating the purpose of even using 4 D-CBCT. It is therefore the aim of this dissertation to initially highlight an additional limitation of using 3 D-CBCT for imaging respiratory motion and thereby reiterate the need for 4 D-CBCT imaging in the treatment room, develop a simple and efficient technique to achieve markerless, self-sorted 4 D-CBCT and finally to comprehensively evaluate its robustness across a variety of potential clinical scenarios with a digital human phantom. People often spend {{a longer period of time}} exhaling as compared with inhaling, and some do so in an extremely disproportionate manner. To demonstrate the disadvantage of using 3 D-CBCT in such instances, a dynamic thorax phantom was imaged with a large variety of simulated and patient-derived respiratory traces of ratios of time spent in the inspiration phase versus time spent in the expiration phase (I/E ratio). Canny edge detection and contrast measures were employed to compare the internal target volumes (ITVs) generated per profile. The results revealed that an I/E ratio of less than one can lead to potential underestimation of the ITV with the severity increasing as the inspiration becomes more disproportionate to the expiration. This occurs because of the loss of contrast in the inspiration phase, due to the fewer number of projections acquired there. The measured contrast reduction was as high as 94 % for small targets (0. 5 cm) moving large amplitudes (2. 0 cm) and still as much as 22. 3 % for large targets (3. 0 cm) moving small amplitudes (0. 5 cm). This is alarming because the degraded visibility of the target in the inspiration phase may inaccurately impact the alignment of the planning ITV with that of the FB-CBCT and thereby affect the accuracy of the localization and consequent radiation delivery. These potential errors can be avoided with the use of 4 D-CBCT instead, to form the composite volume and serve as the verification ITV for alignment. In order to delineate accurate target volumes from 4 D-CBCT phase images, it is crucial that the projections be properly associated with the patient's respiration. Thus, in order to improve previously developed 4 D-CBCT techniques, the basics of Fourier Transform (FT) theory were utilized to extract the respiratory signal directly from the acquired projection data. Markerless, self-sorted 4 D-CBCT reconstruction was achieved by developing methods based on the phase and magnitude information of the Fourier Transform. Their performance was subsequently compared to the gold standard of visual identification of peak-inspiration projections. Slow-gantry acquired projections of two sets of physical phantom data with sinusoidal respiratory cycles of 3 and 6 seconds as well as three patients were used as initial evaluation of the feasibility of the Fourier technique. Quantitative criteria consisted of average difference in respiratory phase (ADRP) and percentage of projections assigned within 10 % respiratory phase of the gold standard (PP 10). For all five projection datasets, the results supported feasibility of both FT-Phase and FT-Magnitude methods with ADRP values less than 5. 3 % and PP 10 values of 87. 3 % and above. Because the technique proved to be promising in the initial feasibility study, a more comprehensive evaluation was necessary in order to assess the robustness of the technique across a larger set of possibilities that may be encountered in the clinic. A 4 D digital XCAT phantom was used to generate an array of respiratory and anatomical variables that affect the performance of the technique. The respiratory variables studied included: inspiration to <b>expiration</b> ratio, respiratory <b>cycle</b> length, diaphragmatic motion amplitude, AP chest wall expansion amplitude, breathing irregularities such as baseline shift and inconsistent peak-inspiration amplitude, as well as six breathing profiles derived from cine-MRI images of three healthy volunteers and three lung cancer patients. The anatomical variables studied included: male and female patient size (physical dimension and adipose content), body-mass-index (BMI) category, tumor location, and percentage of the lung in the field-of-view (FOV) of the projection data. CBCT projections of each XCAT phantom were then generated. Additional external imaging factors such as image noise and detector wobble were added to select cases with different percentages of lung in the projection FOV to investigate any effects on the robustness. FT-Phase and FT-Magnitude were each applied and quantitatively compared to the gold standard. Both methods proved to be robust across the studied scenarios with ADRP 90 %, when incorporating minor modifications to region-of-interest (ROI) selection and/or low-frequency location to certain cases of diaphragm amplitude and lung percentage in the FOV of the projection (for which a method may have previously struggled). Nevertheless, in the instance where one method initially faltered, the other method prevailed and successfully identified peak-inspiration projections. This is promising because it suggests that the two methods provide complementary information to each other. To ensure appropriate clinical adaptation of markerless, self-sorted 4 D-CBCT, perhaps an optimal integration of the two methods can be developed. Dissertatio...|$|R
