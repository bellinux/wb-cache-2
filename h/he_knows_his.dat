5|$|Season one {{revolves}} around two main events: Coach Eric Taylor beginning {{as head coach}} and the injury and paralysis of star quarterback Jason Street {{in the first game}} of the season. Coach Taylor's career depends on his ability to get the Dillon Panthers to the state championship, despite the loss of Street. If the team suffers a losing streak, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> family will no longer be welcome in Dillon.|$|E
5|$|Dan {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with Shirley Benson (Robyn Moore), telling her that his wife, Pushpa, is dead. He takes her to a wedding as his guest, but Pushpa arrives, introducing herself and exposing Dan's lie. Shirley then breaks up with him. The Ferreiras help Shirley {{to deal with her}} neighbour from hell, Gavin Sharp (Steve Nicolson), which leads to Shirley and Ash becoming close and starting a secret relationship. Shirley is unhappy that Ash refuses to tell anyone about their relationship, as <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> father will be furious if he discovers them together. Ash reveals to Shirley that he is a compulsive gambler and he lost his house and ruined his marriage in the process; Dan had bailed him out. He says he owes his father everything and he is not willing to hurt him. Dan attempts to woo Shirley again, forcing her to confess her relationship with Ash. This causes friction between the Ferreiras, and Ash breaks up with Shirley to keep the peace.|$|E
25|$|Abrahams {{is badly}} beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> last {{chance for a}} medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is {{overcome}} that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams {{can get on with}} his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running. Before Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, Jackson Scholz, hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.|$|E

500|$|The Greene Knight {{tells the}} same story as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, with a few differences. Notably, the knight, here named [...] "Bredbeddle", is only wearing green, not green-skinned himself. The poem also states the knight has been asked by his wife's mother (not Morgan in this version) to trick Gawain. He agrees because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> wife is {{secretly}} in love with Gawain, and hopes to deceive both. Gawain falters in accepting a girdle from her, and the Green Knight's purpose is fulfilled in a small sense. In the end, he acknowledges Gawain's ability and asks to accompany him to Arthur's court.|$|E
500|$|While {{majoring in}} finance, Youkilis excelled {{as a player}} for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001. [...] "I take no credit", said Cleary. [...] "He coaches himself. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> swing. Any time we said {{anything}} to him, he was already a step ahead. He made the adjustments he had to make. I just think he's a really smart guy who had a great feel {{for what he had}} to do." [...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. [...] "He was kind of a square-shaped body, a guy [...] in a uniform didn't look all that athletic", Cleary said. [...] "He wasn't a tall, prospect-y looking guy. He looked chubby in a uniform. ... It wasn't fat. He was strong. [...] I think the body did scare some people away." ...|$|E

500|$|Joel Keller of TV Squad said {{he enjoyed}} seeing Ron {{stand up for}} the parks department, which proved that despite his hatred of government, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> {{co-workers}} well and is a good boss. Keller also praised Pamela Reed's performance and said she works well with Amy Poehler. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic said although he believed the no-dating policy was little more than an unnecessary device meant to create friction between Leslie and Ben, he enjoyed the lengths with which they were going to keep their relationship secret. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called [...] "The Bubble" [...] an excellent episode that went a long way in fleshing out the Leslie and Ben romance, but primarily set the scene for the superior [...] "Li'l Sebastian". Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said [...] "The Bubble" [...] was not as funny as some of the better third season episodes like [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] or [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party", but was nonetheless enjoyable and [...] "perfectly funny".|$|E
500|$|Virgil Hawkins is a fourteen-year-old {{who lives}} with his older sister Sharon, and his widowed father Robert in Dakota City. He attends high school with his best friend Richie Foley, and has a crush on a girl named Frieda. He also has a dispute with a bully named Francis, nicknamed [...] "F-Stop." [...] A gang leader named Wade {{recently}} helped Virgil, hoping to recruit him, but Virgil is hesitant, as <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> mother died in an exchange of gunfire between gangs. Wade eventually leads Virgil to a restricted area for a fight against F-Stop's crew, but it was interrupted by police helicopters. During the dispute with the police, chemical containers explode, releasing a gas that causes mutations among {{the people in the}} vicinity (This event was later known as [...] "The Big Bang"). As a result, Virgil obtains the ability to create, generate, absorb, and control electricity and magnetism—he takes up the alter-ego of [...] "Static". The gas also gives others in the area their own powers, and several of them become supervillains. The mutated people become meta-humans known as [...] "Bang Babies", and their mutations apparently spread to other people around them.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a full four stars, and {{considered}} {{it among the}} four best Allen films. He described it as having a [...] "terrible fascination that lasts all the way through". Empire magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it Allen's best of his last half a dozen films, and recommended it even {{to those who are}} not fans of the director. Reviewers in the United Kingdom were generally less favourable. Philip French, writing in The Observer, criticised Allen's grasp of British idiom and the film's lack of humour, especially considering that two comic actors from the UK were cast in minor roles. Also, he called the dialogue [...] "rather lumbering" [...] and said that [...] "the lexicons of neither the City financier nor the London constable are used convincingly." [...] Tim Robey, writing in The Daily Telegraph, disdained the claim that the film was Allen's return to form. Although he acknowledged that the consensus was stronger this time, he called it [...] "as flat-footed a movie as Allen has ever made, a decent idea scuppered by a setting – London – which he treats with the peculiarly tin-eared reverence of a visitor who only thinks <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> way around." [...] He called Johansson's character [...] "the chain-smoking mistress from hell", but said the tennis net analogy has an [...] "unexpectedly crisp payoff" [...] and that the last act was well handled. Reviewing for the BBC's website, Andy Jacobs awarded the film four stars out of five, and called it Allen's best film since Deconstructing Harry (1997). He also criticised some other British reviewers whose dislike, Jacobs stated, was {{due to the fact that}} Allen presented an agreeable portrait of middle class life in London. He also praised the performances by Rhys Meyers and Johansson.|$|E

The weakness is that– for a 'family audience'– he deliberately constrains his vocabulary along with the exuberant imagery and belligerence that made his reputation from the start." ...|$|E

Korede’s singing isn’t all that but <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> range and sticks to the script, another plus for the song. God Win is full of cheeriness and drive; a cool number, indigenous, original, repeat-worthy and all.” ...|$|E

As tools multiply, each is more ingeniously adapted to its own exclusive purpose. [...] So with the men that make the State. For the individual, concentration, and the highest development of his own peculiar faculty, is the only prudence. But for the State, it is variety, not uniformity, of intellectual product, which is needful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stravinsky was not {{the only}} {{composer}} whose modernist tendencies Glazunov disliked. Shostakovich mentioned Glazunov's attacks against the [...] "recherché cacophonists"—the elder composer's term for the newer generation of Western composers, beginning with Debussy. When Franz Schreker's opera Der ferne Klang was staged in Leningrad, Glazunov pronounced the opera [...] "Schreckliche Musik!"—Horrible Music. He also may have wondered occasionally whether he had played a role in spawning musical chaos. Once, while looking at a score of Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, he commented, [...] "It's orchestrated with great taste.... And <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> work.... Could it be that Rimsky and I influenced the orchestration of all these contemporary degenerates?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Proponents of {{the topic}} make their case in interviews; however, they often end up {{appearing}} fallacious or self-contradicting. For example, in [...] "Safety Hysteria", a manufacturer of [...] "radiation guards" [...] for mobile phones admits {{that there is no}} proven link between mobile phone radiation and brain cancer, but assures viewers that [...] "you can't be too safe" [...] (mobile phones use conventional radio waves for communication, which are non-ionizing radiation). When he states his background is in advertising, not medical science, it is implied that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> product is useless but exploits people's fears to turn a profit. A second consecutive interview with another proponent is often started with the phrase: [...] "And then there's this asshole..." ...|$|E
2500|$|At first glance, Noah Bennet {{appears to}} be an {{ordinary}} businessman who works at the Primatech Paper Company and lives in Odessa, Texas, {{with his wife and two}} children. However, he and his associates have actually traveled the world for a number of years investigating superhuman phenomena and tracking down people with these [...] "gifts." [...] Bennet claims that he assists them in learning to use their powers, although a flashback conversation between him and Thompson reveals that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> job is morally questionable and that it will often produce unintended consequences; in one episode, he plainly states that he is comfortable with being morally gray. Though he is a [...] "Company Man," [...] he deeply cares for his family and will do anything to protect them, particularly his adopted daughter Claire, and puts their safety above all else. He is also known as [...] "Glasses Man".|$|E
2500|$|In the film, {{the hotel}} {{possibly}} derives its malevolent energy from being built on an Indian burial ground. In the novel, {{the reason for}} the hotel's manifestation of evil is possibly explained by a theme present in King's previous novel Salem's Lot as well as Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House: a physical place may absorb the evils that transpire there and manifest them as a vaguely sentient malevolence. The film's Hallorann speaks to Danny about that phenomenon occurring at the Overlook. In the novel, Jack does a great deal of investigation of the hotel's past through a scrapbook, a subplot almost omitted from the film aside from two touches: a brief appearance of the scrapbook beside the typewriter, and Jack's statement to the ghost of Grady that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>his</b> face from an old newspaper article describing the latter's horrific acts. [...] Kubrick in fact shot a scene where Jack discovers the scrapbook but removed it during post-production, a decision which co-screenwriter Diane Johnson lamented.|$|E
