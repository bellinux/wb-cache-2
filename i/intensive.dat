5|$|Electron beam {{processing}} is used {{to irradiate}} materials in order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products. Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on <b>intensive</b> irradiation: e.g. <b>intensive</b> electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Intensives</b> are two-week periods, held twice a year, {{in which}} the school ends regular classes and allows {{students}} and teachers {{to focus on a}} single subject all day for these two weeks. Popular <b>intensives</b> include skiing and snowboarding (held annually with three teachers, due to demand), internships in the community, and out-of-state traveling groups. Travel <b>intensives,</b> though popular in theory, are often difficult to arrange due to high costs and the need for wide student interest. Historically <b>intensives</b> are conducted with low academic standards often consistently lack intellectual rigor and lack relation to the school's core curriculum.|$|R
5|$|Allocations {{will be made}} to firms who {{undertake}} {{activities that}} are deemed to be both 'trade-exposed' and 'emissions-intensive'. Moderately emissions <b>intensive</b> activities will receive allocations equal to 60% of the industry average for the financial years ending 2007, 2008 and 2009. Highly emissions <b>intensive</b> industries will receive allocations equal to 90% of the industry average for this period. Allocation per unit of output will decrease by 1.3% per year from 2013 (on an exponential basis rather than a summation basis).|$|E
5|$|Both <b>intensive</b> and free-range farming have {{animal welfare}} concerns. In <b>intensive</b> systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak {{trimming}} as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{auditioned for}} several dance {{programs}} in 1999, and each made her {{an offer to}} enroll in its summer program. She performed with ABT {{as part of its}} 1999 and 2000 Summer <b>Intensive</b> programs. By {{the end of the first}} summer, she was asked to join the ABT Studio Company. Her mother insisted that she finish high school, and so Copeland returned to California for her senior year, even though ABT arranged to pay for her performances, housing accommodations and academic arrangements.

40|$|Atmospheric {{deposition}} of mercury (Hg) {{is a major}} process that contributes mercury loadings in ecosystems resulting in the bioaccumulation of mercury in fish and other wildlife that has prompted public health concerns. Although methods for measuring mercury that is wet deposited have been well studied, there are limited established methods for directly measuring dry {{deposition of}} atmospheric mercury. A new method using a turf surrogate surface (TSS) technique was developed to address limitations in published dry deposition collection methods. This method was deployed {{on a large scale}} for the first time during measurement <b>intensives</b> conducted as part of a Hg Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) project in Florida, USA. Wet and dry deposition of mercury were measured at 15 sites in Florida in 2009 and 11 sites in 2010. The dry deposition of mercury measured during the month-long <b>intensives</b> ranged from 0. 6 μg/m 2 to 2. 1 μg/m 2. Wet deposition of mercury measured during the month-long <b>intensives</b> ranged from 1. 5 μg/m 2 to 6. 9 μg/m 2. A North-South spatial gradient was observed for wet deposition of mercury; however, dry deposition of mercury displayed more general variability...|$|R
