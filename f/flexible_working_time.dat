40|$|Peak Hour Avoidance is a {{relatively}} new Dutch mobility management measure. To reduce congestion frequent car drivers are given a financial reward for reducing the proportion of trips that they make during peak hours on a specific motorway section. Although previous studies show that employers are not eager to support mobility management measures, employers are nevertheless an important stakeholder. They can provide their employees with alternatives such as other travel times, work locations or travel modes and encourage their use. This paper investigates the attitudes of Dutch employers towards Peak Hour Avoidance. Exploring the factors that influence these attitudes may help to fully utilise employer support. The data from 103 employers were collected through a web questionnaire. A structural equation model on the employer support for Peak Hour Avoidance was estimated. The results demonstrate that the size of the organisation and sector only have an indirect effect on the support for Peak Hour Avoidance. Results reveal that most support for Peak Hour Avoidance can be expected from organisations who feel responsible for influencing the commuting behaviour of employees, that have human resource managers with a positive attitude towards Peak Hour Avoidance, with <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>times</b> and that have already implemented mobility management measures. The largest contribution to PHA that can be expected from employers is providing employees with <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>times</b> and encouraging employees to fully utilise this option as an alternative for driving in peak hours.

Unions are critical of this development and point at contraproductive effects of specialisation and large scale companies. Employers favour entrepeneurship and competition. They point at the advantages of clustering of expertise that would lead to higher revenues. However, also employers see labour market shortages threatening the sector in the near future as a result of a growing demand for care and a shrinking labour population. Therefore they strive at labour conditions that are in conformity with the market. They also emphasize that a market conform salary will not be enough to deal with the labour shortages to come. Technical and social innovation will be necessary too. Continuous vocational training is seen as a key component in these policies. However, competition at local level empedes solid education policies, for no company wants to educate its personnel for their neighbours.

An integrated input-output model is developed and applied {{to assess the impact of}} an increase in car sharing to 10 % of the licence holders in Germany until 2020 on pollution, production, sectoral changes, employment, job qualification, working conditions, and regional industrial concentration. The modelling approach complies with the idea of a life-cycle assessment, since indirect effects from inter-sectoral production relations are also taken into account. The scenario results indicate that increased car sharing leads to small production gains since the reductions in the losing sectors such as car producers, garages, oil processing, or insurance services, are more than compensated by the production increases in the winning sectors such as car sharing services or public transportation. Since labour intensity is higher in the winning sectors than in the losing sectors, car sharing also leads to higher employment. In addition, increased car sharing tends to require average job qualifications but more <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> It further results in a regionally more evenly distributed industry structure, but some regions face considerable pressure for adjustment. The shift in the modal split in favour of public transportation results in emission reductions for most, but not all pollutants.

The way in which contemporary employment arrangements and their health consequences are addressed in empirical research is mostly based on the contract-related or employment instability dimension. A broader conceptual approach including various important characteristics of the degrading of employment conditions and relations is needed. /nOBJECTIVE: The general objective {{of this paper is}} to empirically test a new multidimensional construct for measuring precarious employment in an existing database. Special focus is on the social distribution of precarious employment. METHODS: A subsample of 21, 415 participants in the EU- 27 from the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey- 2005 was analysed. A cross-sectional study of the social distribution of precarious employment was conducted through the analysis of proportional differences according to gender, social class and credentials for the European Union as a whole and within each country. The 8 dimensions of the employment precariousness construct were represented by 11 indicators. RESULTS: In general, women, workers without supervisory authority, those with fewer credentials, and those living in Eastern and Southern European countries suffer the highest levels of precarious employment. Exceptionally, men, workers with supervisory authority and those with the highest credentials suffer the highest levels of long working hours, schedule unpredictability and uncompensated <b>flexible</b> <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This article offers the first validation for an innovative multidimensional conceptualisation of employment precariousness applied to the analysis of existing survey data, showing the unequal distribution of precarious employment across the European labour force.
