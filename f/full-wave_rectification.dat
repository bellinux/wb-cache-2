25|$|A full-wave bridge {{rectifier}} converts {{the whole of}} the input waveform to one of constant polarity (positive or negative) at its output.

There {{is a large}} AC ripple voltage component at the source frequency for a half-wave rectifier, and twice the source frequency for a full-wave rectifier. [...] Ripple voltage is usually specified peak-to-peak. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter.

2500|$|An {{aspect of}} most {{rectification}} {{is a loss}} from the peak input voltage to the peak output voltage, caused by the built-in voltage drop across the diodes (around 0.7 V for ordinary silicon p–n junction diodes and 0.3 V for Schottky diodes). Half-wave rectification and <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification</b> using a center-tapped secondary produces a peak voltage loss of one diode drop. Bridge rectification has a loss of two diode drops. This reduces output voltage, and limits the available output voltage if a very low alternating voltage must be rectified.

50|$|Note {{that this}} does not hold true for more complex waveforms. A {{sawtooth}} wave contains both even and odd harmonics, for instance. After even-symmetric <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification,</b> it becomes a triangle wave, which, other than the DC offset, contains only odd harmonics.|$|E
50|$|With {{three-phase}} {{alternating current}} and <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification,</b> six anodes {{were used to}} provide a smoother direct current. Three phase operation can improve {{the efficiency of the}} transformer as well as providing smoother DC current by enabling two anodes to conduct simultaneously. During operation, the arc transfers to the anodes at the highest positive potential (with respect to the cathode).|$|E
50|$|When used in {{its most}} common application, for {{conversion}} of an alternating current (AC) input into a direct current (DC) output, it {{is known as a}} bridge rectifier. A bridge rectifier provides <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification</b> from a two-wire AC input, resulting in lower cost and weight as compared to a rectifier with a 3-wire input from a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification</b> both {{halves of}} the AC {{waveform}} are utilised. The cathode {{is connected to the}} + side of the DC load, the other side being connected to the center tap of the transformer secondary winding, which always remains at zero potential with respect to ground or earth. For each AC phase, a wire from each end of that phase winding is connected to a separate anode [...] "arm" [...] on the mercury-arc rectifier. When the voltage at each anode becomes positive, it will begin to conduct through the mercury vapor from the cathode. As the anodes of each AC phase are fed from opposite ends of the centre tapped transformer winding, one will always be positive with respect to the center tap and both {{halves of the}} AC Waveform will cause current to flow in one direction only through the load. This rectification of the whole AC waveform is thus called <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification.</b>|$|E

Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form {{this can be}} just a reservoir capacitor or smoothing capacitor, placed at the DC output of the rectifier. There is still an AC ripple voltage component at the power supply frequency for a half-wave rectifier, twice that for full-wave, where the voltage is not completely smoothed.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{practical}} envelope detectors {{use either}} half-wave or <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification</b> {{of the signal}} to convert the AC audio input into a pulsed DC signal. Filtering is then used to smooth the final result. This filtering is rarely perfect and some [...] "ripple" [...] {{is likely to remain}} on the envelope follower output, particularly for low frequency inputs such as notes from a bass guitar. More filtering gives a smoother result, but decreases the responsiveness; thus, real-world designs must be optimized for the application.|$|E
5000|$|Rectifiers may use a {{three-phase}} {{source to}} produce a six-pulse DC output. The output of such rectifiers is much smoother than rectified single phase and, unlike single-phase, does not drop to zero between pulses. Such rectifiers {{may be used for}} battery charging, electrolysis processes such as aluminium production or for operation of DC motors. [...] "Zig-zag" [...] transformers may make the equivalent of six-phase <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification,</b> twelve pulses per cycle, and this method is occasionally employed to reduce the cost of the filtering components, while improving the quality of the resulting DC.|$|E

The controls are 'Balance' (volume), 'Expander' (fuzz amount), a two position 'tone' switch, and an on/off footswitch on top. There are two unique features of this device that set it apart from other distortion and fuzz pedals. The first is that the <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification</b> of the circuit produces an upper octave {{as well as a}} slight lower octave. This also gives the sound a lot of compression and gives a mild ring modulator effect. The second unique feature is a tone switch that engages a 1kHz filter that [...] "scoops" [...] the mids, giving a very fat, almost bassy tone, unique to this circuit.|$|E

50|$|Rectification is the {{translation}} of the raw EMG signal to a single polarity frequency (usually positive). The purpose of rectifying a signal is to ensure the raw signal does not average zero, due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components. The two types of rectification of signals refer to {{what happens to the}} EMG wave when it is processed. These types include full length frequency and half length. Full length frequency adds the EMG signal below the baseline (usually negative polarity) to the signal above the baseline making a conditioned signal that is all positive. This is the preferred method of rectification because it conserves all signal energy for analysis, usually in the positive polarity. Half length rectification deletes the EMG signal below the baseline. In doing so, the average of the data is no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical analyses. The only difference between the two types of rectification is that <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectification</b> takes the absolute value of the signal array of data points.|$|E
