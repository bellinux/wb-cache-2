The spirit {{at the beginning of}} the <b>distillation</b> ( [...] <b>heads)</b> and end (tails [...] ) is usually removed to avoid light and heavy alcohols and aromatics.

50|$|Round-bottom flasks {{often have}} one or more conically tapered ground glass joint openings, or necks. Conventionally, these joints at the flask necks are outer joints. Other adapters, such as <b>distillation</b> <b>heads</b> and vacuum adapters, are made with joints that fit in with this convention. If a flask or other {{container}} has an extra outer ground-glass joint on it, which needs to be closed off for an experiment, there are often conically tapered inner ground-glass stoppers for that purpose. In some cases, small hook-like glass protrusions may be fused onto {{the rest of the}} glass item near a joint to allow an end loop of a small spring to be attached, so the spring helps keep joints temporarily together. The use of a special very small size of conically tapered fitting for glass, plastic, or metal parts called a Luer fitting or adapter has become more widespread. Originally, Luer fittings were used to connect the hub of a needle to a syringe. Where the use of ground glass presents a problem, as in the production or distillation of diazomethane (which may explode on contact with rougher surfaces), equipment with smooth glass joints may be used.|$|R

[...] Rhazes refuted Aristotle's theory of four classical elements {{for the first time and}} set up the firm foundations of modern chemistry, using the laboratory in the modern sense, designing and describing more than twenty instruments, many parts of which are still in use today, such as a crucible, cucurbit or retort for <b>distillation,</b> and the <b>head</b> of a still with a delivery tube (ambiq, Latin alembic), and various types of furnace or stove.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Nowadays {{purification}} {{of ethanol}} {{from the head}} and intermediate impurities is done with the selection of fractions of fusel alcohol and fusel oil from the <b>distillation</b> column and <b>head</b> and intermediate fractions impurities from condenser Epuration column operating accord-ing to the hydro-selection method. Due to this the fraction contains at least 13 % ethyl alcohol, resulting in a reduced yield of the final product. Distillation of these fractions in the known acceleration columns requires increased consumption of heating steam for 6 - 8 kg / dal and increasing installation metal content. In this paper we investigate the process of distillation fraction from the condenser of Epura-tion column, fusel alcohol from the distillation column and subfusel liquid layer from the decanter, which is fed on a plate of supply of new accelerating column (AC), which operates on Epuration technology with the supply of hydro-selection water on the top plate and has in its composition concentration, boiling and stripping parts, a dephlagmator, a condenser, a boiler. Material balance equations of the column were obtained and ethyl alcohol concentration on its plates were determined by them. Having converted the material balance equations, we determined the dependences for the impurities ratio being drawn from the accelerating column with the Luther flows and ethyl alcohol fraction. Then we received the equation for determining the proportion of impurities taken from the column condenser with fraction. These calculations proved that the studied impurities are almost completely selected with this faction, ethyl alcohol content of it being 0. 14 % of the hourly output...|$|R
30|$|Grain {{samples were}} {{evaluated}} for 2 -AP concentration by synchronization distillation and extraction method (SDE) combined with GCMS-QP 2010 Plus (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) {{as described by}} Huang et al. (2012). Briefly, Collidine (2, 4, 6 -trimethylpyridine) (Sigma, Switzerland), {{was used as an}} internal standard. 10  g of finely ground grain was transferred into a 500  mL round-bottom flask containing 145  mL purified water; 5  mL of 0.914  μg∙mL− 1 internal standard was then added. A steam <b>distillation</b> continuous extraction <b>head</b> was attached to the flask, and the flask was heated at 150 °C by an oil bath pot, ZKYY (Guangzhou, China). Attached to the other head of the steam distillation continuous extraction instrument, diethyl ether (35  mL) was used as the solvent in a 500  mL round-bottom flask, and the flask was heated at 42 °C by a water bath pot, HH- 2 (Jiangsu, China). During isolation, the steam distillation continuous extraction was maintained at 10 °C by a cold water circulation machine, YKKY-LX- 300 (Beijing, China). The isolation was performed for 35  min. The ether extract was then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered (0.22  μm filter paper, Shimadzu, Japan), and then directly used to measure 2 -AP concentrations with the GCMS-QP 2010 Plus method as described in Huang et al., (2012). The GCMS-QP 2010 Plus working conditions were as followings: gas chromatograph equipped with a Restek Rxi- 5  ms (Shimadzu, Japan) silica capillary column (30  m[*]×[*] 0. 32  mm[*]×[*] 0. 25  μm). The auto injector was AOC- 20 i, SPL 1. High purity helium gas (99.999 %, Guangzhou Gases Co., LTD, China) was the carrier gas at the flow rate of 2.0  mL∙min− 1. The temperature of the GC oven was 40 °C (1  min), increased at 2 °C∙min− 1 to 65 °C and held at 65 °C for 1  min, and then increased to 220 °C at 10 °C∙min− 1, and held at 220 °C for 10  min. The ion source temperature was 200 °C. Under these conditions, the retention time of 2 -AP was 7.5  min. 2 -AP content was expressed as μg∙kg− 1. The relative content of the aroma compounds were identified {{on the basis of their}} mass spectra by comparing the spectra with the records of the NIST library.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} work, several {{significant improvements}} in the measurement of distillation curves for complex fluids were introduced. The modifications to the classical measurement provide for (1) temperature and volume measure-ment(s) of low uncertainty, and most important, (2) a composition-explicit data channel {{in addition to the}} usual temperature–volume relationship. This latter modification is achieved with a new sampling approach that allows precise qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of each fraction, on the fly. In the new approach, the distillation temperature is measured in two locations. The temperature is measured in the usual location, {{at the bottom of the}} take-off in the <b>distillation</b> <b>head,</b> but it is also measured directly in the fluid. We have further modified our developmental instrument to incor-porate a model predictive temperature controller. In response to either an equation-of-state calculation or a previous distillation curve, the programma-ble temperature controller increases the fluid temperature to achieve a con-stant mass flow rate of vapor through the <b>distillation</b> <b>head.</b> This approach eliminates the aberrations that one typically encounters in the data due to fluctuations in distillation rate, often referred to as hesitation. Thus, we can collect data from two temperature channels: one a true state point measure-ment (measured directly in the fluid) and the other comparable to previous data (measured in the head).

40|$|This {{research}} {{intent to}} extract essential oils from the pandan leaves {{and to develop}} a car fragrance from pandan leaves extract. To obtain data, this research employed an experiment. The experiment involved steam distillation method. We used 500 g of pandan leaves in a 500 mL round bottomed flask as the distilling pot. The round bottom flask was placed in a heating mantle with temperature at 2 °C. Enough water was added so that the distilling pot is about 2 / 3 full. Besides that, a small hot plate was used as the heat source. A Claisen connecting tube was used to connect the distilling pot to the <b>distillation</b> <b>head.</b> The Claisen was wrapped with the parafilm to keep it hot during the distillation. The heat was adjusted so the distilling rate equals about 20 drops per minute. The overall results indicated about 150 mL of distillate were collected and 0. 75 mL of essential oils was obtained. The essential oils was tested by using filter paper that absorbed the pandan fragrance in was placed in Petri dish to test the longer of the smell retains. For further research in this scope of study we could analyze the compound responsible for insect repellent properties because pandan leaves can act as insect repellent...|$|E
