5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E

25|$|According to the Talmud {{women are}} {{generally}} exempted from obligations that <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> {{at a certain}} time. Orthodox authorities have generally interpreted this exemption due to women's higher spiritual level and therefore a lack of need to connect to God at specific times, since they are always connected to God. In accordance with the general exemption from time-bound obligations, most Orthodox authorities have exempted women from performing evening prayers (Maariv), but most believe that women are obligated to pray Shacharit and Mincha, the morning and afternoon prayers, respectively, when possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, NBC {{broadcast}} a live production in color of Peter Pan, a new Broadway musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie's beloved play, on the Producers' Showcase anthology series, The first such telecast of its kind, the broadcast starred the musical's entire original cast, led by Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard in a dual role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It {{was so successful}} that NBC restaged it as a live {{broadcast a}} mere ten months later; in 1960, long after Producers' Showcase had ended its run, Peter Pan, {{with most of the}} 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped so that it would no longer <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> live on television.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart was}} a major prize for {{transplant}} surgeons. But over and above rejection issues, the heart deteriorates within minutes of death, so any operation would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> at great speed. The development of the heart-lung machine was also needed. Lung pioneer James Hardy attempted a human heart transplant in 1964, but when a premature failure of comatose Boyd Rush's heart caught Hardy with no human donor, he used a chimpanzee heart, which beat in his patient's chest for approximately one hour and then failed. The first success was achieved on 3 December 1967, by Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town, South Africa. Louis Washkansky, the recipient, survived for eighteen days amid what many saw as a distasteful publicity circus. The media interest prompted a spate of heart transplants. Over a hundred were performed in 1968–1969, but almost all the people died within 60 days. Barnard's second patient, Philip Blaiberg, lived for 19 months.|$|E

500|$|Throughout society, {{circumcision}} {{is often}} considered for {{reasons other than}} medical need. Public health advocates of circumcision consider it to have a net benefit, and therefore feel that increasing the circumcision rate is an ethical imperative. They recommend performing the procedure during the neonatal period when it is less expensive and has a lower risk of complications. While studies show there is a modest epidemiological benefit to circumcision, critics argue that the number of circumcisions that would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> would yield an overall negative public health outcome due to the resulting number of complications or other negative effects (such as pain). Pinto (2012) writes [...] "sober proponents and detractors of circumcision agree that there is no overwhelming medical evidence to support either side." [...] This type of cost-benefit analysis is highly dependent on the kinds and frequencies of health problems in the population under discussion and how circumcision affects those health problems.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, karma in Hinduism {{may mean}} an activity, an action or a materialistic activity. Often with the {{specific}} combination it takes specific meanings, such as karma-yoga or karma-kanda means [...] "yoga or actions" [...] and [...] "path of materialistic activity" [...] respectively. Yet another example is Nitya karma, which describes rituals which <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> daily by Hindus, such as the Sandhyavandanam which involves chanting of the Gayatri Mantra.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{anastomosis}} heals, {{it forms}} scar tissue, which naturally tends to shrink ("contract") over time, making the opening smaller. This {{is called a}} [...] "stricture". Usually, the passage of food through an anastomosis will keep it stretched open, but if the inflammation and healing process outpaces the stretching process, scarring may make the opening so small that even liquids can no longer pass through it. The solution is a procedure called gastroendoscopy, and stretching of the connection by inflating a balloon inside it. Sometimes this manipulation may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> more than once to achieve lasting correction.|$|E

[...] Adults with CP were less likely to get routine reproductive health screening as of 2005. [...] Gynecological examinations may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> under anesthesia due to spasticity, and equipment is often not accessible. Breast self-examination may be difficult, so partners or carers may have to perform it. [...] Women with CP reported higher levels of spasticity and urinary incontinence during menstruation in a study. [...] Men with CP have higher levels of cryptorchidism at the age of 21.|$|E
2500|$|The use of psychosurgery was {{narrowed to}} {{a very small number}} of people for {{specific}} indications. Egas Moniz performed the first leucotomy, or lobotomy in Portugal in 1935, which targets the brain's frontal lobes. This was shortly thereafter adapted by Walter Freeman and James W. Watts in what is known as Freeman–Watts procedure or the standard prefrontal lobotomy. From 1946, Freeman developed the transorbital lobotomy, using a device akin to an ice-pick. This was an [...] "office" [...] procedure which did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> in a surgical theatre and took as little as fifteen minutes to complete. Freeman is credited with the popularisation of the technique in the United States. In 1949, 5,074 lobotomies were carried out in the United States and by 1951, 18,608 people had undergone the controversial procedure in that country. One of the most famous people to have a lobotomy was the sister of John F. Kennedy, Rosemary Kennedy, who was rendered profoundly intellectually disabled as a result of the surgery.|$|E
2500|$|The trouble though is, {{that this}} productive/unproductive {{distinction}} {{is not easily}} made in practice, given changes in the market, in social-organizational efficiency, and in production techniques, {{and it does not}} necessarily {{have anything to do with}} whether a worker produces something tangible or not. What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, technical efficiency and financial efficiency are not necessarily the same thing at all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory about these issues, with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since much depends on the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable input-output relationship which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each specific service is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy. For example, a teacher is replaced with an instruction video.|$|E

These 700 trains stop about 5000 times in the twenty-four hours, and of course they start the same number of times. The empty trains and engines have also to stop and start. We have on the line upwards of 1000 signals, including the telegraphic signals and auxiliaries. Those signals have to be raised and lowered 10,000 times in the twenty-four hours. There are on our line 1700 pairs of points, which have to be opened and shut, to be cleaned, oiled, and attended to, above 5000 times in the day. In {{addition to}} all this there are the operations of shunting, carriage-examining, greasing, and other things in connexion with trains which involve operations amounting to nearly 6000 in number.

60|$|It is {{insisted that}} their {{presence}} would injure and displace white labor and white laborers. If there ever {{could be a}} proper time for mere catch arguments that time surely is not now. In times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves? If they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of labor would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed.</b> The freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably for a time would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor.|$|E
