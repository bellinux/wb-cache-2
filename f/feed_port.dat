The carrying handle, which had been removed from the Mk 46, was reintegrated on the Mk 48 to assist the replacement of hot barrels without use of other equipment, such as heat-resistant gloves; the handle can be folded down when not in use. As with the Mk 46, the Mk 48 Mod 0 does not have an M249-type magazine <b>feed</b> <b>port,</b> in order to save weight.

5000|$|SP-8 {{internals}} {{are identical}} to those of an Ion, with a few minor differences. First, the SP-8's regulator is canted 15 degrees forward; the Ion's is vertical. The SP-8's pressure gauge is mounted on the right, unlike the Ion (and almost all other markers) which has the gauge on the left. The SP-8 ships with a straight [...] "blade" [...] trigger, while the Ion has a curved [...] "wave" [...] trigger. Finally, the SP-8's breech section is drilled for a right-hand feed tube (so that top-mounted accessories such as scopes will not be blocked by the feed tube or hopper), while the Ion is set up for traditional vertical feed. The SP-8 is thus forced to use a plastic 45-degree elbow adapter to mount a hopper, which (because it is prone to frequent breakage) is a criticized feature. The Ion, by contrast, has a threaded vertical <b>feed</b> <b>port</b> that accepts all standard Impulse-threaded feednecks.

5000|$|The Sterling submachine gun is {{constructed}} entirely {{of steel and}} plastic and has a shoulder stock, which folds underneath the weapon. There is an adjustable rear-sight, which can be flipped between 100 and 200 yard settings. Although of conventional blowback design firing from an open bolt, there are some unusual features: for example, the bolt has helical grooves cut into the surface to remove dirt and fouling {{from the inside of}} the receiver to increase reliability. There are two concentric recoil springs which cycle the bolt, as opposed to the single spring arrangement used by many other SMG designs. This double-spring arrangement significantly reduces [...] "bolt-bounce" [...] when cartridges are chambered, resulting in better obturation, smoother recoil and increased accuracy. Additionally, the Sterling uses a much-improved (over the Sten) 34-round curved double-column feed box magazine, which is inserted into {{the left side of the}} receiver. The magazine follower, which pushes the cartridges into the <b>feed</b> <b>port,</b> is equipped with rollers to reduce friction. The bolt feeds ammunition alternately from the top and bottom of the magazine lips, and its fixed firing pin is designed so that it does not line up with the primer in the cartridge until the cartridge has entered the chamber.|$|E
5000|$|The Remington 788 has two {{distinguishing}} design features. The {{first is}} the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles. The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The bolt pictured is a pre-1975 locking model from a [...]308 Winchester caliber rifle. The locking bolt requires the safety {{to be in the}} [...] "fire" [...] or [...] "off" [...] position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged. The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt-action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening {{in the bottom of the}} receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well. When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent <b>feed</b> <b>port,</b> and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength. These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter. A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in the demand of wireless communications, the limited and valuable frequency spectrum has become congested in the lower frequency bands. Several methods {{can be used to}} overcome these problems. Novel techniques based on ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communications operating in the 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz can be used to overlay our existing users and thereby reusing spectrum. Spectrum can be used more efficiently by employing diversity or MIMO systems and finally multibanded systems can access and use more systems. In this thesis we propose antenna solutions for each of these new techniques. UWB antennas based on planar monopole are investigated with 75 % fractional bandwidth and miniaturized size. Then, a dual band, dual diversity Sierpinski gasket antenna with two <b>feed</b> <b>ports</b> as well as a single band, triple diversity rectangular patch antenna with three <b>feed</b> <b>ports</b> are presented.

40|$|With the {{advances}} in wireless communication systems, antennas with different shapes and design have achieved great demand and are desirable for many uses such as personal communication systems, and other applications involving wireless communication. This {{has resulted in}} different shapes and types of antenna design {{in order to achieve}} different antenna characteristic. One attractive approach to the design of antennas is to suppress or attenuate harmonic contents due to the non-linear operation of the Radio Frequency (RF) front end. The objectives of this work were to investigate, design and implement antennas for harmonic suppression {{with the aid of a}} genetic algorithm (GA). Several microstrip patch antennas were designed to operate at frequencies 1. 0, 1. 8 and 2. 4 GHz respectively. The microstrip patch antenna with stub tuned microstrip lines was also employed at 1. 0 and 1. 8 GHz to meet the design objectives. A new sensing patch technique is introduced and applied in order to find the accepted power at harmonic frequencies. The evaluation of the measured power accepted at the antenna <b>feed</b> <b>port</b> was done using an electromagnetic (EM) simulator, Ansoft Designer, in terms of current distribution. A two sensors method is presented on one antenna prototype to estimate the accepted power at three frequencies. The computational method is based on an integral equation solver using adaptive surface meshing driven by a genetic algorithm. Several examples are demonstrated, including design of coaxially-fed, air-dielectric patch antennas implanted with shorting and folded walls. The characteristics of the antennas in terms of the impedance responses and far field radiation patterns are discussed. The results in terms of the radiation performance are addressed, and compared to measurements.

40|$|Industrial {{production}} of titanium occurs via the batch-wise reduction of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) with a reducing metal, being magnesium in the Kroll process, or sodium in the Hunter process. In {{the search for}} low cost titanium, the CSIR is developing a continuous process to produce titanium powder directly via metallothermic reduction of TiCl 4 in molten salt, dubbed the CSIR-Ti process. The move to a continuous process has been attempted {{by a number of}} organizations, but was until now always met with failure, due in no small part to challenges inherent in the process chemistry. The reaction between TiCl 4 and the reducing metal can occur directly, when TiCl 4 or any titanium sub-chlorides present, comes into contact with suspended or dissolved reducing metal. The reaction can also occur indirectly, without any physical contact between the reacting species, via an electronically mediated mechanism. The reaction mechanism via electronic mediation can cause TiCl 4 to react at the outlet of the <b>feed</b> <b>port,</b> rapidly causing blockages of the TiCl 4 feed line. The electrical conductivity of the metal reactor can also cause the electronically mediated reaction to favour the formation of titanium sponge on the reactor walls and internals, rather than titanium powder. Various methods were investigated to overcome the problem of blockages in the TiCl 4 feed line, e. g. mechanical removal, sonic velocities, dilution of the TiCl 4 and the use of ceramic feed lines.
