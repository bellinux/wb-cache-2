5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was {{the divide}} between ideal and nonideal theory, which he understands as a way political theory {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves as a challenge to abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic.</b> The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E

25|$|In {{theory of}} hearing physiology, the {{traveling}} wave (TW) of Von Bekesy, resulted from an acoustic surface {{wave of the}} basilar membrane into the cochlear duct. His theory pretended to explain every feature of the auditory sensation owing to these passive mechanical phenomena. Jozef Zwislocki, and later David Kemp, showed that that <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> and that active feedback is necessary.|$|E

25|$|The New York City Department of Health handles {{enforcement}} of rat infestation problems in New York City. Local authorities in New York have long recognized that eliminating rats {{from the city}} <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic,</b> but have made various efforts to control their prevalence. The approach has traditionally been reactive: after receiving complaints of infestation, officials would commence control efforts at that site by placing rodent poison, traps, or contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|Theoretically, an {{electric}} dipole {{is defined by}} the first-order term of the multipole expansion, and consists of two equal and opposite charges infinitely close together. This <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic,</b> as real dipoles have separated charge. However, because the charge separation is very small compared to everyday lengths, the error introduced by treating real dipoles like they are theoretically perfect is usually negligible. The direction of dipole is usually defined from the negative charge towards the positive charge.|$|E

25|$|Ramsey {{states that}} investors {{can get a}} 12% average annual return {{and this is the}} number he uses in {{financial}} analyses. Critics state that using an average annual return rate is misleading and that the compound annual growth rate is a better measurement when planning investments. Most individuals are unaware of this difference. Critics have also stated that a 12% return <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic.</b> According to the Motley Fool, following Ramsey's calculations could cause individuals to be seriously under-invested for retirement.|$|E
25|$|As a {{nurse in}} a {{hospital}} ward, Lavinia speaks to wounded soldiers and prisoners of war in Washington, specifically asking about her brother, Isaac, who was imprisoned for assaulting a fellow government official. She had hoped that they had seen or heard from him {{while they were in}} the prison camps. The Washington officials ignore her plea to free Isaac. Lavinia is only able to speak to the president on Isaac's behalf because of the intervention of a man, Dr. Norval's friend, Mr. Sinclair. Lavinia then realizes that her belief in being able to voice her opinions equally with men <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The EIB is {{presently}} implemented as a circular ring consisting of four 16 bytes wide unidirectional channels which counter-rotate in pairs. When traffic patterns permit, each channel can convey {{up to three}} transactions concurrently. As the EIB runs at half the system clock rate the effective channel rate is 16 bytes every two system clocks. At maximum concurrency, with three active transactions {{on each of the}} four rings, the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth is 96 bytes per clock (12 concurrent transactions * 16 bytes wide / 2 system clocks per transfer). While this figure is often quoted in IBM literature it <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> to simply scale this number by processor clock speed. The arbitration unit imposes additional constraints which are discussed in the Bandwidth Assessment section below.|$|E

25|$|Parks and Recreation {{focuses on}} Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy {{director}} of the Parks and Recreation Department in the fictional Indiana town of Pawnee. Local nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) demands that a construction pit in the abandoned lot beside her house be filled in after her boyfriend, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), fell in and broke his legs. Leslie promises to turn the pit into a park, despite resistance from the parks director Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), an anti-government libertarian. City planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) – for whom Leslie harbors romantic feelings – pragmatically insists the project <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> due to government red tape, but nevertheless secretly convinces Ron to approve the project. Leslie and her staff, including the sarcastic underachieving materialist Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) and the uninterested intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), try encouraging community interest in the pit project, but meet resistance. Later, Ann becomes furious to learn Andy had his cast removal postponed for two weeks so Ann would pamper him longer. Meanwhile, after a blind date for Leslie set up by her mother that ended horribly, a drunken Leslie and Mark share a kiss at the pit. Mark falls into the pit, and is quickly rescued by Leslie, Ann, and Andy.|$|E

Several days later, while they are lying in bed, Asmoro shows Adjeng that [...] "Lintah" [...] had been {{published}} in Kompas. Adjeng's mother, aware of the story's autobiographical nature, is furious and, after going to Adjeng's apartment, blames everything on Adjeng's father abandoning them.|$|E

500|$|Biological {{taxonomy}} is a sub-discipline of biology, and {{is generally}} practiced by biologists known as [...] "taxonomists", though enthusiastic naturalists are also frequently {{involved in the}} publication of new taxa. The work carried out by taxonomists is crucial for the understanding of biology in general. Two fields of applied biology in which taxonomic work is of fundamental importance are the studies of biodiversity and conservation. Without a working classification of the organisms in any given area, estimating the amount of diversity present <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic,</b> making informed conservation decisions impossible.|$|E
500|$|In her video series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games (2013–2017), feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian criticises Resident Evil for sexualising its {{alternate}} costumes for women, citing as {{an example}} Valentine's pirate costume in the game Resident Evil: Revelations (2012). She also cites Valentine's movement in the game {{as an example}} of female characters who walk in an overly sexualised manner. Valentine's first appearance in the film Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) is of her legs in a miniskirt, and the camera frequently follows her from behind. Commentators have noted that her body shape <b>is</b> <b>unrealistic</b> and does not reflect her physical training, and she was the only member of her team in the original game not to wear a bulletproof vest. Video-game journalist Bob Mackey described her miniskirt outfit in Resident Evil 3 (1999) as an [...] "embarrassing relic" [...] from a period that catered to teenage boys.|$|E
