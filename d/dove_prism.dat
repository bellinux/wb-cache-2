50|$|<b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> have an {{interesting}} property that when they are rotated along their longitudinal axis, the transmitted image rotates at {{twice the rate of}} the prism. This property means they can rotate a beam of light by an arbitrary angle, making them useful in beam rotators, which have applications in fields such as interferometry, astronomy, and pattern recognition.|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods to}} measure the OAM of light include the {{rotational}} Doppler effect, systems based on a <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> interferometer, optical transformations, {{the measure of the}} spin of trapped particles, and the study of diffraction effects from apertures.|$|E
50|$|Lesso and Padgett (1999) and Moreno et al. (2003, 2004) {{found that}} there is a change in the state of {{polarization}} of a beam of light on passing through a rotated <b>dove</b> <b>prism.</b> Polarization rotation in the infrared has been known for much longer. (Johnston 1977) The polarization-transforming properties of dove prisms are of particular interest because they can influence the signal measurement of the scientific instrument.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> {{is a type}} of {{reflective}} prism which is used to invert an image. Dove prisms are shaped from a truncated right-angle prism. A beam of light entering one of the sloped faces of the prism undergoes total internal reflection from the inside of the longest (bottom) face and emerges from the opposite sloped face. Images passing through the prism are flipped, and because only one reflection takes place, the image is inverted but not laterally transposed.|$|E

50|$|The optical tracker {{unit was}} made up of a {{stationary}} lower section and a rotating upper section. The lower section housed the operator controls, while the upper section housed the tracking optics. The operator's optical system was a modified telescope containing a <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> to prevent the image 'toppling' as the optics rotate in azimuth. This system meant that, unlike a periscope, the operator did not have to move in order to track the target. The upper section also contained a separate missile tracking system that was slaved to the operator's optics, based on a television camera optimized for the IR band.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclovergence {{can also}} be evoked by cyclodisparity of the visual field; the cyclodisparity can be {{introduced}} by dove prisms. Here, use is made {{of the fact that}} a pair of dove prisms rotate an image optically if they are arranged one after the other and with an angular displacement relative to each other. Conversely, the range of cyclovergence-based cyclofusion can be trained using dove prisms that actively rotate the field of view: [...] "The patient fixates a vertical line target, and the <b>dove</b> <b>prism</b> is rotated in the direction to increase the action of the insufficient muscle while fusion is maintained." ...|$|E

40|$|We reexamine {{the thought}} {{experiment}} and real experiment of Vaidman et al., by placing <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> in the nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer arms. In those previous works, {{the criterion of}} whether a single photon was present, or not, was {{the presence of a}} "weak trace", indicating the presence of a nonzero weak value. This was verified by slightly varying the mirror angle at a given frequency, which was then detected on a position sensitive detector at the oscillation frequency. We show the presence of the <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> gives identical weak values everywhere to the previous configuration because the prisms change neither the path difference, nor the mode profile in the aligned case. Nevertheless, the same slight variations of the interferometer mirrors now give a signal at the first mirror of the nested interferometer. We can interpret this result as a misaligned optical interferometer, whose detailed response depends on the stability of the elements, or as the detector coupling to a nonzero effective weak value.

A sandwich of two such Dove-prism sheets that inverts both transverse components of the ray direction is a ray-optical approximation to the interface between two media with refractive indices +n and â€“n. We demonstrate the simulated imaging properties of such a Dove-prism-sheet sandwich, including a demonstration of pseudoscopic imaging...|$|R

We have considered nondiffracting Bessel beams of order from 0 to 3, produced by means of suitable binary-amplitude computer-generated holograms and carrying an OAM per photon directly proportional to the beam order. The effectiveness of the OAM division multiplexing technique has been experimentally verified by monitoring the output ports of a demultiplexing interferometer with rotated <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> in the arms...|$|R

30|$|In this experiment, we {{consider}} two images {{which are a}} measurement of spatial light intensity. We aim at studying {{the effect of the}} <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> on the width of an optical beam. Dove prisms are being extensively used in many physical settings that make use of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light (see [28] and references therein). The use of Dove prisms with highly focused beams requires some correcting elements whose characteristics can be determined though the influence of the <b>Dove</b> <b>prism.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Annular Groove Phase Mask (AGPM) is a {{vectorial}} vortex phase mask. It {{acts as a}} {{half-wave plate}} with a radial fast axis orientation operating in the mid infrared domain. When placed at {{the focus of a}} telescope element provides a continuous helical phase ramp for an on axis sources, which creates the orbital angular momentum. Thanks to that phase, the intensity of the central source is canceled by a down-stream pupil stop, while the off axis sources are not affected. However due to experimental conditions the nulling is hardly perfect. To improve the null, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer containing <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> differently oriented can be proposed to sort out light based on its orbital angular momentum (OAM). Thanks to the differential rotation of the beam, a Ï€ phase shift is achieved for the on axis light affected by a non zero OAM. Therefore the contrast between the star and its faint companion is enhanced. Nevertheless, due the <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> birefringence, the performance of the interferometer is relatively poor. To solve this problem, we propose to add a birefringent wave-plate in each arm to compensate this birefringence. In this paper, we will develop the mathematical model of the wave front using the Jones formalism. The performance of the interferometer is at first computed for the simple version without the birefringent plate. Then the effect of the birefringent plate is be mathematically described and the performance is re-computed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} the orbital angular momentum division multiplexing in optical fibre. Two optical vortices carrying well-definite values of orbital angular momentum, with topological charges equal to 0 and 1, respectively, are multiplexed in a few-mode fibre and then demultiplexed after a propagation of 200 m. The two vortices are discriminated {{by means of a}} Mach-Zehnder interferometer with mutually 90 Â°-rotated <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> in the two different arms, showing an inter-modal crosstalk lower than - 10 dB. This demultiplexing scheme can be generalized to a higher number of vortices and it is all-optical, without the need of electronic post-processing. The proposed orbital angular momentum division multiplexing technique is very promising for increasing the capacity of the fibre-optic transmission systems in an energy-saving efficient way...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{coordination}} of head tilt, ocular counterroll and vertical vergence is maintained by adaptive mechanisms; the desired outcome being clear single vision. A disruption or imbalance in otolith-ocular pathways {{may result in}} diplopia which stimulates these adaptive processes. In the present experiment, <b>dove</b> <b>prisms</b> were used to create cyclodisparities that varied with head tilt about a naso-occipital axis (roll). A stimulus for incyclovergence was presented with the head rolled 45 Â° {{to one side and}} a stimulus for an excyclovergence was presented with the head rolled 45 Â° to the other side. At the end of 1 h of training, all subjects demonstrated a change in open-loop cyclovergence that would help to correct for the cyclodisparities experienced during the closed-loop training period. The change appeared to be a simple gain change in the ocular counterroll of one or both eyes...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{polarization}} changes introduced by a rotated <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> on the linearly polarized light, using the Jones calculus and the exact ray trace analysis. The state of polarization changes from the linear to a mildly elliptical one when a {{plane wave front}} passes through a rotated Dove prism: its semi-major axis is nearly parallel to the input plane of polarization, for any angle of prism rotation. The interferogram contrast remains high for all shearing angles in spite of polarization changes when the <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> is incorporated into a rotational shearing interferometer. These results are confirmed experimentally...|$|E

Continuous horizontal and vertical light beams are alternately transmitted by means of a rotating <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> to the reflector assembly. A vertically reciprocating reflector interrupts the continuous light beams and converts these to discrete horizontal and vertical light beam images transmitted at spaced intervals along the path. A second rotating <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> rotates the vertical images to convert them to a second series of horizontal images while the first mentioned horizontal images are left unrotated and horizontal. The images are recorded on a film...|$|E

40|$|The {{rotational}} Doppler {{shift of}} a photon with {{orbital angular momentum}} Â±â„“Ä§ is shown to be an even multiple of the angular frequency Î© of the reference frame rotation when photon is reflected from the phase-conjugating mirror. We consider the one-arm phase-conjugating interferometer which contains N <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> or other angular momentum altering elements rotating in opposite directions. When such interferometer {{is placed in the}} rotating vehicle the Î´Ï‰= 4 (N+ 1 / 2) â„“Â·Î© rotational Doppler shift appears and rotation of the helical interference pattern with angular frequency Î´Ï‰ / 2 â„“ occurs. The accumulation of angular Doppler shift via successive passage through the N image-inverting prisms is due to the phase conjugation, for conventional parabolic retroreflector the accumulation is absent. The features of such a vortex phase conjugating interferometry at the single photon level are discussed. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to referred journa...|$|R
40|$|Efficiently discriminating beams {{carrying}} different orbital {{angular momentum}} (OAM) is of fundamental importance for various applications including high capacity optical communication and quantum information processing. We design and experimentally verify a distinguished method for effectively splitting different OAM-carried beams by introducing <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> in a ring cavity. Because of rotational symmetry broken of two OAM-carried beams with opposite topological charges, their transmission spectra will split. When mode and impedance matches between the cavity and one OAM-carried beam are achieved, this beam will transmit through the cavity, and other beam will be reflected without being destroyed their spatial shapes. In this case, the cavity acts like a polarized beam splitter. The transmitting beam can be selected at your will. The splitting efficiency can reach unity if the cavity is lossless and it completely matches with the beam. Beams carry multi-OAMs can also be effectively split by cascading ring cavities.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using optical vortices with different values of topological charge l, and hence with different {{values of the}} orbital angular momentum (OAM), for mode-division multiplexing in optical fibres is here investigated. Two OAM modes with l equal to 0 and 1, respectively, are multiplexed in a few-mode fibre and then demultiplexed after a fibre propagation of 200 m. Such modes are spatially separated at the two output ports of a Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer with mutually 90 Â°-rotated <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> in the two arms. It is also shown how to generalize this demultiplexing scheme, which is all-optical, passive and in principle without splitting losses, {{in order to deal}} with a higher number of vortices propagating in the fibre. Therefore the proposed mode-division multiplexing technique based on OAM modes is very promising for increasing the capacity of fibre-optic transmission systems in an energy-saving efficient way, without the high power consumption of modal demultiplexing exploiting real-time electronic post-processing...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree of}} freedom of orbital angular {{momentum}} (OAM) is an important resource in high-dimensional quantum information processing, as the quantum number of OAM can be infinite. The <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> (DP) is a most common tool to manipulate the OAM light, such as in interferometers. However, the <b>Dove</b> <b>prism</b> does not preserve the polarization of the photon states and decreases the sorting fidelity of the interferometer. In this work, we analyze the polarization-dependent effect of the DP on single-path Sagnac interferometers. The results are instructive to quantum information processing with OAM light. We also proposed a modified single-path beam splitter Sagnac interferometer (BSSI), of which the sorting fidelity is independent on input polarization and can be 100 % in principle. The single-path BSSI is stable for free running. These merits are crucial in quantum information processing, such as quantum cryptography. Comment: 9 pages and 6 figures.

40|$|Single photons with orbital angular {{momentum}} (OAM) have attracted substantial attention from researchers. A single photon can carry infinite OAM values theoretically. Thus, OAM photon states {{have been widely used}} in quantum information and fundamental quantum mechanics. Although there have been many methods for sorting quantum states with different OAM values, the nondestructive and efficient sorter of high-dimensional OAM remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we propose a scalable OAM sorter which can categorize different OAM states simultaneously, meanwhile, preserving both OAM and spin {{angular momentum}}. Fundamental elements of the sorter are composed of symmetric multiport beam splitters (BSs) and <b>Dove</b> <b>prisms</b> with cascading structure, which in principle can be flexibly and effectively combined to sort arbitrarily high-dimensional OAM photons. The scalable structures proposed here greatly reduce the number of BSs required for sorting high-dimensional OAMstates. In view of the nondestructive and extensible features, the sorters can be used as fundamental devices not only for high-dimensional quantum information processing, but also for traditional optics.
