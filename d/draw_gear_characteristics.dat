40|$|The U. S. East Coast pelagic {{longline}} fishery {{has a history}} of interactions with marine mammals, where animals are hooked and entangled in longline gear. Pilot whales (Globicephala spp.) and Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) are the primary species that interact with longline gear. Logistic regression was used to assess the environmental and <b>gear</b> <b>characteristics</b> that influence interaction rates. Pilot whale inter-actions were correlated with warm water temperatures, proximity to the shelf break, mainline lengths greater than 20 nautical miles, and damage to swordfish catch. Similarly, Risso’s dolphin interactions were correlated with geographic location, proximity the shelf break, the length of the mainline, and bait type. The incidental bycatch of marine mammals is likely associated with depredation of the commercial catch and is increased by the overlap between marine mammal and target species habitats. Altering <b>gear</b> <b>characteristics</b> and fishery practices may mitigate incidental bycatch and reduce economic losses due to depredation. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the vehicle {{dynamics}} caused by the forces exchanged, through buffers and <b>draw</b> <b>gears,</b> by consecutive vehicles on a curve. The results have been obtained by adding a buffers/draw gears contact model on an existing multibody code, previously developed by the authors. The multibody code manages rigid bodies connected by elastic and rigid constraints; the wheel/rail contact model is three dimensional and employs an elastic constraint among wheel and rail. The wheel/rail contact is managed by means of a numerical model called TOAM (third order approximation method). Numerical tests and experimental validations of the proposed model are here presented, considering a train made by three vehicles, running on an S shaped curve, subjected to parametric compressive forces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{temperature}} of rubber or rubber-metal springs {{is liable to}} increase under cyclic loading, due to hysteresis losses and low rubber thermal conductivity. This well-known phenomenon, called a heat build-up, is {{the primary reason for}} rubber aging. A temperature increase within the rubber compound leads to degradation of its physical and chemical properties, its stiffness increase and its damping capability loss. An extensive heat build-up can be a major concern during the accelerated fatigue testing of rubber-metal springs as it alters the spring properties during the testing procedure and can cause permanent damage leading to the testing results unreliability. The paper presents a case study of the heat generation prediction in the rubber-metal spring of railway <b>draw</b> <b>gear</b> during dynamic testing in accordance with UIC Code 827 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Rubber {{is a very}} {{flexible}} material with many desirable properties Which enable its broad use in engineering practice. Rubber or rubber-metal springs are widely used as anti-vibration or anti-shock components in technical systems. Rubber-metal springs are usually realized as a bonded assembly, however especially in shock absorbers, {{it is possible to}} realize free contacts between rubber and metal parts. In previous research it authors was observed that friction between rubber and metal in such case have a significant influence on the damping characteristics of shock absorber. This paper analyzes the development process of rubber or rubber-metal shock absorbers realized free contacts between the constitutive parts, starting from the design, construction, testing and operation, with special emphasis on the development of rubber-metal springs for the buffing and <b>draw</b> <b>gear</b> of railway vehicles...|$|R

40|$|A truly "industrial" French fishery {{does not}} exist in the Mediterranean. The fishing {{activity}} in this area is much closer to what is generally called "artisanal" or "coastal" fishery. Out of an approximate total about 7000 fishermen, more than 5000 work on small boats of less than 12 metres long. The small-scale fishery is the most complex part of the system. Many interactions exist that often induce conflicts between the different components of the fleet (competition for the resource exploitation and for the space utilization). Present knowledge of the demersal stocks shows that they are in general fully exploited (and in some cases, overexploited). More recent analysis, takes into account possible changes in the relative sizes of the fleets, under several hypothesis of changes of <b>gear</b> <b>characteristics,</b> by means of multispecific and multigear models.
