50|$|<b>Diampromide</b> {{produces}} similar {{effects to}} other opioids, including analgesia, sedation, dizziness and nausea, and {{is around the}} same potency as morphine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diampromide</b> is an opioid {{analgesic}} from the ampromide family of drugs, related to other {{drugs such as}} propiram. It was invented in the 1960s by American Cyanamid, and {{can be described as}} a ring-opened analogue of fentanyl.http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/ectoc/echet98/pub/028/index.htm ...|$|E

[...] It {{is listed}} under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled {{in most countries}} {{in the same fashion}} as is morphine.

5000|$|Phenampromide is an opioid {{analgesic}} from the ampromide family of drugs, related to other {{drugs such as}} propiram and <b>diampromide.</b> It was invented in the 1960s by American Cyanamid Co. Although never given a general release, it was trialled and 50mg codeine â‰ˆ 60mg phenampromide. Tests on the 2 isomers showed {{that all of the}} analgesic effects were caused by the (S) isomer. In the book [...] a 4-benzyl group added to the piperidine-ring produces a drug some x60 morphine. When overlaid with the most potent isomer of 3-methylfentanyl, the 2 compounds overlay perfectly. This is of academic interest only since the synthetic complexity is beyond clandestine drug manufacturers.|$|E
