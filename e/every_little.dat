5|$|After Joseph Stalin's death, {{the process}} of destalinization {{prompted}} debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc. Nikita Khrushchev's speech On the Personality Cult and its Consequences had wide implications outside the Soviet Union and in other communist countries. In Poland, {{in addition to the}} criticism of the cult of personality, popular topics of debate centered on the right to steer a more independent course of 'local, national socialism' instead of following the Soviet model down to <b>every</b> <b>little</b> detail; such views were seen in discussion and critique by many Polish United Workers' Party members of Stalin's execution of older Polish communists from Communist Party of Poland during the Great Purge.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one of {{the most}} notable synesthetes is Solomon Shereshevsky, a newspaper reporter turned celebrated mnemonist, who was discovered by Russian neuropsychologist, Alexander Luria, to have a rare fivefold form of synesthesia. Words and text were not only associated with highly vivid visuo-spatial imagery but also sound, taste, color, and sensation. Shereshevsky could recount endless details of many things without form, from lists of names to decades-old conversations, but he had great difficulty grasping abstract concepts. The automatic, and nearly permanent, retention of <b>every</b> <b>little</b> detail due to synesthesia greatly inhibited Shereshevsky from understanding much of what he read or heard.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1850s, Svend Grundtvig initiated a systematic recording of Danish folklore - the stories were told and written down in <b>every</b> <b>little</b> village in Denmark – but Bournonville did not credit Grundtvig as his source of inspiration, even though today Grundtvig is probably considered to be the person who made the most effort to preserve the wealth of Danish national folk tradition. Bournonville found his inspiration in a collection of national Danish songs (Nationalmelodier) published by the philologist R. Nyerup and the composer A.P. Berggren in J.M. Thiele's collection of Danish folk legends (Danske Folkesagn) published in four volumes between 1818 and 1823. Bournonville also found inspiration in the tales collected by the Grimm brothers in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Plants vs. Zombies has {{received}} a positive reception from critics, garnering an aggregate score of 88/100 from Metacritic and an 89.5% from GameRankings. IGN editor Andy J Kolozsy commented that it featured a lot more content than other games in the genre, as well as praising its addictive nature. However, the DS version was criticised for its lower quality graphics and expensive price point. GameSpot editor Chris Watters praised {{the design of the}} plants and zombies, as well as the visuals and its overall value. However, he found fault in the learning curve. 1UP editor Alice Liang found the game enjoyable, commenting that the lawnmowers that protect {{the left side of the}} screen strikes a good balance between ease-of-use and in-depth game play. Edge's review praised PopCap Games for adding an imaginative touch to <b>every</b> <b>little</b> detail of the game. He also credited them for taking the tower defense genre and making it their own.|$|E

500|$|Hamasaki {{made her}} debut under Avex at 19 on April 8, 1998 {{with the single}} [...] "Poker Face". It—and the {{following}} four singles—were not major hits, however each release {{was better than the}} last, thus gradually increasing her exposure and presence on the market. Hamasaki's debut album, A Song for ×× (1999), was likewise [...] "unassuming": the tracks, composed by Yasuhiko Hoshino, Akio Togashi (of Da Pump), and Mitsuru Igarashi (of <b>Every</b> <b>Little</b> Thing), were [...] "cautious" [...] pop-rock songs. However, Hamasaki's lyrics, introspective observations about her feelings and experiences that focused on loneliness and individualism, resonated with the Japanese public. The songs gained Hamasaki a growing following, and the release of the album was a success: it topped the Oricon charts for five weeks and sold over a million copies. For her achievements, she earned a Japan Gold Disc Award for [...] "Best New Artist of the Year".|$|E

While filming the conversation between the two, they did not use a double; Torv memorized the timing and where she should be looking and pointing her gun, and the characters were filmed one at a time. Torv commented about the scene, [...] "You're talking to air. Learning both sides... was tough." [...] For the fight scene that followed, Torv had to block and aim her gun carefully while being mindful of her movements and the camera's location—though she was aided by stunt doubles. Torv credits the crew for successfully completing the scene: [...] "I give them all the credit in the world. It took a while.

500|$|It was screenwriter Joss Whedon's idea to {{incorporate}} Barbie {{as a character}} who would rescue Woody and Buzz in the film's final act. The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy.

If you give the doll a voice and animate it, you're creating a persona for it that might not be <b>every</b> <b>little</b> girl's dream and desire." [...] Hasbro likewise refused to license [...] (mainly because Sid was going to blow one up), but they did license Mr. Potato Head.

500|$|Rebirths soundtrack was {{composed}} by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura, regular composers for the Tales series. The soundtrack was released as an album, , on January 26, 2005. Reception {{of the album}} has been mixed to positive. Patrick Gann of RPGFan said that fans of previous Tales soundtracks would enjoy it, though personally found it tiring due to similarity to previous Tales soundtracks. The reviewer for Game-OST was generally positive, calling {{it one of the}} best albums of the series and better listening outside the context of the game than previous albums, though stated that despite some improvements, it did little to improve on previous Tales scores. As with previous Tales games, a licensed theme song was used for the opening. For Rebirth, the theme song used was [...] "Good Night", a 2004 single by Japanese pop band <b>Every</b> <b>Little</b> Thing. The song was released on 27 December 2004, shortly after the game's release, on a CD single also containing [...] The single reached 1# on the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for nineteen weeks.|$|E

She appeared at all eight shows in Japan and performed with other Avex artists such as <b>Every</b> <b>Little</b> Thing, Ai Otsuka, Namie Amuro, Ayumi Hamasaki, TVXQ, and Maki Goto. In October, Koda released her forty-first single, [...] "Taboo". With around 66,000 copies sold in its first week, [...] "Taboo" [...] debuted at the number-one position and became Koda's fifth single to reach the top. Koda released her forty-second single [...] "Stay with Me" [...] on Christmas Eve, which debuted atop of the chart selling 58,000 copies. Koda's seventh studio album, Trick, was another number-one album for the singer, selling 253,000 in its first week. The album stayed at the number-one spot for a second week selling 56,000 copies. Although the album debuted at the number-one position, this was her lowest selling album since her fourth studio album, Secret.|$|E
500|$|Yuri on Ice has {{highlighted}} homophobia {{in figure}} skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback {{in which a}} younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly-gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir {{said in an interview}} with The Geekiary, [...] "I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I think many of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that <b>every</b> <b>little</b> bit helps". The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights.|$|E

500|$|The team {{spent a lot}} of {{resources}} in carrying out detailed motion capture, to enhance players' engagement with the story and make it easier for them to form emotional attachments to characters, and to keep the game and the TV show consistent with each other. They also hoped that use of this technology would add realism to the game and prevent players from getting distracted by the characters' unrealistic behaviors and appearances. Lake added that one of the challenges when recording motion capture is to convince the inexperienced actors, who thought that the system lacked complexity, not to overact. According to Lake, the game features a technology that creates realistic digital counterparts of the characters and records <b>every</b> <b>little</b> detail of their faces. The team initially did the recording at Los Angeles, where actors need to wear spandex suits with tracking marks and head cameras. Remedy invited the actors to Remedy's office in Helsinki, where they used their own technology to carry out extremely detailed motion capturing of facial expressions and movements in dialogue. Ashmore described the chamber for motion capturing as a [...] "Sweat Box", as actors must remain steady, moving only their faces, in order to prevent the motion capture data from getting ruined.|$|E
500|$|Climax Studios {{began with}} the game's plot, which the {{development}} team considered the main appeal of the series. Early in the game's development, some team members visited a psychiatrist for research. The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game, as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill, and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States, where the fictional town is located. Falling snow was added to limit the player's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread. The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player's interaction with the game. Writer Sam Barlow explained the system: [...] "ultimately <b>every</b> <b>little</b> thing {{you do in the}} game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score. This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research." [...] The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player's profile. Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult, according to the game's producer, Tomm Hulett. Loading times were eliminated from the game to maintain a sense of immersion for the player.|$|E

After rounding up composition with guitarist Chris Shiflett and bassist Nate Mendel, Grohl spent two weeks with Norton discussing [...] "arrangements, harmony and melody" [...] and reducing the song ideas, and then the band spent four weeks rehearsing, playing [...] "a song a day, from noon to midnight". Hawkins stated that [...] "we basically played each of these songs 100 different times, trying <b>every</b> <b>little</b> thing every different way" [...] and that it was the first time since The Colour and the Shape [...] "that Dave had to deal with someone in the room questioning all his ideas", given the more laid-back approach of previous producer Nick Raskulinecz. Grohl claimed the choices were for the [...] "most powerful, dramatic songs", and that there was an effort to [...] "make everything sound as natural as possible – just like on the albums we grew up listening to", citing 1970s artists such as Neil Young and Wings as a major influence. Shiflett added that for the first time he played lead guitar in some tracks while Grohl [...] "usually works out all the bits" [...] of composition.|$|E
