5000|$|The aircraft, {{registered}} [...] {{had been}} chartered by Arrowsmith Holidays Ltd and had left Palma de Mallorca at 5:00 am, carrying holidaymakers {{back from the}} Balearic Islands to Manchester Airport. The approach controller vectored it towards the ILS {{as soon as it}} reached the Congleton NDB, but the pilots were apparently unable to put the aircraft on the <b>extended</b> <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> and called an overshoot. As the aircraft was making a second approach to the airport, the No. 3 and 4 engines suddenly cut out over the town of Stockport. The No. 4 propeller was feathered, but No.3 kept windmilling. The aircraft became uncontrollable and crashed at 10:09 am local time in an open area between buildings close to the town centre. Despite the crash occurring in a densely populated area, there were no fatalities on the ground. Members of the public and police risked harm to save twelve people from the mangled debris, but within minutes the wreckage was entirely engulfed in flames, killing those remaining on board who had survived the impact.Because it was a Sunday and people were not at work the accident drew a large crowd, estimated at around 10,000, hampering the rescue organisations.|$|E
50|$|The {{crew was}} then {{handed over to}} the holding and tower controllers, and was cleared for descent to 600 m, before {{entering}} the turn to the final approach. Whilst performing the turn, the <b>runway</b> <b>extended</b> <b>centreline</b> was overshot. After eliminating the deviation, the crew started descending the aircraft along the glide slope, following the approach pattern.|$|R

50|$|In aviation, a {{localizer}} is {{the lateral}} {{component of the}} instrument landing system (ILS) for the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> when combined with the vertical glide slope, {{not to be confused}} with a locator, although both are parts of aviation navigation systems.|$|R
5000|$|On August 3, 1978, a Boeing 707 {{registered}} as CC-CCX was approaching Ministro Pistarini International Airport in thick fog when it struck trees {{in a gentle}} descent, some 2500 metres short of the runway threshold and 300 metres {{out of line with}} the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> All 63 people on board the aircraft survived the accident.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 March 1970, D-INAH, a Handley Page Jetstream {{owned by}} Bavaria Fluggesellschaft {{departed}} Munich-Riem Airport, West Germany, for Samedan Airport, Switzerland. The aircraft crashed into snow about 3 km and 0.5 km left of Samedan Airport's <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> The aircraft was written-off and all nine passengers and both crew were killed. It {{was discovered that}} part of the turbine wheel on the number one engine had been destroyed.|$|R
50|$|At high altitudes, {{there is}} plenty of space for recovery. But during the final approach, when the {{airplane}} is close to the ground, a stall-spin accident is often fatal. A common cause of this accident is to enter a skidding turn in the airfield traffic pattern on the turn from base leg to final approach, unconsciously using excessive rudder in an attempt to tighten the turn and avoid overshooting the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b>|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{approach}} {{surveillance radar}} (ASR or SRA) {{is a type}} of radar instrument approach provided with active assistance from air traffic control. The only airborne radio equipment required for radar approaches is a functioning radio transmitter and receiver. The radar controller vectors the aircraft to align it with the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> The controller continues the vectors to keep the aircraft on course until the pilot can complete the approach and landing by visual reference to the surface.|$|R
25|$|After {{successfully}} transporting {{the patient}} from Tingwall Airport in the Shetland Islands to Inverness, the pilot, nurse, and physician were {{returning to their}} home base in Tingwall. There was a strong and gusting right crosswind at the runway. The pilot's approach procedure required him to make right turns to line up with the runway. However, these right turns obscured the pilot's view of the runway, and when the pilot made his final right turn, the aircraft had been blown {{to the left of}} the runway, too far to make a safe landing. The pilot executed a go-around procedure and attempted another approach. Again, the aircraft was blown far {{to the left of the}} <b>runway</b> <b>centreline,</b> and during the final approach turn, the aircraft lost a great deal of altitude, striking the ground 1.5km short of the runway and approximately 0.3km to the left of the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> The AAIB determined that nighttime visibility of the airport environment was inadequate, especially during right crosswind conditions, and recommended the Tingwall Airport add additional ground lighting to aid pilots' ability to acquire the runway during nighttime approaches.|$|R
5000|$|... 11 or 12 October 2001, a Swearingen SA.226TC Metro II Perimeter Flight 962 {{arrived at}} Shamattawa on a MEDIVAC flight {{to pick up}} a patient. It was night and the {{aircraft}} was coming into runway 01 too fast and too high so the crew performed a missed approach. Flying {{to the left of the}} <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> the aircraft hit some tress and came to rest in some muskeg. There were three people on board, both pilots were killed and the third person required hospitalization.|$|R
50|$|In August 2013 {{the airport}} started {{a project to}} {{decouple}} {{the ends of the}} two <b>runways</b> and <b>extend</b> <b>runway</b> 14/32 by 885 feet, to 6000 feet and <b>extend</b> <b>runway</b> 2/20 by 200 feet, to 5202 feet. This project was scheduled for completion in November 2014.|$|R
25|$|Singapore Airlines also {{issued a}} {{statement}} {{after the release of}} the ASC report. In their statement, Singapore Airlines reiterated the points brought up by the Singapore investigators and added that air traffic control (ATC) did not follow their own procedure when they gave clearance for SQ006 to take off despite ATC's not being able to see the aircraft. Singapore Airlines also clarified that the paravisual display (PVD) was meant to help the flight crew maintain the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> in poor visibility, rather than to identify the runway in use.|$|R

50|$|The landing continued, but manual braking did not {{commence}} {{until the}} aircraft was over 1,600 metres down the runway. Then the plane proceeded to hydroplane and skid {{its way down}} the runway, departing substantially from <b>runway</b> <b>centreline.</b> Company standard operating procedure mandated that idle reverse thrust {{should be used for}} landings and that flaps should be set at 25 degrees, not the maximum of 30 degrees. The combination of flaps 25, no auto-braking, no reverse thrust, a high and fast approach, a late touch down, poor Cockpit Resource Management, and the standing water on the runway led to a runway overshoot.|$|R

40|$|Two {{multisensor}} system architectures for navigation and guidance of small Unmanned Aircraft (UA) are presented and compared. The main objective {{of our research}} is to design a compact, light and relatively inexpensive system capable of providing the required navigation performance in all phases of flight of small UA, with a special focus on precision approach and landing, where Vision Based Navigation (VBN) techniques can be fully exploited in a multisensor integrated architecture. Various existing techniques for VBN are compared and the Appearance-Based Navigation (ABN) approach is selected for implementation. Feature extraction and optical flow techniques are employed to estimate flight parameters such as roll angle, pitch angle, deviation from the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline</b> and body rates...|$|R
50|$|Lorenz had a {{range of}} about 30 mi, enough for blind-landing but {{not good enough for}} bombing raids over the UK. This could be {{addressed}} by using more powerful transmitters and highly sensitive receivers. In addition the Lorenz beams were deliberately set wide enough that they could be easily picked up at some distance from the <b>runway</b> <b>centreline,</b> but this meant their accuracy at long ranges was fairly limited. This was not a problem for blind landing, where the distance covered by the fan-shaped beams decreased as the aircraft approached the transmitters, but for use in the bombing role this would be reversed, and the system would have maximum inaccuracy over the target.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, {{the three}} {{existing}} runways were paved. Each runway was 4000 ft long, 150 ft wide, and at nearly equal angles from each other, 30, 90, and 130 degrees. They {{were identified as}} runways 3-21, 9-27, and 13-31, respectively. The Corps of Engineers <b>extended</b> <b>Runways</b> 9-27 and 3-21 to 5699 ft in 1945. In 1951, the USAF <b>extended</b> <b>Runway</b> 9-27 to 9000 ft with a 1000 ft overrun and the control tower was built. Runway 9-27 was rebuilt in 1956 and extended in 1966 to 10152 ft in length.|$|R
