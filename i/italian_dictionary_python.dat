40|$|The lexicon of Russian {{concentration}} camp literature translated into Italian hasn’t been studied yet, nor have its entries in <b>Italian</b> <b>dictionaries</b> been considered. Thе article analyses the entries {{of the words}} gulag and lager in the major <b>Italian</b> <b>dictionaries.</b> It is pointed out that their definitions in such dictionaries do not correspond to the meaning that gulag and lager have been taking on either in Rus- sian {{concentration camp}} literature and memoirs or in scientific writings on this topic. It is observed, on the one hand, that in Italian lexicography the word gulag {{has taken on the}} meaning of “one soviet forced labor camp”, which is unusual in Russian and in concentration camp literature translated into Italian. On the other hand, it can be noticed that lager exclusively refers to the German concentration camp system. This can be explained {{as a consequence of the}} ideological-political conditionings which were typical to postwar Italian history...|$|R

50|$|The Italian {{language}} {{is considered a}} language with a large set of inflammatory terms and phrases, almost all of which originate from the several dialects and languages of Italy, such as the Tuscan dialect, which {{had a very strong}} influence in modern standard Italian, which is widely known to be based on Florentine language. Several of these words are cognates to other Romance languages, such as Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian and French. Profanities differ from region to region, but a number of them are diffuse enough to be more closely associated to the Italian language and featured in all the more popular <b>Italian</b> <b>dictionaries.</b>|$|R
