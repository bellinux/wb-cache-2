The decision of Justice Richard Blackburn ruled against the claimants {{on a number of}} issues of law and fact, rejecting the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> Aboriginal title recognizing that in the law of the time of British colonisation of Australia there was a distinction between settled colonies, where the land, being “desert and uncultivated”, was claimed by right <b>of</b> <b>occupancy,</b> and conquered or ceded colonies.

40|$|A {{decrease}} in the area <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> <b>of</b> a species is often criterion by which a species is classified as threatened (i. e. IUCN Red List). However, {{it is unclear how}} to accurately measure change in area <b>of</b> <b>occupancy.</b> Area <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> is a measure of distribution and the spatial scale at which the distribution is measured will affect the ability to detect a decline. To overcome errors introduced by measuring distribution at different spatial scales, scale correction methods are often applied. It is known that scale correction reliably estimates area of occupancy; however, its suitability to estimate trends in area <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> has not been assessed. We investigate the effect of spatial scale and implementation of scale correction when estimating two different forms of decline in area of occupancy: spatially correlated and spatially uncorrelated declines. We explore these issues using simulations of three declining species and a grid-based monitoring method designed to detect the declines. Our results suggest that current grid-based methods are inadequate for detecting uncorrelated local extinctions, even if the total decline is substantial (e. g. 65 % of the original range). We demonstrate that scale correction will lead to misleading conclusions in some situations. We suggest an alternative survey method to accurately estimate changes in area <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> over time. We provide guidelines for designing grid surveys to measure changes in area <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> to assess a species threat status using the IUCN Red List criterion...|$|R

40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John.

40|$|The {{foundation}} STUNS {{is investigating}} a possible move of the Origo office with tenants {{to a new}} office space. The Origo office today has a low utilization rate which makes it interesting to investigate the possibility of having an office space based on the ratio <b>of</b> <b>occupancy.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> {{this study is to}} calculate a ratio <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> with the corresponding risk of overcrowding and estimate the energy reduction. When adapting the new office space to the optimal ratio <b>of</b> <b>occupancy,</b> three office design proposals will be created. With the chosen optimal ratio <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> at 68 percent, the risk of overcrowding spanned between 0. 3 to 0. 6 percent. All proposals based on the optimal ratio <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> lead to electricity and cost reductions. An open office design leads to an electricity reduction of 686 kWh and a cost reduction of 168 kSEK per month. An activity based workplace leads to an electricity reduction of 540 kWh and a cost reduction of 132 kSEK per month. An individual office design leads to an electricity reduction of 452 kWh and a cost reduction of 111 kSEK per month. A sensitivity analysis is made by altering input parameters. The analyzed parameters are the unique attending employees, the transition probabilities and the choice of risk of overcrowding. For optimal utilization an open office space is the best alternative because it requires least square meters based on the same ratio <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> and workspaces. But when considering more aspects about work habits, employees’ opinions and behaviour the optimal office design may need a different structure...|$|R
