40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} that the witness {{protection}} is a subjective, public right and is a result of protection of fundamental human rights. It is fundamental, public, individual, positive, directly relative and indirectly absolute right. The following entitlements stem from the fundamental right of witness <b>to</b> protection: a) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> be informed about one’s right <b>to</b> protection; b) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> demand or waive one’s right <b>to</b> protection; c) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> withhold one’s personal details, testimony in full or answers to particular questions until the decision is made as to his request for protection; d) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> two-instance decision on one’s request; e) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> have a proxy; f) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> enjoy protection. The analysis of procedural witness protection in the comparative law shows that the witness in some countries does not have certain entitlements. On the other side, some entitlements are generally recognized. Certain differencies are understandable and acceptable, but not all of them. It is necessary to work on the realization of all entitlements that can be derived from subjective right to witness protection.
