5|$|Geologically, the Zarqa River {{is about}} 30 million years old. At the river's origin is 'Ain Ghazal, a major archaeological site {{that dates back}} to the Neolithic. Archaeological finds along the course of the river {{indicate}} the area was rich in <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> fauna in the past. The Zarqa River is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the Early Cretaceous (135 m.y.). A remarkable <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> fauna was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition (Kaddumi, 2005; 2007).|$|E

5|$|The Ganga-Jamuna Doab, {{of which}} Allahabad is a part, {{is on the}} western Indus-Gangetic Plain region. The doab (including the Terai) is {{responsible}} for the city's unique <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> fauna. Since the arrival of humans, nearly half of city's vertebrates have become extinct. Others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced. Associated changes in habitat and the introduction of reptiles, snakes and other mammals led to the extinction of bird species, including large birds such as eagles. The Allahabad Museum, one of four national museums in India, is documenting the <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> fauna of the Ganga and the Yamuna.|$|E

5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's decision to use Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> fauna, Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six of plants, and a new species of legless lizard.|$|E

To this end, regular management mainly struggles against the afforestation and against invasive species, such as Japanese knot weed. The secondary objectives are environmental education, heritage interpretation, improvement of knowledge fauna and <b>flora,</b> <b>and</b> environmental monitoring.|$|E

5|$|Fossil Creek {{is one of}} {{only two}} streams in Arizona {{included}} in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

Its former power-plant complex is listed as a National Historic District. Since restoration of the stream's natural flow in 2008, an increase in recreational visits has raised concerns about overuse and has led to road closings and other restrictions.|$|E
5|$|From 1851 to 1854 Henry Denham {{captain of}} HMS Herald, {{which was on}} a {{scientific}} expedition to the southwest Pacific (1852–1856), completed the island's first hydrographic survey. On board were three Scottish biologists, William Milne (a gardener-botanist from the Edinburgh Botanic Garden), John Macgillivray (naturalist) who collected fish and plant specimens, and Assistant Surgeon and zoologist Denis Macdonald. Together these men established much basic information on the geology, <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> fauna of the island.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs are prey animals whose {{survival}} {{instinct is}} to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages.

5|$|It {{was known}} to Indigenous Australians before its {{discovery}} and naming by Europeans; for example, the Gunai people of Gippsland called it birrna.

5|$|Nature {{photography}} {{is a common}} activity in the park due to the large variety of <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> fauna, as well as landscape photography due to the mountainous terrain and views. There are several forest trails and high-elevation ventures used by hikers and mountaineers respectively. There are numerous other activities available for visitors, {{as well as some}} prohibited activities. For example, although recreational fishing is allowed, there are severe consequences for anyone found hunting within the jurisdiction of the park.|$|E
