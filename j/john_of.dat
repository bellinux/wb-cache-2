5|$|According to <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury, {{who first}} {{reported}} {{this story in}} 1172 {{after the death of}} Thomas Becket, as a young clerk Roger was involved in a scandal involving a homosexual relationship with a boy named Walter. After Walter made the relationship public, Roger reacted by embroiling Walter in judicial case that ended with Walter's eyes being gouged out. When Walter then accused Roger of this crime, Roger persuaded a judge to condemn Walter to death by hanging. Becket supposedly was involved in the cover-up afterwards, by arranging with Hilary of Chichester and <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Coutances for Roger to swear an oath that he was innocent. According to <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury, Roger then went to Rome in 1152 and was cleared of involvement by Pope Eugene III. <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury further alleges that it was only after bribery that the pope cleared Roger. Frank Barlow, a medieval historian and Becket's biographer, points out in his biography of Becket that while Roger was accused of these crimes, and may even have been guilty of some sort of criminal homosexuality, <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Salisbury's motives for bringing up this story in 1172 were almost certainly to defame Roger. Such a story would naturally have put Roger in the worst possible light.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1335, {{the delegates}} of <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Bohemia {{and the new}} King of Poland, Casimir III, entered into {{negotiations}} in Trencsén {{to put an end}} to the conflicts between the two countries. With Charles's mediation, a compromise was reached on 24August: <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Bohemia renounced his claim to Poland and Casimir of Poland acknowledged <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Bohemia's suzerainty in Silesia. On 3September, Charles signed an alliance with <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Bohemia in Visegrád, which was primarily formed against the Dukes of Austria. Upon Charles's invitation, <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Bohemia and Casimir of Poland met in Visegrád in November. During the Congress of Visegrád, the two rulers confirmed the compromise that their delegates had worked out in Trencsén. CasimirIII also promised to pay 400,000 groschen to <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Bohemia, but a part of this indemnification (120,000 groschen) was finally paid off by Charles instead of his brother-in-law. The three rulers agreed upon a mutual defence union against the Habsburgs, and a new commercial route was set up to enable merchants travelling between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire to bypass Vienna.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} chronicle {{source is}} the material preserved in <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Fordun's Chronica gentis Scottorum ("Chronicle of the Scottish people") and Walter Bower's Scotichronicon. <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Fordun's work, which survives on its own, was {{incorporated in the}} following century into the work of Bower. Fordun's Chronica was written and compiled between 1384 and August 1387. Despite the apparently late date, Scottish textual historian Dauvit Broun has shown that Fordun's work in fact consists of two earlier pieces, Gesta Annalia I and Gesta Annalia II, the former written before April 1285 and covering the period from King Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III, died 1093) to 2 February 1285. Gesta Annalia I {{appears to have been}} based on an even earlier text, about the descendants of Saint Margaret of Scotland, produced at Dunfermline Abbey. Thus material from these works concerning the late 12th- and early 13th-century Gall-Gaidhil may represent, despite the apparent late date, reliable contemporary or near-contemporary accounts.|$|E

5|$|Edward III {{made his}} fourth son Edmund the first duke of York in 1362. Edmund {{was married to}} Isabella, a {{daughter}} of King Peter of Castile and María de Padilla and the sister of Constance of Castile, who was the second wife of Edmund's brother <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Gaunt. Both of Edmund's sons were killed in 1415. Richard {{became involved in the}} Southampton Plot, a conspiracy to depose Henry V in favour of Richard's brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer. When Mortimer revealed the plot to the king, Richard was executed for treason. Richard's childless older brother Edward was killed at the Battle of Agincourt later the same year. Constance of York was Edmund's only daughter and was an ancestor of Queen Anne Neville. The increasingly interwoven Plantagenet relationships were demonstrated by Edmund's second marriage to Joan Holland. Her sister Alianore Holland was mother to Richard's wife, Anne Mortimer. Margaret Holland, another of Joan's sisters, married <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Gaunt's son. She later married Thomas of Lancaster, <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Gaunt's grandson by King Henry IV. A third sister, Eleanor Holland, was mother-in-law to Richard Neville, 5th Earl of SalisburyJohn's grandson by his daughter Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland. These sisters were all granddaughters of Joan of Kent, the mother of Richard II, and therefore Plantagenet descendants of Edward I.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in the Hundred Years' War spilled {{from the}} French and Plantagenet lands into {{surrounding}} realms, including the dynastic conflict in Castile between Peter of Castile and Henry II of Castile. The Black Prince allied himself with Peter, defeating Henry at the Battle of Nájera. Edward and Peter fell out when Peter {{was unable to}} reimburse Edward’s military expenses leaving him bankrupt. The Plantagenets continued to interfere, and <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, the Black Prince's brother, married Peter's daughter Constance, claiming the Crown of Castile in her name. He invaded with an army of 5000 men. Fighting was inconclusive before Gaunt agreed a treaty with King Juan of Castile.

5|$|In 1336, an embassy to the French Pope Benedict XII in Avignon {{was sent}} by Toghun Temür, the last Yuan emperor in Dadu.

Pope Benedict appointed four ecclesiastics as his legates to the khan's court. In 1338, a total of 50 ecclesiastics were sent by the pope to Peking, among them <b>John</b> <b>of</b> Marignolli, who returned to Avignon in 1353 with a letter from the Yuan emperor to Pope Innocent VI.
