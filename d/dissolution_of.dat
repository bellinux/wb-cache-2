40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the role of Cu content in the <b>dissolution</b> {{kinetics}} <b>of</b> Cu in high-Sn solders during the solid/liquid reaction accompanied by interfacial intermetallic compound formation. Small additions of Cu (0. 7 %, 1. 5 %) in high-Sn solders dramatically decrease the <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Cu at low temperatures. Sn- 3. 5 Ag, as expected, has a dissolution rate similar to that of pure Sn. The difference in <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Cu in various molten solders is explained in terms of the solubility limit of Cu in molten solders based on the Cu-Sn phase diagram. The correlation between the metallurgical aspects of interfacial eta(Cu 6 Sn 5) phase formation and <b>dissolution</b> kinetics <b>of</b> Cu in molten solders leads {{to an understanding of the}} mechanism that controls the <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Cu in molten solders...|$|R

40|$|Solid dispersions of mefanamic acid with a {{water-soluble}} polymer polyvinyl pyrrolidine and a super disintegrant, primojel {{were prepared}} by common solvent and solvent evaporation methods employing methanol as the solvent. The dissolution rate and <b>dissolution</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the prepared solid dispersions were evaluated {{in comparison to}} the corresponding pure drug. Solid dispersions of mefenamic acid showed a marked enhancement in dissolution rate and dissolution efficiency. At 1 : 4 ratio of mefenamic acid-primojel a 2. 61 fold increase in the <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> mefenamic acid was observed with solid dispersion. The solid dispersions in combined carriers gave much higher rates <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> than super disintegrants alone. Mefanamic acid-primojel-polyvinyl pyrrolidine (1 : 3. 2 : 0. 8) solid dispersion gave a 4. 11 fold increase in the <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> mefenamic acid.

40|$|Complexation of Piroxicam with β-Cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin in the {{presence}} and absence of polyvinylpyrrolidone {{and the effect of}} polyvinylpyrrrolidone on the solubilizing efficiency of Cyclodextrins and on the <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Piroxicam from the Cyclodextrin complexes were investigated. The phase solubility studies indicated the formation of Piroxicam-β-Cyclodextrin and Piroxicam-hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin inclusion complexes at a 1 : 1 M ratio in solution, both in {{the presence}} and absence of polyvinylpyrrolidone. The complexes formed were quite stable. The solubility and <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Piroxicam were markedly enhanced by complexation with β-Cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl- β-Cyclodextrin. Piroxicamhydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin(1 : 2) inclusion complex gave a 36. 52 -fold increase in the <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Piroxicam. Addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone resulted in higher complexation efficiency and markedly enhanced solubilizing efficiency of β-Cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin. Solid inclusion complexes of Cyclodextrins with polyvinylpyrrolidone gave several times higher rates <b>of</b> <b>dissolution</b> than those <b>of</b> Piroxicam and its complexes with Cyclodextrins alone...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates {{enhancement}} <b>of</b> the <b>dissolution</b> profile <b>of</b> gliclazide, an antidiabetic drug, {{using the}} combination of solid dispersions and melt adsorption techniques.

The techniques of FTIR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) were performed to characterize the solid dispersions and to identify the physicochemical interaction between drug and carriers. <b>Dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> gliclazide was higher in case of solid dispersion adsorbates as compared to solid dispersion alone and one of the marketed products.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} phase-field {{model has}} been implemented to study the <b>dissolution</b> behavior <b>of</b> alumina (Al 2 O 3) into CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 slags. The simulations allowed evaluating the influence of temperature and composition on the diffusion paths and <b>dissolution</b> rates <b>of</b> Al 2 O 3 into CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 slags. The results obtained in the simulations are consistent with experimental observations and the predictions from an analytical dissolution model. The phase field simulations show that the <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Al 2 O 3 increases with temperature. Increasing CaO at a fixed Al 2 O 3 content or decreasing Al 2 O 3 content at a fixed CaO/SiO 2 ratio also results in a higher <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> Al 2 O 3. The results are further interpreted based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. status: publishe...|$|R
