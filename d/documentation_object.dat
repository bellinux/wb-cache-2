40|$|Museums and {{archives}} {{collect and}} store documentation of processes of {{intangible cultural heritage}} (ICH), such as craftsmanship skills, acts, and events recorded in videos, audio tapes, manuscripts, photos, and transcriptions. Such recordings are typically catalogued in an object-centric way as documents, using schemas such as Dublin Core. Also in event-centric models the {{focus has been on}} tangible cultural heritage. In this article we point out the importance of cataloguing not only the <b>documentation</b> <b>object</b> or related events, but the actual cultural process, such as a craftsmanship skill. Using special process-centric metadata for ICH, one can search for information about the elements and parts of intangible processes, not only documentation objects. Furthermore, process descriptions can be linked to related tangible and intangible objects in collections and Linked Data repositories on the web, facilitating rich and detailed semantic recommendations to end-users. To test and evaluate this idea, we created a metadata model for representing cultural processes, and applied it to the video documentation of traditional shoemaking with visualization and real time semantic recommendations on the CultureSampo portal. 1.

40|$|CMS {{software}} {{requirements and}} computing resources will by far exceed {{those of any}} existing high energy physics experiment, {{not only for the}} complexity of the detector and of the physics task but also for the size of the collaboration and the long time scale. Therefore, software should be developed keeping in mind not only performance but also modularity, flexibility, maintainability, quality assurance and <b>documentation.</b> <b>Object</b> Orientation has been identified as the enabling technology, since it directly addresses this kind of problems. We will report on the development of an Object Oriented Reconstruction and Analysis Framework for the CMS experiment and in particular on a prototype of a complete analysis chain for the CMS test-beam data. The analysis chain consists of three different components: data acquisition, reconstruction and analysis, and interactive analysis tools. In the online part the data, read from the VME, are stored into an Objectivity federated database. Later, using an automatic procedure, the database files are moved from the disk connected to the online computer system to the disks, and eventually tapes, connected to the off-line system. In the reconstruction and analysis step the data are retrieved from the database and an analysis of the detector performances can be carried out. The final step consists in the visualisation of the Histograms (produced using the LHC++ HISTOO package) and ``Tags'' which have been filled during the previous step. HEP-Explorer tools are used for the visualisation. Commercial as well as freely available class libraries have been used to build the functional prototype. A review of results and performances of the prototype, based on the data collected during the summer 1998, will be presented...|$|E

50|$|Practices for {{recording}} information about museum collections began developing {{in the late}} eighteenth century. Early collection control systems evolved from library prototypes, borrowing the idea of a sequential numbering system and accession ledgers to connect objects and the information about those objects.

It was not until the late 1990s when computers became commonplace that any other major breakthroughs occurred in the <b>documentation</b> and <b>object</b> tracking methods of museums.|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates {{advantages}} of application of digital photogrammetry {{for the purposes}} of production of technical <b>documentation</b> for the <b>objects</b> under protection, comparing it with the classical photogrammetric procedures. Based on gained experiences, paper reviews procedures for the completely digital production of technical documentation. Process of making technical documentation is divided in two logical stages. First stage comprises of photogrammetric recording, necessary field measurements and production of archive documentation. Archive documentation is in completely digital form and it includes: geometrically rectified photogrammetric photos, data on control points, parameters of exterior orientation for all photos and digital orthophotos as a preliminary source of geometric information. Second stage involves the production of detailed documentation with data describing object geometry such as: floor plans, facades, sections, etc, by using suitable CAD tools. Considering that this constitutes the most complicated and the most expensive part of making technical documentation, this stage is done when needed. Proposed method will be illustrated in paper by using experiences gained on projects of making technical <b>documentations</b> for <b>objects</b> of historical and cultural heritage for the towns of Kragujevac (Serbia and Montenegro) and Banja Luka (Republic of Srpska) ...|$|R

They have life histories, which can be traced and documented by creating biographies spanning from their creation and use to museum acquisition and life within the museum.
