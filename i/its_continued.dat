5|$|He was {{promoted}} to lieutenant-general on 25 April 1808, and in June was given command of 9,000 men set to invade revolutionary Spanish America. But in 1807, Napoleon had invaded Portugal, via Spain, intent on preventing <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> trade with Britain. He replaced the Spanish royal family with his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, in May 1808. In Madrid, the people attempted a rebellion against the French occupation which spread across Spain resulting in mass executions in reprisal, leading both the Portuguese and Spanish juntas (local administrations) to call on British support.|$|E

However, the project is largely no longer under consideration due to its high cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground was}} first {{constructed}} in 1905, soon before the club moved in. The club rented the ground until 1933, when newly appointed chairman Charles Jeyes organised {{the purchase of}} the stadium. The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989, when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £3.25million. The club was granted a seven-year lease at peppercorn rent for <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> use. This arrangement has been extended several times, and as of 2015 is due to end in 2028.|$|E

Although the practice was beginning to attract an overseas constituency, it remained relatively unknown in the Western world until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between Falun Gong and Communist Party authorities became a subject of international media coverage.

5|$|Faversham Recreation Ground (locally known {{simply as}} Faversham Rec) is {{to the east of}} the town centre. It was {{established}} in 1860 by local solicitor Henry Wreight, who bequeathed his £70,000 estate, including two almshouses housing 70 people, to the town in order that locals would have an area to enjoy. The rec has been preserved and is now run by the town's Municipal Charity. A bandstand was added {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and sporting events began to be held on the rec. A week long party was held to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, which drew praise from Princess Andrei of Russia, then living in Faversham. A 50-year extension on the lease was signed in 2010, confirmed <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> use by the general public.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah {{says that}} <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> {{hostilities}} against Israel are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against Lebanon and as retaliation {{for what they}} claim is Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of 19 March 1978, however Lebanon considers the Shebaa farms—a 26-km² (10-mi²) piece of land captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel—to be Lebanese territory. Additionally, Hezbollah claims that three Lebanese prisoners are being held in Israel. Finally, Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state. For these reasons, they justify their actions as acts of defensive jihad.|$|E

5|$|PlayStation Official Magazine - UK {{praised the}} story's {{blurring}} of Gallia's moral standing, art style, and most points about its gameplay, positively noting the latter for both <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> {{quality and the}} tweaks to balance and content. Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes, something that had affected the previous games. Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non-linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games. He also positively noted the story's serious tone. Points criticized in the review were recycled elements, awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason, pacing issues, and occasional problems with the game's AI.|$|E
5|$|Portugal, in contrast, {{resisted}} diplomatic solutions. It viewed <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> {{possession of}} its Indian enclaves {{as a matter}} of national pride and, in 1951, it amended its constitution to convert its possessions in India into Portuguese provinces. In July 1954, an uprising in Dadra and Nagar Haveli threw off Portuguese rule. The Portuguese attempted to send forces from Daman to reoccupy the enclaves, but were prevented from doing so by Indian troops. Portugal initiated proceedings before the International Court of Justice to compel India to allow its troops access to the enclave, but the Court rejected its complaint in 1960, holding that India was within its rights in denying Portugal military access. In 1961, the Constitution of India was amended to incorporate Dadra and Nagar Haveli into India as a Union Territory.|$|E
5|$|The fledgling RAAF faced several {{challenges}} to <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> {{existence in the}} 1920s and early 1930s, and Williams received {{much of the credit}} for maintaining its independence. However an adverse report on flying safety standards saw him dismissed from the position of CAS and seconded to the RAF prior to World WarII. Despite support in various quarters for his reinstatement as Air Force chief, and promotion to air marshal in 1940, he never again commanded the RAAF. After the war he was forcibly retired along with other World War I veteran officers. He took up the position of Director-General of Civil Aviation in Australia, and was knighted the year before his retirement in 1955.|$|E

5|$|The other non-communist {{organisation}} was the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral, and Cooperative Cambodia, {{formed by}} Sihanouk and {{known by its}} French acronym FUNCINPEC. The organization was formed after Sihanouk had severed ties with the Khmer Rouge following his representation on its behalf at the UN Security Council. As the leader of FUNCINPEC, Sihanouk called on the UN General Assembly to expel Khmer Rouge representatives for their crimes while in power and to keep Kampuchea’s seat at the UN vacant {{on the basis that}} neither the Khmer Rouge nor the Vietnamese-installed PRK had the mandate to represent the Kampuchean people. He also criticised ASEAN for <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> recognition of the Khmer Rouge, and specifically Thailand for enabling Chinese arms shipments to travel through its territory to supply the notorious communist group. Despite the strength, effectiveness and popularity of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC, both resistance groups were plagued by internal divisions caused by the lack of unity, leadership struggles, corruption and alleged abuses of human rights.|$|E
5|$|To further {{enhance the}} Commonwealth's {{integration}} and security, the constitution abolished the erstwhile union of Poland and Lithuania {{in favor of}} a unitary state. Its full establishment, supported by Stanisław August and Kołlątaj, was opposed by many Lithuanian deputies. As a compromise, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania received numerous privileges guaranteeing <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> existence. Related acts included the Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych (Declaration of the Assembled Estates) of May 5, 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów (Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations, i.e., of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) of October 22, 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the Grand Duchy within a single state and their equal representation in state-governing bodies. The Reciprocal Guarantee strengthened the Polish–Lithuanian union while keeping many federal aspects of the state intact.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, O'Donnell and Timken began {{talks with}} the Coast Guard Museum Association about selling the station to a {{third-party}} investor associated with the Association. The sale was originally to be effective {{at the end of}} 2014, but was delayed because the Redevelopment Agency never issued a formal certificate of completion for the 1975 sale and renovations. Since the Agency was dissolved in 2008, the City Council issued the certificate in early January 2015, allowing the sale the proceed. On January 12, the Council released the station from the 1960s urban renewal plan as part of an agreement with O'Donnell and Timken to ease the sale process. The new agreement also included stipulations for historic preservation of the building, and allowed – but not required – <b>its</b> <b>continued</b> use as a train station. On January 29, 2015, Union Station Development sold the station to the New London RR Company – a holding company owned by James Coleman Jr., chairman of the Association – for $3 million. Coleman brought in a restaurant serving locally sourced food for the first floor, and intends to renovate the second floor for use by museum-related tenants.|$|E
