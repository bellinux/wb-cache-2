Six thioureylenes, {{belonging to the}} group of thiouracil and imidazole, were selected for this work: thiouracil (TU), methylthiouracil (MTU), propylthiouracil (PTU), phenylthiouracil (PhTU), mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) and tapazole (TAP). The amphoteric nature of these compounds allows their electrospray detection in both positive and negative ionisation. Nevertheless, MS detection is not favoured by their low molecular weights, while their chromatographic retention is also thwarted by their high polarity. A pentafluorophenyl (PFP) core-shell phase column was selected to avoid peak asymmetry or peak splitting, and a dual-polarity <b>ionisation</b> <b>method</b> was optimised to obtain a sensitivity as high as possible.

40|$|Mass Spectrometry (MS) is an {{important}} analytical tool in the identification and quantification {{of a wide range}} of samples, primarily because of its speed, sensitivity, selectivity and versatility in analysing, gases, solids and liquids. MS is an interdisciplinary analytical tool, impacting many areas of science from physics, through chemistry, to biology. However MS is mainly limited to laboratory settings due to the high vacuum requirement needed for ion generation and processing. The main theme of this work is the development of <b>ionisation</b> <b>methods</b> that enable ion generation and processing under ambient conditions in the open air outside of the laboratory for in-situ applications. To that end, it is also important that ions are generated and processed with little or no extensive sample preparation steps required. In this work the development of two ambient ionisation methods: desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (DAPCI) and paper spray (PS) ionisation and their application for in-situ MS analysis is demonstrated. A DAPCI handheld ion source version based on DAPCI was developed to ignite a corona discharge in air and operates for up to 12 h continuously using only 12 V battery. Both DAPCI and PS ambient <b>ionisation</b> <b>methods</b> were implemented for in-situ MS analysis and were used to detect trace amounts (< ng) of different classes of chemical compounds (i. e hydrocarbons, explosives corrosion inhibitors and metaldehyde in waters samples); this was achieved rapidly (i. e. less than 1 minute) with little or no sample preparation in the open air. Both ambient <b>ionisation</b> <b>methods</b> (i. e., DAPCI and PS) were used with either a commercial instrument or with a custom miniature mass spectrometer to identify and characterize traces amounts of petroleum oil hydrocarbons and additives (e. g. quaternary ammonium corrosion inhibitors), and water pollutants (e. g. metaldehyde) with high sensitivity and selectivity. The handheld DAPCI and PS methods were also applied to the in-situ direct analysis of explosives. Good performance was achieved with the miniaturised instrument giving detection limits within an order of magnitude to those achieved using a benchtop commercial instrument. The results reported in this thesis should be of importance to those interested in ambient ionisation mass spectrometry, miniature mass spectrometry, in-situ MS analysis, oilfield chemical analysis, homeland and border security agencies and environmental monitoring...|$|R

These experiments were performed under well standardised geometrical conditions, employing electron beams (0. 25 - 0. 75 MeV) derived from a Van de Graaff electrostatic generator. The possible effects of poor geometry and small bias voltages on range values have also been investigated, but {{the results show that}} these effects could be kept very small in normal transmission measurements. The range values obtained in five metals (Be, Al, Cu Ag and Au) and in four dielectrics (glass, mica, sulphur and polystyrene) by direct current collection method and in A 1, Ag and mica by an <b>ionisation</b> <b>method,</b> show that the latter method yields larger range values. A comparison with other results showed that the range values obtained with the Geiger counter are also greater than those obtained by the current collection method, The ionisation-in-depth results in Al showed good agreement with the other results, and with Spencer's theory for equivalent source geometry. A universal transmission curve was obtained for each element using the true range values calculated from the Bethe-Bloch stopping power formula, and its intercept was found to be a smooth function of the atomic number for both metals and insulators. Electron bombardment conductivity has been studied primarily in sulphur and in selenium for comparison. Large current gains were observed in sulphur in confirmation of von Hippel's theory of the conductivity of the elements of Group VIb of the periodic table. The single crystals of sulphur showed as much bombardment conductivity as selenium, but much greater conductivity than the polycrystalline specimen, as was noted by Joffe (1928) and as would be expected for a more perfect crystal lattice.

40|$|Atmospheric-Pressure Laser Ionization (APLI) was {{developed}} at the University of Wuppertal as a sensitive atmospheric-pressure <b>ionisation</b> <b>method</b> {{for the analysis of}} non-polar aromatic hydrocarbons. The coupling of liquid chromatography (LC) with APLI was first realised with a Q-TOF Ultima (Waters) instrument in the form of LC-APLI-(TOF) MS. Because of its great separating power, gas chromatography presents an interesting alternative to LC. A plan was therefore drafted for coupling a gas chromatograph with the atmospheric-pressure ion source of the Q-TOF Ultima for APLI. To this end, an appropriate electrically heated transfer line was constructed. The front end of this transfer line could be mounted instead of a volatilisation stage on the otherwise unmodified atmospheric-pressure ion source. The parameters necessary to operate the source, such as the amounts of gas within the source and settings on the mass spectrometer, were optimised. The efficiency of this new coupling was demonstrated by the analysis of a number of standards (PAHs and hetero-PAHs). On the basis of this successful coupling, APLI was also coupled with another atmosphericpressure mass spectrometer (micrOTOF, Bruker Daltonics). For this, a new ion source {{was developed}} for the mass spectrometer, to replace the standard one. The central component of the new source, which can be used for LC as well as for GC versions of APLI-(TOF) MS, is a cube-shaped source body with several apertures. Various additional components, such as the volatilisation stage of liquid chromatography or the newly developed transfer line, could be mounted onto the body. After important parameters had been optimised, a number of standards as well as real samples were analysed with both the LC-APLI-(TOF) MS and GCAPLI-(TOF) MS systems, in order to show the potential of this coupling. Thus, in addition to several aromatic oligomers used in the manufacture of organic light-emitting diodes, which are difficult to analyse by other methods, transition-metal complexes used as triplet emitters were successfully analysed by LC-APLI-(TOF) MS. Among examples of the application of GC-APLI-(TOF) MS, several PAH and hetero-PAH standards were analysed, and the pyrene metabolite 1 -hydroxypyrene was detected in urine. For chrysene, a detection limit of 0. 5 ng/L was achieved with an injection volume of 2 µL. In order to use the advantages of such a flexible coupling, in which the costly high-resolution mass spectrometer serves as detector for various chromatographic applications in conjunction with the three important atmospheric-pressure ionisation methods (ESI, APCI, APPI), these methods were integrated into the design. In addition, an improved version of the GC-transfer line was developed. This new design of a Multi-Purpose API-Source (MPIS) has been made commercially available by the company Bruker Daltonics as a flexible ion source for an atmospheric-pressure mass spectrometer. Switching between various ionisation methods is convenient, requiring only that the alternative components be exchanged at the apertures of the source body. For example, to switch from GC-APLI-(TOF) MS to GC-APCI-(TOF) MS, only a quartz window is replaced by the APCI needle assembly. Switching between LC und GC is possible in the same way: here only the transfer line has {{to be replaced by a}} blind flange. In this design, the ionisation methods can be applied either individually or in combination as true multimode ionisation (e. g. APLI and APCI simultaneously). The efficiency of the individual modes was demonstrated with several standards. With this source, ionisation techniques such as ESI, APCI, APPI and APLI are available for both LC and GC. For LC, the additional multimode ionisation techniques APLI+ESI and APLI+APCI can be used. APLI is a selective method for ionising non-polar aromatic compounds. On the one hand, this represents a limitation to the general applicability of the method, but on the other hand it makes it possible to ionise this class of compounds selectively in a complex matrix. Therefore ionisation labels and corresponding strategies for derivatisation were developed for LC-APLI- (TOF) MS and GC-APLI-(TOF) MS. These ionisation labels are aromatic compounds that can be detected with high sensitivity. They have an anchor group for covalent coupling with nonaromatic analytes. The derivative can then be detected sensitively by APLI. A study of REMPI spectra of several derivatives under atmospheric pressure showed that they do not differ significantly from those of the labels themselves, which indicates that the electronic proportion of the aromatic system of the derivative is not significantly influenced by the analyte. The practical application of the APLI ionisation labels was showen for LC-APLI- (TOF) MS and GC-APLI-(TOF) MS by study of a number of samples such as Brij® 72 and PEG 1000 and by the determination of the fatty acid content of vegetable oils and a technical fatty alcohol mixture...|$|E
40|$|The {{ionisation}} {{of atoms}} and molecules via stepwise excitation of long-lived intermediate electronic states is called resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionisation (REMPI). At comparably low power densities, {{on the order}} of 10 6 W cm - 2, REMPI becomes an <b>ionisation</b> <b>method</b> which is selective and sensitive towards aromatic hydrocarbons. On the one hand, the method presents an advantage because aromatic compounds can be ionised directly from a complex matrix without the resonant excitation of matrix elements or commonly used solvents. On the other hand, this method limits the analyte spectrum. In order to extend the method's selectivity and sensitivity to non-aromatic compounds, ionisation labels have been adopted. These consist of an aromatic group (ionophore) which is primarily excited, a spacer, and an anchor group that is covalently coupled to the analyte. This work is concerned with the development of ionisation labels for GC applications. Here, the vaporisation of the analyte-label derivative is the property of capital importance. First, the spectroscopic characteristics of the potential labels and the derivatives were investigated by examination of their respective (1 + 1) REMPI spectra with an optical resolution of about 0. 1 nm. For this propose, a time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a medium pressure laser ionisation (MPLI) source was available. The system was refurbished, equipped with a new data-acquisition unit and coupled with an Nd:Yag laser pumped optical parametric oscillator (OPO), which generates laser light of variable frequencies in a range of 200 nm to 3100 nm. As part of this project, special software was written for the control and synchronisation of OPO, mass spectrometer and data acquisition. Another important detail, which was required for recording REMPI spectra, was the design of the sample inlet. A means of transporting the analytes continuously into the ion source was created. The challenge here is to vaporise the liquid samples without diluting them too much. High dilution, as is used for pneumatically assisted vaporisation, would lead either to overtaxing the pumping system or to a decrease of the method's sensitivity. In addition to the optimisation of the sample-inlet arrangement, the configuration of the ion-source had to be revised. To this end, an auxiliary repeller was established to optimise the ions' trajectories on their way through the differential pumping stage to the detector. The result of this development was a pressure-controlled sample inlet, which also enabled the vaporisation of compounds of low volatility without pressure fluctuations in the source. The first step {{in the development of the}} ionisation labels was the recording of REMPI spectra of benzene derivatives. These compounds are suitable labels because they undergo ionisation during the REMPI process and have only little effect on the vaporisation of the label-analyte derivative. Another factor that had to be considered in the selection of labels was the ionisation yield at fixed-frequency laser wavelengths in the UV-range. Fixed-frequency lasers offer the advantages of low costs and a high repetition rate, which benefits the performance when coupling with chromatographic systems. From the beginning, the potential labels p-fluorotoluene and p-xylene were selected because of their good ionisation yield at the fourth harmonic of Nd:YAG lasers (l : 266 nm). Furthermore, aromatic silylation reagents were employed because of their rapid reactions. For detailed studies, the archetypical analytes palmitic acid and palmityl alcohol were derivatised with the potential labels, and their REMPI spectra were recorded. The measurements showed a shift of the derivatives' absorption bands, which could be explained by reduction of electron density at the aromatic ring as well as intramolecular interactions between ionophore and the coupled analyte. By variation of ionophore, spacer, and anchor group, derivatives with an ionisation maximum at the fixed-frequency laser wavelength of 266 nm could be created. It was shown that the influence of the coupled analyte on the absorption bands of the derivative could be minimised. These results lead to the conclusion that the mass-spectrometric response factors for analytes tagged with the same REMPI label are virtually identical. Provided that the presently investigated analytes have the same derivatisation yield and similar vaporisation, this method leads to a significantly simplified analysis of the data. It was shown that mixtures of fatty alcohols in both standards and real samples could be quantified without chromatographic separation, solely on the basis of the mass spectra. Similarly, the appropriateness of labels in GC analyses was demonstrated. A temperature- controlled line was constructed to transfer the sample into the ion source of the mass spectrometer. The analyses of a PAH mixture and labelled fat chemicals proved the functional efficiency of the GC-MPLI-MS coupling...|$|E

A new family of techniques has been developed allowing ions to be created under ambient conditions. Three of these ambient ionisation techniques, coupled to different mass analysers, were employed for the rapid screening of pharmaceutical formulations. Active ingredients were identified and subjected to collisionally induced dissociation, enabling the elucidation of potential fragmentation pathways. Drug metabolites were also successfully identified from biological samples. Inorganic mass spectrometry was employed to probe the metal centres of the enzyme, particulate methane monooxygenase, a methane-oxidising complex found in certain bacteria. This protein has been extensively studied, but questions remain regarding its catalytic mechanism, particularly the involvement of indigenous metal ions. Inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry experiments have indicated the presence of copper and iron within the enzyme. Protein cross-sections, obtained using ion mobility mass spectrometry, can be used to probe the conformation of molecules in the gas phase. A commercial instrument was used to investigate human hemoglobin from clinical samples. A complex assembly mechanism was deduced, resolving previous disputes in the literature, and conformational differences were observed between healthy and sickle molecules.

The present work assesses the applicability of the reagents in Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometric (CI-TOF-MS) environments with factors such as high moisture content, operating pressures of 1 - 10 Torr, accelerating electric fields (E/N) and long-lived intermediate complex formation. Of the commonly used chemical ionisation reagents, H 3 O(+) and NO(+) only react with hexane and higher while O 2 (+) reacts with all the target samples, but creates significant fragmentation. By contrast, CF 3 (+) and CF 2 H(+) acting together were found to produce little or no fragmentation. In dry conditions with E/N = 100 Td or higher the relative intensity of CF 2 H(+) to CF 3 (+) was mostly less than 1 % but always less than 3 %, making CF 3 (+) the main reagent ion. Using O 2 (+) in a parallel series of experiments, a substantially greater degree of fragmentation was observed. The detection sensitivities of the alkanes with CF 3 (+) and CF 2 H(+), while relatively low, were found to be better than those observed with O 2 (+). Experiments using alkane mixtures in the ppm range have shown the ionisation technique based on CF 3 (+) and CF 2 H(+) to be particularly useful for measurements of alkane/air mixtures found in polluted environments.

40|$|Hindered amine light {{stabilisers}} (HALS) are {{one class}} of additive {{known to be}} effective in retarding polymer degradation and have been deployed in a range of polymer-based surface coating applications. The use of HALS significantly improves gloss and colour retention of coatings in addition to maintaining surface integrity – resulting in a superior commercial product. Despite their demonstrable efficacy, the precise mechanism by which HALS protect coatings remains an open discussion. It is widely believed that HALS operate as chain-breaking antioxidants whereby, initially, the parent compound undergoes sacrificial oxidation of a heterocyclic amine to form an aminoxyl radical. It is this persistent aminoxyl radical that acts as a free radical scavenging intermediate and is thought to be involved in converting harmful free radicals to less harmful evenelectron species. In theory, this process could repeat indefinitely but empirical evidence suggests HALS become less effective over time suggesting that further investigation of their mechanism of action is required. The overarching goal of this research was to identify molecular-level changes in HALS within polymer systems. To achieve this required the development of new analytical methods that were sensitive to changes in molecular structure and abundance of HALS present in polymer-based surface coatings. The scope of this PhD project encompassed two major objectives. Firstly, to develop ambient <b>ionisation</b> mass spectrometric <b>methods</b> capable of interrogating additives within polymer-based surface coatings. Traditional mass spectrometry (MS) methods have long been employed for the characterisation of both polymers H vi and polymer additives but recent developments in the field suggest new approaches could provide distinct advantages for polymer analysis. Notable among these technological advancements are a class of desorption/ionisation methods capable of analysing solid and liquid material in its native state, under ambient conditions. These ambient <b>ionisation</b> MS <b>methods</b> are distinct from traditional MS in that they permit direct desorption and ionisation of analytes {{from a wide variety of}} substrates with minimum sample preparation, i. e., extraction, pre-concentration, and chromatographic separation are not required. Uncovering the true potential of these ambient sampling and <b>ionisation</b> <b>methods</b> for MS of synthetic polymers and their components is a major focus of the research undertaken for this thesis. The second objective was to use these optimised techniques to characterise changes in molecular structure and abundance of HALS in different polymers - mostly polyester and polyacrylate surface coatings - induced by different preparations and in-service conditions Results reported herein accomplish the objectives of method development and application. Three ambient <b>ionisation</b> mass spectrometry <b>methods</b> have been developed for polymer and polymer additive analysis. These are desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI), liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA), and paint spray ionisation – a new technique developed as a part of this PhD project. All three techniques are capable of detecting HALS directly from within the bulk polymer, removing laborious sample preparation steps required with traditional MS. Each technique is able to provide complementary information on the spatial distribution and change in molecular structure of HALS compounds. Applying these methods to polyester paint samples led to the discovery that all N-functionalised HALS (N-CH 3, N-C(O) CH 3, and N-OR) generate a substantial population of secondary amine (N-H). Detection of this molecular-level change represents key experimental evidence for a major role for secondary amines as intermediates in mechanisms of HALS stabilisation of polymers. These findings are consistent with the results of recent high-level computational studies that also identify secondary amines as a critical reaction intermediate and repository of active HALS (G. Gryn 2 ̆ 7 ova, K. Ingold and M. L. Coote, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 12979 - 12988). The study suggested formation of secondary amines from N-OR functionalised HALS would primarily occur by hydrogen abstraction and subsequent β-scission under normal service temperatures (25 - 80 °C). At low radical concentrations or at high temperatures associated with curing (260 °C), secondary amine formation via direct N-OR bond homolysis may become competitive. Both mechanisms are consistent with the observed experimental presented data and the combination of these results represents a significant advancement in understanding the mechanisms of protection of polymers by HALS...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 2 decades {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in metal complexes that bind non-covalently to DNA, driven {{in part by a}} host of potential applications for molecules that can accomplish this task with high affinity and selectivity. As a result many workers have used a wide variety of experimental techniques, several of which are discussed in other chapters of this book, to unravel the details of the precise intermolecular interactions involved. Here we discuss one of the most recent additions to the armory of techniques used by chemists to interrogate metal complex/ DNA interactions. For the majority of its existence mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to be of enormous advantage to chemists by virtue of its ability to provide the molecular weights of compounds as well as structural information via fragmentation patterns. However, the high energies associated with many earlier MS techniques which result in fragmentation of covalent bonds, prevent its application for studying weaker intermolecular interactions. The advent of soft <b>ionisation</b> <b>methods</b> such as matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) and electrospray ionisation (ESI) has revolutionised mass spectrometric analysis of biomolecules, by allowing these normally fragile molecules to be introduced into the gas phase for analysis with minimal, if any, fragmentation. It was then recognised that ESI–MS, in particular, might be suitable for investigating non-covalent interactions between small molecules and either proteins or nucleic acids. This was confirmed by a number of early studies involving organic intercalators and minor groove binding ligands, prompting our interest in evaluating ESI–MS as a tool for studying non-covalent interactions between metal complexes and DNA. This chapter contains a discussion of the basic principles behind ESI–MS that enable it to introduce representative samples of solutions containing metal complexes and DNA into the gas phase for analysis. This will be followed by a discussion of the results that can be obtained using this method, drawing heavily on studies performed in our laboratory...|$|R

40|$|Originally {{established}} as an analytical technique {{in the fields}} of physics and chemistry, mass spectrometry has recently become an essential tool in biological research. Advances in <b>ionisation</b> <b>methods</b> and novel types of instrumentation have {{led to the development of}} mass spectrometry for the analysis of a wide variety of biological samples. The work presented here describes the use of mass spectrometry to characterise a variety of synthetic and natural macromolecules. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also known as prion diseases, are a class of fatal, infectious neurodegenerative diseases that affect both humans and animals. Prion proteins are unprecedented infectious pathogens that cause a group of invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases by means of an entirely novel mechanism. Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) was used to probe the conformation of a variety of different prion proteins in the gas-phase. It was shown that IM-MS could distinguish between two recombinant structures representative of normal cellular prion protein, PrPC and the pathogenic scrapie form (PrPSc). The structure of the full-length prion protein was probed by means of IM-MS. A comparison of the estimated cross-sections of truncated prion protein constructs and full-length constructs suggested that the N-terminal flexible tail was associated with the core structure. Metal binding to two different prion protein constructs was investigated. It was observed that copper coordination to the N-terminal fragment could induce conformational changes in the octarepeat fragment. These changes were relatively small and could not be measured in the full-length prion protein. The data suggested that minor structural changes in the N-terminal could stimulate endocytosis via a minor, undetected, conformational change in the C-terminal domain. IM-MS was used as a high resolution separation technique to distinguish between mixtures of isobaric synthetic polymers. It was observed that the resolving power of IM-MS/MS was insufficient to resolve the higher molecular weight oligomers. In comparison, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) -nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (GPC-NMR) analysis of the same isobaric mixture could not separate the two components. It was observed that IM-MS was better than GPCNMR at separating isobaric poly(ethylene glycol) mixtures, especially when taking speed and sensitivity into account.

40|$|Separation {{of sugar}} isomers {{extracted}} from biological samples is challenging {{because of their}} natural occurrence as alpha and beta anomers and, {{in the case of}} hexoses, in their pyranose and furanose forms. A reductive amination method was developed for the tagging of sugars with the aim of it becoming part of a metabolomics work flow. The best separation of the common hexoses (glucose, fructose, mannose and galactose) was achieved when 2 H 5 -aniline was used as the tagging reagent in combination with separation on a ZICHILIC column. The method was used to tag a range of sugars including pentoses and uronic acids. The method was simple to perform and was able to improve both the separation of sugars and their response to electrospray <b>ionisation.</b> The <b>method</b> was applied to the profiling of sugars in urine where a number of hexose and pentose isomers could be observed.

These compounds are prohibited for use as feed additives although some are still authorised for use in medicated feed. Feed samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of sodium sulphate. The extracts undergo a hexane wash to aid with sample purification. The extracts are then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. The samples undergo an ultracentrifugation step prior to injection onto the LC-MS/MS system and are analysed in a run time of 26 minutes. The LC-MS/MS system is run in MRM mode with both positive and negative electrospray <b>ionisation.</b> The <b>method</b> was validated over three days and is capable of quantitatively analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, ipronidazole, chloramphenicol, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, dinitolimide, ethopabate, carbadox and clopidol.

40|$|Chapter I {{presents}} {{an overview of}} mass spectrometry on double focusing instruments. Special {{attention is paid to}} <b>ionisation</b> <b>methods</b> which may be of use in mixture analysis. In chapter II, following a brief introduction to chemometrics, results of the application of factor analysis to the problem of determining the components of a mixture from mass spectra of simple mixtures are given. After applying the technique to simulated data, the results of applying the technique to simple mixtures and to the deconvolution of overlapping GC/MC spectra are given. It is concluded that provided the pure compounds have 'unique' peaks in their mass spectra, and that the statistical variations in the intensities of peaks due to different mixtures are not correlated, then the technique will yield good results. Chapter III deals with the application of CI techniques and factor analysis to the analysis of engine oils. Attempts to use the factor analysis technique to yield a meaningful 'type' analysis of engine oil fractions was not successful. The use of proton transfer reagents and charge transfer reagents for CI spectra of engine oil fractions was also unsuccessful. It is concluded that the complexity of engine oil mixtures and the chemical similarity of the constituent molecules makes them difficult to differentiate by CI mass spectrometry. In the final chapter, details are gave of an investigation into the use of CI mass spectrometry and FAB mass spectrometry for the analysis of engine oil additives. The additives studied were calcium 2, 2 '-bis (4 -alkylphenyl) sulphides. The FAB mass spectrometry of these sulphurised phenates gave poor results with glycerol, triethanolamine, triethanolamine / sodium sulphate or squalane used as FAB matrix. Of the CI techniques used, electron capture ionisation of the hydrolysed sample gave the most promising results. The molecular ion peak intensities were higher than those encountered in the EI spectra. In addition, the fragmentation in the EC spectra was simpler than the fragmentation in the EI spectrum. Metastable ion studies of the EI and EC spectra of the sulphurised phenols, using the technique of metastable mapping, gave some useful results, but the poor mass resolving power and the long run times were a major drawback. It is concluded that the technique of metastable mapping is of no use where mass resolution is important, and the use of inlet systems, such as an AGHIS, which allow long sample lifetimes is recommended. Where possible, the use of tandem mass spectrometry or Fourier transform mass spectrometry for metastable ion studies for mixture analysis, is also recommended. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the fatty acid composition of 19 dietary oil supplements that are commercially available in Australia, comparing findings with manufacturers’ reported omega- 3 fatty acid content. Methods: Fifteen fish oil supplements and four non-fish oil supplements were obtained from Australian retail stores. Fatty acids were derivatised, and fatty acid methyl esters were quantitated using classical GC-flame <b>ionisation</b> detection <b>methods.</b> Composition of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid reported by supplement manufacturers was compared with experimental values using the Bland-Altman plot. Results: The combined eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid content in the fish oil and non-fish oil supplements was 17. 63 – 71. 45 % and 0. 00 – 0. 05 % respectively. A high level of congruency was observed for the composition of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid reported by manufacturers and determined experimentally (mean difference, eicosapentaenoic acid, 13. 2 mg; docosahexaenoic acid, 12. 8 mg). Conclusion: Current practice in pre-market assessment of complementary medicines in Australia is satisfactory for supplements examined in the present study. Intake of these fish oil supplements can be used to provide high levels of long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids that would be otherwise difficult to achieve through normal dietary intake alone...|$|R
40|$|Reaction {{with the}} {{hydroxyl}} radical (OH) {{is the dominant}} removal mechanism for virtually all volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere; however, {{it can be difficult}} to reconcile measured OH reactivity with known sinks. Unresolved higher molecular weight VOCs contribute to OH sinks, of which monoaromatics are potentially an important sub-class. A method based on comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) has been developed that extends the degree with which larger VOCs can be individually speciated from whole air samples (WAS). The technique showed excellent sensitivity, resolution and good agreement with an established gas chromatography–flame <b>ionisation</b> (GC-FID) <b>method,</b> for compounds amenable to analysis on both instruments. Measurements have been made of VOCs within the UK east coast marine boundary layer and free troposphere, using samples collected from five aircraft flights in winter 2011. Ten monoaromatic compounds with an array of different alkyl ring substituents have been quantified, in addition to the simple aromatics, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and Σ m - and p -xylene. These additional compounds were then included in constrained box model simulations of atmospheric chemistry occurring at two UK rural and suburban field sites in order to assess the potential impact of these larger monoaromatics species on OH reactivity; they have been calculated to contribute an additional 2 – 6 % to the overall modelled OH loss rate, providing a maximum additional OH sink of ~ 0. 9 s − 1...|$|R

We also deliver a Milky Way (MW) comparison sample of giant stars covering the - 4 - 3. 5 regime, the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) calculations with non-spectroscopic effective temperature (Teff) and surface gravity (log g) based on the photometric methods and known distance provide consistent abundances of the Fe I and Fe II lines. This justifies the Fe I/Fe II <b>ionisation</b> equilibrium <b>method</b> to determine log g for the MW halo giants with unknown distance. The atmospheric parameters of the dSphs and MW stars were checked with independent methods. In the [Fe/H] > - 3. 5 regime, the Ti I/Ti II ionisation equilibrium is fulfilled in the NLTE calculations. In the log g - Teff plane, all the stars sit on the giant branch of the evolutionary tracks corresponding to [Fe/H] = - 2 to - 4, in line with their metallicities. For {{some of the most}} metal-poor stars of our sample, we hardly achieve consistent NLTE abundances from the two ionisation stages for both iron and titanium.
