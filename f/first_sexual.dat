He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E

25|$|Although {{opinions}} differ, others {{suggest that}} sexual activity {{is an essential}} part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex. Sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction. In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity according to one particular research study. In a rural upstate New York community, a cross-sectional study of teenagers was completed in 2008 and 2009. Teenagers who had their <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17. Furthermore, teenagers who had their <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.|$|E

25|$|The age {{at which}} {{adolescents}} tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures {{and from time to}} time. (See Prevalence of virginity.) The <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the sexualization of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of virginity or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the age of consent.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{prevalence}} of HIV/AIDS amongst Nicaraguan adults {{was estimated to be}} 0.3% by UNAIDS in 2015, in the past UNAIDS' numbers have been claimed to be grossly underreported due to data collection issues.

25|$|One {{study has}} several factors that {{influence}} the age of <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> intercourse among both genders. Those from families with both parents present, from high socioeconomic backgrounds, who performed better at school, were more religious, who had higher parental expectations, and felt like their parents care, showed lower levels of sexual activity across all age groups in the study (age 13-18). In contrast, those {{with higher levels of}} body pride, showed higher levels of sexual activity.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{surveyed}} 157 {{college women}} regarding sexual abuse, {{age at first}} intercourse, reactions to <b>first</b> intercourse, <b>sexual</b> attitudes, and sexual risk behavior outcomes to clarify the relationship between early sexual experiences and risky sexual behavior. Women who had been sexually abused in childhood reported greater numbers of lifetime sexual partners. This relationship was partially explained by adoles-cent/adult sexual abuse, age at <b>first</b> intercourse, permissive <b>sexual</b> atti-tudes, and reaction to <b>first</b> intercourse. Childhood <b>sexual</b> abuse was indirectly associated with more frequent use of alcohol or drugs dur-ing sexual activity through its relationships with adolescent/adult sexual abuse, age at <b>first</b> intercourse, permissive <b>sexual</b> attitudes, and reaction to first intercourse.

25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E
25|$|Sexual Harassment, or sekuhara in Japanese, {{appeared}} most {{dramatically in}} Japanese discourse in 1989, when {{a court case}} in Fukuoka {{ruled in favor of}} an woman who had been subjected to the spreading of sexual rumors by a co-worker. When the case was first reported, it spawned a flurry of public interest: 10 books were published, including English-language feminist guidebooks to ‘how not to harass women’ texts for men. Sekuhara was named 1989’s ‘Word of the Year.’ The case was resolved in the victim’s favor in 1992, awarding her about $13,000 in damages, the <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> harassment lawsuit in Japanese history.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Wrangler {{made the}} move to heterosexual-adult film, making his debut in China Sisters which {{included}} his <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> encounter with a woman on film. He quickly {{made a number of}} well-known and popular straight-adult films, including Jack and Jill, Roommates, and The Devil in Miss Jones 2. He was a favorite of director Chuck Vincent, the critically acclaimed, openly gay director of some of the top straight-adult films of the 1970s and 1980s. Vincent's films subvert straight porn's traditional focus on the female body by focusing on Wrangler's body and fixing the viewer's eye on the male (rather than female) sexual experience.|$|E

25|$|An HPV {{infection}} {{is caused by}} human papillomavirus, a DNA virus from the papillomavirus family, of which over 170 types are known. More than 40 types are transmitted through sexual contact and infect the anus and genitals. Risk factors for persistent HPV infections include early age of <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> intercourse, multiple partners, smoking, and poor immune function. HPV is typically spread by sustained direct skin-to-skin contact with vaginal and anal sex being the most common methods. Occasionally, it can spread from a mother to her baby during pregnancy. It does not spread via common items like toilet seats. People can become infected {{with more than one}} type of HPV. HPV only affects humans.|$|E
25|$|Romantic {{relationships}} tend {{to increase}} in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month {{over the course of}} the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence. Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity. While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.|$|E
25|$|For the {{advantage}} due to genetic variation, {{there are three}} possible reasons this might happen. <b>First,</b> <b>sexual</b> reproduction can combine the effects of two beneficial mutations in the same individual (i.e. sex aids in the spread of advantageous traits). Also, the necessary mutations {{do not have to}} have occurred one after another in a single line of descendants. Second, sex acts to bring together currently deleterious mutations to create severely unfit individuals that are then eliminated from the population (i.e. sex aids in the removal of deleterious genes). However, in organisms containing only one set of chromosomes, deleterious mutations would be eliminated immediately, and therefore removal of harmful mutations is an unlikely benefit for sexual reproduction. Lastly, sex creates new gene combinations that may be more fit than previously existing ones, or may simply lead to reduced competition among relatives.|$|E

Notoriously philandering into his old age, Crevedia boasted that his <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> encounters were war widows. Upon the end of war, he walked to Bucharest, the national capital, in order to complete his education. In 1923–1924, he was a clerk at the War Ministry, making his published debut in 1924, in the journal Cultul Eroilor Noștri. Crevedia graduated from Saint Sava High School in 1925, and then pursued a degree in Slavic studies at the University of Bucharest. Although he learned Latin and the rudiments of Bulgarian, he never in fact took his degree. He belonged to the sociological research teams led by Dimitrie Gusti and worked for a while as a substitute teacher, then as a private tutor.|$|E
25|$|Having {{discovered}} his sexual inclination early in life, Negoiţescu {{claimed to have}} had his <b>first</b> <b>sexual</b> experiences while still a young boy. According to his own testimony, he made his coming out at around age sixteen, when he wrote about his homosexuality in a test paper which he then handed to his supervising teacher.

Negoiţescu later openly assumed his sexual identity and, in contrast to other gay men of 20th century Romania, did not deny {{it in front of}} the conservative cultural establishment (see LGBT rights in Romania). At the time however, the various ways in which the adolescent Negoiţescu disregarded social conventions caused a rift between him and his parents, resulting in the first of his several suicide attempts. Negoiţescu's subsequent life was marked by successive bouts of clinical depression and self-hatred.|$|E
