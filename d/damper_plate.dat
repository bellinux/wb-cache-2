40|$|As part of {{research}} into the effect of underwater noise on the communication between an under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and it’s stationary launch vessel (the Aurora Australis), fast multipole boundary element method (FMBEM) acoustic modeling was conducted. In particular, a steel <b>damping</b> <b>plate</b> with a complex 3 -dimensional structure was modeled (using up to 1. 6 x 10 5 boundary elements) {{and the effect of}} sound scattering from a pinger near the ship was determined at the receiver hydrophone, which was in close proximity to the <b>damping</b> <b>plate.</b> The direct incident field from the pinger was modeled as a plane wave at a number of incidence angles (to account for the depths to which the hydrophone was lowered) and over a range of frequencies up to the pinger frequency of 10 kHz. This paper presents these results and discusses some of the interesting effects observed at the ‘non-unique’ frequencies when using the different methods available to provide stability to the numerical solution. Thus far, the modeling conducted for the <b>damping</b> <b>plate</b> has treated the object as rigid.

40|$|International audienceThe {{vibration}} of a plate partially {{covered with}} a passive constrained layer damping (PCLD) patch is studied from an energetic point of view. The <b>damped</b> <b>plate</b> is excited by an acoustic plane wave. The study is done with a numerical two-dimensional multilayer plate model. Results of the present model are compared to those obtained with three-dimensional finite element models. It is shown that the present model gives accurate results, even for the layer's inner behavior. It is less expansive in terms of computational cost; hence, it can simulate efficiently the structure for higher frequencies. Mathematical formulas for complex mechanical power are presented, and the link with strain and kinetic energies and dissipated power is detailed. Both local and global complex power balance are established, and corresponding expressions for the discretized problem are formulated. Conservative and dissipative powers are studied for the PCLD <b>damped</b> <b>plate.</b> After a global balance analysis versus frequency, a local study {{has been carried out}} in order to quantify the relative contribution of the components of strain and stress tensors to the total strain energy and dissipated power; the individual layer's contributions is also investigated.

40|$|On {{a compact}} Riemannian {{manifold}} with boundary, we prove a spectral inequality for the bi-Laplace operator {{in the case}} of so-called " clamped " boundary conditions, that is, homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann conditions simultaneously. We also prove a resolvent estimate for the generator of the <b>damped</b> <b>plate</b> semigroup associated with these boundary conditions. The spectral inequality allows one to observe finite sums of eigenfunctions for this fourth-order elliptic operator, from an arbitrary open subset of the manifold. Moreover, the constant that appears in the inequality grows as exp(Cµ 1 / 4) where µ is the largest eigenvalue associated with the eigenfunctions appearing in the sum. This type of inequality is known for the Laplace operator. As an application, we obtain a null-controllability result for a higher-order parabolic equation. The resolvent estimate provides the spectral behavior of the plate semigroup generator on the imaginary axis. This type of estimate is known {{in the case of}} the damped wave semigroup. As an application, we deduce a stabilization result for the <b>damped</b> <b>plate</b> equation, with a log-type decay. The proofs of both the spectral inequality and the resolvent estimate are based on the derivation of different types of Carleman estimates for an elliptic operator related to the bi-Laplace operator: in the interior and at some boundaries. One of these estimates exhibits a loss of one full derivative. Its proof requires the introduction of an appropriate semi-classical calculus and a delicate microlocal argument...|$|R

The layers significantly increased the damping in the composite laminates. The use of the constrained viscoelastic film {{as an integral part}} of composite structures appears to be a feasible approach to passive vibration control.

A single complex eigenvalue analysis is then performed in which the eigenvalues are purely imaginary. The loss factor is computed by the modal strain energy (MSE) approach. In the the MSE approach, the loss factor of a composite structure vibrating in one of its natural modes may be visualized as a weighted average of the loss factors of the component parts, with the relative stored energies as weighting constants. The finite element procedure, which can treat very general geometries, is illustrated for the case of a vibrating constrained-layer <b>damped</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

30|$|It is {{well known}} that Crauel and Flandoli {{originally}} introduced the random attractor for the infinite-dimensional RDS [11, 12]. A random attractor of RDS is a measurable and compact invariant random set attracting all orbits. It is the appropriate generalization of the now classical attractor from the deterministic dynamical systems to RDS. The reason is that if such a random attractor exists, it is the smallest attracting compact set and the largest invariant set [13]. These abstract results have been successfully applied to many stochastic dissipative partial differential equations. For instance, Fan [14] proved the existence of a random attractor for a damped Sine-Gordon equation with white noise. The existence of random attractors for the wave equations has been investigated by several authors [15 – 17]. Yang et al. [18] studied random attractors for stochastic semi-linear degenerate parabolic equations. Ma and Ma [19] investigated attractors for stochastic strongly <b>damped</b> <b>plate</b> equations with additive noise.
