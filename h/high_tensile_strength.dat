5|$|Steel is an alloy of {{iron and}} carbon with trace amounts of other elements. Because of its <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and low cost, {{it is a major}} {{component}} used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of glass fiber used in {{fiberglass}} is E-glass, which is alumino-borosilicate glass {{with less than}} 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are A-glass (Alkali-lime glass {{with little or no}} boron oxide), E-CR-glass (Electrical/Chemical Resistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (borosilicate glass, named for its low Dielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement), and S-glass (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength).</b>|$|E

50|$|M5 has a <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than Aramid (Kevlar, Twaron) and UHMWPE (Dyneema, Spectra).|$|R
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E
25|$|Most silks, in {{particular}} dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and extensibility (ductility). This enables a silk fibre to absorb {{a large amount}} of energy before breaking (toughness, the area under a stress-strain curve).|$|E
50|$|Concrete and {{ceramics}} {{typically have}} much <b>higher</b> compressive <b>strengths</b> than <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths.</b> Composite materials, such as glass fiber epoxy matrix composite, {{tend to have}} <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> than compressive strengths. Metals tend to have <b>tensile</b> and compressive <b>strengths</b> that are very similar.|$|R
30|$|The <b>highest</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and MOR among WPCs were {{observed}} for both FDWF and HDWF at a milling time of 30  min. In {{the case of}} FDWF, trends in <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> were consistent with trends in 100 – 300  µm particle size behavior.|$|R
40|$|Airborne-particle {{abrasion}} before cementation of polymeric CAD/CAM crowns minimally {{improved the}} <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Both the failure types and the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> values of adhesively luted glass ceramic crowns showed superior results to adhesively cemented polymeric ones. Although the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> results were low, crowns cemented with RXU showed, after aging, the <b>highest</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> {{of all other}} tested groups...|$|R
25|$|HDPE has <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> It {{is used in}} {{products}} and packaging such as milk jugs, detergent bottles, butter tubs, garbage containers, and water pipes. One-third of all toys are manufactured from HDPE. In 2007, the global HDPE consumption reached a volume of more than 30 million tons.|$|E
25|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, truss {{systems of}} wrought iron were {{developed}} for larger bridges, but iron {{does not have}} the tensile strength to support large loads. With the advent of steel, which has a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> much larger bridges were built, many using the ideas of Gustave Eiffel.|$|E
25|$|Composite {{material}} {{structures are}} made of cloth with a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> (usually fiberglass or carbon fiber, or occasionally Kevlar) combined with a structural plastic (usually epoxy, although vinylester is used in some aircraft). The fabric is saturated with the structural plastic in a liquid form; when the plastic cures and hardens, the part will hold its shape while possessing the strength characteristics of the fabric.|$|E
50|$|Steel fibre-reinforced {{shotcrete}} (SFRS) is shotcrete (spray concrete) {{with steel}} fibres added. It has <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than unreinforced shotcrete and is quicker to apply than weldmesh reinforcement. It {{has often been}} used for tunnels.|$|R
50|$|Plant-derived {{cellulose}} {{is usually}} {{found in a}} mixture with hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and other substances, while bacterial cellulose is quite pure, has a much higher water content and <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> due to <b>higher</b> chain lengths.|$|R
5000|$|The {{term was}} used in both the {{original}} 1933 version, {{as well as the}} 2005 remake, of King Kong. When Kong is brought to New York City, he is chained with this metal on stage. The impression given by the movie from Carl Denham to the audience is that the [...] "chrome steel" [...] has some unique properties of having a <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than [...] "normal steel" [...] which is incorrect. The chromium component of chrome steel would only provide some corrosion resistance. <b>Higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> steels are created by the addition of carbon. True to this deceptive description, Kong breaks free anyway.|$|R
25|$|Copper’s higher tensile {{strength}} (200–250 N/mm2 annealed) compared to aluminium (100 N/mm2 for typical conductor alloys) {{is another reason}} why copper is used extensively in the building industry. Copper’s high strength resists stretching, neck-down, creep, nicks and breaks, and thereby also prevents failures and service interruptions. Copper is much heavier than aluminum for conductors of equal current carrying capacity, so the <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> is offset by its increased weight.|$|E
25|$|White & grey {{aluminium}} oxide abrasives are used on <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> metals, such as carbon and alloy steel, tough iron, and nonferrous alloys. Gray silicon carbide abrasives are used on hard and brittle substances, such as grey iron and cemented carbide, and low tensile strength metals, such as brass, aluminium, and copper. Green chromium (III) oxide is the abrasive used in green compounds that are typically used to finish ferrous metals (steels).|$|E
25|$|Filament tape or {{strapping}} tape is a {{pressure-sensitive tape}} used for several packaging {{functions such as}} closing corrugated fiberboard boxes, reinforcing packages, bundling items, pallet utilizing, etc. It consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film and fiberglass filaments embedded to add <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Filament tape was invented in 1946 by Cyrus Woodrow Bemmels. In 1949, it {{was placed on the}} market and was an immediate success.|$|E
50|$|First {{generation}} flywheel {{energy storage}} systems use a large steel flywheel rotating on mechanical bearings. Newer systems use carbon-fiber composite rotors that have a <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than steel and are {{an order of magnitude}} less heavy.|$|R
30|$|Since carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have the}} sp 2 bonds {{between the individual}} carbon atoms, they have a <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than steel and Kevlar. This bond is even stronger than the sp 3 bond found in diamond. Theoretically, SWCNTs may really have a <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> hundreds of times stronger than steel.|$|R
30|$|The {{heat input}} governs the above said {{strengthening}} mechanism. Decrease in heat input {{will increase the}} strengthening effects. Thus, the UWFSW joint recorded higher hardness in the entire region than the FSW joint and therefor the UWFSW joint exhibited <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than the FSW joint. The <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> is attributed {{to the presence of}} relatively fine grains, high volume fraction of precipitates and appreciably narrow LHDR. On comparing the four joint conditions (FSW-THC, FSW-TTC, UWFSW-THC and UWFSW-TTC), the UWFSW-TTC joint shows enhanced tensile and hardness properties because this joint experience the lowest temperature compared to its counterparts. So, the pin profile capable of formation of the defect-free stir zone at the minimum heat input is appreciable.|$|R
25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though luminal stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating radiocontrast agent to simply escape into the blood.|$|E
25|$|The intermolecular {{forces in}} {{polymers}} {{can be affected}} by dipoles in the monomer units. Polymers containing amide or carbonyl groups can form hydrogen bonds between adjacent chains; the partially positively charged hydrogen atoms in N-H groups of one chain are strongly attracted to the partially negatively charged oxygen atoms in C=O groups on another. These strong hydrogen bonds, for example, result in the <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and melting point of polymers containing urethane or urea linkages. Polyesters have dipole-dipole bonding between the oxygen atoms in C=O groups and the hydrogen atoms in H-C groups. Dipole bonding is {{not as strong as}} hydrogen bonding, so a polyester's melting point and strength are lower than Kevlar's (Twaron), but polyesters have greater flexibility.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} space drives that need {{little or no}} reaction mass to function. A tether propulsion system employs a long cable with a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> to change a spacecraft's orbit, such as by interaction with a planet's magnetic field or through momentum exchange with another object. Solar sails rely on radiation pressure from electromagnetic energy, but they require a large collection surface to function effectively. The magnetic sail deflects charged particles from the solar wind with a magnetic field, thereby imparting momentum to the spacecraft. A variant is the mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion system, which uses a small cloud of plasma held in a magnetic field to deflect the Sun's charged particles. An E-sail would use very thin and lightweight wires holding an electric charge to deflect these particles, and may have more controllable directionality.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} {{was investigated}} {{the condition of}} reinforcement of hemp fiber and hemp fiber/epoxy resin composites with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CNTs were mixed with several liquid such as ethanol, latex, water glue and epoxy resin. These mixtures were added to hemp fiber and prepared the hemp fiber/epoxy resin composites. The mechanical properties of both fiber and composite samples were measured. It {{was found that the}} mixture of epoxy resin and CNTs with CNTs ratio of 20 vol % in hemp fiber showed the <b>highest</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of 25. 43 N. and the same mixture in hemp fiber/epoxy resin composites showed the <b>highest</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of 31. 82 MPa and elongation of 7. 40 %...|$|R
40|$|Sugarcane bagasse {{was treated}} to obtain sawdust, in {{addition}} to mechanical, thermomechanical, and chemical-thermomechanical pulps. The obtained fibers were used to obtain reinforced polypropylene composites prepared by injection molding. Coupling agent contents ranging from 2 to 10 % w/w {{were added to the}} composite to obtain the <b>highest</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> All the composites included 30 % w/w of reinforcing fibers. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of the different sugarcane bagasse fiber composites were tested and discussed. The results were compared with that of other natural fiber- or glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene composites. Pulp-based composites showed <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than sawdust-based composites. A micromechanical analysis showed the relationship of some micromechanical properties to the orientation angle, critical length, the intrinsic <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> and the interfacial shear strength. The pulps showed similar intrinsic <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> and were <b>higher</b> than that of sawdust. The properties of the sugarcane bagasse composites compared well with other natural fiber-reinforced composite...|$|R
25|$|The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of a {{material}} quantifies how much elongating stress the material will endure before failure. This {{is very important}} in applications that rely upon a polymer's physical strength or durability. For example, a rubber band with a <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> will hold a greater weight before snapping. In general, <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> increases with polymer chain length and crosslinking of polymer chains.|$|R
25|$|The {{middle lamella}} is laid down first, formed from the cell plate during cytokinesis, {{and the primary}} cell wall is then {{deposited}} inside the middle lamella. The actual structure of the cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model. However, the primary cell wall, {{can be defined as}} composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles. Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle lamella, which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid). Cells interact though plasmodesmata, which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.|$|E
500|$|Because {{titanium}} alloys have <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> to density ratio, high corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, high crack resistance, {{and ability to}} withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, they are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles. For these applications, titanium is alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts, fire walls, landing gear, exhaust ducts (helicopters), and hydraulic systems. In fact, about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames. The SR-71 [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{was one of the}} first aircraft frames where titanium was used, paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft. An estimated 59 metric tons (130,000 pounds) are used in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 18 in the Boeing 737, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons, including about 11 tons in the engines. In engine applications, titanium is used for rotors, compressor blades, hydraulic system components, and nacelles. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.|$|E
500|$|Pure silica (silicon dioxide), when cooled as {{fused quartz}} {{into a glass}} with no true melting point, {{can be used as}} a glass fiber for fiberglass, but has the {{drawback}} that it must be worked at very high temperatures. In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as [...] "fluxing agents" [...] (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass ("A" [...] for [...] "alkali-lime") or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called cullet glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass ("E" [...] because of initial electrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of boron minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass ("S" [...] for [...] "Strength") is used when <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> (modulus) is important, and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction. The same substance is known as R-glass ("R" [...] for [...] "reinforcement") in Europe. C-glass ("C" [...] for [...] "chemical resistance") and T-glass ("T" [...] is for [...] "thermal insulator" [...] – a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.|$|E

40|$|Mo-Zr and Mo-Ti alloy were {{fabricated}} by {{powder metallurgy}} process, {{the effect of}} the adding forms and addition amount of Zr, Ti on the tensile property and microstructure of the alloy were studied. The results indicate that the addition of the alloyed element Zr, Ti obliviously enhances the mechanical property of molybdenum.
