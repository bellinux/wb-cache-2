25|$|Taken from New York Times Sunday Book Review, January 2, 2015, Richard Dunn's 'A Tale of Two Plantations' a {{comparison}} and contrasting of Mesopotamia Plantation on Jamaica and Mount Airy Plantation in Virginia: In Virginia, John Tayloe III, master of Mount Airy from 1792 to 1828, bred horses and slaves. The horses he raced, earning him the reputation “as the leading Virginia turfman of his generation.” The slaves he worked and sold. “There were,” Author Richard Dunn counts, “252 recorded slave births and 142 slave deaths at Mount Airy between 1809 and 1828, providing John III with 110 extra slaves.” These slaves treatment Dunn notes, comparatively to Mas Tayloe, a fourth-generation enslaver, moved {{some of these}} surplus people around his other Virginia holdings and transferred others to his sons. The rest he sold, providing Tayloe with both needed capital {{and an opportunity to}} cull unproductive workers, keeping his labor <b>force</b> <b>fit</b> and young.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} summer, 1943, the USAAF fighters {{operated}} over German air {{space for the}} first time. Several aircraft crashed near Aachen {{on the cusp of}} Germany's west border. Galland presented these wrecks as proof that the Luftwaffe was facing an enemy that could soon escort its heavy bombers with fighter aircraft to industrial targets inside Germany. Galland submitted his findings to Göring. Göring was livid with Galland and the fighter force. The Reichsmarschall called the report the [...] "rantings of a worn-out defeatist", and gave Galland an [...] "order", that no Allied fighters had crossed into Germany. Göring declared the only possible reason could have been that short range fighters ran out of fuel at high altitude and [...] "they were shot down much further west... and glided quite a distance before they crashed. Galland and Milch denied this. Galland questioned why an Allied pilot would choose to glide east instead of west. Both men also argued that they must increase fighter production to reach a three or fourfold advantage over the attackers immediately to prepare for this new threat. Galland's efforts to produce a fighter <b>force</b> <b>fit</b> for a war of attrition conflicted with Göring's bias in favour of bombers, to maintain the offensive on all fronts.

The number and size of our vessels are known, and the Portuguese, questionless, have resorted to the means necessary to effect their purposes, whatever those purposes may be. Alas! Luis, my lot hath been hard, though I humbly trust that the end will repay me for all! Years did I sue the Portuguese to enter fairly into this voyage, and to endeavor to do that, in all honor, which our gracious mistress, Doña Isabella, hath now so creditably commenced; he listened to my reasons and entreaties with cold ears--nay, repelled them, with ridicule and disdain; and yet, here am I scarce fairly embarked in the execution of schemes that they have so often derided, than they endeavor to defeat me by violence and treachery." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{man who has}} had his way {{is seldom}} happy, for {{generally}} he finds that the way does not lead very far on this earth of desires which can never be fully satisfied. Anthony had entered with extreme precipitation the enchanted gardens of Armida saying to himself [...] "At last!" [...] As to Armida, herself, {{he was not going}} to offer her any violence. But now he had discovered that all the enchantment was in Armida herself, in Armida's smiles. This Armida did not smile. She existed, unapproachable, behind the blank wall of his renunciation. His <b>force,</b> <b>fit</b> for action, experienced the impatience, the indignation, almost the despair of his vitality arrested, bound, stilled, progressively worn down, frittered away by Time; by that force blind and insensible, which seems inert and yet uses one's life up by its imperceptible action, dropping minute after minute on one's living heart like drops of water wearing down a stone.|$|E

60|$|Towards {{the end of}} May, Washington {{broke up}} his cantonments at Morristown, and shifted his camp to Middlebrook, within ten miles of Brunswick. His whole <b>force</b> <b>fit</b> for duty was now about seven {{thousand}} three hundred men, all from the States south of the Hudson. There were forty-three regiments, forming ten brigades, commanded by Brigadiers Muhlenberg, Weedon, Woodford, Scott, Smallwood, Deborre, Wayne, Dehaas, Conway, and Maxwell. These were apportioned into five divisions of two brigades each, under Major-generals Greene, Stephen, Sullivan, Lincoln and Stirling. The artillery was commanded by Knox. Sullivan, with his division, was stationed on the right at Princeton. With {{the rest of his}} force, Washington fortified himself in a position naturally strong, among hills, {{in the rear of the}} village of Middlebrook. His camp was, on all sides, difficult of approach, and he rendered it still more so by intrenchments. The high grounds about it commanded a wide view of the country around Brunswick, the road to Philadelphia, and the course of the Raritan, so that the enemy could make no important movement on land without his perceiving it.|$|E
60|$|But {{that brings}} me to my second contention, {{which is that we}} do not want such an army. I believe that the vast masses of men in uniform {{maintained}} by the Continental Powers at the present time are enormously overrated as fighting machines. I see Germany in the likeness of a boxer with a mailed fist as big as and rather heavier than its body, and I am convinced that when the moment comes for that mailed fist to be lifted, the whole disproportionate system will topple over. The military ascendancy of the future lies with the country that dares to experiment most, that experiments best, and meanwhile keeps its actual fighting <b>force</b> <b>fit</b> and admirable and small and flexible. The experience of war during the last fifteen years has been to show repeatedly the enormous defensive power of small, scientifically handled bodies of men. These huge conscript armies are made up not of masses of military muscle, but of a huge proportion of military fat. Their one way of fighting will be to fall upon an antagonist with all their available weight, and if he is mobile and dexterous enough to decline that issue of adiposity they will become a mere embarrassment to their own people. Modern weapons and modern contrivance are continually decreasing the number of men who can be employed efficiently upon a length of front. I doubt if there is any use for more than 400,000 men upon the whole Franco-Belgian frontier at the present time. Such an army, properly supplied, could--so far as terrestrial forces are concerned--hold that frontier against any number of assailants. The bigger the forces brought against it the sooner the exhaustion of the attacking power. Now, it is for employment upon that frontier, and for no other conceivable purpose in the world, that Great Britain is asked to create a gigantic conscript army.|$|E

The {{experimental results}} of four tested configurations showed that the force transmission {{is based on the}} three joining mechanisms: <b>force</b> <b>fit,</b> direct adhesion and form fit.

Experimental results also show that {{the behavior of the}} combination is dependent on the interaction of the single joining mechanisms.

It is demonstrated how the developed simulation tool can be used to support the selection of the best joint configurations...|$|E
40|$|We fit a new gold {{embedded}} atom method (EAM) potential {{using an}} improved force matching methodology which included fitting to high-temperature solid lattice constants and liquid densities. The new potential shows a good overall improvement in agreement {{to the experimental}} lattice constants, elastic constants, stacking fault energy, radial distribution function, and fcc/hcp/bcc lattice energy differences over previous potentials by Foiles, Baskes, and Daw (FBD) [Phys. Rev. B 33, 7983 (1986) ] Johnson [Phys. Rev. B 37, 3924 (1988) ], and the glue model potential by Ercolessi [Philos. Mag. A 50, 213 (1988) ]. Surface energy was improved slightly as compared to potentials by FBD and Johnson {{but as a result}} vacancy formation energy is slightly inferior as compared to the same potentials. The results obtained here for gold suggest for other metal species that further overall improvements in potentials may still be possible within the EAM framework with an improved fitting methodology. On the other hand, we also explore the limitations of the EAM framework by attempting a brute <b>force</b> <b>fit</b> to all properties exactly which was found to be unsuccessful. The main conflict in such a brute <b>force</b> <b>fit</b> was between the surface energy and the liquid lattice constant where both could not be fitted identically. By intentionally using {{a very large number of}} spline sections for the pair potential, electron-density function, and embedding energy function, we eliminated a lack of functional freedom as a possible cause of this conflict and hence can conclude that it must result from a fundamental limitation in the EAM framework...|$|E
