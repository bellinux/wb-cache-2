40|$|The {{continuing}} development of new, highly sophisticated {{materials for the}} articulating surfaces of total hip endoprostheses involves the need for testing, not only of biocompatibility and dynamic loadability, but also of tribological properties (friction, wear, lubrication). For decades, the wear resistance of these materials has been tested in wear simulators. In consequence of the currently often widely differing test methods, the technical committee (TC 150) of the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has been concerned to develop an International Standard (ISO/FDIS 14242 1 and 2 : Implants for Surgery - wear of total hip joint prostheses - {{on the basis of}} kinetic and kinematic data from gait analysis.

Calcium phosphates identical to natural bone minerals are such materials. HAp could be prepared by various methods {{from which the}} level of crystallinity and also particle size depends on. The reaction activity of HAp is determined by chemical, phase and granulometric composition, and by morphology and grain boundaries. Various additives are used to advance mechanical strength. Sol-gel process is a perspective technique to develop ceramic materials from liquid precursors. Low mechanical strength characteristics of HAp restrict the application of HAp implant materials. Sol-gel method gives tools to prepare mechanically resistant materials with high homogeneity level and low thermal expansion coefficient at relatively low temperatures.

40|$|SUMMARY Background: Evaluation of the {{efficacy}} of the percutaneous transhepatic insertion of metallic <b>endoprothesis</b> in 53 patients with biliary obstruction. Materials and methods: From September 1994 to December 2001, 83 patients with obstructive jaundice, 79 with malignancy and 4 with benign obstruction, aged 29 - 92 years (mean age 67, 3 years), attended the Radiology Department of our hospital. In 3 patients, the findings of percutaneous cholangiography did not indicate any further access. 68 metallic stents were implanted in 53 out of the 80 remaining patients, whereas the other 27 patients were treated with percutaneous biliary drainage: external drainage was performed in 21 patients in order to assist a following operation, and a combined internal-external drainage in 6 patients. Hemobilia occured in one patient and required embolization of the right hepatic artery. In 5 cases a new procedure was needed because of the occlusion of the endoprotheses after 40 - 278 days. Results: Clinical improvement and decrease in serum bilirubin levels was achieved in all patients. The survival time in patients with malignancy ranged between 6 to 485 days (mean survival time 139 days). Obviously, the patients who were treated with implantation of an <b>endoprothesis</b> had a better quality of life in comparison to those treated only with external or internal-external drainages and were not subsequently operated.

However most patients present with advanced disease and cannot be considered as candidates for curative surgery. Palliative therapies with <b>endoprotheses</b> and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy have shown poor results with limited survival time. This retrospective study presents long-term outcome in patients undergoing photodynamic therapy (PDT) in a single centre during a 10 -year period. In 63 patients diagnosed with Klatskin tumour (94 % Bismuth-IV) median survival time was 493 days, 30 -day mortality rate was 0 % and overall one-year-survival was > 60 %. There {{was no significant difference}} between chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy subgroups. After PDT there was a reversible increase in biochemical markers of cholestasis in 46, 81 % (1 - 3 days after treatment). However only 19, 15 % of patients developed cholangitis (4 - 7 days after PDT). In contrast to previous studies there was no significant decrease of bilirubin within the first week after PDT. Nevertheless a significant decrease of bilirubin can be expected in the long-term follow-up. In patients with advanced hilar cholangiocarcinoma, not eligible for surgery, PDT is a practicable and safe therapeutic option.

40|$|Nos últimos anos, foram desenvolvidas diversas modalidades alternativas para o tratamento da HPB. Entre elas, incluem-se terapêuticas medicamentosas e aquelas que se convencionou denominar de minimamente invasivas. Estas últimas fundamentam-se na aplicação de calor (hipertermia e termoterapia), de laser, de radiofreqüência, de ultrasom, na dilatação uretral com balões, na colocação de endopróteses uretrais e na incisão transuretral da próstata. Entre os métodos que utilizam o calor para tratamento da HPB, encontra-se a termoterapia induzida pela água ou WIT (water induced thermotherapy). Com o objetivo de se estudar os efeitos do calor sobre a próstata, foi realizado este trabalho experimental, que utilizou o equipamento ThermoflexTM (Argomed Ltda.), o qual, de modo controlado, produz aquecimento da água que circula de um reservatório até a extremidade de uma sonda tipo Foley, onde existe um balão insuflável termotransmissor, que deve ser posicionado na uretra prostática. Utilizou-se, no experimento, 27 cães, sem raça definida, com peso variando de 11, 5 a 32, 0 kg, distribuídos em três subgrupos controles (n= 9) e três experimentais (n= 18). Os animais foram sacrificados 12, 72 horas e duas semanas (momentos M 1, M 2 e M 3) após o procedimento. Nessa ocasião, as próstatas foram removidas e seus volumes foram aferidos por gravimetria, volume de água deslocado em bureta, peso do volume de água deslocado e, indiretamente, pelas medidas dos eixos cranio-caudal, dorsoventral e latero-lateral, com um paquímetro.

Over {{the past}} years, several {{alternative}} treatments for Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) {{have been developed}} including drug therapies and the so called “minimally invasive” therapies. These latter {{are based on the}} application of heat (hyperthermia and thermotherapy), laser, radiofrequency, ultrasound; balloon urethral dilation; placement of urethral <b>endoprotheses</b> and transurethral incision of the prostate. One of the methods that use heat to treat BPH is water-induced thermotherapy (WIT). The present experimental work was undertaken with the purpose of studying the effects of heat on the prostate using ThermoflexTM (Argomed Ltda.), a device that heats the water that circulates from a reservoir to the tip of a Foley-like catheter, which has an inflatable thermotransmitting balloon that is placed in the prostatic urethra. Twenty-seven mongrel dogs, weighing 11. 5 - 32. 0 kg, were divided into three control (N= 9) and three experimental (N= 18) subgroups. The animals were sacrificed 12 hrs., 72 hrs. and two weeks (moments M 1, M 2 and M 3, respectively) after heat application. Their prostates were removed and prostatic volume was estimated by gravimetry, the amount of water displaced from a burette, weight of the displaced water volume and, indirectly, by measuring the cranio-caudal, dorso-ventral and latero-lateral axes with a pachymeter.

40|$|For {{treatment}} of abdominal aortic aneurysms transfemoral, endovascular stented graft repair can satisfactorily be performed. Postinterventional, typical complications as endoleaks, thrombosis and structural failure are described, which make long-term follow-up imaging necessary. Computed tomography (CT) has been recommended {{as a primary}} imaging technique. However, metallic implants such as stents often cause severe artifacts (such as beam-hardening and partial volume artifacts), which can limit the assessment of both the lumen and the surrounding tissue. Additionally the required radiation dose should be considered. Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (3 D CE-MRA) has become competitive as a diagnostic modality. The MR compatibility of stents regarding security and visualization has already been confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. However, typical susceptibility and nonsusceptibility artifacts like eddy currents or radio-frequency shielding are known to drastically reduce MR image quality. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the imaging appearance of routinely used bifurcated and tubular endoprostheses in contrast-enhanced 3 D-MRA. Firstly, the influence of different sequence parameters on the representation is evaluated, in order to specify the optimal sequence for further investigations. Secondly, quantitative signal and artifact investigations allow the identification of stent characteristics in order to establish a ranking of visualization. Thirdly, these images are evaluated in comparison with the appearance of the <b>endoprotheses</b> in computed tomography. Finally, diagnostic recommendations are drafted for each endoprosthesis. The variation of sequence parameters shows that the echo time (TE) affects the visualization most strongly; a short echo time reduces susceptibility artifacts of gradient echo sequences. The flip angle (FA) affects the RF caging inside the stents. A flip angle of 40 ° provides good visualization, the application of higher flip angles may even improve in-stent visualization. A smaller field-of-view (FOV) leads to a better representation of the prosthesis lumen by reducing the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). A change of the water fat shift (WFS) does not affect the lumen visualization. Parameters of the optimized sequence are TR 8. 1 ms, TE 1. 3 ms, FA 40 °, FOV 300 mm³, WFS 0. 700. Both geometry of the stents and underlying material composition are associated with MR imaging artifacts. Due to the different susceptibility bifurcated protheses made from Nitinol show a better in-stent lumen visualization than stents from cobalt alloys; the stainless steel prosthesis is not MR compatible. A close meshed geometry relates to worse lumen visualization, probably because of radio frequency shielding. In CT, the influence of beamlike artifacts on the lumen visualization is evident. These mainly derive from platinum and gold markers. Finally, diagnostic recommendations are drafted for each endoprosthesis: MRA should be preferred for the bifurcated stentgrafts by Talent and Vanguard. The Gore prostheses and the Talent tubular prosthesis are suitable both for CT and MRA. CT is the prime imaging modality for AneuRx, Lifepath and Bard bifurcated stentgrafts and the only suitable imaging modality for the prostheses by Corvita and Zenith. For the Ancure prostheses the combination of both imaging modalities is recommended...|$|R

Results of this research, in its primary goal, show that: the "main effect" of factors in the gene TNF-α 1 on position - 308 is statistically relevant, but due to small number of the patients, {{it was not possible to}} assesss relative risk for genotype G/G comparing to the presence of "A-alel"; statistically, there is much greater risk combined with the genotype T/T on position 29 in the gene TGF-β 1 with respect to the mostcommon genotype on that position (T/C), that is with respect to gennotypes that include the "C-allele"; that it is statistically significant or of bordering significance greater risk combined with the genotype G/A on the position - 597 within the gene IL- 6, that is with the genotype C/C on position - 572 in the same area; much greater risk has been found in association with a combination of genotypes G/A - 597 / C/C - 572 in the gene IL - 6 with respect to other genotype combinations on these two positions.

Application of metal stents in the renal canal system was attempted in order to eliminate BCD and PCN - related limitations as well as poor therapeutic results of these methods in a number of etiopathogenic groups of urinary stasis. Years - long application of interventional uroradiology methods, until the development of metallic stengts had shown the following therapeutics facts: PCN is incapable to resolve the cause of urinary obstruction. Permanent good therapeutic BCD results mostly depend on pathohistological aspect of the stricture, metallic stents are most frequently the last choice in therapeutics approch to urinary tract obstructions and their application is directly dependent on previous therapeutics results accomplished by PCN and BCD.

This pattern calculates the displacements, the stresses (constraints) and the deformations of the two arteries’ walls enabling us to know their experimentally determined mechanical and geometric properties. This pattern could be applied to detect the aneurysm and dissection phenomena...|$|E
30|$|Bone sarcomas in {{children}} and young adults are rare but highly malignant. The most frequent histological types are osteosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma. The treatment method for these tumors in the extremities consists of chemotherapy and surgical tumor resection [1, 2]. This combined treatment has led to a significantly increased survival rate since it was introduced in the 1970 s [3]. The five-year survival rate in patients with non-metastatic disease is above 70  %. The introduction of chemotherapy combined with the development of imaging and surgical techniques has made it possible to perform bone tumor resections and limb-sparing surgery in more than 80  % of cases without incurring increased mortality [4, 5]. Large bony defects in the middle or distal third of the tibia resulting from surgical resection of malignant bone tumors present a difficult reconstructive challenge. Various methods are available to the reconstructive surgeon, such as allografts, vascularized fibular graft (either free or pedicled), or <b>endoprothesis</b> replacement for distal defects [6].|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium lentiflavum is a nontuberculous, slowly growing {{mycobacterium}} usually {{recognized as}} a contaminant. Here, we report a case of disseminated M. lentiflavum infection responsible for hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis in a heart-trans-planted man. CASE REPORT In June 2013, a 65 -year-old man {{was admitted to the}} medical inten-sive care unit (ICU) of North Hospital in Marseille (France) for coma in the context of pancytopenia and fever. He had a medical history of heart transplantation for ischemic heart failure (2006), moderate renal failure, an abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with <b>endoprothesis</b> in 2011, and recurrent stays in Senegal. He presented with a 1 -year history of a chronic fever, splenomeg-aly, and pancytopenia. Fever developed in early June 2012 and was associated with a poor general condition and a loss of 9 kg in body weight. The patient was receiving tacrolimus and mycophenolate as maintenance immunosuppression regimens. All etiological evalua-tions for infectious diseases, including tropical diseases and solid an...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Primary coxarthrosis occurs {{often in}} older population. There is {{possibility}} of implanting both <b>endoprothesis</b> simultaneously in bilateral coxarthrosis which decreases hospitalization {{and reduces the}} expenses and possibility of complication that can occur during general anesthesia. The most serious indications for bilateral total hip arthroplasty in one procedure are younger patients with serious bilateral osteoarthrosis of the hips, without added diseases. Absolute contraindication is found in patients with persistent ductus arteriosus and septal defect. The {{aim of this study}} was to point out the possibility and advantages of a single-staged bilateral hip arthroplasty and introducing it in our orthopedic practice. Methods. The procedure was accomplished in 19 patients. The standard total hip arthroplasty surgical technique was performed, followed by the usual antibiotic and anticoagulant therapy. Results. Only one complication - acetabular part instability we recorded, followed by luxation that was surgically managed. Conclusion. This procedure can be performed routinely in selected population and should be reserved for major medical centers capable to provide adequate postoperative care...|$|E
40|$|New modular {{endoprosthesis}} CITO – MATI {{was developed}} and introduced in the clinical practice {{on the basis of}} the exploration of results of reconstructive interventions on knee joint area with the usage of different Russian and foreign endoprosthesis. The aim of our work was to compare the functional results and survival of CITO – MATI and Beznoska endoprosthesis. To the moment of the study among 59 patients, who had implanted Beznoska endoprosthesis, 16 (27 %) were secondly operated due to aseptic instability and the destruction of endoprosthesis components. Functional results of the Beznoska endoprosthesis application were good and excellent in 70, 7 %, and satisfactory in 29, 3 %. Among 107 patients with implanted CITO – MATI endoprosthesis 3 (2, 8 %) were operated because of the aseptic instability. The destruction of endoprosthesis components in the observed period of time was not revealed. Functional results of the CITO – MATI endoprosthesis application were good and excellent in 86, 6 % of cases, and satisfactory in 13, 4 %. It was revealed, that survival and functional results of the CITO – MATI endoprosthesis application are higher, than those of the Beznoska <b>endoprothesis.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Hepaticojejunostomy {{stricture}} {{could lead}} to long-term complication such as hepaticodocholithiasis, cholangitis, liver abscess formation, secondary biliary cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate feasibility and safety of revision hepaticojejunostomy after failure of metal stent. Methods: Revision of hepaticojejunostomy stricture after failure of metal endoprosthesis was done for 16 patients from February 2004 to May 2010. All patients presented by recurrence of symptoms and signs of biliary obstruction after percutanous management. Results: The study group consisted of 12 females and 4 males. The mean age was 35. 4 (range 22 – 60) years. The duration of metal stent prior to attempted revision ranged from 6 to 36 months. Fourteen patients were followed up for a mean period of 32. 6 (range 12 – 60) months. Twelve patients had excellent results; they never had jaundice or cholangitis. Two patients had good results with attacks of cholangitis at 13, 16 months after operation and both of them respond to conservative management within 72 hours. Conclusion: Surgical revision of hepaticojejunostomy after failure of metal <b>endoprothesis</b> is feasible and safe. Surgical revision is recommended from the start in such benign condition to avoid complication of metal stents...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Walking {{is one of}} {{the most}} common human movements. It means to {{transport}} the body safely and efficiently across ground level, uphill or downhill. Walking is learned during the first year of life and reaches maturity around the age of seven,remaining at the same level until 60. In old age one's walking performance starts to decline and it gradually slows down. With the increased life expectancy of the elderly and their more active lifestyle, there is now an emphasis on determining any changes that occur in their gait patterns, in order to indentify diagnostic measures that are usable for monitoring the rehabilitation process after <b>endoprothesis</b> implantation. The aim of this study is to determine how selected kinematical, kinetic and electromyographical parameters may change as a result of aging. A total of 31 healthy elderly subjects without any history of lower extremity joint pathology were investigated at constant gait speed (three km/h). The gait analysis equipment used consisted of an infinitely adjustable treadmill with force-plates and an ultrasoundbased motion analyser with a surface electromyograph. Spatial-temporal, angular, kinetic and electromyographical parameters were recorded for the lower extremities...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{in essence}} rounds off {{the range of}} queries asked several {{years ago when the}} task was set by Doc. RNDr. Zdenek Horak, PhD. The {{original}} isolation procedure for polyethylene wear particles, identification of some of their physico-chemical properties and manipulation accordingly has been successful in the process of this thesis accomplishment. It became possible to quantify the particles at relative as well as absolute scale. The thesis managed to disprove the published opinion that centrifugation can affect the morphology of isolated particles. The issue of distribution of polyethylene wear particles around hip <b>endoprothesis</b> has been solved at two levels: "macroscopically", the distribution of wear particles in zones around endoprosthesis was showed (this thesis does not include these data). Furthermore, at the "microscopic" level, the distribution of wear particles in granuloma tissue from the zones surrounding endoprostheses with most particles has been determined. The granuloma tissue formed in zones with most particles because of that. It was observed that the common term - osteoagressive granuloma - used by orthopedist is rather misguided. Granuloma is not aggressive to bone tissue. On the contrary, the granuloma formation reduces the effective amount of wear particles with [...] ...|$|E
