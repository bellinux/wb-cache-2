5|$|In 1873, Tesla {{returned}} to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden {{for nine months}} and was near death multiple times.

5|$|Benn's {{father had}} been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill {{increased}} the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood</b> and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.|$|E
5|$|The new {{religious}} orders {{that became a}} major feature of Scottish monastic life in this period also brought new educational possibilities {{and the need to}} train larger numbers of monks. Benedictine and Augustinian foundations probably had almonry schools, charity schools using funds from the almoner to provide a type of bursary to educate young boys, who might <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood.</b> At the Cluniac Paisley Abbey, secular chaplains were employed as schoolmasters. Some monasteries, including the Cistercian abbey at Kinloss, Sweetheart Abbey and Beauly, opened their doors to a wider range of students to teach the sons of gentlemen. St Andrews, which was both the seat of a bishop and the site of a major Augustinian foundation, had both a grammar school, under the archdeacon, and a song school, under the priory. The foundation of over 100 collegiate churches of secular priests between 1450 and the Reformation would have necessitated the training of large numbers of choristers. Sometimes, as at Lochwinnoch, they were taught both music and grammar. Dominican friars were noted for their educational achievements and were usually located in urban centres, probably teaching grammar, as at Glasgow and Ayr. The number and size of these schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. By the end of the Middle Ages, grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Dean R. Hoge {{conducted}} a survey of Catholic college students and determined that celibacy was the most significant deterrent keeping men from <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood.</b> Hoge estimated that if celibacy were optional for diocesan priests, there would be four {{times the number of}} men <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1759, Charles III of Spain {{ascended to}} the throne of Spain; he soon sent out a visitor-general {{with the power to}} {{investigate}} and reform all parts of colonial government. During this period, Don Cristóbal was determined that Miguel and his younger brother Joaquín should both <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood</b> and hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. Being of significant means he paid for all of his sons to receive the best education the region had to offer. After receiving private instruction, likely from the priest of the neighboring parish, Hidalgo was ready for further education.|$|E
25|$|When he reemerged from prison, in 1952, Brother Agathon {{decided to}} <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood</b> as a hieromonk, and became Father Daniil. He was {{originally}} assigned to Crasna, {{then moved to}} more remotes sketes. After a stint at Sihăstria Monastery, he moved {{high up in the}} Rarău Mountains, Bukovina. With the help of Ilie Cleopa, the influential Orthodox preacher at Sihăstria, Daniil was appointed Starets. In this new capacity, he resumed the spreading of Kulygin's ideas, forming a prayer group with about a dozen followers, and outlined a new plan for a monastery of the intellectual elite.|$|E

25|$|Following graduation, James {{wished to}} <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood.</b> He could not {{study at the}} Jesuit novitiate in Maryland, {{as it was a}} slave state. With the help of John Bernard Fitzpatrick, James entered a Sulpician seminary in Montreal. In 1852, he {{transferred}} to study at Saint Sulpice Seminary in Paris, working toward a doctorate and a career as a seminary professor. After a change of heart, he decided to become a pastor. On June 10, 1854, he was ordained at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris as a priest to serve in Boston, Massachusetts. He was the first African American to be ordained a Roman Catholic priest; at the time he identified as and was accepted as white Irish Catholic. During the 19th century, numerous Americans studied for the priesthood in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Boarman's {{father was}} also, at one time, {{studying}} to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood.</b> He was educated at the Jesuit College of Liege, Belgium, {{and was a}} scholastic of the Society {{at the time of}} the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773. As a result, he was released from his vows and returned to Maryland where he met and married his future wife. The Boarman family lived on a farm in Charles County while Charles Boarman, Sr. resided at Georgetown University. In 1799, he moved the family to Georgetown, where they lived in a brick house on the university grounds. After Boarman, Sr. died, the house was occupied by Mrs. Susan Decatur, widow of Captain Stephen Decatur, until her death in 1860. The property was later sold and the house was torn down; the site is now included in the university's baseball field.|$|E
25|$|Fisher {{studied at}} the University of Cambridge from 1484, where at Michaelhouse he came under the {{influence}} of William Melton, a pastorally-minded theologian open to the new current of reform in studies arising from the Renaissance. Fisher earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1487 and in 1491, proceeded to a Master of Arts degree. Also in 1491 Fisher received a papal dispensation to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood</b> despite being under canonical age. Fisher was ordained into the Catholic priesthood on 17 December 1491 - the same year that he was elected a fellow of his college. He was also made Vicar of Northallerton, Yorkshire. In 1494 he resigned his benefice to become proctor of the university and three years later was appointed master debator, about which date he also became chaplain and confessor to Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother of King Henry VII. On 5 July 1501, he became a doctor of sacred theology and 10 days later was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University. Under Fisher's guidance, his patroness Lady Margaret founded St John's and Christ's Colleges at Cambridge, and a Lady Margaret Professorship of Divinity at each of the two universities at Oxford and Cambridge, Fisher himself becoming the first occupant of the Cambridge chair. In the years from 1505 to 1508 he was also the President of Queens' College. At the end of July 1516 he was at Cambridge for the opening of St John's College and consecrated the chapel.|$|E

60|$|Greatly {{they enjoyed}} the {{occasional}} visits {{made by the}} family to their farm. Here they saw the cultivation of the fields carried on, watched the plucking of the grapes and their conversion into wine. To extract the juice the grapes were heaped in a large flat vat above which ropes were suspended. A dozen barefooted slaves entered the vat and trod out the grapes, using the ropes to lift themselves in order that they might drop with greater force upon the fruit. Amuba had learned from Chebron that although {{he was going to}} <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood</b> as an almost necessary preliminary for state employment, he was not intended to rise to the upper rank of the priesthood, but to become a state official.|$|E
6000|$|Abbot Pambo, {{as well as}} Arsenius, {{had been}} dead several years; the abbot's place was filled, by his own dying command, by a hermit from the {{neighbouring}} deserts, who had made himself famous for many miles round, by his extraordinary austerities, his ceaseless prayers, his loving wisdom, and, it was rumoured, by various cures which could only be attributed to miraculous powers. While still {{in the prime of}} his manhood, he was dragged, against his own entreaties, from a lofty cranny of the cliffs to reside over the Laura of Scetis, and ordained a deacon at the advice of Pambo, by the bishop of the diocese, who, three years afterwards, took on himself to command him to <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>priesthood.</b> The elder monks considered it an indignity to be ruled by so young a man: but the monastery throve and grew rapidly under his government. His sweetness, patience, and humility, and above all, his marvellous understanding of the doubts and temptations of his own generation, soon drew around him all whose sensitiveness or waywardness had made them unmanageable in the neighbouring monasteries. As to David in the mountains, so to him, every one who was discontented, and every one who was oppressed, gathered themselves. The neighbouring abbots were at first inclined to shrink from him, as one who ate and drank with publicans and sinners: but they held their peace, when they saw those whom they had driven out as reprobates labouring peacefully and cheerfully under Philammon. The elder generation of Scetis, too, saw, with some horror, the new influx of sinners: but their abbot had but one answer to their remonstrances--'Those who are whole need not a physician, but those who are sick.' ...|$|E
