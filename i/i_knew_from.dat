500|$|Speaking to a rally {{outside the}} plant on May 3, August Spies advised the {{striking}} workers to [...] "hold together, {{to stand by}} their union, or they would not succeed." [...] Well-planned and coordinated, the general strike to this point had remained largely nonviolent. When the end-of-the-workday bell sounded, however, a group of workers surged to the gates to confront the strikebreakers. Despite calls for calm by Spies, the police fired on the crowd. Two McCormick workers were killed (although some newspaper accounts said there were six fatalities). Spies would later testify, [...] "I was very indignant. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> experience {{of the past that}} this butchering of people was done {{for the express purpose of}} defeating the eight-hour movement." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] Cubby Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E

At first when Avis got sick, I thought she just had a cold, but when time passed and she didn’t get better, I made her go to a doctor and we found out she had TB … I suppose <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> when we found out she had the TB, I understood that {{it was just a matter}} of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} started mid-October 2011, {{and took}} place at Joss Whedon's residence in Santa Monica, California. On the choice of location, he told Studio 360, [...] "First of all, my wife built that house. And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> the moment I set foot in it that I would want to film something there. Because it's all in one place, that place informs the mood and the feeling and {{the look of the}} picture so much, and I was really already comfortable with that". Whedon and his wife, Kai Cole, produced the film through their studio Bellwether Pictures. It was filmed entirely in a black-and-white palette over a period of 12 days, in conjunction with cinematographer Jay Hunter. Whedon shot it while on a contractual vacation from the post-production of The Avengers. The cast and crew were informed to keep the project a secret until production was finished. They wrapped their last day of filming on October 23, 2011.|$|E
