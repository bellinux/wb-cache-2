Jeremy Helligar of True/Slant commented {{the song was}} [...] "still {{to the left of}} what normally passes for modern R" [...] Originally revealed as [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] and later changed to [...] "Grown Woman," [...] the lyrics and theme of the song are based on a woman who [...] "asserts her maturity and clues her suitors in on what won’t fly when it comes to relationships." [...] The song is one of three records which Ne-Yo co-wrote for Rowland after the singer specifically approached him to pen records for her album. Its concept was devised in a brief conversation between the pair. Rowland said, [...] "'Ne-Yo asked me what I wanted to talk about,' and <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'. [...] want a record that declared that I'm Grown!" ...|$|E
500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which <b>I</b> <b>replied,</b> 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E

2500|$|At a {{press conference}} in April, when asked whether Russians should {{reciprocate}} the Ukrainian sex strike, he replied that all Ukrainian women were [...] "nymphomaniacs" [...] like the journalist who had asked the question, Stella Dubovitskaya.

2500|$|In the ahadith, lmam Ahmad, Nasa'i, and Ibn Hibban have related on the {{authority}} of Hadrat Abu Dharr a tradition, saying: [...] "I sat before Muhammad, {{who was in the}} Mosque. He said: Abu Dharr, have you performed the prayer? <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> in the negative. He said: Arise and perform the prayer. So, I performed the prayer. Muhammad said: O Abu Dharr, seek God's refuge from the devils of men and the devils of jinn. I asked: [...] "Are there devils among men also? O Muhammad!" [...] He replied: Yes." ...|$|E

2500|$|He had courage {{amounting to}} insanity, {{as well as}} {{displays}} {{of a lack of}} responsibility. I would not say the same about his civil courage. Once Ben Gurion had asked me—what do I think of the decision to appoint Dayan as the Minister of Agriculture in his government. I said that it is important that Dayan sits in every government because of his brilliant mind—but never as prime minister. Ben Gurion asked: [...] "why not as prime minister?". <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> then: [...] "because he does not accept responsibility".|$|E

Change their situation with the whites, and they would be like them. They have souls, and are subjects of salvation. Go into Cincinnati or any city, and find an educated negro, who rides in his carriage, and you will see a man who has risen by the powers of his own mind to his exalted state of respectability. The slaves in Washington are more refined than many in high places, and the black boys will take the shine off many of those they brush and wait on.|$|E
2500|$|... "The ANC {{is enjoying}} the {{protection}} of president Kaunda and is planning insurgency activities against South Africa from Lusaka", Botha declared on nationwide television. He said he had asked the cabinet what reason he should give the public for abruptly leaving office. [...] "They replied I could use my health as an excuse.

2500|$|I {{was asked}} {{by a member of}} an {{academic}} audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to [...] "the global left" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.|$|E
2500|$|... "The emperor {{asked me}} what France would get in return for her {{military}} backing, and whether Your Majesty would hand over Savoy and Nice to France. [...] <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> that Your Majesty supported the principal of nationalism, which included recognition that Savoy, {{by virtue of being}} French speaking, should be united with France .... even though it would cause your majesty untold unhappiness to renounce a territory that was the cradle of his own family. [...] Regarding Nizza (Nice) the situation was different, since the inhabitants of Nice had far more in common with the Piedmontese than with the French, and their incorporation into France would accordingly be entirely contrary to those very principals of nationalism underpinning the military triumph anticipated against Austria." ...|$|E
2500|$|She then {{wrote to}} her mother, Queen Victoria: ...I have heard {{different}} things about poor Rudolf which may perhaps interest you. Prince Bismarck {{told me that the}} violent scenes and altercations between the Emperor and Rudolf had been the cause of Rudolf's suicide. <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> that I had heard this much doubted, upon which he said Reuss had written it and it was so! He would send me the despatch to read if I liked, but I have declined. I did not say what I thought, which is that for thirty years I have had the experience of how many lies Prince Bismarck's diplomatic agents (with some exceptions) have written him, and therefore I usually disbelieve what they write completely, unless I know them to be honest and trustworthy men. Szechenyi, the Ambassador at Berlin, whom we know very well, tells me that there had been no scenes with the Emperor, who said to Szechenyi: Dies ist der erste Kummer, den mein Sohn mir macht.|$|E

2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' <b>I</b> <b>replied,</b> 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang'an." [...] By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang'an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Terry Nation {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Ronnie Marsh, the BBC's Head of Serials, to discuss ideas for new television series. Marsh was looking for formats for co-productions with American television channels. Nation suggested a number of ideas, mostly for crime dramas, none of which appealed to Marsh. According to Nation, [...] "...the interview was {{drawing to a close}} when I surprised myself by starting to detail a new science fiction adventure [...] 'Have you got a title?' someone asked. Blake's 7 <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> without hesitation". Marsh's notes of the meeting survive and record the pitch Nation made as follows: “cracking Boy's Own/ kidult sci-fi. A space Western adventure. A modern swashbuckler. Blake's Seven. Group of villains being escorted onto a rocket ship (transported) which goes astray & lands on an alien planet where inhabitants are planning to invade & destroy Earth. Possibly live underground". Nation left the meeting with a commission for a pilot script and [...] "...the bewildered feeling that [...] I could not trace the source of the idea". Nation submitted his pilot script, titled [...] "Blake's 7 – A Television Series created by Terry Nation", in April 1976, sub-titling the draft episode Cygnus Alpha.|$|E
2500|$|Seeing further {{potential}} in the idea, Horn teamed Jeczalik and Langan with Dudley in February to develop the project and brought {{in one of his}} business partners, ex-NME journalist Paul Morley, as a provider of concepts, art direction and marketing ideas. Morley came up with the project name (taken from the essay [...] "The Art of Noises" [...] by noted futurist Luigi Russolo, and finalised at Jeczalik's request by dropping the final 's'). Much later, in a July 2002 article penned for The Guardian, Morley wrote [...] "I loved the name Art of Noise so much that I forced my way into the group. If over the years people asked me what I did in the group, <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> that I named them, and it was such a great name, that was enough to justify my role. I was the Ringo Starr of Art of Noise. I made the tea. Oh, and I wrote the lyrics to one of the loveliest pieces of pop music ever, Moments in Love." [...] Horn himself joined the new group as production advisor and provider of further ideas. This {{was the first time that}} he had been part of a group since parting company with his The Buggles' partner Geoff Downes (after they had been part of Yes). It would also be the first and last time that he would enjoy chart success as an artist since the new wave hit in 1979 with [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star".|$|E

2500|$|... "One of {{the chief}} objects of my {{expedition}} was to diffuse knowledge tending towards emigration, and whether driving over the fjelds, scaling mountains, resting at stations, or coasting along the shore in steamers, I everywhere preached an immigration crusade to the laborer's paradise in the New World. I spoke of our homestead law— the fertility of our soil— the length of our summer— the richness of our immense mining districts, but I found nothing so telling as the simple description of the condition and prospects of the working man in the United States of America. Of fifty odd postillions I had along the road, all promised me to immigrate to the United States next Spring, save one; he, I ascertained, had been in England for nine months, and, judging all foreign countries by {{the one he had}} visited, concluded, perhaps wisely according to his light, to remain at home. (...) Sometimes some Norwegian proprietors, not liking perhaps the tendency of things, would commence a discussion in presence of the deck-passengers. I found it very easy to refute all their arguments. When driven from every other point they invariably took refuge under the palladium of patriotism— love for Gamle Norge (Old Norway). To this <b>I</b> <b>replied,</b> that I recognized no love of country, not connected with love for our countrymen; if then, as they had been constrained to admit, the Norwegian laborer bettered his condition by immigrating into the United States, true patriotism should assist him to go, not hinder him from going. I however always treated these Norwegian gentlemen personally with the greatest respect. In no case did one discussion descend to altercation, and no unfriendly words were ever used." ...|$|E
2500|$|American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo {{was also}} {{involved}} in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, [...] "Ne-Yo asked me what I wanted to talk about, and <b>I</b> <b>replied</b> 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'." [...] The first of these records, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off", was originally {{intended to be a}} single in the US. It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like a job I that I never get a break from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
