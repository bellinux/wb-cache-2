5|$|The {{author has}} {{attenuated}} Natrum muriaticum (common table-salt) {{until there was}} not a single saline property left... and yet, with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of water, and a teaspoonful of the water administered at intervals of three hours, she has cured a patient sinking in the last stage of typhoid fever. The highest attenuation of homœopathy and the most potent rises above matter into mind. This discovery leads to more light. From it may be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is the healer and that there is no efficacy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug.</b>|$|E

This situation persisted until 1905 when Oregon voters voiced their collective opinion on the library's future.|$|E
