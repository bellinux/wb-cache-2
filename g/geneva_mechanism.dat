The Iron Ring Clock uses a <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> to provide intermittent motion to one of its rings.|$|E

Using the elliptic gear mechanism as the drive crank of the Geneva, the variable transmission {{ratio of the}} elliptic gear mechanism is utilized, which makes the kinematic characteristic of the <b>geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> changed. A synthesis method of combined <b>geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> is put forward according to the kinematic coefficients in this paper. The calculation methods of the maximum and minimum kinematic coefficient are proposed. The parameters of the combined <b>geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> are presented, which the middle position of the kinematic range of the geneva has approximate constant velocity characteristics...|$|E

Skladanowsky witnessed a performance of the Cinématographe and continued to make technical improvements to his projector and camera, touring Germany, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia throughout 1896, presenting his last show in Stettin on March 30, 1897. These later shows used a more sophisticated system with a single band of film and a <b>geneva</b> drive <b>mechanism,</b> but Skladanowsky had to stop exhibiting as the authorities refused to renew his trade licence as [...] "too many film licences were already in circulation" ...|$|R
40|$|A {{plantain}} chips {{slicing machine}} was designed, fabricated and tested. This {{is perhaps a}} major advancement {{in the development of}} plantain chips. A cam and spring return mechanism was used to achieve both the feeding and the slicing operations. The machine was made as simple as possible for easy repairs and maintenance. It is designed such that the machine slices one tuber of plantain over one revolution of the cam. A conveyor rolls sliced chips to a tray {{with the help of a}} <b>Geneva</b> drive <b>mechanism</b> (or timer). A variable speed pulley system was used to reduce the motor speed to desired value. Test performance gave an efficiency of 74 per cent. Further modification is in view to further improve on the efficiency...|$|R

In this approach, the <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> with curved slots is basically thought of as an inverse cam mechanism. However, basic equations for the surface geometry of the slots were not discussed in their work, resulting in unknown conditions for manufacturing, such as undercutting, double point in the curve, etc. Figliolini and Angeles [7] studied the force transmission of the <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> with curved slots...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} {{theoretical and practical}} based on the finite element analysis and modelling of <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> with four slots, using the CATIA graphic program. This type of mechanism {{is an example of}} intermittent gearing that translates a continuous rotation into an intermittent rotary motion. It consists of alternate periods of motion and rest without reversing direction. In this paper, some design parameters with specify a <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> will be defined precisely such as number of driving cranks, number of slots, wheel diameter, pin diameter, etc. Finite element analysis (FEA) can be used for creating a finite element model (preprocessing) and visualizing the analysis results (postprocessing), and use other solvers for processing...|$|E

The rotating prism allows the editor to move the film smoothly and continuously, reducing mechanical noise and film wear. It also makes high-speed operation feasible, and some machines can move the film at up to ten times standard speed. The K-E-M Universal, which has a modular construction, supports up to three picture heads and up to three sound tracks.|$|R
50|$|The {{clock was}} {{designed}} {{in large part}} in a four-month period {{at the end of}} 2002, with some features that were originally intended for an outdoor installation. The clock keeps time {{through the use of a}} synchronous alternating current motor, which regulates its speed based on the frequency of the electricity that it is fed. The top and bottom halves of the ring can rotate independently, with the top half of the ring displaying the hours, and the bottom half the minutes. The minute ring moves constantly, while the hour ring increments once an hour through the use of a <b>Geneva</b> drive <b>mechanism.</b> The rings are driven through a gearbox that was designed and partly manufactured by the group. The two ring sections are made of forged stainless steel, with machined surfaces, and facets cut using a robotic six-axis water jet cutter. The central shield, which is the university coat of arms, is made of hand-crafted stained glass. The design of the clock was completed entirely with computer-aided design software, and CNC tools were used for components where the most precision was required. Although the clock was donated to McMaster University on completion, it is maintained by members of the team that built it.|$|R

40|$|Methodologies for {{computer-aided}} type {{synthesis of}} variable-constraint mechanisms (VCMs) {{are discussed in}} this dissertation. Two kinds of VCMs are discussed, one-way mechanisms and Geneva mechanisms. ^ In {{the first chapter of}} this dissertation, systematic type synthesis algorithms are proposed and discussed. Dual-graph methods are proposed to represent a one-way mechanism that uses only one overrunning clutch, or a <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> (rotary or translational), that includes only a pair of Geneva crank/wheel (or crank/slider for translational <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism).</b> A dual-graph set of a VCM consists of a 1 -DOF graph and a 2 -DOF graph. The combination of the 2 graphs reflects the constraint-varying nature of a VCM. ^ The 1 -DOF graph of a VCM is, or can be obtained from, a constant-constraint mechanism (CCM) graph. The two graphs of a VCM are related such that the 2 -DOF graph can be derived from the 1 -DOF graph following specific rules. The graph-deriving process reflects the process of modification of a CCM to obtain a VCM. The dual-graph also includes all necessary information for sketching a VCM. ^ In the second chapter of this dissertation, the proposed methodologies are applied to the type synthesis of a one-way mechanism that is used as the index mechanism of a leaf sampler. The leaf sampler is used to collect a precise amount of leaf material for genetic research purposes. ^ Although this investigation is mainly aimed for the design of one-way mechanisms and Geneva mechanisms, the general idea is applicable to the design of all VCMs. ...|$|E
40|$|A simple yet {{comprehensive}} {{method is}} {{proposed for the}} design of a Geneva indexing mechanism with curved slots. In the proposed approach, conjugate surface theory is employed to derive an analytical description of the profile of the curved slots with and without an offset feature. The use of an appropriate offset angle to eliminate the singular points and double-points on the profile of the curved slots is then demonstrated. Finally, a mock-up <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism</b> is constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results confirm that the methodology presented in this study enables the integration of the design, analysis and machining tasks for a Geneva indexing mechanism, and therefore makes possible a flexible and automatic production process...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} is to make machinery for stamping details on water bottle cap.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} variable input speed for optimization of kinematic characteristic of <b>Geneva</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The objective is lowering maximum acceleration and jerk of driven wheel. First objective function is extracted then non-dimensional motion equations are used in order to formulate the optimization problem. After that a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to optimize the objective function. A penalty is assumed in objective function {{in order to satisfy}} constraints. This work is done first for minimizing of acceleration and then multi objective optimization is applied for decreasing of acceleration and jerk of driven wheel simultaneously. Results showed 42. 5 % decrease in peak acceleration in optimal mechanism when acceleration is objective function and 32. 5 % and 81. 8 % decrease in peak acceleration and peak jerk respectively when multi objective optimization is applied. A kinematic simulation is done to validate the results. Finally a pair of non-circular gear is used to generate non-constant velocity obtained by optimization of acceleration. Applying this procedure shows how variable input speed can improve kinematic characteristic of mechanism instead of designing another mechanism.
