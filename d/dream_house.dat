5|$|By 1983, {{with his}} medical bills at £40,000 a year, Terry-Thomas's {{financial}} resources were dwindling. He {{and his wife}} sold their <b>dream</b> <b>house</b> and moved into the small cottage once owned by his former wife Pat Patlanski, which she left to him in her will on her death in June that year. Shortly afterwards he worked with ghostwriter Terry Daum on an autobiography, Terry-Thomas Tells Tales. Although the first draft was completed by late summer 1984, Terry-Thomas refused to release the script and continued to make alterations, but never completed his copyediting: the book was finally published after his death.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Dreaming</b> <b>House</b> {{exhibition}} pays {{homage to}} Newstead Abbey’s history as the ancestral home of Lord Byron, {{where many of the}} personal items that belonged to the great Romantic poet are displayed. However, rather than making direct reference to Byron and his work, the artists in The <b>Dreaming</b> <b>House</b> are interested in themes that are also present in Bryon's writing: childhood, memory, the supernatural, romanticism, ruin and decay. The works of art infiltrate the evocative rooms and spaces of Newstead Abbey, tapping in to the theatrically and radical spirit for which Byron was known. Nottingham City Museums and Galleries have one of the best collections of contemporary art textiles in the UK. For the <b>Dreaming</b> <b>House</b> exhibition, highlights from this collection are shown alongside works on loan from Nottingham-based artists Kashif Nadim Chaudry and Judy Liebert. The project worked with Radford Care Group, a day care facility for older people, many of whom had once worked in Nottingham's lace industry. The project was part of 'Imagine – Arts and Older People' a city-wide programme co-ordinated by City Arts with a range of partners which is funded by Arts Council England and The Baring Foundation...|$|R
40|$|During recent years, housing {{has been}} the object of general {{attention}} and so called home or <b>house</b> <b>dreams</b> (da. boligdrømme) has become a widespread phenomenon in contemporary society, manifested in the activity of thinking or <b>dreaming</b> about <b>housing</b> in imaginary ways. Many a word {{has been said about}} <b>house</b> <b>dreams,</b> but no one has in fact thoroughly investigated the phenomenon. The present MA-thesis carries out a critical study of current, predominately mainstream ways of understanding the topic as well as offers a comprehensive research in the nearby area of this. Hence, by combining the theory of mind as seen by John Searle with the thoughts of the production of space by Henri Lefebvre, an attempt to conceptualize <b>house</b> <b>dreams</b> is executed. The thesis concludes that when <b>dreaming</b> about <b>houses,</b> we direct our consciousness towards an always already present world. Thus, a <b>house</b> <b>dream</b> is a kind of experience in which perception and imagination come together although perception might be more pronounced than imagination and vice versa. In <b>house</b> <b>dreams,</b> we intend both an imaginable and desirable content, although at the same time this also implies certain vague aspects, which obviously affects the discussion of this thesis. However, when <b>house</b> <b>dreaming,</b> we actively by appropriation make the world around us our own. The house or home as a definite construction is the pivotal point for the <b>house</b> <b>dreaming</b> experience though the building as a physical object is in fact only part of the <b>house</b> <b>dream.</b> Other essential elements of <b>house</b> <b>dreams</b> consist of good and elevated moods, not to forget notions of ”the good life” which the <b>house</b> <b>dreaming</b> individual, in various degrees, apply as a component to the desired house...|$|R

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Loy all but abandoned her acting career {{to focus on the}} war effort and work closely with the Red Cross. She was so fiercely outspoken against Adolf Hitler that her name appeared on his blacklist. She helped run a Naval Auxiliary canteen and toured frequently to raise funds. She returned to films with The Thin Man Goes Home (1945). In 1946, she played the wife of returning serviceman Fredric March in The Best Years of Our Lives (1946). Loy was paired with Cary Grant in David O. Selznick's The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947). The film co-starred a teenaged Shirley Temple. Following its success, she appeared again with Grant in Mr. Blandings Builds His <b>Dream</b> <b>House</b> (1948), and with Clifton Webb in Cheaper by the Dozen (1950).

500|$|Watts {{appeared}} opposite Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz in Jim Sheridan's psychological thriller <b>Dream</b> <b>House,</b> {{which was}} released in September 2011, to a lackluster critical and commercial response. Watts' following film role was in Clint Eastwood's biopic J. Edgar, alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the title character. Watts played Edgar's secretary Helen Gandy. The film {{was released in}} December 2011 and rated average with reviewers. About Watts' performance, The Hollywood Reporter remarked that she [...] "has little opportunity to express much beyond dogged loyalty" [...] and while Los Angeles Times called her [...] "talented", it also noted that her part was a [...] "thankless one" [...] for the actress.|$|E

[...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her <b>dream</b> <b>house,</b> and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate. Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house." [...] According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity for a decent living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Grant {{played an}} artist who becomes {{involved}} in a court case when charged with assault in The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, opposite Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple. The film was praised by the critics, who admired the picture's slapstick qualities and chemistry between Grant and Loy; it {{became one of the}} biggest-selling films at the box office that year. Later that year he starred opposite David Niven and Loretta Young in the comedy The Bishop's Wife, playing an angel who is sent down from heaven to straighten out the relationship between the bishop (Niven) and his wife (Loretta Young). The film was a major commercial and critical success, and was nominated for five Academy Awards. Life magazine called it [...] "intelligently written and competently acted". The following year, Grant played neurotic Jim Blandings, the title-sake in the comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His <b>Dream</b> <b>House,</b> again with Loy. Though the film picture lost {{a lot of money for}} RKO, Philip T. Hartung of Commonweal thought that Grant's role as the [...] "frustrated advertising man" [...] was one of his best screen portrayals. In Every Girl Should Be Married, an [...] "airy comedy", he appeared with Betsy Drake and Franchot Tone, playing a bachelor who is trapped into marriage by Drake's conniving character.

500|$|In 2003, as well, RKO Pictures {{entered into}} a legal battle with Wall Street Financial Associates (WSFA). Hartley and Merrill claimed that the owners of WSFA fraudulently induced them into signing an {{acquisition}} agreement by concealing their [...] "cynical and rapacious" [...] plans to purchase RKO with the intention only of dismantling it. WSFA sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting RKO's majority owners from selling their interests in the company to any third parties. The WSFA motion was denied in July 2003, freeing RKO to deal with another potential purchaser, InternetStudios.com. In 2004, that planned sale fell through when InternetStudios.com apparently folded. The company's minimal involvement in new film production continues to focus on its remake rights: Are We Done Yet?, based on Mr. Blandings Builds His <b>Dream</b> <b>House</b> (1948), was released in April 2007 to dismal reviews. Later in the year, RKO launched a horror division, Roseblood Movie Company.

500|$|Homer {{attempts}} to appease Grimes by inviting {{him to his}} home for a lobster dinner {{in order to make}} him and his enemy co-worker friends. Grimes' visit to the Simpson house only fuels his resentment; he is incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life and earn so many accomplishments (such as being friends with former president Gerald Ford, going on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, going into space, and winning a Grammy) despite his slothful and ignorant ways, while Grimes has to live a life of hard work and all he has to show for it is a battered briefcase, a bad haircut, and a single room apartment between two bowling alleys. Declaring Homer a [...] "fraud", a bitter Grimes storms away in anger. The following day, Homer, after getting advice from Marge, makes further {{attempts to}} earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, both of whom insist that despite his faults, Homer is essentially a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children, by carefully cutting away all references to them in a promotional poster which he leaves at Homer's control panel. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to kids, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism. At the contest, Grimes is horrified when Homer's model, which is almost exactly the same as the current power plant with only a few modifications, easily wins against Ralph Wiggum's Malibu Stacy <b>dream</b> <b>house,</b> and Martin Prince's futuristic model that supplies power to the room. The audience's applause and cheers for Homer cause Grimes to finally snap and he runs amok through the plant, mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Entering Homer's office, Grimes sees a machine labeled [...] "Extremely High Voltage", sarcastically declares that he does not need safety gloves because he's Homer Simpson, grabs the high voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral (with a headstone that simply reads [...] "Grimes"), Homer unintentionally and unknowingly gets the last laugh as he falls asleep and in a drowsy state tells Marge to change the TV channel, causing all the attendees to burst into laughter and completely ignore Grimes' coffin as it's lowered into the earth.|$|E
