5|$|Rossi, {{who started}} from pole position, was {{overtaken}} by Maricello {{at the start}} of the first lap. He had a small lead which was reduced because he was using super soft tyres which had higher degradation levels, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer. Rossi gained the lead after Maricello made a pit stop for new tyres. Vandoorne became the new leader after <b>getting</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Rossi when both drivers made pit stops, and maintained it to win the event. In the second race, Marciello started from the pole position but lost the lead to Stanaway after making a slow getaway from his starting position. The event was processional with few overtaking manoeuvres occurring and Stanaway remained the leader for the rest of the race to clinch the victory.|$|E
