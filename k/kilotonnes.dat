30|$|The {{difference}} in CO 2 emissions between the baseline case, without PHEVs charging and with PHEVs charging {{for both the}} peak and off-peak scenarios is 598 <b>kilotonne</b> of CO 2 (ktCO 2) and 375 ktCO 2, respectively in 2020. If the Car Stock model CO 2 savings in ICE reductions of 504 ktCO 2 is included, then the overall net reduction in CO 2 emissions is a reduction of 129 ktCO 2 for the off-peak scenario but an increase of 94 ktCO 2 for the peak scenario. Thus WASP-IV indicates that peak charging increases CO 2 emissions. Therefore off-peak charging has more overall transport and power systems benefits in terms of CO 2 emissions reductions and contributes 0.95 % to the Republic of Ireland’s 20 % reduction in non-emissions trading scheme emissions by 2020 relative to 2005 [42].|$|R

40|$|This {{briefing}} {{focuses on}} {{a particular type of}} rebound effect, which results from re-spending decisions as households realise savings due to reduced energy requirements. Measuring rebound from re-spending involves identifying changes in emissions-relevant energy use embodied in the supply chains of different goods/services that households may switch consumption between as their energy requirements are reduced In assessing re-spending options, we consider a carbon saving multiplier (CSM). This measures the change in embodied supply chain emissions per <b>kilotonne</b> (kt) directly saved by UK households. A key aim of policy will then be to limit the erosion of this multiplier value. Our central finding is that upward rebound effects in supply chains supporting re-spending decisions erode carbon saving multiplier effects of reduced energy spending. There may also be important effects in terms of increased emissions overseas (carbon leakage) because non-energy supply chains tend to be more international than energy supply chains...|$|R
5000|$|As {{early as}} in 1976, Ahmad, in a seismic {{team led by}} {{geophysicist}} Ahsan Mubarak conducted a three-dimensional geometrical survey and made several reconnaissance tours of the suitable areas in Balochistan.

The 185-meter high-rise granite mountain was founded in the Ras Koh region of the Chagai Division of Balochistan, which at their highest point rise to a height of 3,009 metres. Ahmad had long noted that the underground weapon-testing laboratories in the mountain should be [...] "bone dry" [...] and capable of withstanding a ~20 <b>kilotonne</b> nuclear force from the inside.

40|$|The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) is a 1 <b>kilotonne</b> heavy-water Čerenkov {{detector}} {{designed to}} study fundamental properties of neutrinos produced by thermonuclear fusion reactions {{in the core}} of the Sun. The uniqueness of SNO resides in its capability to distinctively measure the total flux of all active neutrino flavours as well as the flux of electron neutrinos, through the Neutral-Current (NC) and Charged-Current (CC) interactions of neutrinos on deuterium, respectively. The measurements of the NC and CC fluxes for neutrinos originated from 8 B disintegration inside the Sun unambiguously proved that neutrinos change their flavour while traveling to the Earth. These results are consistent with predictions from a neutrino oscillation hypothesis on neutrino flavour transitions due to the mixing of massive neutrino states. The NC measurement from SNO also solved the long-standing Solar Neutrino Problem (SNP). In this dissertation, the measurements of the fundamental properties of neutrinos, in particular their mixing parameters, are presented. Data samples from SNO and other experiments are used to extract the mixing parameters of activ...|$|R

40|$|The vast rice {{production}} in some developing Asian countries like Indonesia raises expectation on poverty alleviation and energy diversification through second generation biofuel production from rice residues, specifically rice straw. This work attempts {{to estimate the}} potential environmental and socioeconomic benefits of rice straw-to-ethanol project in Indonesia. Literature research and interviews are performed to quantify several environmental and socioeconomic indicators that are considered as the major concerns inimplementing an energy project. Assuming all the technically available rice straw in Bali is used (~ 244 - 415 kilotonne/year), ethanol production may yield gasoline replacement, lifecycle GHG savings, GDP contribution, foreign exchange savings, and employment beneficiaries of 55 - 93 ML/year, 140 - 240 millionUSD/year, 19 - 32 <b>kilotonne</b> of CO 2 -equivalent/year, 100 - 180 million USD/year, and 2, 200 - 3, 700 persons, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the Kargil War as a {{landmark}} limited conflict that was fought against a nuclear backdrop in South Asia. Kargil, therefore, is very important for the crystallisation of a new Limited War Doctrine that would be more pertinent and specific to the Asian context in general and the South Asian context in particular. It is noteworthy that most theories of limited war originated in the West during the Cold War era. America had ushered in the nuclear age by employing 20 <b>kilotonne</b> (KT) airburst warheads on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Soviets had caught up by 1949. Thus, began the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers. The world was trying to come to terms with this paradigm shift brought about by the absolute nature of nuclear weapons. They were so destructive that contemplating their use in a symmetric setting was a logical absurdity. The Cold War in the West, therefore, did not transform into a hot war or a shooting war. Nuclear weapons held the peace. Fielding dominant war-fighting capabilities was the preferred way to deter and dissuade a...|$|R
5000|$|Chattanooga Process is an {{extraction}} process {{that uses a}} fluidized bed reactor and an associated hydrogen-fired heater. In this process, retorting occurs at relatively low temperatures (...) through thermal cracking and hydrogenation of the shale into hydrocarbon vapors and spent solids. The thermal cracking allows hydrocarbon vapors to be extracted and scrubbed of solids. The vapors are then cooled, inducing the condensate {{to drop out of}} the gas. The remaining hydrogen, light hydrocarbons, and acid gases are passed through an amine scrubbing system to remove hydrogen sulfide which is converted to elemental sulfur. The cleaned hydrogen and light hydrocarbon gases are then fed back into the system for compression or into the hydrogen heater to provide heat for the fluidized bed reactor. This system is a nearly-closed loop; almost all of its energy needs are provided by the source material. The demonstration plant in Alberta was able to produce [...] of oil per <b>kilotonne</b> of oil shale with an API gravity ranging between 28 and 30.
