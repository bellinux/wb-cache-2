5|$|Despite the {{aforementioned}} anti-cheating protocols, some participants {{felt that this}} was merely a display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard <b>going</b> <b>off,</b> particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov. It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.|$|E
5|$|Amfortas arrives, borne on a {{stretcher}} by Knights of the Grail. He calls out for Gawain, whose attempt at relieving the King's pain had failed. He is told that Gawain has left again, seeking a better remedy. Raising himself somewhat, the King says <b>going</b> <b>off</b> without leave ("?") {{is the sort of}} impulsiveness which led himself into Klingsor's realm and to his downfall. He accepts the potion from Gurnemanz and tries to thank Kundry, but she answers abruptly that thanks will not help and urges him onward to his bath.|$|E
5|$|Bickford was groomed to be {{a relief}} pitcher in minor league {{baseball}} and played four seasons with the Welch Minors before <b>going</b> <b>off</b> to fight in World War II. He {{came back to the}} Braves system in 1946 where he played for the Jackson Senators of the Southeastern League, where he had a 10–12 win-loss record with a 3.33 earned run average (ERA), and one game with the Hartford Chiefs of the Eastern League.|$|E

5|$|Concurrently, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) turns {{himself in}} at the FBI headquarters. Suffering from effects of being teleported out of his German prison cell by Walter's technology, he insists on only {{speaking}} to Olivia, warning {{that she is the}} only one that can stop a bomb from <b>going</b> <b>off</b> in 36 hours. Sanford Harris (Michael Gaston) instead orders Olivia to join other agents in raiding a warehouse which they believe Jones and his men used. Evidence confirms Jones had been there, but an agent dies from suffocation after finding another two-dollar bill.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before <b>going</b> <b>off</b> to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E
5|$|L'Estrange {{performed}} in the Domain from January through to April 1877, but not without incident. On 7 February 1877, as L'Estrange neared {{the end of his}} wire act, sparks from the fireworks <b>going</b> <b>off</b> around him fell into the nearby store of gunpowder and fireworks, igniting them. The store's shed was demolished, a surrounding fence knocked down, part of L'Estrange's performance tent caught fire, and two young boys were injured.|$|E

5|$|Riley had {{previously}} presented a fictionalized version of Mary Alice Smith in his short story “Where Is Mary Alice Smith?,” published in The Indianapolis Journal of 30 September 1882. In it, Mary Alice arrives at her benefactor family’s home and wastes {{no time in}} telling the children a grisly story of murder by decapitation and then later introduces them to her soldier friend Dave who is soon killed upon <b>going</b> <b>off</b> to war. The plot of this short story was heavily incorporated into the 1918 movie adaptation as well as Johnny Gruelle’s 1921 storybook.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry <b>going</b> <b>off</b> the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} on Friday, {{ahead of the}} two Red Bull cars of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. The session started on a very wet track, but with no more rain falling, it dried out as the practice progressed, with drivers soon switching to intermediate tyres. Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest, behind Carlos Sainz Jr.. Despite <b>going</b> <b>off</b> the track late in the session, Fernando Alonso was ninth fastest in the McLaren with the new power unit. A gearbox problem meant that Pastor Maldonado was unable {{to take to the}} track, while at Sauber, Raffaele Marciello replaced Felipe Nasr, ending the session three-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Marcus Ericsson.|$|E

60|$|Before recess {{it began}} to be known among them that Pony was <b>going</b> to run <b>off,</b> because his father had made him come back, and then they did think he was somebody; {{and as soon as}} they got out at recess they all crowded round him and began to praise him up, and everything, and to tell him that they would run off, too, if their fathers sent them back; and so he began to be glad {{that he was going to}} do it. They asked him when he was <b>going</b> to run <b>off,</b> and he told them they would see; and pretty soon it was {{understood}} that he was <b>going</b> to run <b>off</b> the same night.|$|R

5|$|On December 15, 2002, ABC aired Nancy Drew, {{starring}} Maggie Lawson {{and produced}} by Lawrence Bender. The movie {{was intended to}} be a pilot for a possible weekly series, which saw Nancy and her friends <b>going</b> <b>off</b> to college in a modern setting. Like the 1930s films, this pilot also took a more mature turn. The pilot aired as part of The Wonderful World of Disney series, with additional scripts being ordered and production contingent on the movie's reception. The series was passed at ABC, and UPN also passed following Lawson being cast on another series.|$|E
5|$|The season points leader {{entering}} the race, Gil de Ferran, {{was awarded the}} pole position when qualifying was cancelled after a practice session was rained out. Bräck took the lead early in the race, and built a seven-second advantage before <b>going</b> <b>off</b> course while trying to lap another car. Carpentier took his place after the lap 64 incident, and held the lead until Tony Kanaan passed him on lap 95. After passing Carpentier for second, Alex Zanardi moved ahead of Kanaan {{after a series of}} pit stops between laps 121 to 123. Zanardi held the top spot entering his final scheduled pit stop with 12 laps remaining.|$|E
5|$|While McLaren {{once again}} succeeded in {{advancing}} both cars into Q2, Fernando Alonso's car {{stopped in the}} first corner due to an electrical fault {{at the start of}} the second session, and he took no further part in qualifying. Team mate Jenson Button was more successful, missing out on Q3 when his second fast lap was interrupted by Nico Rosberg <b>going</b> <b>off</b> at Sainte Dévote. The second Williams of Felipe Massa completed a problematic Saturday for the team, claiming only 14th on the grid, while Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean also did not make it into Q3.|$|E

5|$|With all the walkers subdued from Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson)'s barn, Hershel demands Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and {{his group}} leave the farm. Rick confronts Shane (Jon Bernthal) {{regarding}} his actions leading to this, but Shane considers Rick as delusional as Hershel. The group decides to bury the walker bodies of Hershel's wife and stepson as well as Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, while burning {{the rest of the}} walkers. They hold a makeshift memorial service for Sophia, but Carol refuses to attend. She falls into a deep depression, <b>going</b> <b>off</b> into the woods to pull up flowers, including a Cherokee Rose that has been a sign of hope for her. Shane finds her and helps return her to the camp, apologizing to her that he had no idea Sophia was in the barn.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be <b>going</b> <b>off</b> far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October 2012, O'Gara {{scored a}} penalty and {{conversion}} before <b>going</b> <b>off</b> {{injured in the}} 34th minute in Munster's 22-17 defeat against Racing Métro 92 in their 2012–13 Heineken Cup opener. As a result, O'Gara missed Munster's bonus-point victory against Edinburgh in Round 2, but he returned and scored 15 points in Munster's next pool game against Saracens, which saw Munster scrape a win. He became Munster's most capped player ever on 5 January 2013, when he won his 233rd cap against Cardiff Blues. O'Gara was cited and banned for one week after kicking Edinburgh's Sean Cox in the Heineken Cup Round 4 fixture between the two sides, which ruled him out of Munsters 29-6 victory over Racing Metro which secured qualification from the group stages. He kicked all of Munster's points in their 12-18 Heineken Cup quarter-final victory over Harlequins on 7 April 2013. O'Gara kicked five points for Munster in their 16-10 Heineken Cup semi-final defeat to Clermont Auvergne on 27 April 2013.|$|E

50|$|The form of Aaron Lennon {{meant that}} Bentley was mostly {{used as a}} {{substitute}} for the start 2009-10 season, although he did score a free kick in Tottenham's 9-1 victory over Wigan Athletic, with the ball then <b>going</b> in <b>off</b> the back of Wigan goalkeeper Chris Kirkland.|$|R
5000|$|Overtaking [...] - [...] Formula D {{rules are}} {{structured}} {{so as not}} to encourage drivers to overtake their opponents; doing so incurs a penalty.

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them <b>going</b> <b>off</b> to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E
5|$|Wurz, Herbert, Salo and Heidfeld {{all made}} pit stops on lap 18, while Trulli lost time after <b>going</b> <b>off</b> the track. On the 19th lap, Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve, Frentzen, Pedro de la Rosa and Fisichella made their first pit stops. Barrichello and Button made pit {{stops on the}} {{following}} lap, and rejoined ahead of Irvine. Alesi retired from the race with an engine failure and spun off onto the circuit on lap 21. Häkkinen made a pit stop on lap 22. Michael Schumacher took over the lead for one lap before his pit stop on lap 23 giving it to Coulthard. The Scot took his pit stop on lap 24 handing back the lead to teammate Häkkinen. On the same lap, Villeneuve passed Irvine into turn 16 for seventh position. All of the drivers had made pit stops {{by the end of}} lap 25. The race order was Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Button, Irvine, Herbert, Frentzen, Trulli, Diniz, Zonta, Salo, de la Rosa, Heidfeld, Fisichella, Gené, Wurz and Mazzacane. Häkkinen set a new fastest lap of the race on lap 26, a 1:39.189, as he built a gap between himself and Michael Schumacher to 2.9 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Barrichello set the fastest time in the first practice session, at 1 minute and 41.953 seconds, which was three-tenths of a second quicker than Pedro de la Rosa of Arrows. Coulthard was third fastest despite <b>going</b> <b>off</b> the circuit at the Clark chicane. Michael Schumacher went off at the Senna chicane en route to recording the fourth quickest lap, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Häkkinen, Montoya, Irvine, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. In the second practice session, Irvine was running quicker by setting the fastest {{time of the day}} of 1:41.424, ahead of Montoya in second. Häkkinen was third quickest, in front of Barrichello in fourth. Michael Schumacher took fifth place, running wide at the circuit's chicanes which prevented him from setting a quicker lap. de la Rosa, Coulthard, Jean Alesi, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher, who collided with the Sudkurve tyre barrier, followed in the top ten.|$|E
