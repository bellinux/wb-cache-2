5|$|From the 15th century, {{changes to}} the areas {{surrounding}} Santa María de Óvila initiated a slow decline. Civil wars depopulated the villages of the upper Tagus valley.

Neighbors looted more lands.|$|E

5|$|The A Station {{had been}} {{operated}} by the London Power Company, {{but by the time}} the B Station was completed, the UK's electric supply industry had been nationalised, and ownership of the two stations had passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the British Electricity Authority in 1948.

5|$|The Mediterranean had at {{this time}} fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> pirates, largely from Cilicia. The pirates not only strangled {{shipping}} lanes but also plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia. Pompey was nominated as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against the pirates. It took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the sea of pirates and restore communication between Iberia (Spain), Africa, and Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{paper was}} founded by a Huguenot family, the de la Fonts, and passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> another Huguenot family, the Luzacs, in 1738.

5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
5|$|After leasing it to Warner {{for four}} years, Sinatra sought {{to sell the}} {{property}} to Howard Hughes in 1967 {{as part of the}} renewal of his contract at the Sands Hotel and Casino.

This included a requirement for Sinatra's stake in Cal Neva to be purchased by his new employer for $2 million, but instead the lodge passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the same owners as Reno's Club Cal-Neva in 1968 for $1.4 million.|$|E
5|$|After the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes {{and kills}} Henry. Glass uses Henry's corpse {{on his horse}} as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a {{riverbank}} where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the Arikara. The chief kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara spare Glass. Heavily wounded, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, {{its first}} foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, he treated the {{population}} generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, {{although he did}} not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan Kings suggests to historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon to deal with a Dardani invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> successive tyrants.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in his}} tenure, Kosygin {{challenged}} Brezhnev's {{right as}} general secretary to represent the country abroad, a function Kosygin believed should fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> the head of government, as was common in non-communist countries. This was actually implemented for a short period, which led Henry A. Kissinger to believe that Kosygin {{was the leader of}} the Soviet Union. Kosygin, who had been the chief negotiator with the First World during the 1960s, was hardly to be seen outside the Second World after Brezhnev consolidated his position within the Politburo, but also due to Andrei Gromyko's dislike of Kosygin meddling into his own ministerial affairs.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire, Flanders became part of the Merovingian realm of Neustria. In the 9th century it became part of West Francia, forming a pagus within the kingdom of Charles the Bald. In 864, Cassel passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> Baldwin Ironarm, who expanded his holdings to become the first count of the County of Flanders. At the time, the town was {{on the edge of a}} deep bay of the North Sea, making it vulnerable to raids by the Vikings, who attacked and destroyed it in the 9th century. It was rebuilt by Baldwin's grandson, Arnulf I, in the 10th century.|$|E
