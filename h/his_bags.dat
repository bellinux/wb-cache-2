5|$|Icke met {{his first}} wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a {{dance at the}} Chesford Grange Hotel near Leamington Spa; she {{was working as a}} van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows he had started having with his father—always a domineering man, his father was upset that Icke's {{arthritis}} was interfering with his football career—so he packed <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice a week in the evenings to play football.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

25|$|By Monday, July 11, Speck had outstayed his welcome {{with his}} sister Martha and her family. After packing <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> and again being driven by his {{brother-in-law}} to the NMU hiring hall to await a berth on a ship, Speck stayed that evening at Pauline's rooming house, a mile away at 3028 E. 96th St. in the Vets Park neighborhood of South Deering, Chicago.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ambush}} in via Fani the terrorists took {{only the most}} {{interesting}} for them of the five bags that Moro carried with him. Those containing the politician's medicines and his reserved documents. Further, the necessity of inflicting a coup de grâce {{to any of the}} bodyguards is in contrast with a hurried attack typical of such acts, and is motivated only by the necessity to eliminate any possible witness that would reveal that Moro was not there. In a letter to his wife Moro wrote during captivity he asked her to take care of <b>his</b> <b>bags.</b> Since Moro was surely aware that if <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> had been found in the massacre location, they had been taken by the investigators. Also the absence from his letter of any word about the victims of via Fani has been taken as an element in favour of the theory that Moro was captured while in his Gladio escort (see Involvement of P2, Gladio and of the Italian intelligence services) and not in via Fani and so did not know anything about their assassination.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completing}} his formal education at Belfast Academical Institution {{he wrote to}} his mother in New York City. While incubating a desire to move there the fifteen-year-old Stewart was prevailed upon by Lamb to gain some business experience by earning money as a grocer in Belfast. Quickly wearying of the work, Stewart packed <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> in the spring of 1818 and left for New York with the $500 he had earned as a bag boy.|$|E

25|$|On Tuesday, July 12, Speck {{returned}} to the NMU hiring hall and in mid-afternoon received an assignment on Sinclair Oil's tanker SS Sinclair Great Lakes, a thirty-minute drive away in East Chicago, Indiana, but when he arrived there he found his spot had already been taken and was driven back to the by then closed NMU hiring hall. Speck {{did not have enough}} money for a rooming house, so he dropped off <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> six blocks east at the Manor Shell filling station at 9954 S. Torrence Ave. and slept in an unfinished house just off E. 103rd St.|$|E

25|$|A {{friend in}} Vienna, the old Count Karol Lanckoroński (Karl Lanckoronski) {{a large man}} of huge charm, who had a fine {{collection}} of art at his palace in Vienna, persuaded Seilern he should collect also, and in 1931, {{after the death of}} his grandmother, when he received his share of an enormous inheritance, he was able to devote himself to the study of art history and to serious collecting. During the years 1930 to 1933 he travelled widely, particularly in Africa, in search of big-game (as the trophies that could be seen at his house at Princes Gate after the war testified) though <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> were reputedly always packed with art books. He even acquired a pilot's license in Berlin.|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday, July 13, after {{picking up}} <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> and {{checking}} {{in at the}} NMU hiring hall, angry at being sent to a non-existent assignment, Speck talked for thirty minutes in their car with his sister Martha and her husband Gene who had driven down to visit him at 9 a.m., parked on E. 100th St. next to Luella Elementary School, {{across the street from}} the townhouses where the nurses lived. At 10:30a.m., tired of waiting at the NMU hiring hall for a job and with $25 his sister had given him, Speck left and walked a mile and a half east on E. 100th St. to check in at the Shipyard Inn at E. 101st St. & S. Avenue N, an East Side, Chicago rooming house.|$|E
25|$|Gautham Subramaniam (Jayam Ravi) is {{a doctor}} from an Indian family who lives in Chennai. Since his father (Nizhagal Ravi) and mother are doctors, he {{wanted to become a}} doctor. Gautham gets an {{opportunity}} from the Government of India to go to Russia to represent India in a week long medical conference, along with five other young doctors. Gautham is delighted to receive this offer and packs <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> to fly to Russia. Meanwhile, his beloved is introduced on the frame which happens to be Shenba (Kangana Ranaut). She happens to be the same village girl in which Gautham's sister Sarasu (Anu Haasan) resides with her husband (Chetan) and so they two meet and fall in love. Despite initial frictions between her father and uncle (Pithamagan Mahadevan and Bose Venkat) with Gautham, they eventually agree to get the pair married. Gautham’s parents agree to the marriage, and as a happy man, Gautham is ready to marry Shenba after his return to India from his Russia trip.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1993 season, Ablett was {{encouraged}} by his coach, Malcolm Blight, to move from his customary roaming half-forward position to full-forward, {{in an effort to}} prolong his career. The move up forward proved to be a master-stroke, with Ablett thriving in his goal-kicking role, reaching the 50 goal mark in just six games, equalling the sixty-year record of South Melbourne legend Bob Pratt. He brought up his maiden century of goals in the season just eight games later, one game slower than record-holder Pratt, and became the first Geelong player to kick 100 goals in a season since Larry Donohue in 1976. Although the Cats did not make the Finals, Ablett's new-found dominance up forward was highlighted during the season with <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> of ten or more goals on five occasions – including a 14-goal performance against Essendon in Round 6. His end-of-season total of 124 goals, achieved in just 17 appearances, earned him his first Coleman Medal as the League's leading goal-scorer, the Leigh Matthews Trophy, his AFLMA Player of the Year Award, and a top ten placing in the Brownlow Medal.|$|E
25|$|After Fatboy {{breaks a}} tree in Albert Square, Leon helps to replace it but is horrified to {{discover}} the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day Zsa Zsa makes a joke when Leon speaks after a prolonged silence, causing Leon to walk out. She finds him to apologise, as she had not realised the discovery had affected him badly. He then recalls the day his mother {{died in a car}} crash when it took an hour for firemen to cut him free and he was unable to lean over to close his mother's eyes. He admits to Zsa Zsa that he sometimes feels alone. He fails most of his GCSE exams. Months later he flirts with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) in the local bookmaker's and agree to meet later. He obtains two tickets to a music festival in France and plans to take Zsa Zsa, but he reveals to Fatboy that he slept with Glenda, who tells Mercy, who then tells Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Leon if he has seen anyone else but he says no. Zsa Zsa then seduces Leon in Fatboy's van before throwing him out in his underwear and leaving Walford for France. Leon decides that as <b>his</b> <b>bags</b> are packed he will go to France anyway, hinting that he will follow Zsa Zsa to apologise and resume their relationship. Before leaving, he tells Fatboy that he will always be his best friend and they continue to stay in touch.|$|E
