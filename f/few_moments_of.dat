25|$|The {{following}} weekend, Parma travelled off {{the mainland}} to Sardinia to play Cagliari. For {{the second week}} in a row, Parma played out a goalless draw with <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> note. Not even the return from injury of loanee Sergio Floccari could spark a Parma revival, but another man returning from injury, Francesco Modesto, did come off the bench to make his 300th career appearance, while club captain Stefano Morrone made his 150th league appearance for the club. Sebastian Giovinco and Cristian Zaccardo both went off with injuries during the match.|$|E

After a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> mirth at the reunion, Orion shows up, seeking Sylvia. He and Aminta fight; Sylvia {{barricades}} herself in Diana's shrine and Orion attempts to follow. The goddess of the hunt, outraged at this act, smites Orion and denies Aminta and Sylvia congress. Compassionate Eros gives Diana a vision. The goddess reminisces over her own young love of Endymion, also a shepherd. Diana has {{a change of heart}} and repeals her decree. Aminta and Sylvia come together under the deities' good will.|$|E

He is used {{in one of the}} elite Myrmidon guards that belong to no particular Overlord, which are ordered to drown Gold-Eye and Ninde {{near the end of the}} book. When the Change Projector is destroyed, the device controlling his brain is disabled, giving him a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> humanity during which he recites a small poem in English and tells Gold-Eye that he was once Sam Allen; after this, he falls into the water and dies due to the lack of Projector radiation energy.|$|E

25|$|His <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> fame {{came when}} West Zone played North {{in the final}} of the 1990–91 Duleep Trophy at Jamshedpur. It was a bitter match which saw {{sledging}} and arguments between the players of the two sides. While North Zone was batting for the second time on the last day, already having taken a decisive lead in the game, Patel pulled out a stump and attacked the North opener Raman Lamba. Patel had earlier ran onto the crease which prompted Lamba to warn him and it resulted in an argument between the two. The play was called off fifteen minutes before tea on the final day. Patel defended his action arguing that his intention was only to defend himself against Lamba who was rushing towards him wielding his bat, and that he had only hit Lamba's bat thrice and not his person. Four weeks later a three-member disciplinary committee composed of Madhavrao Scindia, M.A.K. Pataudi and Raj Singh Dungarpur banned Patel for 13 months and Lamba for 10 months. Patel's career after his return from the ban was even more undistinguished.|$|E
25|$|The second {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} {{takes place in}} human fluids. The body {{is made up of}} 60% water, much of it intra-vascular and inter-cellular. Within a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> entering a microgravity environment, fluid is immediately re-distributed to the upper body resulting in bulging neck veins, puffy face and sinus and nasal congestion which can last throughout the duration of the trip and is very much like the symptoms of the common cold. In space the autonomic reactions of the body to maintain blood pressure are not required and fluid is distributed more widely around the whole body. This results in a decrease in plasma volume of around 20%. These fluid shifts initiate a cascade of adaptive systemic effects that can be dangerous upon return to earth. Orthostatic intolerance results in astronauts returning to Earth after extended space missions being unable to stand unassisted for more than 10 minutes at a time without fainting. This {{is due in part to}} changes in the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and the loss of plasma volume. Although this effect becomes worse the longer the time spent in space, as yet all individuals have returned to normal within at most a few weeks of landing.|$|E
500|$|A year later, Takemitsu {{returned}} to the instrumental combination of shakuhachi, biwa, and orchestra, in the less well known work Autumn (1973). The significance of this work is revealed in its far greater integration of the traditional Japanese instruments into the orchestral discourse; whereas in November Steps, the two contrasting instrumental ensembles perform largely in alternation, with only a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> contact.

All parts of the mushroom turn an intense blue color within a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> bruising or cutting. The mushroom is edible, despite its hard stem. A less common variety occurs where the color change is to deep violet rather than blue. The bluing reaction results from the oxidation of a chemical called gyrocyanin.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hampp of Billboard was mixed, writing that, [...] "Sadly, the second-verse {{reference}} to 'Lady Marmalade' {{remains one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> fun on this otherwise tepid track". Sam Hine of Popjustice called it [...] "pop filler" [...] and [...] "it prompts his headache to really kick in". Several critics compared [...] "Around the World" [...] to songs performed by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. Kitty Empire of The Observer called it a [...] "come-hither tune", also writing that it is a [...] "Rihanna-copping". [...] T'cha Dunlevy, a writer for the Montreal Gazette, agreed with EMpire's sentiments, calling it [...] "a blatant Rihanna ripoff". Annie Zaleschi of The A.V. Club echoed the same thought, calling it a [...] "Rihanna reject".|$|E
500|$|Oral {{argument}} in Bakke {{took place on}} October 12, 1977. There was intense public interest in the case; prospective attendees began to line up the afternoon before. The court session took two hours, with Cox arguing for the university, Colvin for Bakke, and Solicitor General Wade H. McCree for the United States. Colvin was admonished by Justice Byron White for arguing the facts, rather than the Constitution. Cox provided one of the <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> levity during the argument when Justice Harry A. Blackmun wondered whether the set-aside seats could be compared to athletic scholarships. [...] Cox was willing to agree, but noted {{that he was a}} Harvard graduate, and as for sporting success, [...] "I don't know whether it's our aim, but we don't do very well." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen {{noted that}} [...] "Henriksen invests [...] world-weariness with a soothing, almost {{beautiful}} patience, and those <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> delight he's {{allowed on the}} show [...] are sincere instead of cloying". DVD Talk's Randy Miller considered the character to have been [...] "masterfully played" [...] by Henriksen. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, felt that Henriksen [...] "seiz the part with a confidence that makes him immediately a more credible character" [...] than Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, the lead roles in Millennium sister show The X-Files. Writing for Slant magazine, Keith Uhlich described Henriksen's portrayal of Black as [...] "the perfect actorly complement to Carter's thematic obsessions", calling the character a [...] "mortal survivalist pushing ever-forward, {{even in the face}} of the devil's idle temptations".|$|E
500|$|Despite lacking {{support from}} Cornwallis' main army, Tarleton's cavalry struck {{immediately}} upon {{arriving at the}} scene, charging into the militia's makeshift camp. At {{the first sign of}} the British approach, the Patriots attempted to organize a defense under the ad-hoc command of Captain Nathaniel M. Martin, who tried to rally the militia to a line behind a nearby rail fence. [...] There is also evidence that Col. Thomas Farmer and some 300 militia were stationed at the tavern as a secondary defensive line. Tarleton claimed to have led the charge by reminding his cavalrymen to [...] "remember the Cowpens". The British won in a quick and convincing fashion, dispersing the outnumbered militia units before they managed to complete their rally. Martin was captured in the first <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> the battle, thereafter leaving the Patriots without any effective tactical command. With Patriot forces under the effects of such confusion, Tarleton divided his dragoons into smaller parties, ordering them to chase and further disburse the militia from the area.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{said the}} film [...] "succeeds well enough as a genial {{diversion}} {{and sometimes a}} delightful one, predicated on the rarely heeded Hollywood wisdom that less really can be more." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, [...] "Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff, with its parallel father-daughter melodrama, is elemental button-pushing, a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Playful in unexpected ways and graced with a genuinely off-center sense of humor, Ant-Man (engagingly directed by Peyton Reed) is light on its feet the way the standard-issue Marvel behemoths never are." [...] Kim Newman of Empire wrote that it [...] "straddles as many genres as the Avengers films have characters but manages to do most of them pretty well. Extremely likable, with a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> proper wonder." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "This film is a passable piece of drone work from the ever-expanding Marvel-Disney colony." ...|$|E

500|$|The Strawberry Panic! {{short stories}} were {{initially}} panned by Erica Friedman as being [...] "distinctly derivative of Maria-sama ga Miteru". Friedman {{is the president}} of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned out pretty good". She went on to say, [...] "There's no denying that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> dignity and elegance out of the trash heap." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the Strawberry Panic! manga as [...] "a nearly plotless cascade [...] everything seems rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot." ...|$|E

She also performed the song at the Billboard Women in Music event on December 11, 2015, where she was presented with the award for Woman of the Year. The song was also performed at an intimate gathering at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. The audience consisted of the filmmakers and the rape survivors featured in the documentary. Gaga reportedly became emotional while performing the song, and thanked the filmmakers for including the song in the film. She also performed the song at the 2015 Producers Guild of America Awards, where The Hunting Ground was awarded a special recognition trophy. Actress America Ferrera introduced Gaga but she did not appear on stage for sometime leading to a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> [...] "nervous laughter from the audience" [...] as Ferrera tried to joke about the situation, until the singer finally arrived in front of her piano on stage.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} airing on March 15, 2009, [...] "The Juice is Loose" [...] was watched by 7.21 million households and acquired a 3.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic. It was the most-watched {{show in the}} [...] "Animation Domination" [...] block, surpassing The Simpsons, American Dad! and King of the Hill. The episode received mixed reviews from television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave [...] "The Juice Is Loose" [...] 5.5/10, saying that the episode was [...] "a largely forgettable episode with only a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> brilliance". The review criticized the usage of a three-minute long Conway Twitty live action singing clip which was received as an [...] "effort {{to reduce the amount}} of animation... for the episode". Alex Rocha of TV Guide said that he [...] "did enjoy this episode" [...] but called the Conway Twitty clip a [...] "filler" [...] and that he would have wanted to see a [...] "blank screen or even commercials" [...] instead. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club stated that the episode [...] "relied on an overabundance of pop culture riffs far too dated to elicit much more than a brief chuckle", and also criticized the Conway Twitty clip. He graded [...] "The Juice Is Loose" [...] a C+.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{a positive response}} from reviewers. They disagreed over how well Paltrow was used, but generally praised the Brittany–Santana and Kurt–Burt storylines. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon deemed [...] "Sexy" [...] an episode of mixed messages, one which treated the issues it raised with [...] "an appropriate amount of levity", but failed to [...] "play the nuances of the [...] argument as delicately as it probably thought it did." [...] His Atlantic co-writer Patrick Burns criticized the series for glorifying a risqué subject, [...] "then half-heartedly attempt to hammer home a moral." [...] Meghan Brown, also writing for The Atlantic, called it a [...] "solid episode with some strong character moments." [...] Time James Poniewozik felt that the episode [...] "began clumsily, lacked subtlety, involved some embarrassing moments" [...] and focused too much on Paltrow, but as it continued, [...] "achieve a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> delight and honest emotion". Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times described it as [...] "incredibly comprehensive and enjoyable to boot", and IGN Robert Canning said it [...] "avoided preaching and teaching and instead just had some fun and let guest star Gwyneth Paltrow steal all the scenes". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Glee continues its climb, delicately and successfully marrying actual sex lessons with camp and humor".|$|E
500|$|Late in the afternoon, {{after hours}} of fighting, Wilson's men ran out of ammunition, and reacted to this by rising to their feet, shaking each other's hands and singing a song, {{possibly}} [...] "God Save the Queen". The Matabele downed their own rifles and ended the battle charging with assegai spears. Some of the whites allegedly used their last bullets to commit suicide. According to an eyewitness, [...] "the white inDuna" [...] (Wilson) {{was the last to}} die, standing motionless before the Matabele with blood streaming from wounds all over his body. After a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> hesitation, a young warrior ran forward and killed him with his assegai. The Matabele usually mutilated the bodies of their foes after a victory, but on this occasion they did not: [...] "The white men died so bravely we would not treat them as we do the cowardly Mashonas and others," [...] an inDuna explained. At Mjaan's orders, the bodies of the patrol were left untouched, though the whites' clothes and two of their facial skins were collected the next morning to serve as proof to Lobengula of the battle's outcome. [...] "I had two sons killed that day," [...] Ingubo warrior M'Kotchwana later said, [...] "and my brother was shot in the stomach. The amakiwa [...] were brave men; they were warriors." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Gareth McLean {{described}} the episode as a [...] "bold move" [...] {{on the part}} of the EastEnders producers in deviating from the serial's usual format, and found it to be [...] "compelling and brave", but [...] "not as convincing as it should be". The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan felt that Brown gave a [...] "mesmerising" [...] performance, but was critical of the episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn't be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing. Had it been a swan song, it would have been a worthy one. But doubtless Dot will be out and about again tonight, fag in hand, quoting from the Good Book. Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was, I suspect that most fans will be hoping this one-hander remains a one-off." [...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. O'Donovan compared the episode to Krapp's Last Tape, saying [...] "it must be said there were quite a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> positively (or perhaps that should be negatively) Beckettian bleakness here as Dot recalled, in painfully vivid detail, how time and time again 'life took away everything I ever cared about' and 'all that I ever 'ad, I lorst'." ...|$|E
