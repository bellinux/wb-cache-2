[...] Congreso celebrado del 7 - 12, abril, 2013, en Viena, Austria. Conversion of forest ecosystems into croplands often leads to severe decrease of the soil organic matter (SOM) levels with the concomitant <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure.</b> The present research focuses {{on the effects of}} cultivation on the stability of soil macroaggregates, {{as well as on the}} total quantity and quality of SOM.

40|$|The 42 {{plots of}} the Versailles {{long-term}} bare fallow experiment offer exceptional opportunities {{to study the}} impacts of fertilizers and amendments on soil physical properties. In this experiment, continuous annual applications since 1928 of 16 different treatments – including nitrates, phosphates, manure, ammonium, calcium, and potassium salts – have led to strongly diverging {{physical and chemical properties}} in the soil's surface layer. In this work, the proportion of water dispersible clay (WDC), which is considered a good indicator of soil structural stability and sensitivity to crusting and erosion, was determined in all plots of the experiment. The results showed the influence of the valence of cations and pH on soil structure and clay dispersability. Application of sodium or potassium salts deteriorated the degree of soil aggregation, with increased bulk density and WDC values, whereas amendment with manure or calcium salts ameliorated soil aggregation, with decreasing bulk density and WDC. The strong acidification of the soils receiving ammonium-based fertilizers was another factor related to the increase of water dispersible clay, and therefore the <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure.</b> This study emphasizes the role of potassium and ammonium, associated with fertilizer additions, on the <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> and on the increase of the risk of erosion...|$|E
40|$|Water {{soil erosion}} is a {{phenomenon}} in which soil particles are separated transported and translocated {{by the action of}} rain water. Removal of topsoil by water flow leads to a decrease of humus in the soil, <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure,</b> compaction, and reduction of microbial activity. Developed and tested have been number of methods and technologies for soil protection from the effects of water erosion. Such technology is vertical mulching, and straw or compost applied as mulching material. This work is a study of the changes that occur in some soil chemical properties and soil microbiological activity, as a result in the implementation of anti-erosion measure vertical mulching with different mulching materials for growing corn and wheat grain on carbonate chernozem, on sloping agricultural lands...|$|E
50|$|Clay {{particles}} {{with considerable}} ESP (> 16), {{in contact with}} non-saline soil moisture have an expanded DAZ zone and the soil swells (dispersion).The phenomenon results in <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> <b>structure,</b> and especially crust formation and compaction of the top layer.Hence the infiltration capacity <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> and the water availability in the soil is reduced, whereas the surface-water-logging or runoff is increased. Seedling emergence and crop production are badly affected.|$|R
50|$|To {{reclaim the}} soils {{completely}} one needs prohibitively {{high doses of}} amendments. Most efforts are therefore directed to improving the top layer only (say the first 10 cm <b>of</b> the <b>soils),</b> as the top layer is most sensitive to <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> <b>structure.</b> The treatments, however, need to be repeated in a few (say 5) years' time. Trees / plants follow gravitropism. It is difficult to survive in alkali soils for the trees with deeper rooting system which can be more than 60 meters deep in good non-alkali soils.|$|R
40|$|In 1932, a {{nitrogen}} fertilizer trial was initiated on a loamy Oxyaquic Eutrochrept near Munich (Germany). After 45 years, the sodium nitrate plots showed {{a much stronger}} slaking <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> surface compared to the calcium nitrate plots in 1976. Sampling of the experimental plots to 1 m depth {{in order to determine}} bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture characteristic, slaking resistance and exchangeable cations was only possible after termination of the experiment in 1998. Comparison of the laboratory results of both plots showed increased contents of exchangeable Na, but no decrease of exchangeable Ca for the sodium nitrate plots. Bulk density at depths > 50 cm increased and the slaking resistance decreased on those plots. The other soil structural properties determined were not significantly affected. The reason behind these unexpected findings is the change from sodium nitrate to calcium nitrate + cattle salt as the sodium nitrate fertilizer in 1984, 15 years prior to sampling. The resulting additional supply of Ca 2 + was able to remediate the formerly visible <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> by Na+. The adverse structural effects of an unfavourable fertilizer type (based on monovalent cations) can therefore be reversed by a change to a more appropriate type (based on bivalent cations, preferentially Ca 2 +) ...|$|R
40|$|After {{mulching}} {{of winter}} pea on 1 st of May 2007 for green manuring four different varieties of millet were sown without any tillage {{directly into the}} mulch cover or after tillage by a rotary harrow on a brown earth (Cambisol) near Dresden, Germany. Due to <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> through the impact of rain after tillage seed emergence, plant height and grain yield of millet were reduced in tilled compared to no tilled plots. Although the content of mineral N in the soil was much higher after rotary harrowing nitrogen use efficiency of millet was significantly higher when growing without any tillage. This effect could {{be caused by a}} higher ratio of NH 4 -N to total mineral N in the soil which can be an advantage for plant growth with respect to the energy demand for nitrogen assimilation...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural intensification, {{especially}} enhanced mechanisation of soil management, {{can lead}} to the <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> and to compaction. A possible amelioration strategy is the application of (structural) lime. In this study, we tested the effect of two different liming materials, ie limestone (CaCO 3) and quicklime (CaO), on soil aggregate stability in a 3 -month greenhouse pot experiment with three agricultural soils. The liming materials were applied in the form of pulverised additives at a rate of 2 000 kg ha− 1. Our results show a significant and instantaneous increase of stable aggregates after quicklime application whereas no effects were observed for limestone. Quicklime application seems to improve aggregate stability more efficiently in soils with high clay content and cation exchange capacity. In conclusion, quicklime application may be a feasible strategy for rapid improvement of aggregate stability of fine textured agricultural soils...|$|E
30|$|Direct {{effects of}} fire and the overall changes to the {{ecosystem}} can both lead to short-, medium-, and long-term changes in the soil (Doerr and Cerda 2005). Physical, chemical, and biological soil properties can be altered by fires (Neary et al. 2009, Úbeda and Outeiro 2009). The magnitude and duration of these changes depend on factors like fire severity, peak temperature, and soil type. During severe fires, the most typical effects are loss of organic matter and nutrients through volatilization, ash entrapment in smoke columns, leaching and erosion, alterations of microbial communities, and <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> by affecting aggregate stability (Mataiz-Solera and Cérda 2009). Hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in the post-fire period are dependent {{on the status of}} the soil surface. Reduction in vegetation cover will also lead to changes in soil thermal regime and, in general, higher soil and water losses (Certini 2005).|$|E
30|$|Forest {{fires are}} {{well-known}} events, especially during summer. Forest fires, regularly experienced in regions with hot, dry, or mediterranean climates, represent {{a risk to}} life and extant infrastructure. In Portugal, there are typically between 15 000 and 25 000 forest fires each year (Mateus and Fernandes 2014), burning from 150 000 ha to 250 000 ha. Notwithstanding {{the fact that these}} fires can cause extensive economic damage (typically with tangible repercussions for many years to come), they also threaten human life. Furthermore, the aftermath of forest fires can have other far-reaching consequences. For example, many physical, chemical, mineralogical, and biological soil properties can be affected by forest fires (Certini 2005). Negative effects resulting from high levels of burn severity include significant removal <b>of</b> organic matter, <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> both <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> and porosity, considerable loss of nutrients through volatilization, ash entrapment in smoke columns, leaching, and erosion. Also, the release of hazardous chemicals significantly impacts human health and increases the risk of future diseases. As suggested by Lipsett et al. (2008), wildfire smoke is accompanied by high concentrations of carbon dioxide, which can result in consequences such as headache, mental confusion, nausea, disorientation, coma, and even death. Even at lower concentrations, the effects of carbon dioxide should not be neglected; individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia. A comprehensive study tracking wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990 to 2006 reported that 21.9 % of their deaths occurred from heart attacks (Mangan 2007).|$|R

30|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} {{is accompanied}} by, no doubt, {{an abuse of}} agrochemical inputs and a reckless pumping of groundwater, which are becoming less and less abundant and of poor quality. This leads to a problem of overfertilizing. A number of field observations clearly show an excessive enrichment. Overexploitation of these resources, coupled with the phenomenon of drought, inevitably leads to degradation of soils and waters, which result in problems of salinization, sodization and <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure.</b> The salinization of Sebkha Oran basin, as for most soils of the Maghreb, is initially of primary origin. The soils are in fact made of alluvial materials, more or less salty, resulting from {{the erosion of the}} reliefs and the alteration of the rocks. Soil salinization in these regions is related not only to climatic conditions but also to the often poorly controlled use of irrigation, which results in an accumulation of dissolved salts on the surface (Rahmoune et al. 2001).|$|E
40|$|Global {{population}} growth is expected to impose an increasing pressure on agricultural production in the world's drylands, which cover approximately 41 % of the continental area. The land resources in drylands are severely threatened by soil degradation, with wind erosion being. {{one of the major}} degradation processes. It causes sedimentation at undesired places, crop damage by sand blasting and burial, <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure,</b> a loss of soil fertility, and it affects the water economy in the topsoil. On drylands in developing countries, adequate wind erosion control is currently not achieved due to poor socio-economic conditions, low crop biomass production, crop competition and management constraints. A potential solution is {{to make use of the}} natural dryland vegetation of scattered trees and shrubs. But, more research is needed to better understand the effects of scattered vegetation on wind speed and erosion, as well as on particle deposition and accumulation. This ultimately should lead to models that can help develop location-specific wind erosion control strategies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aspects of}} {{environmental}} degradation can be ascribed to soil (erosion, soil compaction, soil crusting, <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure,</b> flooding, losses of organic matter, salinisation, onsite and offsite damages, etc.) following the impact of human activities. Since the increase of stress application to soil by the agricultural conventional production systems has resulted in excessive erosion and soil degradation, there is need to control and fight such degradation. Among the above mentioned aspects, soil compaction is surely {{one of the most}} important factors responsible for environmental degradation. In fact, stress application like compaction and shearing causes strong modifications to soil structure and reduces not only soil porosity but also pore functions. Therefore the measurements of such a physical property can help to quantify the effects of compaction. This is now possible because of the increasing use and availability of the technique of image analysis allowing the measurement of soil porosity on thin sections or impregnated soil blocks, prepared from undisturbed soil samples. Micro and macroporosity, pore shape and size distribution, penetration resistance...|$|E

Scientists recommended different resource-conserving technologies (RCTs) viz. zero tillage, laser levelling, irrigation based on soil matric potential, bed planting, direct seeding, mechanical transplanting of rice and crop diversification for this purpose. These technologies are site specific and before selecting any particular RCT for a particular region, soil texture and agro-climatic conditions must be considered.

40|$|The {{primary soil}} tillage for {{different}} crops in Croatia is generally based on mouldboard ploughing {{which is the}} most expensive for crops production. Negative effects due to frequent passes by equipment and machines (<b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure,</b> soil compaction, lower biogenity and soil tilth), together with negative economical and energetical costs, can be lowered and avoided by introduction of reduced soil tillage or direct drilling (No-tillage). Accordingly, the main goal of this research was to determine effects of conventional and reduced soil tillage systems on yield components and nodulation ability of nitrogen fixing bacteria in soybean crop. The research was established at chernozem soil type of northern Baranja as monofactorial completely randomized block design in four repetitions. The soil tillage variants were as follows: CT) Conventional Tillage (primary soil tillage by moldboard ploughing at 25 - 30 cm depth), DH) Multiple Diskharrowing at 10 - 15 cm as primary tillage, and NT) Notillage system. Results show significantly lower plant density, mass of 1000 grains and grain yield at variants with reduced soil tillage in both investigation years. However, reduced tillage systems had positive trend on nitrogen-fixing bacteria nodulation, since the highest values of number and mass of nodules per plant were recorded.

Dry aggregate size distribution and related soil structure indices are essential parameters in understanding the structural state of the soil. This study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} different soil types and land uses on structure parameters and to relate them to selected soil properties. The investigation was performed on five soil types (Arenosols, Fluvisols, Chernozems, Gleysols and Solonetz), each from three different locations and under three different land uses (cropland, meadow and forest), so that a total of 135 undisturbed soil samples were collected. Dry sieving analysis was performed to obtain eight aggregate size classes (ASCs) (> 10, 10 - 5, 5 - 3, 3 - 2, 2 - 1, 1 - 0. 5, 0. 5 - 0. 25 and 10, 5 - 3 and 3 - 2 mm ASCs.

30|$|Suitability {{of water}} for {{irrigation}} {{is a function of}} its mineral compositions (Table  2). The quality of water can have an adverse impact on soil/crop productivity. An excess of even small amounts of some salts, but when applied for a long time, coupled with poor agricultural practices and drainage, may radically affect soils (Inayathulla and Paul 2013). High conc. of Na+ in water reduces soil permeability and soil/crop productivity (Ibid). Hence, assessment of Na+ conc. in irrigation water is crucial and is often represented as %Na. Table  2 shows that, 77.7 % of the samples were grouped as excellent (3.7 %), good (7.4 %) or permissible (59.3 %). However, (7.7 %) and (3.7 %) of samples were classified as doubtful and unsuitable, respectively, and could harm crops/soils. These include HD samples (70.5 – 78.4 %, C 4), the two SG samples from the LSPMA (76.3 – 79.6, C 4) and SN 18 (91.8 %, C 5) and should be avoided for irrigation. Generally, water with Na% of > 60 % may result in Na accumulation and <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure,</b> infiltration and aeration rates (Inayathulla and Paul 2013). Further analysis of MD water shows that its EC, %Na, SRC, KR values were all acceptable which is a sharp contrast to HD where most of these parameters were unacceptable and/or doubtful (Table  2). The unfitness of HD water for irrigation is distressing as it already employs 468 farmers in the HIS which supports an annual per capita income of 4000 $ (1, 171, 200 $ of annual local income) (Personal communication with Mr. Ntuza). Thus, sustainability of HD is vital to the populace.|$|E
40|$|The {{disposal}} of olive mill wastewaters (OMWs) {{is a major}} problem that affects soil and groundwater. Different papers have discussed the effects of OMW discharge on soil characteristics, plant production and phytotoxicity. In this work, a holistic approach is proposed and the main research studies regarding the effects of OMWs on crops and soils are reviewed. Generally, direct application of OMWs exerts a temporary positive effect on soil physical properties. However, in clay soils, the accumulation of salts from these wastewaters could lead to the disintegration of the soil structure. <b>Deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> would decrease the soil hydraulic conductivity, which is a key parameter for determining the volume of OMW that can be spread on a soil. Organic matter (OM) makes up approximately 65 % of the OMW dry weight. Among the soil chemical characteristics, the soil pH remains almost constant following OMW applications. Polyphenols are the most limiting factor for spreading OMWs on soils because of their antimicrobial and phytotoxic effects. Nevertheless, these polyphenols are rapidly degraded depending on environmental conditions. Due to the highly variable chemical composition of the OMWs, these effluents provide variable macronutrient inputs (especially potassium and phosphorus), which potentially reduce necessary fertilizer inputs. Regarding soil microflora, the OMWs exert the following two contrasting actions: stimulating microflora development by temporarily enriching soil carbon and inhibiting certain microorganisms and phytopathogenic agents by adding antimicrobial substances to the soil. For many crops, spreading OMWs benefits crop yield. However, the application of OMWs may also damage germination. Thus, the application of OMWs should adequately precede sowing. The beneficial effects of OMWs on crop yields indicate that these wastewaters may become very important sources of OM and nutrients in agriculture soils and positively impact soil fertility. However, to improve their effectiveness, some use restrictions based on soil characteristics were outlined...|$|E

40|$|The main {{aspects of}} {{environmental}} degradation can be ascribed to soil (erosion, soil compaction, soil crusting, <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure,</b> flooding, losses of organic matter, salinisation, onsite and offsite damages, etc.) following the impact of human activities. Since agricultural conventional production systems have resulted in excessive erosion and soil degradation, there is need to control and fight such degradation. Scientific results have clearly showed that the agricultural management systems {{can play an important}} role in preventing soil degradation provide that appropriate management practices are adopted. Long-term field experiments in different types of soils have shown that alternative tillage systems, like minimum tillage, ripper subsoiling, etc., improve the soil structural quality. The continuous conventional tillage causes a decrease of soil organic matter content that is associated to a decrease of aggregate stability, leading, as a consequence, to the formation of surface crusts, with an increase of runoff and erosion risks. Other aspects of very dangerous soil degradation (erosion) in the hilly environments are represented by land levelling and scraping. After levelling, slopes being prepared for plantation (in particularly vineyard) are almost always characterised by the presence of large amounts of incoherent earth materials accumulated with scraper. In this vulnerable condition, a few summer storms can easily cause soil losses exceeding 500 Mg ha- 1 y- 1. Moreover, the land levelling and the following soil loss causes drastic alteration of the landscape and loss of the cultural value of soil. Subsoil compaction is strongly under evaluated, even though the presence of a ploughpan at the lower limit of cultivation is largely widespread in the alluvial soils of the plains cultivated by monoculture and it is responsible of the frequent flooding of such plains in occasion of heavy rains concentrated in a short time (rainstorm), because the presence of this ploughpan strongly reduced drainage. Alternative tillage practices, like ripper subsoiling, are able to avoiding the formation of this compact layer. The soil conservation can be realised through a correct soil management and, therefore, it is essential to know this resource and to have pedological data bases of appropriate detail...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{application}} of lime to an acid Nekia soil significantly increased the yield of winter wheat and alfalfa {{in a field}} experiment. Crop yields maximized when the lime was partially mixed into the surface four inches of the soil. Thorough mixing of the lime into the surface six inches of soil did not increase crop yields over partial mixing of lime, and on some plots the yields were reduced by the more thorough mixing treatment. The reduction in yield on the thoroughly mixed plots occurred with the lower rates of lime application. <b>Deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> due to rototilling was also {{a factor in the}} reduction of yield in the plots where the lime was thoroughly mixed. The yields of wheat decreased over a three-year period following the {{application of}} one ton of lime per acre. It was felt that part of this decrease in yield was caused by a more thorough mixing of the lime into the soil with annual seedbed preparation on the partially mixed plots, and by a decrease of Ca and increase of Al in the soil solution as the quantity of free lime in the soil decreased. The importance of the soil solution pH and Al and Ca concentrations in the soil solution is also demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} R 2 values for the relationship between the soil test pH and wheat yields, were highest for the 1 N KC 1 pH values the first two years, and highest for the water pH value the third year. Third-year wheat yields were also decreased by an infestation of the root fungus, Ophiobolus Graninus, with the adverse effect on the yield decreasing as the lime rates increased. High levels of soil acidity adversely affected the survival of the alfalfa seedlings and the rhizobia which inoculate the alfalfa. The concentration of nitrogen in the plants and the quantity of nitrogen harvested in the plants, increased as the rate of lime applied increased. The wheat and alfalfa roots which grew in the unlimed soil exhibited Al-toxicity symptoms. The Al-toxic roots were thicker than the healthy roots, and there was very little lateral root development on the Al-affected roots. The application of the intermediate and high rates of lime to the acid Nekia soil eliminated the Al-toxicity symptoms and promoted the growth of fine fibrous root systems. The distribution of the alfalfa roots in the samples taken from the field experiment, corresponded with the distribution of the lime in the soil. The field experimental data showed that the yields of wheat and alfalfa were closely correlated to the weight of the root samples. Growth chamber experiments using winter wheat as an indicator crop and acid Nekia and Dayton soils were also conducted. Maximum yields of dry matter were harvested when 30 per cent of the total soil volume was limed, and the dry matter yield decreased as the low rate of lime was mixed into larger volumes of soil. The wheat roots grew in the limed portion of soil, whereas root growth was restricted in the unlimed soil. Plant analysis data showed that the concentrations of plant nutrients were similar for all lime treatments. Plant water potential data indicated that water stress induced by Al-toxicity of wheat roots contributed to the lower yields of wheat grown in soil receiving zero and one ton of lime per acre...|$|E

Before 1970 s, farming was mainly carried out using low-tech methods, leading to unproductive practices and overexploitation and <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil.</b> From 1970 s, there were technological advances such as new cultivation approaches for intercropping, mulching technologies, and efficient pest control methods, all of which contributed to high productivity of croplands.|$|R
40|$|Soil tillage modifies {{environmental}} conditions <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> microorganisms {{and their ability}} to release nitrogen. We compare the influence of reduced tillage (RT) and mouldboard ploughing (MP) on the soil microbial functioning in organic farming. In order to connect <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> generated by these tillage systems on the soil microbial biomass we adopt a particular sampling scheme based on the morphological characterisation <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> by the description <b>of</b> the <b>soil</b> profile. This method reveals the influence <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> on <b>soil</b> microbial biomass and allows a more precise assessment of the impact of tillage managements on the soil microbial functioning...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} an evaluation <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> by the unconventional method of fractal analysis. The soil is {{represented as a}} pore medium with statistically self-similar structure which represents a fractal structure. The fractal dimension is presented as decisive representative of the structural properties <b>of</b> <b>soil.</b> The fractal dimension is a non-integer number which expresses degradation <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> which was caused by pores. This number includes comprehensively the modification of structural properties <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> induced by arbitrary influence. The fractal dimension of clay-loam and sandy-clay soil {{was related to the}} activity of factors which represented the influence of exactly defined tillage practices (conventional, reduced and direct seeding) in the depths of 0 - 3 and 6 - 9 cm. The intensity and statistical significance of individual factors were determined by analysis of variance. The effects of tillage practices on the modification <b>of</b> surface <b>soil</b> <b>structure</b> represented by fractal dimension and the influence of the tillage depth and the locality were confirmed...|$|R

Artemisia ordosica is the dominant species in Mu Us sandy land, the development <b>of</b> biological <b>soil</b> crust in Artemisia ordosica community seriously impediment precipitations, which result in the <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>soil</b> water within 40 cm, where most of Artemisia ordosica roots distribution. That led to the recession of Artemisia ordosica in the fixed sand dunes in a long time...|$|R
