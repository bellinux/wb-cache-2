5000|$|November 13, 1966 saw Richard Petty win at {{the half}} mile oval with an average speed of 84.112.movie (Tiny Lund) Harder Charger was partly made. Tiny {{dropped out of the}} race with a broken <b>distributor</b> <b>gear.</b> After the race , in the movie a young Southern MotoRacing sales girl ( [...] Joy Tollison Agner) can be seen kissing Richard Petty and jumping up and down in {{excitement}} ! ...|$|E
25|$|In {{mechanically}} timed ignition systems, {{a separate}} cam in the <b>distributor</b> is <b>geared</b> {{to the engine}} and operates a set of breaker points that trigger a spark at the correct time in the combustion cycle.|$|R
5|$|While {{based at}} Verdun, the Patrie was {{stranded}} on Friday, 29November 1907, at nearby Souhesmes {{due to a}} mechanical problem caused by the clothing {{of one of the}} mechanics becoming caught in the <b>distributor</b> drive <b>gear.</b> On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of a spare magneto on board meant that the motor could not be used for the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her overnight in the open at Souhesmes.|$|R
50|$|Large Diesel {{generators}} {{and almost all}} Diesel engines used as the prime mover of ships use compressed air acting directly on the cylinder head. This is not ideal for smaller Diesels, as it provides too much cooling on starting. Also, the cylinder head needs to have enough space to support an extra valve for the air start system. The air start system is conceptually very similar to a distributor in a car. There is an air <b>distributor</b> that is <b>geared</b> to the camshaft of the Diesel engine; {{on the top of}} the air distributor is a single lobe similar to what is found on a camshaft. Arranged radially around this lobe are roller tip followers for every cylinder. When the lobe of the air distributor hits one of the followers it will send an air signal that acts upon the back of the air start valve located in the cylinder head, causing it to open. Compressed air is provided from a large reservoir that feeds into a header located along the engine. As soon as the air start valve is opened, the compressed air is admitted and the engine will begin turning. It can be used on 2-cycle and 4-cycle engines and on reversing engines. On large 2-stroke engines less than one revolution of the crankshaft is needed for starting.|$|R
5000|$|Jaguar {{first used}} the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type {{as well as}} other models. It was used through 1996 (Jaguar IRS Article). There are some {{differences}} in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the pinion shaft is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" [...] Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model {{through the use of a}} special installation kit which includes special shouldered bolts to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard pinion shaft to the IRS housing. <b>Gear</b> <b>distributors</b> with knowledge of the Jag IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears a slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500 hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.|$|R
