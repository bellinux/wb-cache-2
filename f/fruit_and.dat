Although {{there is no}} clear relationship between obesity <b>and</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables consumption, studies suggest that eating <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables could be helpful in preventing childhood obesity. A few school-based interventions targeting youth have been effective at increasing <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables intake. ^ In Austin, Texas, the Sustainable Food Center delivered the Sprouting Healthy Kids (SHK) program that targeted low socio-economic status children in four intervention middle schools. The SHK program delivered six intervention components. This school-based intervention included: a cafeteria component, in-class lessons, an after-school garden program, a field trip to a local farm, food tasting, and farmers 2 ̆ 7 visits to schools.

A total of 214 students completed the pre-and-posttest surveys measuring self-report <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables intake as well as intrapersonal factors. The results showed that the school cafeteria, the food tasting, the after school program, and the farmers 2 ̆ 7 visits had a positive effect on the participants 2 ̆ 7 motivation, knowledge, <b>and</b> self-efficacy towards <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables intake.

We did this by dividing the development processes for the supply of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables for school lunches in Sapporo City into four stages, based on the supply routes and differences in the background features, and by analyzing each stage. The analysis yielded the following three results: 1) the production contracts that limited production areas have been expanding, due to supply through wholesale markets that restrict variations in quality of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables as much as possible to maintain consistency, 2) the production contracts have been expanding due to agreements on supply amounts and periods, in response to measures for safety, security and local production for local comsumption, and 3) supply routes for <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables grown in the local ward have been set up to supply lacal ingredients, as nutritionists at the ward level have become the norm and people have recently renewed their awareness of the need for dietary education resources <b>and</b> locally-grown <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables.
