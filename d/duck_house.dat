The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for an election). Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only after Federalist Party leader Alexander Hamilton—who disfavored Burr's personal character more than Jefferson's policies—had made known his preference for Jefferson.|$|E

50|$|The Agassiz Road <b>Duck</b> <b>House</b> was {{designed}} by architect Alexander Longfellow, and built in 1897. It was used exclusively as a public restroom facility, and was closed after a damaging fire in 1986. The <b>Duck</b> <b>House</b> is sited within a prominent landscape in The Fens adjacent to the Agassiz Road bridge—the only building along that roadway. Agassiz Road is a significant pedestrian link between the East and West Fenway neighborhoods though it provides only one-way vehicular circulation. Much of the building that we see today is original; however, the roof design was simplified when it was reconstructed following the 1986 fire. While the <b>Duck</b> <b>House</b> itself is not a Boston Landmark, its rustic style and relationship to the park makes it an important contributing feature to the Back Bay Fens. Recently, the City of Boston has been reviewing possible ways to revive the <b>Duck</b> <b>House</b> with such ideas as a bicycle rental shop or café.|$|E
50|$|A <b>duck</b> <b>house,</b> duck canopy, or duck island, is {{an often}} {{floating}} structure that ducks can climb onto and into, offering protection from predators such as foxes.

A rather famous example {{can be found at}} Woodway House in Devon. A small domestic version of a <b>duck</b> <b>house</b> is at Knowle Farm in Derbyshire. Such houses are also used for the birds to nest in a safe and convenient area. Dummy eggs, originally ceramic and now plastic, are used to encourage birds to lay in the <b>duck</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E

40|$|Duck rearing is an {{important}} component of sustainable living in poor rural communities, especially as a source of subsistence. A study was conducted on 118 households (N[*]=[*] 1, 373 Jinding ducks, Anas platyrhynchus) from December 2002 to February 2004 on Hatia Island in Bangladesh with the aim of identifying the factors that limit the health and production of Jinding ducks. Overall duck mortality was 29. 3 %, with disease (19. 7 %) being a more significant factor than predation (9. 6 %; p[*]=[*] 0. 001). Duck mortality also varied significantly among study zones (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Common diseases were duck plague (21. 1 %) and duck cholera (32. 1 %). Helminth infection was prevalent, with endemic trematode (Prosthogonimus spp., Trichobilharzia spp., Echinostoma spp.) and nematode (Cyathostoma bronchialis, Amidostomum anseris, Heterakis gallinarum, Capillaria spp., and Echinuria spp.) infections and epidemic cestode infections due to Hymenolepsis setigera. The median egg production rate per duck per household was 93 for a 6 -month laying period. The odds of diminished egg production (average[*]≤[*] 93 eggs per duck per household for a 6 -month laying period) was 25. 4 times higher in ducks that were kept in traditional <b>duck</b> <b>houses</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 14. 2 times higher in ducks that experienced delays in the onset of sexual maturity (days 191 and 280; p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Ducks that were provided snails for a shorter period of time over the laying period were 18. 2 times more likely to produce fewer eggs than their longer fed peers (p[*] =[*] 0. 002). In conclusion, duck mortalities due to diseases and predation and parasitic infections appear to be common constraints on household duck production on Hatia Island. Additionally, improving <b>duck</b> <b>housing</b> and providing longer nutritional supplementation with snails increased the production capabilities of household-raised Jinding ducks on Hatia Island...|$|R
