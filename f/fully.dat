5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be <b>fully</b> united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first <b>fully</b> united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become <b>fully</b> human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become <b>fully</b> divine.|$|E

5|$|For a <b>fully</b> {{secret trust}} to be valid, therefore, {{it must be}} proved that there was intention, that this was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee {{accepted}} his obligations. Intention {{is one of the}} three certainties, and applies to <b>fully</b> secret trusts {{in the same way as}} it does to other express trusts.|$|E

5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a <b>fully</b> secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage <b>fully</b> secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a <b>fully</b> secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if <b>fully</b> secret trusts are.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{baseband}} pass range {{used was}} 200Hz to 2500Hz but later the International Telecommunication Union {{set a standard}} of 300Hz to 3.4kHz with 4kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from <b>fully</b> pass to <b>fully</b> stop {{in the space of}} 900Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|E

5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be <b>fully</b> fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are <b>fully</b> genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also <b>fully</b> inter-fertile.|$|E

5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both <b>fully</b> human and <b>fully</b> God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both <b>fully</b> divine and <b>fully</b> human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E

5|$|On 11 June 1928 the {{suburban}} line Potsdam-Stadtbahn-Erkner was <b>fully</b> equipped with DC third rail gear. Five trains {{of the new}} DRG Class ET 165 – the type appropriately named Stadtbahn – went into service, still sharing the track with steam trains. By November 1928 all lines leading toward the Stadtbahn, namely the lines from Kaulsdorf, Spandau and Grünau {{as well as the}} Berlin Ringbahn, were <b>fully</b> electrified. Therefore, suburban services to Spandau could be moved from the long-distance tracks to the local tracks. The last steam trains disappeared in 1929 when the ring became <b>fully</b> operated by electric trains. Half-ring trains operated only as peak time services.|$|E
5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to <b>fully</b> carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered <b>fully</b> carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E

5|$|Plasma and ionised gases have unique {{properties}} and display behaviors unlike {{those of the}} other states, and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature and subject to interpretation. Based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density, partially ionised or <b>fully</b> ionised forms of plasma may be produced. Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of <b>fully</b> ionised plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|E
