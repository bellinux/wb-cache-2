40|$|AbstractNumerical {{growth of}} global population, technical-scientific and socio-economical {{evolution}} determinate {{the increase of}} food need and diversification. In these conditions, beekeeping acquires an increasingly important role as food providers, {{but also as a}} vehicle to boost production by pollinating <b>entomophilies</b> cultures. Thus, the aim of present work is to highlight the influence of the use of energo-proteic supplements eco certificated represented by honey with added 10 % rape pollen, sunflower, linden and trees upon some physical-chemical parameters of acacia, linden and rape honey. The analyzes performed show that water in honey samples was within the recommended range for a high quality honey. Whatever the energo-protein supplement used hydroxymethylfurfural content presented to all the variants analyzed values below 1 mg/ 100 g of honey. Colorimetric index value of honey was framed in recommended high quality standards, the results obtained were below the maximum limits for each type of honey, and the protein supplements administrated to bee families had no influence. Regarding the content of glucose and fructose in honey samples, acacia honey had the highest amount of fructose compared to linden honey or rape honey, and the ratio of fructose and glucose ranged between 1. 34 - 1. 43. It can be concluded that the physical-chemical parameters analyzed in all three varieties of honey were located within the limits recommended by the European Commission and Codex Alimentarius, whatever the energo-proteic supplement used...|$|R
2500|$|Ornithophily or bird {{pollination}} is the pollination {{of flowering}} plants by birds. This coevolutionary association {{is derived from}} insect pollination (<b>entomophily)</b> and is particularly well developed {{in some parts of}} the world, especially in the tropics and on some island chains. The association involves several distinctive plant adaptations forming a [...] "pollination syndrome". The plants typically have colourful, often red, flowers with long tubular structures holding ample nectar and orientations of the stamen and stigma that ensure contact with the pollinator. Birds involved in ornithophily tend to be specialist nectarivores with brushy tongues, long bills, capable of hovering flight or are light enough to perch on the flower structures.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Entomophily</b> or insect {{pollination}} {{is a form}} of pollination whereby pollen of plants, especially but not only of [...] flowering plants, is distributed by insects. Flowers pollinated by insects typically advertise themselves with bright colours, sometimes with conspicuous patterns (honey guides) leading to rewards of pollen and nectar; they may also have an attractive scent which in some cases mimics insect pheromones. Insect pollinators such as bees have adaptations for their role, such as lapping or sucking mouthparts to take in nectar, and in some species also pollen baskets on their hind legs. This required the coevolution of insects and flowering plants in the development of pollination behaviour by the insects and pollination mechanisms by the flowers, benefiting both groups.|$|E

50|$|Brassia {{has a very}} {{specific}} method for pollination : it uses <b>entomophily</b> : pollination by insects {{and in this case}} specifically by female spider-hunter wasps of the genera Pepsis and Campsomeris. Mistaken by the mimicry of Brassia, the wasp stings the lip, while trying to grasp its prey without any success. By these movements the wasp comes into contact with the pollinarium, that then sticks to its head. By flying to another Brassia flower, this flower gets pollinated.|$|E

50|$|Flowering plants usually face {{selective}} {{pressure to}} optimize the transfer of their pollen, and this is typically reflected in the morphology of the flowers and the behaviour of the plants. Pollen may be transferred between plants via a number of 'vectors'. Some plants make use of abiotic vectors — namely wind (anemophily) or, much less commonly, water (hydrophily). Others use biotic vectors including insects (<b>entomophily),</b> birds (ornithophily), bats (chiropterophily) or other animals. Some plants make use of multiple vectors, but many are highly specialised.|$|E
50|$|Most {{species of}} Lepidoptera engage {{in some form}} of <b>entomophily</b> (more {{specifically}} psychophily and phalaenophily for butterflies and moths, respectively), or the pollination of flowers. Most adult butterflies and moths feed on the nectar inside flowers, using their probosces to reach the nectar hidden {{at the base of the}} petals. In the process, the adults brush against the flowers' stamens, on which the reproductive pollen is made and stored. The pollen is transferred on appendages on the adults, which fly to the next flower to feed and unwittingly deposit the pollen on the stigma of the next flower, where the pollen germinates and fertilizes the seeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{consists of}} nodding spikelike racemes with numerous drooping flowers. The flowers are bright blue-violet (rarely white), 2 to 4 cm long, with short petioles standing {{to one side}} in the axils of the bracts. The bracts are quite different and smaller than the leaves. The sepals are lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, entire, wide at the base up to 2.5 mm. The corolla is bell-shaped, with five deep lobes slightly ciliate. The flowering period extends from June through September. The flowers are pollinated by insects (bees, flies, butterflies, etc.) (<b>entomophily).</b> The fruit is a capsule with five pores near the base, where the seeds are spread.|$|E

5000|$|This plant plays host to {{a variety}} of insects and butterflies. It is the host plant for Hawaii's {{non-migratory}} monarch butterflies. [...] Calotropis is an example of <b>entomophily</b> pollination (pollination by insects) and pollination is achieved with the help of bees. In Calotropis, gynostegium is present (formed by the fusion of stigma and androecium). The pollen are in a structure named pollinia which is attached to a glandular, adhesive disc at the stigmatic angle (translator mechanism). These sticky discs get attached to the legs of visiting bees that pull out pollinia when a bee moves away. When such a bee visits another flower, this flower might be pollinated by the pollinium.|$|E

50|$|The twining stems bear {{plenty of}} fragrant, chalice-shaped {{bisexual}} flowers, of about 2 cm of diameter,with five white, creamish, violet or pale pink petals. The flowers are usually pollinated by moths (hence the common {{name of the}} plant), butterflies and bees (<b>entomophily),</b> but {{they are capable of}} automatic self-pollination. The structure of the flower includes a number of wedge-shaped openings which occasionally and inadvertently trap the pollinator's proboscis, leading to its death. The flowering period extends from July through September in the northern hemisphere and from November through February in the southern hemisphere. The pear-shaped fruits are large pods of about 8 - 10 cm of length. They contain numerous black seeds attached to silky hairs which enable them to be dispersed by the wind.|$|E
5000|$|The {{biological}} form of Geranium sanguineum is hemicryptophyte, as its overwintering buds {{are situated}} {{just below the}} soil surface and the floral axis {{is more or less}} erect with a few leaves. It has a thick rhizome. The stems are prostrate to ascending, well developed, very branched and hairy. This plant reaches on average 30 - 50 cm in height. The petiolate leaves have five lobes (or segments), each segment is tripartite in large teeth. The flowers have a diameter of 2.5 to 4 cm. and are purple The flowering period extends from May through October. The flowers are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects (<b>entomophily).</b> The most common flower visitors are Syrphidae and Hymenoptera, but also butterflies and Coleoptera. The fruit is a schizocarp that breaks up into five mericarps when ripe.|$|E
5000|$|Arisarum vulgare reaches {{on average}} 10 - 30 cm of height. The leaves of this {{geophyte}} plant are basal only, wide, ovate to arrow-shaped, with a petiole 12 - 15 cm long. The stems are erect and unbranched, usually mottled and grow {{directly from the}} underground rhizome. A single leaflike bract (spathe) forms a purplish-brown or olive green striped tube about 5 inches long, with an open upper part helmet or hood-shaped curved forward. It encloses a fleshy greenish clublike spike (spadix) bent forward, protruding from the tube and bearing at the bottom minute purple violet flowers. The 20 male flowers are located above the four to six female, with sterile flowers completely missing. The flowering period extends from October through May. The sexes are united in the same individual plant. Pollination is granted by insects (<b>entomophily).</b> The fruits are greenish berries of about 1 cmlong.|$|E
5000|$|The basal {{leaves are}} green, cordate, {{more or less}} {{elongated}} and pointed and always with rounded and often sharply defined white or pale green patches. The upper surface of the leaves has tiny bumps and it is quite hairy. The leaves of this host plant are eaten by the caterpillars of the moth Ethmia pusiella. In spring, the plant produces small bunches of flowers. The 5-petals flowers are red or pink at first, later turn to blue-purple during the anthesis, by changing the pH value inside of the petals. As {{a matter of fact}} the flowers contain a dye that belongs to the anthocyanins and change the color from red (acidic) to blue (alkaline). Pulmonaria officinalis is diploid and has the chromosome number 2n = 14. Flowering period extends from March through May and the seeds ripen from May to June. Pollination is granted by insects (<b>entomophily)</b> - mainly bees, bumblebees and butterflies - the spread of seeds over ants.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} is 5 - 25 cm {{long and}} it is composed of flowers gathered in dense cylindrical spikes (up to 50 flowers per spike). These inflorescences are scented and genes underlying eugenol (a volatile scent compound) production {{have been identified in}} Gymnadenia conopsea, Gymnadenia odoratissima and Gymnadenia densiflora [...] The flowers are petiolated, placed in the axils of long bracts and reach on average 8 - 14 cm. They have a distinctive three lobed lip and long spurs. Their light scent is similar to cloves. Their colors vary from white and pink to pink-purple, more rarely white. These flowers bloom in the Summer, from June to July. They are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects (<b>entomophily),</b> including moths. The species is almost exclusively pollinated by moths (Lepidoptera). The most common pollinators are the small elephant hawk-moth (Deilephila porcellus), hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum), silver Y (Autographa gamma), burnished brass (Diachrysia chrysitis) and large yellow underwing (Noctua pronuba). Fruit set is high with an average of 73%. The seeds germination is conditioned by the presence of specific fungi.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{dioecious}} genera (Aulax, Dilobeia, Heliciopsis and Leucadendron), 11 andromonoecious genera {{and some other}} genera have species that are cryptically andromonoecious: two species are sterile and only reproduce vegetatively (Lomatia tasmanica, Hakea pulvinifera). The species vary between being autocompatible and autoincompatible, with intermediate situations; these situations sometimes occur in the same species. The flowers are usually protandrous. Just before anthesis, the anthers release their pollen, depositing it onto the stigma, which in many cases has an enlarged fleshy area specifically for the deposition of its own pollen. Nectar-feeders are unlikely to {{come into contact with}} the anthers themselves, but can hardly avoid contacting the stigma; thus, the stigma functions as a pollen-presenter, ensuring the nectar-feeders act as pollinators. The downside of this pollination strategy is that the probability of self-fertilisation is greatly increased; many Proteaceae counter this with strategies such as protandry, self-incompatibility, or preferential abortion of selfed seed. The systems for presenting pollen are usually highly diverse, corresponding to the diversification of the pollinators. Pollination is carried out by bees, beetles, flies, moths, birds (honeyeaters, sunbirds, sugarbirds and hummingbirds) and mammals (rodents, small marsupials, elephant shrews and bats. The latter two means were evolutionarily derived from <b>entomophily</b> in different, independent events. The dispersion of some species exhibit the curious phenomenon of serotiny, which is associated with their pyrophytic behaviour: these trees accumulate fruits on their branches whose outer layers or protective structures (bracts) are highly lignified and resistant to fire. The fruit only release their seeds when they have been burnt and when the ground has been fertilized with ashes from the fire and is free from competitors. Many species have seeds with elaiosomes that are dispersed by ants; the seeds with wings or thistledown exhibit anemochory, while the drupes and other fleshy fruit exhibit endozoochory as mammals and birds ingest them. Some African and Australian rodents are known to accumulate fruit and seeds of these plants in their nests in order to feed on them, although some manage to germinate.|$|E
