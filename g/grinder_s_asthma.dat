The occurrence of ILC 2 s is more frequent {{in the blood of}} subjects with allergic asthma than in healthy individuals and allergic donors. When stimulated with IL- 25 or IL- 33, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with allergic asthma produced significantly greater amounts of IL- 5 and IL- 13 than those from patients with allergic rhinitis and those from healthy donors (Bartemes et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2016). Recently, ILC 2 s were found in the bronchoalvoelar lavage (BAL) and sputum of patients with asthma, and the proportion of IL- 5 +IL- 13 + ILC 2 s in the sputum of patients with severe asthma was higher than that in corresponding samples from patients with mild asthma (Smith et al., 2016). ILC 2 levels are also increased in the sputum from severe asthmatic children (Nagakumar et al., 2016).

40|$|It {{is almost}} 50 {{years since the}} first UK studies {{identified}} potentially preventable factors {{in the majority of}} asthma deaths. 1 Those first reports {{led to the development of}} national asthma guidelines, intended to radically improve management. Since the 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>asthma</b> care in the UK has shifted from secondary to primary care, 2 linked to enhanced asthma nurse training and involvement. With the development of new doctor–patient partnerships in the form of personalised self-management plans and newer drugs with innovative delivery systems, improving asthma care in the future seemed a certainty. And yet, from 1992, the only ongoing inquiry into asthma death in the East of England fuelled background concern that prevent-able death was still a major issue. 3 That concern was highlighted by the National Atlas of Variation in Healthcare for Respiratory Disease, 4 published in September 2012, which showed great variation in almost every facet of asthma care delivery across the UK. The National Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD) was a confidential enquiry that investigated in detail 900 deaths of people of all ages who had died in 2012 with an ICD- 10 code J 459, where the underlying cause of death was classified as asthma.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{caregivers}} with asthma and caregivers without asthma in relation to their knowledge of asthma medication, asthma triggers, and preventative care utilization. A total of 35 caregivers were analyzed. The target population consisted of mostly Hispanic caregivers residing in Fresno and Madera Counties. Data were analyzed by utilizing the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS). A total of five hypotheses were tested using Chi-Squared Fisher s Exact test to compare caregivers with asthma and caregivers without asthma in relationship to (a) taking their children to a primary care physician, (b) taking their children to an asthma educator, (c) identifying asthma triggers in the home setting, (d) knowing how often their children should use a rescue inhaler, and (e) knowing how often their children should use a controller medicine. The study suggested there were no statistical differences between caregivers with asthma and caregivers without asthma in regard to taking their children to visit a primary care physician, asthma educator, or knowing how often their children should use a rescue inhaler. However, caregivers with asthma were more likely to identify triggers in their homes that made their children <b>s</b> <b>asthma</b> worse and more likely to know when and how often their children should use their controller medication...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of asthma is usually estimated {{on the basis}} of the results of questionnaires. A comparison with prevalence according to medical records has not been reported before. Adherence to medical advice and prescriptions are generally poor in chronic diseases like asthma. There is a lack of intervention studies to improve adherence. Aims: 1 : To perform an epidemiological analysis of the asthma prevalence and the use of the healthcare system in a Swedish region. 2 : To compare the parental assessment of children <b>s</b> <b>asthma</b> according to a questionnaire with physicians diagnosed asthma. 3 : To perform an intervention with additional information and support to parents of preschool children with newly diagnosed asthma in order to improve adherence. 4 : To evaluate the effects on quality of life and separately analyze the answers of the mothers and the fathers. 5 : To analyze any remaining intervention effects after 6 years. Methods: Firstly, all outpatient clinics had computerised patient records and thus these visits could be studied as well as admissions to hospital for asthma. In 1999 a questionnaire was answered by 75 % of the parents of 6 295 children 1 - 6 years of age. Secondly, a controlled, prospective intervention study where the parents of 60 children were randomised to either a control group (CG) or to an intervention group (IG) which had group meetings in close connection to the diagnosis. Outcome was measured by questionnaires and by classification of the children according to clinical examination, blood tests, symptoms and medication. Adherence rate was calculated with the help of diaries and weighing the inhalers used. Fathers and mothers answered separately the Paediatric Caregiver s Quality of Life Questionnaire. Children were followed up after 6 years and objective measurements of lung function were added to the other parameters. Results: The burden of asthma was mainly handled by the outpatient clinics. According to the parental questionnaire 5. 9 % had asthma in 1999, according to the medical records 4. 9 %. With register diagnosis as gold standard the sensitivity of the questionnaire was 77 %. The questionnaire identified half of the children with a medical record of asthma. Forty percent of the children claimed by their parents to be asthmatic had no medical record of asthma. One third of the children with newly diagnosed asthma had risk of developing persistent asthma. The intervention resulted in an improvement of the parents view on adherence issues and on adherence per se. The children in the IG had less exacerbation days despite having lower inhaled steroid doses. There were no major gender differences in indices of quality of life, but according to individual questions mothers were more affected by their children <b>s</b> <b>asthma.</b> After 6 months the mothers in the IG showed improvements in all indices. At the 6 year follow-up 71 % still had asthma. The IG had fewer contacts with nurses than the CG and they had lower inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses. The IG parents still had a more positive view on adherence questions and their quality of life was better. The children who were older than 2 years of age at inclusion had a higher risk of developing persistent asthma. Intermittent ICS was used by 81 %. The lung function was preserved. The burden on the health care system was low. Hospital admittances due to asthma in the region are the lowest in the country. Conclusions: A parentally completed questionnaire provided an acceptable estimation of the {{prevalence of}} asthma in children 2 - 6 years of age compared to asthma registered in medical records although in half of the cases the individual child was not identified. Straightforward and timely information to parents of children with asthma has long-term positive effects which can be mediated through equalization of the parent s roles in handling their child <b>s</b> <b>asthma.</b> The hospital admissions due to asthma are very few, possibly as a result of the intervention and improved medical care in the paediatric outpatient clinics. Asthma diagnosed before age 2 has a better prognosis. Most children with a high risk of persistent asthma can be successfully treated with intermittent ICS...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{everyday}} {{management of}} a child with asthma can affect the parent 2 ̆ 7 s quality of life. Past studies which examined the effects of asthma characteristics of the child on parental quality of life have not reached a consensus over findings. Few studies examine parent characteristics such as mental health and sociodemographics on {{the quality of life of}} parents of asthmatic children. Purpose. To examine the effect of asthma severity of school-children and sociodemographic characteristics onthe caregiver 2 ̆ 7 s quality of life. It also investigates whether agreement exists between the caregiver 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> perception of <b>asthma</b> severity and physician-diagnosed asthma severity. Methodology. Parents of asthmatic children (n= 101) were identified in the waiting room at an outpatient pediatric pulmonology clinic in Las Vegas and were given three questionnaires: (1) the Paediatric Caregiver 2 ̆ 7 sQuality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ), (2) asthma severity questionnaire, (3) sociodemographics questionnaire. Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s correlation (rho), analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear and multivariate regression, Chi-square, independent t-tests, Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient, and descriptive analyses were performed. Results. A significant negative correlation was found between overall asthma severity, based on the 2007 NAEPP guidelines, and mean activity limitation scores (rho=. 400, p 3 ̆c. 001), mean emotional function scores (rho= -. 258, p 3 ̆c. 001), and mean total of PACQLQ scores (rho= -. 342, p 3 ̆c. 001). A significant moderate, negative correlation was found between PACQLQ scores and asthma day symptoms, asthma night symptoms, and asthma exercise symptoms. No significant relationship was found between pulmonary function testing (PFT) scores and PACQLQ scores. Parents of children with mild intermittent asthma had higher mean PACQLQ scores, followed by those with mild persistent asthma, moderate persistent asthma, and lastly, severe persistent asthma who had the lowest PACQLQ scores. Predictors of better quality of life included increased income. Predictors of worse overall quality of life included increased hospitalization days, increased ER visits, increased school days missed, and increased work days missed. Using independent t-tests, better scores were found for those who were not of Black or African ethnicity, were able to pay for health costs, owned a home or a car, and perceived their child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>asthma</b> as under control.

Of the 42 families completing the study, 21 received the additional problem solving instruction and 21 received only the routinely provided asthma education. Outcome measures included the families 2 ̆ 7 record of the child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>asthma</b> symptoms for 4 one-month periods following the instruction, Health Locus of Control scores and self-efficacy measures obtained pre-instruction and four months post-instruction for the participating parent, as well as the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Health Locus of Control measure for children age 7 years and above. ^ Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance revealed no difference between groups in symptom control, but symptoms decreased significantly over time (p =. 002) with fewer symptoms reported at four months than at one month. The problem solving instruction had no significant effect on Health Locus of Control for parents or children nor upon self-efficacy ratings by parents. A 2 × 2 fixed analysis of variance (group by locus of control) of asthma symptoms revealed a significant interaction, p =. 004. The experimental group children whose parents had an 2 ̆ 2 external 2 ̆ 2 locus of control had a significantly greater decrease in symptoms than either experimental children with 2 ̆ 2 internal 2 ̆ 2 parents or control group children with 2 ̆ 2 external 2 ̆ 2 parents. ^ The problem solving instruction, sampling technique, and data collection procedures are examined with suggestions for modification and recommendations for further study. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of NAD-dependent deacetylase activity of the silent information regulator- 2 (SIR 2) family (‘sirtuins’), many exciting connections between protein deacetylation and energy metabolism have been revealed. The importance of sirtuins in the regulation of many fundamental biological responses to various nutritional and environmental stimuli has been firmly established. Sirtuins have also emerged as critical regulators for aging and longevity in model organisms. Their absolute requirement of NAD has revived an enthusiasm {{in the study of}} mammalian biosynthesis of NAD. Sirtuin-targeted pharmaceutical and nutriceutical interventions against age-associated diseases are also on the horizon. This review summarizes the recent progress in sirtuin research (particularly in mammalian sirtuin biology) and re-evaluates the connection between sirtuins, metabolism, and age-associated diseases (e. g., type- 2 diabetes) to set a basis for the next ten years of sirtuin research.

Hirst Airway smooth muscle cell culture: application to studies of airway wall remodelling and phenotype plasticity in <b>asthma.</b> <b>S.</b> J. Hirst. ©ERS Journals Ltd 1996. ABSTRACT: Chronic persistent asthma {{is characterized by}} poorly reversible airway obstruction. Histopathological studies of airways removed postmortem from patients with severe asthma reveal marked inflammatory and architectural changes associated with airway wall thickening. Increased airway smooth muscle content, occurring {{as a result of}} hyperplastic and/or hypertrophic growth, is believed {{to be one of the}} principal contributors to airway wall thickening. Intense interest is building to discover the mechanisms responsible for these long-term structural changes. In vitro cell culture offers a powerful and exacting approach to cellular and molecular studies of the long-term regulation of airway smooth muscle function. This review discusses the methodologies for establishing and maintaining cell cultures of airway smooth muscle. It also describes the characteristics of these cells in culture and addresses the potential importance of phenotype plasticity and its possible relationship to altered smooth muscle function in vivo. Drawing on parallels from vascular studies, this review focuses, in particular, on the synthetic nature of the airway smooth muscle cell, emphasizing its potential to alter the composition of the extracellular matrix environment and orchestrate key events in the process of chronic airway remodelling...|$|R

This review provides a perspective {{on the role of}} the NP in implementing the revised National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines put forth by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, thereby helping patients achieve and maintain asthma control. A literature search of PubMed was performed using the terms asthma, nurse practitioner, asthma control, burden, impact, morbidity, mortality, productivity, quality of life, uncontrolled asthma, NAEPP guidelines, assessment, pharmacotherapy, safety. Despite the increased morbidity and mortality and impaired quality of life attributable to uncontrolled asthma, the 2007 NAEPP asthma guidelines are greatly underused. NPs have an opportunity to identify patients at risk and provide enhanced care and education for asthma control. Often, NPs can prescribe medication for and manage these patients, but it is necessary to be able to discern which patients require referral to a specialist.

40|$|AbstractGroup 2 innate {{lymphoid cells}} (ILC 2 s) are {{recently}} identified cell populations that produce type 2 cytokines such as IL- 5 and IL- 13 {{in response to}} epithelial cell-derived cytokines. Although ILC 2 s were initially reported to {{play a key role}} in the anti-helminth innate immunity, we now have greater interest in their role in asthma and other allergic diseases. In various asthma mouse models, ILC 2 s provoke eosinophilic inflammation accompanied by airway hyperresponsiveness independent of acquired immunity. Moreover, recent mouse studies show that ILC 2 s also promote acquired immunity and Th 2 polarization, and various cytokines and lipid mediators influence the functions of ILC 2 s. Although ILC 2 s have also been identified in humans, studies on the role of human ILC 2 <b>s</b> in <b>asthma</b> are very limited. Thus far, human studies have shown that there is a slight difference in responsiveness and production of cytokines between mouse and human ILC 2 s, and it has been suggested that ILC 2 s are involved in allergic-type asthma and the exacerbation of asthma. In this review, we focus on mouse and human ILC 2 s, and discuss their role in asthma...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{comprehensive}} guidelines {{established by}} the European Global Initiative for Asthma and the U. <b>S.</b> National <b>Asthma</b> Education and Prevention Program on the diagnosis and management of asthma, its mortality in older adults continues to rise. Diagnostic and therapeutic problems contribute to older patients being inadequately treated. The diagnosis of asthma rests on the history and characteristic pulmonary function testing (PFT) with the demonstration of reversible airway obstruction, but there are unique problems in performing this test in older patients and in its interpretation. This review aims to address the difficulties in performing and interpreting PFT in older patients because {{of the effects of}} age-related changes in lung function on respiratory physiology. The concept of "airway remodeling" resulting in "fixed obstructive" PFT and the relevance of atopy in older people with asthma are assessed. There are certain therapeutic issues unique to older patients with asthma, including the increased probability of adverse effects in the setting of multiple comorbidities and issues surrounding effective drug delivery. The use of beta 2 -agonist, anticholinergic, corticosteroid, and anti-immunoglobulin E treatments are discussed in the context of these therapeutic issues...|$|R
