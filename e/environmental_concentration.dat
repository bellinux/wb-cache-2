40|$|This review {{assesses the}} effects of <b>environmental</b> <b>{{concentrations}}</b> of bisphenol-A (BPA) on wildlife. Water concentrations of BPA vary tremendously due to proximity to point and non-point sources, but reported concentrations in stream/river water samples are less than 21 �g/L, and concentrations in landfill leacheate are less than 17. 2 mg/L. Extensive evidence indicates that BPA induces feminization during gonadal ontogeny of fishes, reptiles, and birds, but in all cases the amount of BPA necessary to cause such ontogenetic disruption exceeds concentrations in the environment. Extensive evidence also exists that adult exposure to <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> of BPA is detrimental to spermatogenetic endpoints and stimulates vitellogenin synthesis in model species of fish. Most of the reported effects of BPA on vertebrate wildlife species {{can be attributed to}} BPA acting as an estrogen receptor agonist, but mechanisms of disruption in invertebrates are less certain. A comparison of measured BPA <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> with chronic values suggests that no significant margin of safety exists for the protection of aquatic communities against the toxicity of BPA. Further studies should examine the most vulnerable vertebrate and invertebrate species...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{bacteria}} {{of clinical}} importance survive and may grow in different environments. Antibiotic pollution may exert on them a selective pressure {{leading to an}} increase in the prevalence of resistance. Objectives: In this study we sought to determine whether <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> of antibiotics and concentrations representing action limits used in environmental risk assessment may exert a selective pressure on clinically relevant bacteria in the environment. Methods: We used bacterial inhibition as an assessment end point to link antibiotic selective pressures to the prevalence of resistance in bacterial populations. Species sensitivity distributions were derived for three antibiotics by fitting log-logistic models to end points calculated from minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions based on worldwide data collated by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). To place bacteria represented in these distributions in a broader context, we performed a brief phylogenetic analysis. The potentially affected fraction of bacterial genera at measured <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> of antibiotics and environmental risk assessment action limits was used as a proxy for antibiotic selective pressure. Measured <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> and <b>environmental</b> risk assessment action limits were also directly compared to wild-type cut-off values. Results: The potentially affected fraction of bacterial genera estimated based on antibiotic concentrations measured in water environments is ≤ 7 %. We estimated that measured <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> in river sediments, swine feces lagoons, liquid manure, and farmed soil inhibit wild-type populations in up to 60 %, 92 %, 100 %, and 30 % of bacterial genera, respectively. At concentrations used as action limits in environmental risk assessment, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin were estimated to inhibit wild-type populations in up to 25 % and 76 % of bacterial genera. Conclusions: Measured <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> of antibiotics, as well as <b>concentrations</b> representing <b>environmental</b> risk assessment action limits, are high enough to exert a selective pressure on clinically relevant bacteria that may lead {{to an increase in}} the prevalence of resistance...|$|R
5000|$|The EPA {{determined}} {{there is}} no substantial risk to toxic levels when considering food and water exposure. Enilconazole has a very minute degree of mobility, so its level of drinking water contamination is quite low. The estimated <b>environmental</b> <b>concentration</b> (EEC) found the levels to be 0.072 ppb for surface water and 500 ppb for drinking water.

50|$|PNEC is used {{extensively}} in Europe by the European Chemicals Agency, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals program and other toxicology agencies to assess environmental risk. PNEC values {{can be used}} in conjunction with predicted <b>environmental</b> <b>concentration</b> values to calculate a risk characterization ratio (RCR), also called a Risk Quotient (RQ). RCR is equal to the PEC divided by the PNEC for a specific chemical and is a deterministic approach to estimating environmental risk at local or regional scales. If the PNEC exceeds the PEC, the conclusion is that the chemical poses no environmental risk.|$|E
50|$|In Sweden, the {{industry}} together with universities {{and health care}} sector has developed a method for environmental risk assessment and environmental classification of drugs. Environmental risk refers {{to the risk of}} toxicity to the aquatic environment. It is based on the ratio between predicted <b>environmental</b> <b>concentration</b> of the substance (PEC) and the highest concentration of the substance that does not have a harmful effect in the environment (PNEC). Environmental hazard expresses the inherent environmentally damaging characteristics of the substance in terms of persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The toxicity tests used are acute toxicity of fish, acute toxicity of Daphnia sp. and growth inhibition test of algae. Most medications on the Swedish market are now classified. This gives the health care possibilities to make better choices when prescribing medicines.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{exposure}} and ecotoxicity data of six human pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, clofibric acid, diclofenac, ofloxacin, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole) were collected, including our own experimental data and literature data. From this data collection, the two-tiered European draft guideline {{on the environmental}} risk assessment of human pharmaceuticals was tested. Measured <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> in effluents from France and in effluents and surface waters from Germany were compared to the predicted <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> (PECs) in both countries. In a similar manner, predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) derived from acute data and PNECs derived from chronic data were estimated for each pharmaceutical and corresponding PEC/PNEC ratios then were compared in both countries. Globally, results demonstrated that all <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> (predicted or measured) for each considered pharmaceutical exceeded the 10 -ng/L cutoff value, which requires {{the implementation of the}} second-tier assessment based on ecotoxicity data. Moreover, the six pharmaceuticals showed a relatively limited acute toxicity, and carbamazepine and propranolol were inaccurately identified as having negligible risks under the current European draft procedure. Such results lead to discussion of the actual procedure on pharmaceuticals, especially on the need of appropriate ecotoxicity tests...|$|R

5000|$|The autoinducer {{molecule}} used by V. fischeri is N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-homoserine lactone. [...] This molecule {{is produced}} in the cytoplasm by the LuxI synthase enzyme and is secreted through the cell membrane into the extracellular environment. [...] As is true of most autoinducers, the <b>environmental</b> <b>concentration</b> of N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-homoserine lactone {{is the same as}} the intracellular concentration within each cell. [...] N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-homoserine lactone eventually diffuses back into cells where it is recognized by LuxR once a threshold concentration (~10 μg/ml) has been reached. [...] LuxR binds the autoinducer and directly activates transcription of the luxICDABE operon. [...] This results in an exponential increase in both the production of autoinducer and in bioluminescence. LuxR bound by autoinducer also inhibits the expression of luxR, which is thought to provide a negative feedback compensatory mechanism to tightly control levels of the bioluminescence genes.|$|E

40|$|The Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) {{was applied}} to {{investigate}} how projected climate changes will affect the atmospheric transport of 13 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to the Arctic and their environmental fate within the Arctic. Three sets of simulations were performed, one with present day emissions and initial <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> from a 20 -year spin-up simulation, one with present day emissions and with initial <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> set to zero and one without emissions but with initial <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> from the 20 -year spin-up simulation. Each set of simulations consisted of two 10 -year time slices representing the present (1990 – 2000) and future (2090 – 2100) climate conditions. DEHM was driven using meteorological input from the global circulation model, ECHAM/MPI-OM, simulating the SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) A 1 B climate scenario. Under the applied climate and emission scenarios, the total mass of all compounds was predicted {{to be up to}} 55 % lower across the Northern Hemisphere {{at the end of the}} 2090 s than in the 1990 s. The mass of HCHs within the Arctic was predicted to be up to 38 % higher, whereas the change in mass of the PCBs was predicted to range from 38 % lower to 17 % higher depending on the congener and the applied initial <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The results of this study also indicate that contaminants with no or a short emission history will be more rapidly transported to and build up in the arctic environment in a future warmer climate. The process that dominates the environmental behaviour of POPs in the Arctic under a future warmer climate scenario is the shift in mass of POPs from the surface media to the atmosphere induced by the higher mean temperature. This is to some degree counteracted by higher degradation rates also following the higher mean temperature. The more dominant of these two processes depends on the physical-chemical properties of the compounds. Previous model studies have predicted that the effect of a changed climate on the transport of POPs to the Arctic is moderate relative to the effect of proposed changes in emissions, which is confirmed in this study. However, the model studies do not agree on whether climate change acts to reduce or increase <b>environmental</b> <b>concentrations</b> of POPs in the Arctic, and further work is needed to resolve this matter...|$|R
