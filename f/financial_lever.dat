40|$|SummaryMany issues {{challenge}} France and Quebec’s health systems. These issues, similar on {{both sides}} of the Atlantic, are characterized by transitions (demographical, epidemiological and technological), which will have an impact on care and prevention practices. Factors like ageing populations, improving quality of life or the deficit projected to certain health professions characterize these issues and put the health system to the test. In this context, acting upstream of health problems and investing efforts in prevention will become even more necessary. Health care professionals are directly involved to initiate or participate in prevention actions. In the context of these two systems transforming, four types of levers or incentives benefit from being put forward: 1) the governance lever, which assures global consistency between the actions by linking the care system’s specific interventions with those developed as part of a health strategy; 2) the professional lever, that targets the recognition of skills in terms of preventionpractices and leadership; 3) the organizational lever, which promotes the development of collective skills oriented towards prevention; 4) the <b>financial</b> <b>lever,</b> which forces to explore new methods of compensation and incentives supporting prevention.

One	of	the	most	important	 factors	for	private	equity	investors	is	cash	flow	stability. 	In	theory,	cash	flows	in	shipping	are	very	 unpredictable	 due	 to	 their	 dependence	 on	 shipping	 rates,	 thus	 making	 it	 difficult	 for	 private	 equity	to	invest. 	However,	the	correct	estimation	and	timing	of	the	shipping	cycle	can	provide	 certain	stability	to	ship	owners. 	Therefore,	private	equity	 firms	have	to	rely	heavily	on	proven	 management	teams	as	they	lack	significant	sector	experience	and	hence	forecasting	ability. 	The	 asset	intensive	nature	of	 the	business	provides	some	downside	protection	 for	invested	 funds. 	 The	case	study	conducted	in	this	thesis	has	found	that	traditional	private	equity	methods	worked	 in	the	tanker	business	even	though	those	methods	are	not	very	different	from	traditional	ship	 management	practices. 	Out	of	the	three	levers	that	private	equity	usually	applies,	the	<b>financial</b>	 <b>lever,</b>	the	tax	lever	and	the	legal	lever,	none	of	those	is	exclusively	used	by	private	equity	owners	 in	 the	shipping	sector.
