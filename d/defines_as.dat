5|$|The bridge, {{as well as}} the {{remainder}} of SR225 are considered a major collector road by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which the Federal Highway Administration <b>defines</b> <b>as</b> linking towns to larger arterials. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that 9,500vehicles traveled on SR-225 along the bridge.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman {{writes about}} the book {{in the context of}} the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace <b>defines</b> <b>as</b> beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E
5|$|SR-103 {{serves the}} {{function}} of connecting the town of Clearfield, and residents along I-15 to Hill Air Force Base. The base, , was the sixth largest employer {{in the state of}} Utah and is the third largest employer which is neither the state government nor a state-funded higher education institution. SR-103 is one of four Utah state highways that connect to Hill Air Force Base, the others being SR-97, SR-168 and SR-232, Only SR-168 has a lower average daily traffic count, with roughly 1,000vehicles-per-day traveling along the highway compared to SR-103's approximately 16,000vehicles-per-day. This is a decline from previous years (in 2007 the average on SR-103 was 22,525; in 2006, the average was 22,215; in 2005, 21,275). Four percent of this traffic was composed of trucks. The measurement point for the traffic counts is at the eastern terminus of SR-103, the entrance to the Falcon Hill National Aerospace Research Park. The highway is codified as Utah Code §72-4-116, and is designated as a minor arterial, which the Federal Highway Administration <b>defines</b> <b>as</b> linking major arterials at a lower volume than a primary arterial.|$|E

25|$|The Talmud prohibits any {{activity}} which it <b>defines</b> <b>as</b> mesolelot or tribadism (women rubbing genitals together).

Talmudic law limits the penalty for lesbianism to flagellation rather than the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|As well, many of Aristotle’s {{conclusions}} directly oppose {{those of}} twentieth century narratologists such as Vladimir Propp, who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not {{of human beings}} but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”. Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he <b>defines</b> <b>as</b> functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are {{defined in terms of}} a character who has specific ethical qualities”. Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in Poetics because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.|$|E
25|$|Windows NT uses kernel-mode device {{drivers to}} {{enable it to}} {{interact}} with hardware devices. Each of the drivers has well defined system routines and internal routines that it exports {{to the rest of}} the operating system. All devices are seen by user mode code as a file object in the I/O manager, though to the I/O manager itself the devices are seen as device objects, which it <b>defines</b> <b>as</b> either file, device or driver objects. Kernel mode drivers exist in three levels: highest level drivers, intermediate drivers and low level drivers. The highest level drivers, such as file system drivers for FAT and NTFS, rely on intermediate drivers. Intermediate drivers consist of function drivers—or main driver for a device—that are optionally sandwiched between lower and higher level filter drivers. The function driver then relies on a bus driver—or a driver that services a bus controller, adapter, or bridge—which can have an optional bus filter driver that sits between itself and the function driver. Intermediate drivers rely on the lowest level drivers to function. The Windows Driver Model (WDM) exists in the intermediate layer. The lowest level drivers are either legacy Windows NT device drivers that control a device directly or can be a PnP hardware bus. These lower level drivers directly control hardware and do not rely on any other drivers.|$|E

25|$|T.D. Kendrick {{observed}} that the Book of Cerne exhibits a distinctive style from the other manuscripts from the Canterbury group and suggested that it was possibly Mercian in origin. Later, in several articles dating between 1948 and 1957 there was a debate between S.M. Kuhn and K. Sisam over the provenance of these manuscripts, including the Book of Cerne. Although the Book of Cerne has been periodically attributed with a possible Mercian origin, Kuhn postulated the direct link between this manuscript and the Bishop of Lichfield, and attributed the entire group of manuscripts to Mercia, particularly Lichfield. Sisam, on the other hand, dismissed Kuhn’s interpretation by reasserting the Canterbury/Kentish association for this group of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. However, Sisam did realize that the Book of Cerne {{was different from the}} other manuscripts of this group, and he postulated that it could be a provincial or Mercian outlier. The recent in depth studies of the Book of Cerne by Brown has included this codex within the Canterbury/Tiberius group of manuscripts that she argues were produced in Mercia, Kent, and Wessex in the 8th and 9th centuries CE, a region which she <b>defines</b> <b>as</b> a “Mercian Schriftprovinz”. Along with other manuscripts including the Barberini Gospels, Brown has placed the Book of Cerne in the Mercian school of the Tiberius group. She further concluded that this codex was the product of a scriptorium in Worcester, or perhaps Lichfield.|$|E
