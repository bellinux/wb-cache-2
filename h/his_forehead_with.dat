25|$|The second {{match was}} a tag team match between {{the team of}} Johnny Weaver and Scott McGhee, and the team of Kevin Sullivan and Mark Lewin (accompanied by Gary Hart). The match started back and forth until Sullivan and Lewin gained the {{advantage}} over McGhee by targeting his left arm. McGhee and Weaver fought back when Weaver performed a bulldog on Sullivan, sending his face into the canvas. Weaver attempted another bulldog, but Sullivan pushed him into the corner. Lewin performed a knee drop from the top turnbuckle on Weaver's left arm as Hart and Sullivan held onto him. Lewin then pinned Weaver to win the match. After the match, Lewin and Sullivan beat down McGhee and lacerated <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>with</b> a foreign object provided by Hart. Angelo Mosca attempted to help McGhee, but was also attacked.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple years}} before dying {{he was often}} heard {{remarking}} that he had grown old and this {{to some of his}} devotees was him dropping hints about his final days being imminently close. On the morning of 28 May 1968, as a part of his daily routine, he washed his face, tied his turban and smeared <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>with</b> a saffron mark (called tilak in Hinduism). All throughout the day, many people had come to visit him. Later-on in the noon, some sadhus (wandering monks) too had come to visit him. He used to give alms to these visiting sadhus (some of whom he would call as mere jugglers in ochre robes) who, on their journey to Amarnath shrine, would stop-over at his place. On this day too, he gave these sadhus whatever money he had in his cloth purse. He is then said to have gone into a state of meditative trance (called samadhi in Hinduism) till about 5:30pm when he asked for some water and was helped to drink a tumbler full of sweet water. He died at about 5:45pm and his recorded last words were Om Namah Shivaya (the mantra of Lord Shiva). On his death, Swami Nand Lal, is said to have remarked that Kashmir was being rocked by an earthquake. He is also said to have predicted Bhagwan Gopinath's death a week in advance.|$|E
2500|$|Basil's {{physical}} outbursts {{are primarily}} {{directed at the}} waiter Manuel, an emotional but largely innocent Spaniard whose confused English vocabulary causes him to make elementary mistakes. At times, Basil beats Manuel with a frying pan and smacks <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>with</b> a spoon. The violence towards Manuel caused rare negative criticism of the show. [...] Sybil, on the other hand, is always condescending toward Manuel, excusing his behaviour to guests with [...] "He's from Barcelona." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{hearing of}} his fiancée's peril, Sing Sang follows Tjonat and finds {{him in a}} cave. Although capable of ambushing the bandit, he refuses to kill in cold blood. Instead, Sing Sang attacks an armed Tjonat {{with his bare hands}} and wins, using Tjonat's own knife to cut the bandit's ears off and mark <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>with</b> a [...] "T" [...] before {{ordering}} him to return Gouw Nio. Tjonat, however, does not obey, instead stabbing Gouw Nio in the chest and throwing her in a nearby river. At that moment Tjonat is arrested by arriving police and villagers, while Sing Sang rescues Gouw Nio from the current.|$|E
2500|$|Ramana himself {{considered}} God, Guru and Self {{to be the}} {{manifestations of}} the same reality. Ramana considered the Self to be his guru, {{in the form of}} the sacred mountain Arunachala, which is considered to be the manifestation of Shiva. Arunachala is one of the five main shaivite holy places in South India, which can be worshipped through the mantra [...] "Om arunachala shivaya namah!" [...] and by Pradakshina, walking around the mountain, a practice which was often performed by Ramana. Asked about the special sanctity of Arunachala, Ramana said that Arunachala is Shiva himself. In his later years, Ramana said it was the spiritual power of Arunachala which had brought about his Self-realisation. He composed the Five Hymns to Arunachala as devotional song. On the three occasions Venkataraman (Ramana) referred to himself he used the name Arunachala Ramana. Ramana Maharshi also used to smear <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>with</b> holy ash, as a token of veneration.|$|E
2500|$|... {{posted a}} lifted still from a video {{to the social}} {{networking}} website Facebook showing the school's chancellor, Pat Robertson, [...] scratching <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>with</b> his middle finger. The still gave the appearance that Robertson was making an obscene gesture. Key also criticized Robertson for urging the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. School officials asked Key to remove the still, publicly apologize and withhold public comment or, alternatively, defend the posting. While Key did remove the photograph, he refused to apologize and submitted his defense on the grounds it was protected speech. Regent rejected his argument and Key was subsequently suspended and later removed. In November 2007, Key {{filed a lawsuit against}} Regent claiming fraud, violation of his right to free expression as governed by rules tied to federal funding, and defamation. Robertson said that, in general, freedom of speech does not encompass the use of these kinds of images. The university stated that Key violated the school's standards of conduct. However, Key's attorney countered with examples of racist images posted on Facebook by other Regent students about which the school took no action.|$|E
