5000|$|Prime Minister Lukšić, {{then the}} {{youngest}} {{prime minister in}} the world, faced a double challenge: modernizing society and implementing reforms, while maintaining the political stability {{of the country and}} respecting traditions set by previous governments at the same time. As a result, regardless of his statements that his decisions were independent of the former President and Prime Minister of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, many still regarded the latter as a figurehead, and argued that the country was still being run from behind the scenes by Milo Djukanovic. Lukšić responded to the question from Reuters news agency, in his first interview to the foreign media after his confirmation as Prime Minister, saying, [...] "I am in charge. I will always, when I find it necessary, consult with many people ... But I would not accept doing this job if I had to bear all the responsibility and if the decisions were made somewhere else." [...] Lukšić's political credo was to govern by clear, precise and applicable rules, with the objective of leaving less room for discretionary decision making and corruption. While he said, [...] "Montenegrin society has relied throughout its entire history on strong personalities", his main aim was to create trust in political institutions instead. One of his top priorities was to achieve Montenegro's membership of the European Union as soon as possible. To speed up this process he demanded changes in values in society, and more individual initiatives than state interference. In his inaugural speech, he stated, [...] "The Government cannot and should not be the solution to all of society's problems and shortcomings; it should be accountable and efficient in carrying out its constitutional and statutory obligations. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> everyone to be accountable for his part in the task, so that we all individually and jointly contribute to Montenegro’s overall development." ...|$|E

40|$|Objections to Searle's {{argument}} for the Connection Principle and its consequences (Searle 1990 a) fall roughly into three categories: (1) those that focus on problems with the {{argument for}} the Connection Principle; (2) those that focus on problems in understanding the conclusion of this argument; (3) those that focus on whether the conclusion has the consequences Searle claims for it. I think the Connection Principle is both true and important, but I {{do not think that}} Searle's argument establishes it. The problem with the argument is that it either begs the question or proves too much. It will be helpful to begin by laying out some criteria of adequacy for the success of Searle's argument. I take Searle's {{argument for the}} Connection Principle to be an a priori argument, based on a claim about our concept of an Intentional mental state. If it is an a priori argument, then its premises must be knowable a priori, and it must be deductively valid. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> in addition that it meet the following criteria of adequacy: (A 1) No premise should presuppose the conclusion; (A 2) No premise should be in conflict with other assumptions Searle makes about the relation of mental to physical states.

40|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, European {{philosophical}} theologians concerned about the perceived threat of secularity {{played a crucial role}} in the construction of the category of ‘religion,’ conceived as a transcultural universal, the genus of which the so-called ‘world religions’ are species. By reading the work of the late John Hick (1922 – 2012), the most influential contemporary philosophical advocate of religious pluralism, through an historically informed hermeneutic of suspicion, this paper argues that orientalist-derived understandings of religion continue to play a significant (though often unacknowledged) role within the philosophy of religion today. Though couched in the language of pluralism, Hick’s later work in the philosophy of religion functions apologetically to maintain a version of the religious–secular distinction that, while theologically and politically loaded, is, I show, philosophically arbitrary. Moving the philosophy of religion beyond Eurocentrism, <b>I</b> argue, <b>will</b> <b>require</b> freeing it from the logic of the modern understanding of religion...|$|R

40|$|The human suppressive T {{cells that}} stably express {{transcription}} factor FOXP 3, or regulatory T cells (Tregs), {{are thought to}} suppress antitumor immune responses. The most specific marker for human Tregs is the demethylation of CpG dinucleotides located in the first intron of FOXP 3 (FOXP 3 i 1). FOXP 3 i 1 is completely methylated in other hematopoietic cells, including nonsuppressive T cells that transiently express FOXP 3 after activation. Previously, we and others reported estimations of the frequency of Tregs {{in the blood of}} melanoma patients using a FOXP 3 i 1 methylation-specific qPCR assay. Here, we attempted to quantify Tregs inside tumor samples using this assay. However, we found demethylated FOXP 3 i 1 sequences in the melanoma cells themselves. This demethylation was not associated with substantial FOXP 3 mRNA or protein expression, even though the demethylation extended to the promoter and terminal regions of the gene in some melanoma cells.
