5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also <b>jammed</b> <b>the</b> {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had}} been uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|During {{a tumultuous}} pioneer period {{characterized}} by its centrality in {{proximity to the}} Western United States, transportation in Omaha demanded the construction of massive warehouses where frontier settlers could stock up and communities west of Omaha got food and supplies to build themselves with.

Early Omaha also landed the Union Pacific Railroad headquarters, leading to its important place in national railroad lore.|$|E

5|$|On 8 May 1975, while {{practicing}} a 9-g aerial display maneuver {{with the}} second YF-16 (tail number 72-1568) at Fort Worth, Texas, prior to {{being sent to the}} Paris Air Show, one of the main landing gear <b>jammed.</b> <b>The</b> test pilot, Neil Anderson, had to perform an emergency gear-up landing and chose {{to do so in the}} grass, hoping to minimize damage and to avoid injuring any observers. The aircraft was only slightly damaged, but due to the mishap the first prototype was sent to the Paris Air Show in its place.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming <b>jammed.</b> <b>The</b> salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls <b>jammed</b> <b>the</b> switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{telescope}} was originally completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading the telescope so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. The telescope was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the telescope working; if tey had not been put right, then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps <b>jammed.</b> <b>The</b> telescope was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{previous}} day, 3 May, the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north. Here {{they had a}} number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling, which resulted in them being ambushed. They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching, and crossing the river, arriving there on 6 May. On 5 May, along the Buin Road, the 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again. Advancing with a tank troop in support, they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese. After the lead Matilda's machine gun <b>jammed,</b> <b>the</b> field gun opened fire on it, damaging it and wounding its crew. Moving around the stricken tank, the second Matilda, armed with a howitzer, opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the Japanese defenders from the position. That night, the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage, and the following morning put in a company-sized counter-attack. The fighting lasted for over two-and-a-half hours, but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack. In doing so, they suffered one killed and nine wounded, while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily, losing 58 men killed. It was the biggest loss since the action at Slater's Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the Hongorai.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} high repetition frequency laser jamming on laser seeker’s distinguishing and locking stage for decoding process, two models are built to quantitatively study <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> effect under <b>the</b> different coding systems, one is normalized cross-correlation function model, <b>the</b> other is <b>jamming</b> efficiency model. <b>The</b> simulation result indicates that, at the stage of code distinguishing, <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> frequency is a dominant factor in affecting <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> effect; <b>The</b> effect of high repetition frequency laser <b>jamming</b> seeker under <b>the</b> different coding system is different; The greater the seeker sampling interval is, the better the effect is. At the stage of code locking, the leading time of high repetition frequency laser to guidance signal {{is an important factor}} in affecting <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> efficiency; <b>The</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> frequency and <b>the</b> wider the time gate’s width is, the higher the average efficiency of interference is. High repetition frequency laser can completely <b>jam</b> <b>the</b> decoding process of the two stages when the laser frequency is high enough.

25|$|Early that evening, Tunny {{surfaced}} {{and headed}} {{away from the}} heavily traveled lanes she had been patrolling {{in order to assess}} her damages and effect repairs. Inspection disclosed considerable damage to the bow, ripped-up plating aft of the torpedo room, and sheared-off rivets and bolts. The torpedo room pressure hull was badly dished in between frames; and this damage in turn immobilized the bow plane tilting gears. The explosions had <b>jammed</b> <b>the</b> gyro spindles in the stern torpedo tubes, impaired the usefulness of sound and radar gear, and caused other damage visible throughout the ship. Sailors inspecting topside found fragments of the destructive depth charges scattered over the deck.|$|E
25|$|Interstate 45 gained notoriety during Hurricane Rita in 2005. Thousands of Houston area {{evacuees}} <b>jammed</b> <b>the</b> roadway {{trying to}} leave.

Even though the Texas Department of Transportation started contraflow lane reversal at FM 1488, it did not alleviate the traffic jam deep into the city, as that starting point was even north of The Woodlands, which is close to Conroe, the northern terminus of the greater Houston area.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{policy was}} to {{pressure}} the Serbs to accept the ultimatum {{as much as possible}} without being humiliated too much. Russia was anxious to avoid a war because the Great Military Programme was not to be completed until 1917, and Russia was otherwise not ready for war. Because all of France’s leaders, including President Poincaré and René Viviani, were at sea on the battleship France, returning from the summit in St. Petersburg, the acting head of the French government, Jean-Baptiste Bienvenu-Martin took no line on the ultimatum. In addition, the Germans <b>jammed</b> <b>the</b> radio messages, at least garbling contacts between the ship-borne French leaders and Paris, and possibly blocking them completely.|$|E
