30|$|In the {{assessment}} of cytotoxicity, cell types {{also need to be}} considered as cells with different functions may respond differently to the exposure of CNTs. After the CNTs' pass of the endothelial barrier, the cell types that are most likely to encounter CNTs in vivo are immune cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B lymphocytes) because of their primary <b>defence</b> <b>function</b> <b>against</b> pathogens and foreign particulate matter. Additionally, immune cells have been identified as effective vehicles for cancer therapy and in the treatment of infectious diseases when stimulated and targeted by functionalized CNTs [9 – 11]. Hence evaluation of CNT toxicity to immune cells is an important but overlooked component of CNT nanotoxicology.|$|R

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely distributed in nature and are considered to be ancestral components in the evolution on innate immunity. Several types of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been isolated from fish and they are present in mucosal surfaces and in immune cells such as MCs. One type of AMPs expressed by fish MCs is piscidins. Twenty-four perch, Perca fluviatilis (22, 95 ± 7, 48, mean total length ± S. D.) from Lake Piediluco (Centre Italy) were caught by professional fishermen using a gill net. Fourteen pike were infected with an intestinal parasite, Acanthocephalus lucii. The pathological changes and the immune response induced by worms were assessed using histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. The parasites penetrate not deeply into the intestinal wall and induce slight inflammation to the organ. The main damage caused by worms to the host digestive tract was the destruction of the mucosal epithelium covering the villi next to the parasites site of attachment, which included necrosis and degeneration. Immunostaining of the perch intestine with antibodies against the peptide antibiotics piscidin 3 (anti-HAGR) and piscidin 4 (anti- 5. 3 - 02 - 3 A) showed subpopulations of MCs that were positive. Piscidin positive MCs were observed especially among the epithelial cells of the intestine but also within the submucosal layer. In both uninfected and infected perch, the number of MCs positive to piscidin 4 was higher than those immunoreactive with piscidin 3 (ANOVA, p 0. 05). The immunostaining intensity was also compared in infected and healthy fish but no distinct differences were noticed (ANOVA, p > 0. 05). Our study provides the first evidence of the presence of piscidins in digestive tract of a fish infected with intestinal helminths...|$|R

Several types of AMPs have been isolated from fish and they are present in mucosal surfaces and in immune cells such as MCs. One type of AMPs expressed by fish MCs is piscidins, which are 22 - 44 residue, α-helical AMPs that were originally isolated from MCs of hybrid striped bass. In this study on gills of 45 Dicentrarchus labrax, the MCs positive to piscidin 3 and 4 synthesized greater amounts of these peptides in the presence of metazoans, irrespective of the number of parasites or of the proximity to them. In the 46 specimens of Sparus aurata heavily parasitized the number of positive cells to piscidin 3 was higher than both those lightly parasitized and healthy ones in all the investigated tissue districts (central venous sinus, capillaries of secondary lamellae and extravascular tissue), irrespective of the vicinity of the parasite. In the extravascular tissue, furthermore, the intensity of the immunostaining was stronger in heavily parasitized fish compared to both lightly parasitized and healthy. The study on 24 Perca fluviatilis showed that the intensity of immunostaining for both piscidin 3 and 4 was stronger in healthy fish than those parasitized and that there were no differences in abundance of MCs expressing piscidins in {{the presence or absence of}} helminths. Our report documents the response of gills of D. Labrax and S. Aurata, and intestine of P. Fluviatilis and provides further evidence that MCs and their AMPs may play a role in response to branchial ectoparasite and intestine endoparasite infection...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arsenic and cadmium {{are widely}} {{distributed}} {{in nature and}} pose serious threats {{to the environment and}} human health. Exposure to these nonessential toxic metals may result in a variety of human diseases including cancer. However, arsenic and cadmium toxicity targets and the cellular systems contributing to tolerance acquisition are not fully known. RESULTS: To gain insight into metal action and cellular tolerance mechanisms, we carried out genome-wide screening of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid and homozygous diploid deletion mutant collections and scored for reduced growth in the presence of arsenite or cadmium. Processes found to be required for tolerance to both metals included sulphur and glutathione biosynthesis, environmental sensing, mRNA synthesis and transcription, and vacuolar/endosomal transport and sorting. We also identified metal-specific defence processes. Arsenite-specific <b>defence</b> <b>functions</b> were related to cell cycle regulation, lipid and fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the cytoskeleton whereas cadmium-specific <b>defence</b> <b>functions</b> were mainly related to sugar/carbohydrate metabolism, and metal-ion homeostasis and transport. Molecular evidence indicated that the cytoskeleton is targeted by arsenite and that phosphorylation of the Snf 1 p kinase is required for cadmium tolerance. CONCLUSION: This study has pin-pointed core functions that protect cells from arsenite and cadmium toxicity. It also emphasizes the existence of both common and specific defence systems. Since many of the yeast genes that confer tolerance to these agents have homologues in humans, similar biological processes may act in yeast and humans to prevent metal toxicity and carcinogenesis...|$|R
