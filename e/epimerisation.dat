50|$|Reactions are {{generally}} made in methanol, especially thiolysis, as benzyl mercaptan {{has a low}} solubility in water. They involve a moderate (40 to 90 °C) heating for a few minutes. <b>Epimerisation</b> may happen.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{the use of}} {{triethylamine}} as {{the base}} can lead to <b>epimerisation</b> at the carbon alpha to the newly formed carbonyl. Using the bulkier base diisopropylethylamine (iPr2NEt, Hünig's base) can mitigate this side reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} method for {{alkylation}} of the lactam nitrogen of 2,5-diketopiperazines {{is based on}} the use of sodium hydride as base. However <b>epimerisation</b> can occur especially with proline-fused 2,5-diketopiperazines, even with milder methods such as under phase-transfer catalyst conditions for example 1 to 2.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Epimerisation</b> is catalysed by one enzyme, the GlcA C5 epimerase or heparosan-N-sulfate-glucuronate 5-epimerase (...) [...] This enzyme epimerises GlcA to iduronic acid (IdoA). Substrate {{recognition}} {{requires that}} the GlcN residue linked to the non-reducing side of a potential GlcA target be N-sulfated. Uronosyl-2-O-sulfotransferase (2OST) sulfates the resulting IdoA residues.|$|E
50|$|Epimerization is a {{chemical}} process where an epimer {{is made to}} transform into its chiral counterpart. It can happen in condensed tannins depolymerisation reactions. <b>Epimerisation</b> can be spontaneous (generally a slow process), or catalyzed by enzymes, e.g. the epimerization between the sugars N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmannosamine, which is catalyzed by renin-binding protein.|$|E
50|$|LSD has two labile protons at the {{tertiary}} stereogenic C5 and C8 positions, rendering these centres {{prone to}} <b>epimerisation.</b> The C8 proton is more labile {{due to the}} electron-withdrawing carboxamide attachment, but removal of the chiral proton at the C5 position (which was once also an alpha proton of the parent molecule tryptophan) is assisted by the inductively withdrawing nitrogen and pi electron delocalisation with the indole ring.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} feature of phosphoramidites is their ability to undergo the phosphoramidite coupling reaction that is, to react with nucleophilic groups {{in the presence of}} an acidic azole catalyst, 1H-tetrazole, 2-ethylthiotetrazole, 2-benzylthiotetrazole, 4,5-dicyanoimidazole, or a number of similar compounds. The reaction proceeds extremely rapidly. This very feature makes nucleoside phosphoramidites useful intermediates in oligonucleotide synthesis. Stereochemically, the phosphoramidite coupling leads to the <b>epimerisation</b> (forming of diastereomers) at the P(III) chiral center.|$|E
50|$|Retosiban is a cyclic {{dipeptide}} or 2,5-diketopiperazine {{and these}} are formed by cyclising the corresponding linear dipeptide. In the short and highly stereoselective synthesis of Retosiban 8 the linear peptide 5 is formed by the four-component Ugi reaction of the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected R-indanylglycine 1, D-alloisoleucine methyl ester hydrochloride 2, 2-methyloxazole-4-carboxaldehyde 3 and 2-benzyloxyphenylisonitrile 4. Hydrogenation to remove the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups, enabled cyclization of the linear peptide 5 to occur to give the phenolic cyclic dipeptide 6. Hydrolysis of the phenolic amide, by reaction with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), followed addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid gave the acid 7 which was converted to the amide Retosiban 8 by activating the acid with the peptide coupling reagent PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) followed {{by the addition of}} morpholine.Although the linear peptide 5 and the cyclic dipeptide 6 are a mixture of diastereoisomers (7RS) at the exocyclic amide, the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of the activated phenolic amide caused <b>epimerisation</b> at the exocyclic position and yielded the acid 7 with the required (7R)-stereochemistry as the major product.|$|E
40|$|Post-translationally {{modified}} ribosomal peptides are unusual {{natural products}} {{and many have}} potent biological activity. The biosynthetic processes involved in their formation have been delineated for some, but the patellamides represent a unique group of these metabolites {{with a combination of}} a macrocycle, small heterocycles and D-stereocentres. The genes encoding for the patellamides show very low homology to known biosynthetic genes and there appear to be no explicit genes for the macrocyclisation and <b>epimerisation</b> steps. Using a combination of literature data and large-scale molecular dynamics calculations with explicit solvent, we propose that the macrocyclisation and <b>epimerisation</b> steps are spontaneous and interdependent and a feature {{of the structure of the}} linear peptide. Our study suggests the steps in the biosynthetic route are heterocyclisation, macrocyclisation, followed by <b>epimerisation</b> and finally dehydrogenation. This study is presented as testable hypothesis based on literature and theoretical data to be verified by future detailed experimental investigations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>epimerisation</b> of the cis and trans isomers of 4 ‐tertiobutylcyclohexanol is studied quantitatively in {{the case}} of {{potassium}} in benzene as an agent. A general theory is formulated for the <b>epimerisation</b> of conformationally homogeneous cyclohexanols by monovalent agents. It has been shown that, in such conditions there is a linear relationship between the equilibrium titres of the trans derivative and the titre of the cyclohexanolate present. By extrapolation one may obtain experimental values of the conformational equatorial axial equilibrium of both the free alcohol and the corresponding alcoholates.

40|$|Previous {{researchers}} {{have used the}} extent of isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> and stable carbon, oxygen and nitrogen isotope ratios of ostrich (Struthio), emu (Dromaius) and Genyornis eggshells to provide geochronological control and palaeoenvironmental information on the Quaternary sequences from which these sample types are recovered. This thesis expanded this field of research by examining isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> and the stable isotopes ratios of cassowary (Casuarius), megapode (principally the Australian brushturkey, Alectura lathami) and Aepyornis eggshells. The aims of the research were to (1) increase {{our understanding of the}} ancient habitats of Casuarius, megapodes and Aepyornis in order to provide information on how these ecosystems functioned, as well as the nature and timing of the environmental change they have experienced, and (2) to document the amino acid and stable isotope biogeochemistry of avian eggshells in novel contexts in order to better understand the processes that influence these attributes. Samples of Casuarius, Alectura lathami and Aepyornis eggshells were heated at high temperatures (110, 143 and 160 ºC). These experiments were used to determine the temperature sensitivity of isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> in these eggshell types, expressed in terms of Arrhenius parameters, and to characterise the thermal stability of amino acids. In the stratified archaeological sequences of Toé Cave, Kria Cave (Ayamaru Plateau, West Papua, Indonesia), Liang Lemdubu and Nabulei Lisa (Aru Islands, Arafura Sea, Indonesia) exposure to short-term high temperature heating events associated with campfires complicated interpretation of the extent of isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> in Casuarius and megapode eggshells in terms of time and temperature. The extent of isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> in Alectura lathami eggshells from Hay Cave (northeastern Queensland, Australia) enhanced the geochronological control for this site by clarifying the presence of temporal breaks in the sequence and providing an age estimate for a section of the sequence lacking age control. Late Holocene and Pleistocene populations of Aepyornis eggshells from the southern and southwestern coasts of Madagascar were readily distinguished by the extent of isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> they exhibit. Relatively high stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (_ 13 C and _ 18 O values) in Pleistocene Casuarius eggshells from the Aru Islands were consistent with a weaker monsoon during the Last Glacial Maximum. The absence of this trend in Pleistocene Casuarius eggshells from the Ayamaru Plateau suggested the latter site is less sensitive to fluctuations in monsoon effectiveness. Supported by isotope analyses of modern megapode eggshells, carbon fixed by C 3 photosynthesis was identified {{at the base of the}} Alectura food chain from the _ 13 C values of Hay Cave megapode eggshells. The interpretation of Alectura eggshell _ 18 O values was complicated by their wide range, and this was most likely a product of the combined effects of evaporation on oxygen isotope ratios and the protracted breeding season. The lack of variation in the _ 13 C and _ 18 O values of Aepyornis eggshells was attributed to subsistence on C 3 vegetation and the water of perennial groundwater-fed ponds, whereas enriched nitrogen isotope ratios could be due to a number of factors including the infiltration of seawater into the littoral water table. Overall, the research presented an opportunity to examine the strengths and weaknesses of information extrapolated from isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> and isotope ratios in avian eggshells in novel taxonomic and geographical settings. The high temperature experiments further documented the taxonomic dependency of the rate of isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> in avian eggshells and indicated that the temperature sensitivity of this reaction is similar amongst eggshells. Although interpreting the extent of isoleucine <b>epimerisation</b> in eggshells from archaeological sites in terms of time and temperature was readily complicated by exposure to campfire heating events, the ability to demonstrate a close correlation with independent age control indicated that this problem is not ubiquitous in these contexts. The _ 13 C values of eggshells broadly identified the vegetation that herbivorous birds consumed, and where the photosynthetic pathway of this vegetation was known, eggshell _ 13 C values provided information on the _ 13 C value of this biomass. The nitrogen isotope ratios of eggshells could be successfully integrated with existing knowledge of ancient habitats, and eggshell _ values were used to identify drinking water sources and trace climatically-significant changes in these reservoirs over time...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPodophyllotoxin (PT) and its {{clinically}} used analogues {{are known}} to be powerful antitumour agents. These compounds contain a trans fused strained γ-lactone system, a feature that correlates to the process of <b>epimerisation,</b> whereby the trans γ-lactone system of ring D opens and converts to the more thermodynamically stable cis epimer. Since these cis epimers {{are known to}} be either less active or lacking antitumour activity, <b>epimerisation</b> is an undesirable feature from a chemotherapeutic point of view. To circumvent this problem, considerable efforts have been reported, amongst which is the synthesis of azapodophyllotoxins where the stereocentres at C 2 and C 3 are removed in order to preclude <b>epimerisation.</b> Herein we report the identification of a novel C 3 hydroxy, cis-selective γ-lactone configuration of ring C in the azapodophyllotoxin scaffold, through an efficient stereoselective multicomponent reaction (MCR) involving fluorinated and non-fluorinated aldehydes. This configuration releases the highly strained trans γ-lactone system in podophyllotoxin analogues into the more thermodynamically stable cis γ-lactone motif and yet retains significantly potent activity. These compounds were evaluated against the human cancer lines MCF- 7 and 22 Rv 1 in vitro. Fourteen out of the seventeen tested compounds exhibited sub-micromolar activity with IC 50 values in the range of 0. 11 – 0. 91  μM, which is comparable and in some cases better than the activity profile of etoposide in this assay. Interestingly, we obtained strong evidence from spectroscopic and X-ray data analyses that the previously reported structure of similar analogues is not accurate. Molecular modelling performed using the podophyllotoxin binding site on β tubulin revealed a novel binding mode of these analogues. Furthermore, sub-cellular study of our compounds using immunolabelling and confocal microscopy analyses showed strong microtubule disruptive activity, particularly in dividing cells...|$|E

Three genes coding for the NAD + -dependent short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) NV 10127, NV 10128, and NV 10129 {{are linked to the}} ability of Nv to produce RR.

Nv-derived SDR orthologues generally had higher <b>epimerisation</b> rates, which were also influenced by NAD + availability. Semiquantitative protein analyses of the pheromone glands by tandem mass spectrometry revealed that NV 10127 as well as NV 10128 and/or NV 10129 were more abundant in Nv compared to Ng.
