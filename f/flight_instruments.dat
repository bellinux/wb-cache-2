5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed won many {{contracts}} to upgrade foreign operator's F-16s. BAE Systems also offers various F-16 upgrades, receiving orders from South Korea, Oman, Turkey, and the US Air National Guard; BAE lost the South Korean contract {{due to a}} price breach in November 2014. In 2012, the USAF assigned the total upgrade contract to Lockheed Martin. Upgrades include Raytheonâ€™s Center Display Unit, which replaces several analog <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> with a single digital display.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 has a {{glass cockpit}} with all-digital <b>flight</b> <b>instruments.</b> The {{monochrome}} head-up display offers a wide {{field of view}} {{and serves as a}} primary flight instrument; information is also displayed upon six color liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls, but this was judged to be too technically risky and was abandoned. The canopy's dimensions are approximately 140inches long, 45inches wide, and 27inches tall (355cm x 115cm x 69cm) and weighs 360 pounds.|$|E

The performance of the detectors was characterized, optimized, and calibrated, both individually and in the <b>flight</b> <b>instrument.</b> The detector test techniques and calibration methods are described and results for the spectral response, dark current, responsivity, and noise equivalent power are presented. The dependence of these parameters on operating conditions was explored and optimum values established for the <b>flight</b> <b>instrument.</b> Calibration of the <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> demonstrated that {{the sensitivity of the}} LWS is within specifications...|$|R
5|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> in the B.1 were {{traditional}} and included G4B compasses; Mk.4 artificial horizons; and zero reader flight display instruments. The B.1 had a Smiths Mk10 autopilot. In the B.2, these features {{were incorporated into}} the Smiths Military Flight System (MFS), the pilots' components being: two beam compasses; two director-horizons; and a Mk.10A or Mk.10B autopilot. From 1966, B.2s were fitted with the ARI 5959 Terrain-following radar (TFR), built by General Dynamics, its commands being fed into the director-horizons.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited III is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) flight simulator video game, {{in which the}} player pilots virtual reproductions of real-world planes. Players may control ten aircraft: the Lake Turbo Renegade, Stemme S10, Mooney Bravo, Fokker Dr.I, Beechjet 400A and five planes first included in Flight Unlimited II. Plane cockpits feature simulated <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> such as variometers and primary flight displays, and allow for both visual and instrument navigation. The main airspace is 10,000 square miles of Seattle terrain; eight other Western American states are modeled as well, albeit in less detail. The California scenery from Flight Unlimited II may be imported to expand the airspace. The player shares the game's skies with artificially intelligent (AI) planes. Real-time, interactive air traffic control monitors the player's actions and tries to prevent mid-air collisions. Before a flight, the player may select which types of weather to encounter. Weather conditions such as cold fronts and thunderstorms develop in real-time.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is set in}} a {{reproduction}} of 11,000 square miles of the San Francisco Bay Area. The player may land at or takeoff from the area's 46 airports. Weather conditions such as rain, wind and fog are simulated. Players share the game's airspace with up to 600 artificially intelligent (AI) planes, which fly and respond to the player in real-time. Real-time air traffic control (ATC) directs the player and the AI planes to prevent collisions. The player interacts with the ATC and with other planes by constructing radio messages with a menu. Three cockpit views are available: IFR (instrument flight rules), which allows the player to monitor and interact with all flight instruments; VFR (visual flight rules), which features a larger windshield area but fewer flight instruments; and Virtual Cockpit View, which allows free look but features no interactive <b>flight</b> <b>instruments.</b> External camera angles are also available, and the player may ride as a passenger in any AI plane.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft <b>flight</b> <b>instruments,</b> however, operate using {{pressure}} differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The {{assumption is that}} a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a Pitot tube is dependent on altitude as well as speed.|$|E

50|$|An {{electronic}} <b>flight</b> <b>instrument</b> system (EFIS) is a <b>flight</b> deck <b>instrument</b> {{display system}} that displays flight data electronically rather than electromechanically. An EFIS normally {{consists of a}} primary flight display (PFD), multi-function display (MFD), and an engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) display. Early EFIS models used cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, but liquid crystal displays (LCD) are now more common. The complex electromechanical attitude director indicator (ADI) and horizontal situation indicator (HSI) were the first candidates for replacement by EFIS. Now, however, few <b>flight</b> deck <b>instruments</b> cannot be replaced by an electronic display.|$|R

25|$|An early order {{came from}} the French ArmÃ©e de l'Air, which was already {{operating}} P-36s. The ArmÃ©e de l'Air ordered 100 (later the order was increased to 230) as the Hawk 81A-1 but the French were defeated before the aircraft had left the factory and the aircraft were diverted to British and Commonwealth service (as the Tomahawk I), in some cases complete with metric <b>flight</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E
25|$|Instrumentation {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure, flow, and temperature. The design of such instrumentation requires {{a good understanding of}} physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, <b>flight</b> <b>instruments</b> measure variables such as wind speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier-Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft <b>flight</b> <b>instruments,</b> however, don't compute true {{airspeed}} {{as a function}} of groundspeed and windspeed. They use impact and static pressures as well as a temperature input. True airspeed is equivalent airspeed that is corrected for pressure altitude and temperature (which define density). The result is the true physical speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding body of air. At standard sea level conditions, {{true airspeed}}, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are all equal.|$|E
