40|$|Multiple {{scattering}} of radio waves by artificial random irregularities HF-induced in the ionosphere F region may cause significant attenuation of both ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>waves</b> together with common anomalous absorption of ordinary waves {{due to their}} non-linear conversion into plasma waves. To demonstrate existence and strength of this effect, direct measurements of attenuation of both powerful pump wave and weak probing <b>waves</b> of <b>extraordinary</b> polarization {{have been carried out}} during an experimental campaign on September 6, 7 and 9, 1999 at the Sura heating facility. The attenuation magnitude of <b>extraordinary</b> <b>waves</b> reaches of 1 - 10 dB over a background attenuation caused by natural irregularities. It is interpreted in the paper on the base of the theory of multiple scattering from the artificial random irregularities with characteristic scale lengths of 0. 1 - 1 km.

50|$|One {{undesirable}} {{effect of}} angle tuning {{is that the}} optical frequencies involved do not propagate collinearly with each other. This {{is due to the}} fact that the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>wave</b> propagating through a birefringent crystal possesses a Poynting vector that is not parallel to the propagation vector. This would lead to beam walk-off, which limits the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency. Two other methods of phase matching avoid beam walk-off by forcing all frequencies to propagate at a 90° with respect to the optical axis of the crystal. These methods are called temperature tuning and quasi-phase-matching.|$|E

50|$|The {{image at}} the right {{illustrates}} {{the complexity of the}} situation. Unlike optical ray tracing where the medium between objects typically has a constant refractive index, signal ray tracing must deal with the complexities of a spatially varying refractive index, where changes in ionospheric electron densities influence the refractive index and hence, ray trajectories. Two sets of signals are broadcast at two different elevation angles. When the main signal penetrates into the ionosphere, the magnetic field splits the signal into two component waves which are separately ray traced through the ionosphere. The ordinary wave (red) component follows a path completely independent of the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>wave</b> (green) component.|$|E

(14) Except for arbitrary cases of incomprehension, all people felt that God had stimulated extraordinary answers in his soul, and that his journey to the Holy Mountain was really fast. A religious woman, his contemporary and friend since childhood, wrote that on learning of his death she felt the words of Wisdom ringing in her heart: [...] "Having come to perfection so soon, he has lived long; his soul being pleasing to the Lord, he has hurried away from the wickedness around him." [...] (Wis. 4:13-14a)Such a conclusion to life cannot be improvised. It comes from afar and the moment of death is only the occasion that reveals the interior work done.

5000|$|Ferdinand von Zeppelin {{completed}} his first airship, the LZ 1 in July 1900. Constructed in a floating shed on Lake Constance, it was 128.02 m (420 ft) long, 11.73 m (38 ft 6 in) in diameter with {{a volume of}} 11,298 m3 (399,000 ft 3) and was powered by two 11 kW (14 hp) Daimler engines. The first flight, lasting 20 minutes, was made on 2 July, but ended with the airship being damaged. After repairs and modifications two further flights were made in October 1900. [...] These experiments failed to attract any investors, and Count Zeppelin did not complete his next design, LZ 2, until 1906. This made only a single flight on 17 January 1906. After both engines failed it made a forced landing in the Allgäu mountains, where a storm subsequently damaged it beyond repair. A similar design, the LZ 3 was soon completed. This performed well enough to interest the German Army, but they required an airship capable of flying for 24 hours. This was beyond the capability of LZ 3, so a larger craft, LZ 4, was built. This was 136 m (446 ft) long, 12.95 m (42 ft 6 in) in diameter and powered by two Daimler engines delivering a total of 156 kW (210 hp). [...] LZ 4 first flew on 20 June 1908, and on 1 July made a spectacular 12 hour cross-country flight during which it was flown over Switzerland to Zürich {{and then back to}} Lake Constance. The 24-hour trial was started on 4 August, but was interrupted by the failure of one of the engines. It was moored near Echterdingen in order to make repairs but a storm arose and it broke away from its moorings, was blown into some trees and caught fire.

Earlier SEAWs have been considered in the electrostatic limit. Here we include the electromagnetic effects in their spectrum at the propagation perpendicular to the external magnetic field. We find that the SEAW spectrum considerably changes at the account of transverse part of electric field. We obtain that the separate spin evolution modifies spectrum of the well-known extraordinary waves either.
