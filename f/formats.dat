5|$|HDMI 1.0 and 1.1 are {{restricted}} to transmitting only certain video <b>formats,</b> defined in EIA/CEA-861-B and in the HDMI Specification itself. HDMI 1.2 and all later versions allow any arbitrary resolution and frame rate (within the bandwidth limit); any <b>formats</b> that are {{not supported by the}} HDMI Specification (i.e. no standardized timings defined) may be implemented as a vendor-specific format. Although successive versions of the HDMI Specification continue to add support for additional <b>formats</b> (such as 4K resolutions), the added support is to establish standardized timings to ensure interoperability between products, not to establish what <b>formats</b> are and aren't permitted, and video <b>formats</b> do not require explicit support from the HDMI Specification in order to be displayed.|$|E

5|$|HDMI 1.2 was {{released}} on August 8, 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on Super Audio CDs, at up to 8 channels. To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported <b>formats</b> be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific <b>formats,</b> allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported <b>formats.</b> In addition, it added explicit support for several new <b>formats</b> including 720p at 100 and 120Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would {{not be required to}} support YCBCR output.|$|E

50|$|The <b>format</b> {{originated}} with Oskar Barnack and his {{introduction of the}} Leica camera in the 1920s. Thus it is sometimes called the Leica <b>format</b> or Barnack <b>format.</b> The name 35 mm originates with the total width of the 135 film, the perforated cartridge film which was the primary medium of the <b>format</b> prior to {{the invention of the}} full frame DSLR. The term 135 <b>format</b> remains in use. In digital photography, the <b>format</b> {{has come to be known}} as full frame, FF or FX, the latter invented as a trade mark of Nikon. Historically the 35 mm <b>format</b> was sometimes called miniature <b>format</b> or small <b>format,</b> terms meant to distinguish it from medium <b>format</b> and large <b>format.</b>|$|R
40|$|Field <b>format</b> {{restrictions}} {{are often used}} in online forms to impose certain <b>formatting</b> and content rules on users, such as minimum password length or date entry <b>format.</b> In this study, the question whether and how <b>format</b> restrictions for fields in online forms should be communicated to Internet users was explored. In an online study with n = 166 participants, four ways to communicate <b>format</b> restrictions were investigated: (1) no visual <b>format</b> restriction, (2) <b>format</b> examples, (3) <b>format</b> specifications, and (4) both <b>format</b> restrictions (examples and specifications). Results show that providing details of any <b>format</b> restriction to users in advance leads to significantly fewer errors and trials. The {{most efficient way to}} communicate field <b>format</b> restrictions to users is by stating the imposed rule (<b>format</b> specification). Providing an additional example neither helps nor constrains user...|$|R
