25|$|According to the Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra, the sun {{and moon}} {{are said to be}} born from Avalokiteśvara's eyes, Shiva from <b>his</b> <b>brow,</b> Brahma from his shoulders, Narayana from his heart, Sarasvati from his teeth, the winds from his mouth, the earth from his feet and the sky from his stomach. In this text and others, such as the Longer Sukhavativyuha Sutra, Avalokiteśvara is an {{attendant}} of Amitabha.|$|E
25|$|Then further back, {{higher than}} the candelabrum, and much {{higher than the}} altar, rose the Moloch, all of iron, and with gaping {{apertures}} in his human breast. His outspread wings were stretched upon the wall, his tapering hands reached down to the ground; three black stones bordered by yellow circles represented three eyeballs on <b>his</b> <b>brow,</b> and his bull's head was raised with a terrible effort as if in order to bellow.|$|E

25|$|Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the Man Beren and Elf Lúthien, the {{daughter}} of Thingol, entered Angband and recovered a Silmaril from Morgoth’s crown after Luthien's singing sent him to sleep. It was inherited by their granddaughter Elwing, who joined those dwelling at the Mouths of Sirion. Her husband Eärendil, wearing the Silmaril on <b>his</b> <b>brow,</b> sailed across the sea to Valinor, where he pleaded with the Valar to liberate Middle-earth from Morgoth.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{is about}} a local blacksmith. Noted as being strong, he works by the sweat of <b>his</b> <b>brow</b> and does not owe anyone anything. Children coming home from school stop to stare {{at him as he}} works, {{impressed}} by the roaring bellows and burning sparks. On Sundays, the blacksmith, a single father {{after the death of his}} wife, takes his children to church, where his daughter sings in the choir. He goes through his life following the daily tasks assigned to him and has earned his sleep at night. The narrator concludes by thanking the blacksmith for the lessons he can teach.|$|E
25|$|Margaret attacks York's castle at Wakefield, and the Yorkists {{lose the}} ensuing battle. During the conflict, Clifford murders York's twelve-year-old son, Rutland. Margaret and Clifford then capture and taunt York himself; {{forcing him to}} stand on a molehill, they give him a {{handkerchief}} covered with Rutland's blood to wipe <b>his</b> <b>brow,</b> and place a paper crown on his head, before stabbing him to death. After the battle, as Edward and Richard lament York's death, Warwick brings news that his own army has been defeated by Margaret's at the Second Battle of St Albans, and the King has returned to London, where, under pressure from Margaret, he has revoked his agreement with York. However, George Plantagenet, Richard and Edward's brother, has vowed to join their cause, having been encouraged {{to do so by}} his sister, the Duchess of Burgundy. Additionally, Warwick has been joined in the conflict by his own younger brother, Montague.|$|E

25|$|The {{story in}} the Vishnu Purana goes that Durvasa, while {{wandering}} the earth {{in a state of}} ecstasy due to a vow he was observing, came by a Vidyadhari(a nymph of the air) and demanded of her a heavenly wreath of flowers she was wearing. The nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on <b>his</b> <b>brow.</b> Resuming his wanderings, the sage came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Durvasa, still in his state of frenzy, threw the garland at Indra, who caught it and placed it on Airavata's head. The elephant was irritated by the fragrance of the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk. Durvasa was enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland was cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa's forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or even soften his curse and went on his way. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and shorn of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods. The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras and work together with them to churn the ocean of milk and obtain the Amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing it with them. Vishnu promised that he would ensure only the devas drank the Nectar and obtained immortality so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu's advice and called their truce with the asuras and thus did the gods and demons begin planning their great enterprise.|$|E
500|$|One {{report says}} the wrestler {{was able to}} hold a {{pomegranate}} without damaging it while challengers tried to pry his fingers from it, and another report says he could burst a band fastened around <b>his</b> <b>brow</b> by inhaling air and causing the temple veins to swell. He was said to maintain his footing on an oiled discus while others tried to push him from it. [...] These feats {{have been attributed to}} misinterpretations of statues depicting Milo with his head bound in victor's ribbons, his hand holding the apple of victory, and his feet positioned on a round disc that would have been fitted into a pedestal or base.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his distinctive name, Z. Marcas has a remarkable appearance which his neighbors notice immediately. The story's first line refers to his [...] ("striking") appearance. As usual in his later work, Balzac describes Marcas by relating him to an animal: [...] "L'animal de Marcas était le lion. Ses cheveux ressemblaient à une crinière, son nez était court, écrasé, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partagé comme celui d'un lion par un sillon puissant, divisé en deux lobes vigoureux." [...] ("The animal for Marcas was the lion. His hair was like a mane, his nose was short and flat; broad and dented at the tip like a lion's; <b>his</b> <b>brow,</b> like a lion's, was strongly marked with a deep median furrow, dividing two powerful bosses.") ...|$|E

When AJ wants to be spontaneous for his plans to spend the vacation, he impulsively decides to get a job. The trio comes across a corporate office. AJ wants to apply for the corporation that owns it, but Danny and Morgan suggest that he prepares for the interview. AJ turns to his father, Peter, for advice. He equips AJ with an oversized business suit, and afterward the trio enter the office to help AJ apply. AJ shows his resume, and immediately he is hired by the Instructor of First Impressions. Workers of the office welcome AJ, who wears the same style of business suit as they do. When he sees that each worker has their own assistant, AJ hires Morgan as his [...] "secretary" [...] and tells her to fetch papers. Meanwhile, he asks [...] "towel boy" [...] Danny to wipe the sweat off <b>his</b> <b>brow.</b>|$|E
500|$|To {{maintain}} a foreign atmosphere, {{the characters of}} the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first Final Fantasy VIII character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize {{his role as the}} central character, Nomura gave him a scar across <b>his</b> <b>brow</b> and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver–sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a Final Fantasy game, were incorporated into Final Fantasy VIII. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in Final Fantasy VII, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E

2500|$|The Byronic hero first {{appears in}} Byron's semi-autobiographical epic {{narrative}} poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812–1818). Historian and critic Lord Macaulay described the character as [...] "a man proud, moody, cynical, with defiance on <b>his</b> <b>brow,</b> and misery in his heart, a scorner of his kind, implacable in revenge, yet capable of deep and strong affection". The initial {{version of the}} type in Byron's work, Childe Harold, draws {{on a variety of}} earlier literary characters including Hamlet, Goethe's Werther (1774), and William Godwin's Mr. Faulkland in Caleb Williams (1794); he was also noticeably similar to René, the hero of Chateaubriand's novella of 1802, although Byron may not have read this.|$|E
2500|$|Finally {{the poet}} denies time a singular, most grievous sin ("one most hainous crime"). It must [...] "carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow". In associating crime and {{wrinkles}} Shakespeare has drawn on Ovid again, [...] "de rugis crimina multa cadunt" [...] ('from wrinkles many crimes are exposed' from [...] ), rendered by Christopher Marlowe as [...] "wrinckles in beauty is a grieuous fault". The hours must not etch into the beloved's brow any wrinkle (compare Sonnet 63, [...] "When hours have [...]. fill'd <b>his</b> <b>brow</b> / With lines and wrinkles"). Nor must time's [...] "antique pen," [...] both its 'ancient' and its 'antic' or crazy pen, [...] "draw ... lines there".|$|E
2500|$|Host Laughton {{introduced}} the singer from New York. [...] Once on camera, Elvis {{cleared his throat}} and said, [...] "Thank you, Mr. Laughton, ladies and gentlemen.

We want to thank you from the bottom of our heart. And now ..." [...] "Don't Be Cruel", which was, after a short introduction by Elvis, followed by [...] "Love Me Tender". According to Elaine Dundy, Presley sang [...] "Love Me Tender" [...] "straight, subdued and tender ... —a very different Elvis from the one on The Steve Allen Show three months before".|$|E
