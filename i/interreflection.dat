50|$|Diffuse <b>interreflection</b> is {{apparent}} when light from one diffuse object is reflected onto another. Photon mapping is particularly adept at handling this effect because the algorithm reflects photons from one surface to another {{based on that}} surface's bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and thus light from one object striking another is a natural result of the method.

50|$|Diffuse <b>interreflection</b> is {{a process}} whereby light {{reflected}} from an object strikes other objects in the surrounding area, illuminating them. Diffuse <b>interreflection</b> specifically describes light reflected from objects which are not shiny or specular.

It is used to realistically simulate the interaction of light with different objects. Specifically, {{it is capable of}} simulating the refraction of light through a transparent substance such as glass or water, diffuse <b>interreflection</b> between illuminated objects, the subsurface scattering of light in translucent materials, and some of the effects caused by particulate matter such as smoke or water vapor.

40|$|Interreflections {{affect the}} colors of {{surfaces}} as they appear in images. The light reflected by one surface that then impinges upon a second surface changes {{the color of the}} overall illumination that it receives and hence the color of the light that it reflects. Both the relative colors and positions of the two surfaces affect the result. We analyze the physics of the <b>interreflection</b> process and extract constraints on the possible surface reflectances, ambient illumination, and geometric configuration of the surfaces. By using the calculus of variations, a finite-dimensional model of reflectance, and a one-bounce model of <b>interreflection,</b> we express these constraints as a set of equations that are then solved for the surface spectral reflectance functions of the surfaces, the spectrum of the ambient illumination, and local <b>interreflection</b> factors related to the scene geometry. The <b>interreflection</b> factors express how the image is altered by <b>interreflection</b> effects and can be used to produce an image shaded as it would appear had there been no interreflection; the surface reflectance functions provide color constancy.

40|$|Abstract- Mutual {{illumination}} {{occurs when}} light reflected from one surface impinges {{on a second}} one. The resulting additional illumination incident on the second surface affects both the color and intensity of the light reflected from it. As a consequence, {{the image of a}} surface in the presence of mutual illumination differs from what it otherwise {{would have been in the}} absence of mutual illumination. Unaccounted for mutual illumination can easily confuse methods that rely on intensity or color such as shape-from-shading or color-based object recognition. In this correspondence, we introduce an algorithm that removes mutual illu-mination effects from images. The domain is that of previously-segmented images of convex surfaces of uniform color and diffuse reflectance where for each surface the <b>interreflection</b> occurs mainly from one other surface and can he accurately accounted for within a one-bounce model. The algorithm is based on a singular value decomposition of the colors coming from each surface. Geometrical information about where on the surface the colors emanate from is not required. The RGB triples from a single convex surface experiencing <b>interreflection</b> fall in a plane; intersecting the planes generated from two interreflecting surfaces results in a unique <b>interreflection</b> color. Each pixel can then he factored into its <b>interreflection</b> and no-interreflection components so that a complete no-interreflection image is produced.

Previous research on shadows has shown them to be effective in determining the 3 D layout of a scene, but interreflections have been ignored as a cue for spatial layout. The addition of <b>interreflection</b> as well as shadows may help to disambiguate the 3 D layout of objects by providing information about object contact with a surface. We generated computer images of a box on an extended textured ground plane that was either in contact with the ground or slightly above the ground.

Participants rated the degree of contact for each image on a scale which was used to generate ROC curves and a measure of sensitivity. In the images with no shadow or interreflections, the participants performed at chance. Interreflections, shadows, and a combination of interreflections and shadows all resulted in a high sensitivity for judging object contact. More importantly information from shadows and interreflections can be combined to result in near-perfect judgement of surface contact.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} surface color {{appearance}} have ignored 3 -D illumination phenomena such as shadows and <b>interreflections,</b> These phenomena must affect surface color appearance to some extent, {{but without a}} model we cannot make claims about how great these effects really are. In this article, we introduce a simple model of how <b>interreflections</b> car? affect color appearance. We consider a family of ideal surfaces, namely spherical concavities dug out of a ground plane, and we assume that these surfaces are illuminated by a uniform, diffuse light source. Under such assumptions, the color signal reflected from a surface is described by a simple mathematical model. We use this model and CIELAB coordinates to perform a parametric study of how the lightness, hue, and chroma of the reflected color signal vary with the concavity aperture.

Due {{to the complexity of}} this time-varying data, advanced visualization techniques are required to support its visual analysis. Current molecular visualization techniques utilize ambient occlusion as a global illumination approximation to improve spatial comprehension. Besides these shadow-like effects, <b>interreflections</b> are also known to improve the spatial comprehension of complex geometric structures. Unfortunately, the inherent computational complexity of <b>interreflections</b> would forbid interactive exploration, which is mandatory in many scenarios dealing with static and time-varying data. In this paper, we introduce a novel analytic approach for capturing <b>interreflections</b> of molecular structures in real-time. By exploiting the knowledge of the underlying space filling representations, we are able to reduce the required parameters and can thus apply symbolic regression to obtain an analytic expression for <b>interreflections.</b> We show how to obtain the data required for the symbolic regression analysis, and how to exploit our analytic solution to enhance interactive molecular visualizations.
