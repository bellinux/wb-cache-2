25|$|A {{photograph}} was taken of Richmond captain-coach Dyer, aged 30 and playing his {{two hundred and}} twenty second game, wearing white strapping on his left thumb, and a dirty knee bandage on his left knee, breaking away from the pack, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the Lake end goals (Dyer went on to kick a goal), {{in the last quarter}} of the 1944 Preliminary Final, held at the Junction Oval, on Saturday 23 September 1944, in which Richmond defeated Essendon, primarily due to Dyer's nine goals.|$|E
2500|$|We don’t {{even see}} his feet. He is {{embedded}} in the rock like something not yet fully born, suited and stern, rising from its roughly chiseled surface. His face is uncompromising, determined, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> in the distance, not far from where Jefferson stands across the water. But kitsch here strains at the limits of resemblance: Is this the Dr. King of the [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech? Or the writer of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech? ...|$|E
2500|$|Recitative and prologue. Hamlet asks Ophélie if he may sit at {{her feet}} (Hamlet: Belle, permettez-nous [...] "Lady, permit me"). She {{responds}} that his expression frightens and chills her. Hamlet sits, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the King and Queen. Everyone takes their places, and the curtains of the small theatre are opened. The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a saxophone solo. (According to Annegret Fauser {{this is the first}} instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.) In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez pâlir, dites-le moi! [...] "Now! Fix your gaze on upon the King, and, if he should turn pale, tell me!").|$|E
60|$|She saw {{the light}} in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fix</b> determinedly, and he nodded.|$|R
60|$|The {{moment the}} {{landlord}} {{came out and}} saw who it was, <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> on the cocked hat, and he turned as pale as ashes.|$|R
60|$|Richard kept <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> on the Scot's face, beheld and beholding, smiling {{inwardly}} at {{the relief}} {{produced by the}} turn he had given to his general accusation.|$|R
2500|$|Notorious for {{his defense}} against the pirates, Mangkaw was a known net-fisherman. Already a fishing ground that it is today, Sogod then had houses {{clustered}} close to shore around the watchtower. Being {{an expert in the}} art of casting the net, Laya, he could send out the casting net in a perfect circle in the sea. As the community grew bigger, the residents agitated for a name for their place. Meetings after meetings were held presided by Mangkaw. But every time a meeting is ongoing, a shoal of fish would be seen by the subtle wave of the surface or quick shifting shadow beneath the surface. The eyes of the pondering datu kept stalking it, interfering with the meeting. Satisfying his unequalled fisherman's instinct, he would leave the meeting unattended and his body language was being watched by the attendees, feasting their eyes on the artful slide of the feet of the datu so as not to disturb the surface, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the school. Then, he shared his catch with the people for the asking, even by strangers. After which, shouts of [...] "Sogod, sogod!" [...] (vernacular for [...] "to begin") would reconvene the meeting. Thus the word [...] "Sogod" [...] became the name of the village then and the town as it is today.|$|E
60|$|The cashier, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the door, {{does not}} answer.|$|E
60|$|Poirot puffed at {{his tiny}} cigarette, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the ceiling.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned over}} some papers {{for a few}} minutes, during which Buck Tom did not condescend to glance to {{one side or the}} other, but kept <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> sternly on the landlord.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] said Briant, {{stretching}} {{out his hand}} to the place indicated, but keeping <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> all the time on the piece of biscuit. [...] "Ah, here it is; ketch it." ...|$|R
60|$|I was so astounded at this infamous {{action that}} I stood petrified before him. I {{tried to speak}} to him of honour and gratitude, but I saw <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fix</b> and harden over the pistol.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mool {{answered}} this, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on her {{in grave}} scrutiny.|$|E
60|$|He made no reply. <b>His</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>fixed</b> intently {{on the sea}} astern, {{suddenly}} flashed.|$|E
60|$|Still Gordon was silent, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on her {{expressive}} {{and charming}} face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Macassar merely sighed gently--perhaps {{he had no}} fitting answer; {{perhaps his}} heart was too full for him to answer. He sat with <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> on <b>his</b> hat, which still dangled in his hand; but <b>his</b> mind's <b>eye</b> was far away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all never warmer {{looks very}} comfortable, though. Where's Uncle?" [...] asked Charlie, {{following}} with his hat still on, {{his hands in}} his pockets, and <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> steadily on the bright head in front of him.|$|R
60|$|The Doctor {{looked even}} graver, and <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> as on a thought far away, as the boy's grief {{brought to his}} mind the Great Assize, when all that is spoken in the ear shall indeed be proclaimed on the house-tops.|$|R
60|$|The captain assented, {{and with}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the mantelpiece smoked in silence.|$|E
60|$|Harry {{remained}} speechless, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> {{upon the}} box: {{at last he}} turned to her.|$|E
60|$|Matteo and I {{looked at}} one another. Checco kept <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the Count.|$|E
60|$|Thereon he scooted with a subdued grin {{round the}} other side of the bush, whence as I knew well he kept <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> on me to be sure that I made no further attempt to take off the Great Medicine.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the man who}} {{had entered}} the shop in company with the goldsmith--a tall figure, about fifty, with a short trimmed beard, wearing an old felt hat and a threadbare mantle--had kept <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> on the Greek, and now said abruptly-- ...|$|R
60|$|He nodded, <b>his</b> dark <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> {{upon her}} face but {{displaying}} no expression.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} curiously and kept <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on me while he {{answered}} my question.|$|E
60|$|Sir James spoke {{slowly and}} low, as if reflectively, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the ground.|$|E
60|$|The priest paused; but Thady sat quite still, listening, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the fender.|$|E
60|$|Francis made no movement. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>fixed</b> {{upon the}} weapon.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Roy said; [...] "and some of {{you will}} {{soon be able to}} handle arms in earnest. Who are your leaders?" [...] he asked sharply, as <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> on Archie, who had seated himself {{carelessly}} upon a rock at some little distance.|$|R
60|$|Phineas Duge {{was silent}} for several moments, <b>his</b> keen <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> upon Vine's face.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> {{themselves}} {{upon his}} daughter's face with one long, searching look, and closed.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grummit, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> on the other's, backed {{a couple}} of yards and breathed heavily.|$|E
60|$|Stanley moved {{a little}} on his feet. His lips were {{slightly}} parted, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>fixed</b> upon Mr. Bundercombe.|$|E
60|$|He lay {{a little}} forward of where I {{stood at the}} levers, and thus he faced {{the stern of the}} vessel as he {{addressed}} me. It {{was at the end of}} his description of the plant men that I caught <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>fixed</b> momentarily upon something behind me.|$|R
60|$|Carton nodded {{a little}} more hopefully. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>fixed</b> now upon Maraton.|$|R
