40|$|The sonolytic {{degradation}} of aqueous solutions of dimethoate, O,O-dimethyl S-[2 -(methylamino) - 2 -oxoethyl]dithiophosphate, was examined. Optimal degradation rates were obtained at 619 kHz for continuous sonolysis and 406 kHz for pulse sonolysis. The primary pathways for degradation include hydroxyl radical oxidation, hydrolysis and pyrolysis on collapsing cavitation bubble interfaces. Reaction mechanisms {{coupled with the}} corresponding kinetic models are proposed to reproduce the observed concentration versus time profiles for <b>dimethoate,</b> <b>omethoate</b> and N-(methyl) mercaptoacetamide during sonolysis. The oxidation and hydrolysis of dimethoate and omethoate occurred at the water-bubble interface was the rate-determining step for sonolytic overall {{degradation of}} dimethoate. More than 90 % toxicity of dimethoate was reduced within 45 min ultrasonic irradiation. Ferrous ion at micro molar level can significantly enhance the sonolytic degradation of dimethoate and effectively reduce the yields of toxic intermediate omethoate...|$|E

Pesticides that have been very frequently detected (n > 40) were carbendazim, imidacloprid, tebuconazole, azoxystrobin, cypermethrin, difenoconazole, <b>dimethoate,</b> methomyl, <b>omethoate</b> and methiocarb sulphoxide. All of the pesticides that were found in more than 25 samples are listed in Figure 3.|$|R
40|$|Residue {{levels of}} {{dimethoate}} and its oxon metabolite (omethoate) during tea planting, manufacturing, and brewing were investigated using a modified QuEChERS sample preparation and gas chromatography. Dissipation of dimethoate and its metabolite in tea plantation followed the first-order kinetic with a half-life of 1. 08 - 1. 27 d. Tea manufacturing has {{positive effects on}} dimethoate dissipation. Processing factors of dimethoate {{are in the range}} of 2. 11 - 2. 41 and 1. 41 - 1. 70 during green tea and black tea manufacturing, respectively. Omethoate underwent generation as well as dissipation during tea manufacturing. Sum of <b>dimethoate</b> and <b>omethoate</b> led to a large portion of 80. 5 - 84. 9 % transferring into tea infusion. Results of safety evaluation indicated that omethoate could bring higher human health risk than dimethoate due to its higher hazard quotient by drinking tea. These results would provide information for the establishment of maximum residue limit and instruction for the application of dimethoate formulation on tea crop...|$|R
40|$|A multiresidue {{method was}} {{developed}} and validated for the determination of pesticide residues (<b>omethoate,</b> <b>dimethoate,</b> carbendazim, propoxur, thiabendazole, carbaryl, pirimicarb, azinphos-methyl, methidathion, and iprodione) in fruit juices. The samples were extracted by matrix solid-phase dispersion with diatomaceous earth and analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The method detection limits were < 0. 2 ppb for all pesticides; the relative standard deviations for analyses of samples fortified over the range of 2 - 50 ng/g were < 9 %, and the recoveries for each pesticide were all between 77 and 102 %. The proposed method was used to analyze 21 commercial fruit juices; pesticide residues were found in 71 % of the samples...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{laboratory}} and field experiments showed that Aphis glycines could reproduce 18 - 22 generations {{per year in}} Jinan, and that generation period, reproductive period and reproduction rate were dependent on temperature. The aphids migrated with two peaks [...] in the first ten days of June and between the last ten days of July and first ten days of August. The insect population on soybean plants was low during seedling stage and peaked in the first ten days of August. The aphid was controlled effectively by furrow application of carbofuran (Furaden) and aldicarb (Temik) and by spray application of <b>omethoate</b> (<b>Dimethoate</b> - met) and fenvalerate (Sumicidin).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} aimed to screen {{the effect of}} overuse of the {{insecticide}} Dimethoate and its residues within 0 - 15 cm soil layer on the soil micro-arthropods population, which play {{a very important role}} in maintenance of the fertility of the soil. The valley of Zendan is located in Arhab Destrict, Sana’a Governorate, Yemen. The valley is about 50 km north-east of Sana’a city and this geographical area is a large producer of Qat (Catha edulis Forsk); the plant which {{most of the people in}} the country chew. In this study the valley divided into three stations, each station contained three treated substations and three control substations. The control substations selected from the farms, which are historically free from pesticides. Due care has been taken to insure that the treated sub-stations were from the closest area to the control substations. The average use of Dimethoate 40 % E. C is 1 - 2 ml/L water. The treatment replication was 1 - 3 times within the period of 2 - 3 weeks. In this study also, we analyzed the total concentration of Dimethoate, and its metabolite; Omethoate in the soil layer of 0 - 15 cm. The analysis of <b>Dimethoate</b> and <b>Omethoate</b> residues from representative soil samples covered the major part of the Zendan valley was done by the technique of LC-MS, and the results revealed that the detected levels ranged from 0. 914 to 5. 180 mg/kg air-dried soil for Dimethoate residues and 0. 001 to 0. 067 mg/kg air-dried soil for Omethoate residues. For studying the effect of Dimethoate residues on the soil micro-arthropods population, soil samples from each substation were collected with core sampler. The soil micro-arthropods were extracted for 48 hours and collected i...|$|R
40|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) spectra {{are presented}} and analyzed for two important organophosphate pesticides, <b>dimethoate</b> (DMT) and <b>omethoate</b> (OMT). Very detailed SERS spectra {{were obtained by}} aggregated Ag hydrosols, both in aqueous suspension and dried on a glass substrate. The SERS and ordinary Raman spectra of DMT do not resemble each other, suggesting that a chemical reaction immediately occurs when DMT is adsorbed onto the metal surface. We propose that the reaction product is OMT, which is the oxygen analog of DMT, {{on the basis of}} the Raman and SERS spectra of OMT. Further support is derived from the calculated Raman spectra of DMT and OMT. Minor wavenumber and intensity differences that are observed between the SERS spectra of DMT reaction product and those of OMT could be related to different metal/adsorbate interaction modes. The results can be useful in the development of new analytical methods for the determination of pesticide residues in food. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
