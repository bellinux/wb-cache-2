5|$|During {{the first}} four months of his premiership, Brown enjoyed a {{substantial}} lead in the polls. His popularity amongst the public may have been because his handling of numerous serious events during his first few weeks as Prime Minister, including two attempted terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow at the end of June 2007. However, between the end of 2007 and September 2008, his popularity fell significantly; two contributing factors were believed to be his perceived change of mind over plans to call a general election in October 2007 and his handling of the 10p tax rate cut in 2008, which led to allegations of weakness and <b>dithering.</b> His unpopularity led eight Labour MPs to call for a leadership contest in September 2008, less than 15 months into his premiership. The threat of a leadership contest receded due to his perceived strong handling of the global financial crisis in October, but his popularity hit an all-time low and his position became increasingly untenable after the May 2009 expenses scandal and Labour's poor results in the 2009 Local and European elections. Brown's cabinet began to rebel; there were several key resignations in the run up to local elections in June 2009. However, Brown was backed by his party. He faced a second attempt to launch a leadership challenge by former Cabinet colleagues Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt in January 2010, but the plot failed to gather momentum and Brown remained as both Labour leader and Prime Minister to lead his party into the 2010 General Election. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservative Party winning the largest number of seats. Brown remained as Prime Minister while the Liberal Democrats entered separate negotiations with Labour and the Conservatives with a view to forming a coalition government. He announced his intention to resign on 10 May 2010 to help broker a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. However, this became increasingly unlikely and on 11 May, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labour Party.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dither</b> {{signals are}} {{commonly}} used for compensating nonlinearities in feedback systems in electronics and mechanics. The seminal works by Zames and Shneydor and more recently by Mossaheb present rigorous tools for systematic design of <b>dithered</b> systems. Their results rely however on a Lipschitz assumption on the nonlinearity and thus do not cover important applications with discontinuities. The aim of this thesis is to provide some ideas and tools on how to analyse and design <b>dither</b> in nonsmooth systems. In particular, it is shown that a <b>dithered</b> relay feedback system can be approximated by a smoothed system. Guidelines are given for tuning the amplitude and the period time of the <b>dither</b> signal, in order to stabilize the nonsmooth system. Stability results based on Popov-like and Zames-Falb criteria jointly with some Linear Matrix Inequalities are proposed. Moreover {{it is argued that}} in <b>dithered</b> relay feedback systems the shape of <b>dither</b> signals is relevant for stabilization. Some peculiar behaviours of relay feedback systems <b>dithered</b> with a particular class of <b>dither</b> signals are presented. When the <b>dither</b> signal is a square wave, the <b>dithered</b> system can exhibit an asymmetric periodic orbit, though the smoothed system is asymptotically stable. We even show an example in which, by using a trapezoidal <b>dither</b> signal, both systems have a stable oscillation, but the period time for the oscillation of the smoothed system is different from the one of the <b>dithered</b> system. Finally some engineering applications are presented in order to show the usefulness of techniques and results discussed in the thesis.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a maximum {{likelihood}} technique to combat amplitude scaling attacks within a quantizationbased watermarking context.

First we derive the probability density function of the watermarked and attacked data in the absence of subtractive <b>dither.</b> Next we extend these models to incorporate subtractive <b>dither</b> in the encoder. The <b>dither</b> sequence is primarily used for security purposes, and the <b>dither</b> is assumed to be known also to the decoder. We design the <b>dither</b> signal statistics such that an attacker having no knowledge of the <b>dither</b> cannot decode the watermark. Using an approximation of the probability density function in the presence of subtractive <b>dither,</b> we derive a maximum likelihood procedure for estimating amplitude scaling factors.
