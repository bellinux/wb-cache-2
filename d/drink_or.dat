5|$|High {{states that}} {{afterward}} Skaði {{went back up}} to the mountains to Þrymheimr and recites a stanza where Skaði skis around, hunts animals with a bow, and lives in her fathers old house. Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr as the father of two beautiful and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja. In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, <b>drink,</b> <b>or</b> talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at, and, not looking forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.|$|E
5|$|Stark {{attributes}} {{the rise of}} the movement in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to several factors, chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy. Because patients often fared better without medical treatment, Christian Science prayer was favorable in comparison. Other factors included that the church retained cultural continuity with Christianity by stressing that it was Christian and adopting its terms, despite the new content Eddy introduced. It was not puritanical. Members were expected not to <b>drink</b> <b>or</b> smoke, but could otherwise do as they pleased, and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted.|$|E
5|$|These events trouble Mac Da Thó greatly, {{such that}} he goes three days without food, <b>drink</b> <b>or</b> sleep. However, his wife devises {{for him a}} plan – that he should give the dog to both parties and let them fight for it. Pleased by this scheme, Mac Da Thó takes each {{delegation}} aside in private, and intimates to both that he had awarded the hound to them after much deliberation. Unknowingly, both parties agreed separately that their people should come {{on the same day}} to a feast in Leinster to claim Ailbe formally.|$|E

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a <b>drink</b> <b>or</b> pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The male becomes broody {{after his}} mate starts laying, and {{may begin to}} {{incubate}} the eggs before the clutch is complete. From this time on, he does not eat, <b>drink,</b> <b>or</b> defecate, and stands only to turn the eggs, which he does about ten times a day. He develops a brood patch, a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the eggs. Over {{the course of the}} eight-week incubation period, he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest. As with many other Australian birds, such as the superb fairywren, infidelity is the norm for emus, despite the initial pair bond: once the male starts brooding, the female usually wanders off, and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests; thus, as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male, or even by either parent, as emus also exhibit brood parasitism.|$|E

25|$|Sugar-sweetened drinks {{have also}} been speculated to cause weight gain in adults. In one study, {{overweight}} individuals consumed a daily supplement of sucrose-sweetened <b>or</b> artificially sweetened <b>drinks</b> <b>or</b> foods for a 10-week period. Most of the supplement was {{in the form of}} soft drinks. Individuals in the sucrose group gained 1.6kg, and individuals in the artificial-sweetener group lost 1.0kg. A two-week study had participants supplement their diet with sugar-sweetened soft drinks, artificially sweetened soft <b>drinks,</b> <b>or</b> neither. Although the participants gained the most weight when consuming the sugar-sweetened drinks, some of the differences were unreliable: the differences between men who consumed sugar-sweetened <b>drinks</b> <b>or</b> no <b>drinks</b> was not statistically significant.|$|R
