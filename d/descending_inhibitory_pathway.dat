40|$|In the extrinsically denervated {{smooth muscle}} {{esophagus}} of the hen anesthetized with urethane (1 g/kg, i. m.), it was studied whether peptidergic neurons in the intramural plexus {{are involved in}} the intrinsic reflex. Ascending and descending contractions, and descending relaxation were induced by electrical stimulation of a narrow segment of the esophagus. Naloxone (1 microM), desensitization to substance P (0. 3 microM) and spantide (20 microM) inhibited the ascending and descending contractions, respectively. The degree of the inhibition of the contractile response by a combination of naloxone and substance P was nearly the same as that by a single administration of naloxone or substance P. The ascending and descending contractions were reduced to one-third of the control by hexamethonium (100 microM) and abolished by atropine (10 microM). The descending relaxation was abolished after desensitization to vasoactive intestinal peptide (0. 3 microM). Taken together the results suggest that in the hen's esophagus, opioid- and substance P-containing neurons in the intramural plexus may act as preganglionic neurons of cholinergic motor neurons in the ascending and descending excitatory pathways and that vasoactive intestinal peptide-containing neurons {{are involved in the}} <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is {{involved}} in the central regulation of nociceptive transmission by affecting the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway.</b> In the present study, we have addressed the functional role of presynaptic glycine receptors in spontaneous glutamatergic transmission. Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were recorded in mechanically dissociated rat PAG neurons using a conventional whole-cell patch recording technique under voltage-clamp conditions. The application of glycine (100 [*]µM) significantly increased the frequency of sEPSCs, without affecting the amplitude of sEPSCs. The glycine-induced increase in sEPSC frequency was blocked by 1 [*]µM strychnine, a specific glycine receptor antagonist. The results suggest that glycine acts on presynaptic glycine receptors to increase the probability of glutamate release from excitatory nerve terminals. The glycine-induced increase in sEPSC frequency completely disappeared either in the presence of tetrodotoxin or Cd 2 +, voltage-gated Na+, or Ca 2 + channel blockers, suggesting that the activation of presynaptic glycine receptors might depolarize excitatory nerve terminals. The present results suggest that presynaptic glycine receptors can regulate the excitability of PAG neurons by enhancing glutamatergic transmission and therefore {{play an important role in}} the regulation of various physiological functions mediated by the PAG...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{etiology}} of neural blockrelated transient neurological sequelae following spinal anesthesia, such as transient neurological symptoms (TNS) and less serious sensory disturbances, is still unclear, previous reports have described the facilitation of ascending nociceptive pathways {{as the source of}} complications resulting from local anesthetic toxicity, needle trauma, and patient positioning. We hypothesized that, in addition to the facilitation of ascending nociceptive pathways, the intrathecal injection of local anesthetics might interrupt <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways,</b> leading to hypersensitivity. To test this hypothesis, changes in tail flick (TF) latency were evaluated under lidocaine blockade of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> at the thoracic spinal cord level and under lumbar intrathecal lidocaine injection in rats. Furthermore, the effects of lumbar intrathecal lidocaine injection on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neurotransmitters related to nociceptive transmission were investigated. The results revealed that thoracic intrathecal lidocaine shortened TF latency immediately after injection, while lumbar intrathecal lidocaine injection initially prolonged TF latency to the cut-off point and subsequently reduced TF latency compared to the baseline. Lumbar intrathecal lidocaine caused a significant reduction in norepinephrine concentrations in the CSF. These results indicate that the reduction of TF latency following lumbar intrathecal lidocaine injection was caused by the suppression of nor adrenergic <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways.</b> We concluded that the enhanced activity of dorsal horn neurons due to the suppression of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> by intrathecal lidocaine injection is one of the possible mechanisms of transient neurological sequelae...|$|R

We examine neural activity associated with fibromyalgia (N = 44) and compare these with healthy controls (N = 44) using resting state source localized EEG. Our data support an important role of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex but also suggest that the degree of activation and the degree of integration between different brain areas is important. The inhibition of the connectivity between the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex on the pain inhibitory pathway seems to be limited by decreased functional connectivity with the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex.

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanism}} of acupuncture analgesia (AA) {{has been widely}} explored since the 1970 s. Early studies investigated the relationship between acupuncture and endogenous opi-ates (β-endorphin, enkephalin, endomorphin and dynorphin). Before the 1990 s, most experts agreed on the concept that in normal animal models, lower frequency electroacupuncture (EA) stimulates the release of β-endorphin, enkephalin and endomorphin, which in turn activates the µ- and δ-opioid receptors, and that higher frequency EA stimulates dynorphin which activates the κ-opioid receptor. Besides endogenous opiates, our {{studies have focused on}} serotonin. The serotoninergic <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> is suggested to be an important {{mechanism of}} acupuncture analgesic, collaborating with endogenous opiates. Many efforts have been made to clarify these mechanisms, but to date no satisfactory consensus has been reached. In the late 1990 s, researchers began to focus on the different analgesic effects of EA between normal and hyperalgesic animal models. Published data from these studies imply that normal and hyper-algesic animals respond differently to EA. Results from experiments on the anti-hyperalgesia effect of EA have raised a new issue about the influences of EA on receptors to excitatory amino acid in the spinal cord level. Results from various studies have shown that these receptors pla...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{nature of}} {{synaptic}} transmission at functionally distinct synapses in intestinal reflex pathways {{has not been}} fully identified. In this study, we investigated whether transmission between interneurons in the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> is mediated by a purine acting at P 2 Y receptors to produce slow excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs). Methodology/Principal findings: Myenteric neurons from guinea-pig ileum in vitro were impaled with intracellular microelectrodes. Responses to distension 15 mm oral to the recording site, in a separately perfused stimulation chamber and to electrical stimulation of local nerve trunks were recorded. A subset of neurons, previously identified as nitric oxide synthase immunoreactive descending interneurons, responded to both stimuli with slow EPSPs that were reversibly abolished by {{a high concentration of}} PPADS (30 mM, P 2 receptor antagonist). When added to the central chamber of a three chambered organ bath, PPADS concentration-dependently depressed transmission through that chamber of descending inhibitory reflexes, measured as inhibitory junction potentials in the circular muscle of the anal chamber. Reflexes evoked by distension in the central chamber were unaffected. A similar depression of transmission was seen when the specific P 2 Y 1 receptor antagonist MRS 2179 (10 mM) was in the central chamber. Blocking either nicotinic receptors (hexamethonium 200 mM) or 5 -HT 3 receptors (granisetron 1 mM) together with P 2 receptors had no greater effect than blocking P 2 receptors alone...|$|E

40|$|The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is {{involved}} in many gonadal steroid-sensitive behaviors, including responsiveness to pain. The PAG projects to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), comprising the primary circuit driving pain inhibition. Morphine administered systemically or directly into the PAG produces greater analgesia in male compared to female rats, while manipulation of gonadal hormones alters morphine potency in both sexes. It is unknown if these alterations are due to steroidal actions on PAG neurons projecting to the RVM. The expression of androgen (AR) and estrogen (ERα) receptors in the PAG of female rats and within this <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> in both sexes is unknown. The present study used immunohistochemical techniques (1) to map the distribution of AR and ERα across the rostrocaudal axis of the PAG; and (2) to determine whether AR and/or ERα were colocalized on PAG neurons projecting to the RVM in male and female rats. AR and ERα immunoreactive neurons (AR-IR, ERα-IR) were densely distributed within the caudal PAG of male rats, with the majority localized in the lateral/ventrolateral PAG. Females had significantly fewer AR-IR neurons, while the quantity of ERα was comparable between thesexes. In both sexes, approximately 25 - 50 % of AR-IR neurons and 20 - 50 % of ERα-IR neurons were retrogradely labeled.

40|$|Stimulation of nociceptors by {{intradermal}} capsaicin produces {{depression of}} bradykinin (BK) -induced synovial plasma extravasation (PE) that is markedly enhanced by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. This depression is {{mediated by the}} adrenal medullae, a propriospinal pathway between the afferent nociceptive input and preganglionic neurones projecting to the adrenal medullae, and a spino-bulbo-spinal pathway. Here we investigated the role of spinal ascending and descending pathways in the interaction between noxious and vagal afferent inputs, leading to inhibition of BK-induced PE mediated by the adrenal medullae. Nociceptors in the paw were activated by capsaicin and depression of BK-induced PE was measured in rats with intact or cut subdiaphragmatic vagus nerves. After cutting the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) contralateral to the stimulated hindpaw (segmental level C 5 /C 6 and T 8 /T 9), depression of BK-induced PE was weak or absent both in rats with intact vagus nerves and in vagotomised rats, suggesting that an ascending excitatory pathway was interrupted. After cutting the DLF ipsilateral to the stimulated hindpaw, depression of BK-induced PE was already markedly enhanced, {{even in the absence}} of vagotomy. Ipsilateral DLF lesion (L 2 /L 3) below the level of the spinal output to the adrenal medullae produced the same effect, suggesting interruption of a <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> that relays the effect of vagal activity to the level of the capsaicin-induced nociceptive input. Contralateral and ipsilateral hemisection of the spinal cord (C 5 /C 6) produced the same changes as the corresponding DLF lesions. Ipsi- or contralateral lesion of the dorsal funiculus at the spinal level T 8 /T 9 had no effect on depression of BK-induced PE generated by cutaneous noxious stimulation of the forepaw. We suggest that noxious stimulation activates an ascending pathway of the spino-bulbo-spinal excitatory circuit which projects through the DLF contralateral to the nociceptive input, and that the inhibitory pathway which is activated by vagal afferent activity projects through the DLF ipsilateral to the nociceptive input...|$|E
40|$|Morphine is {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} opiate for alleviation of persistent pain; however, {{it is becoming increasingly}} clear that morphine is less potent in women compared to men. Morphine primarily binds mu opioid receptors, which are densely localized in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). Anatomical and physiological studies conducted in the 1960 s identified the PAG, and its projections to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and spinal cord dorsal horn, as an essential neural circuit mediating opioid-based analgesia. Remarkably, the majority of studies since then were conducted in males with the implicit assumption that this circuit was the same in females; this is not the case. It is now well established that morphine produces greater analgesia in males compared to females {{in a wide range of}} vertebrates, however, the mechanism(s) driving this sex difference is not clear. Our recent studies indicate that two factors appear to be contributing to the sexually dimorphic effects of morphine. First, there are sex differences in the anatomy and physiology of the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> on which morphine acts to produce analgesia. Specifically, the projections from the PAG to the RVM are sexually dimorphic and activated to a greater degree by both inflammatory pain and systemic morphine in males. In the absence of pain, the PAG-RVM circuit is activated to a greater degree in males compared to females, while this activation steadily declines during the development of tolerance in males only. We also have evidence of a sexually dimorphic expression of mu opioid receptor within the PAG that appears to contribute to sex differences in morphine potency. Microinjection of morphine directly into the PAG produces significantly greater analgesia in males, indicating that the PAG is sufficient for eliciting this sexually dimorphic behavior. Furthermore, mu opioid receptor-expressing PAG neurons are necessary for eliciting a sexually dimorphic response to morphine as lesioning mu opioid receptor-expressing neurons attenuates analgesia in males only. Together, these data indicate that the PAG-RVM pathway and mu opioid receptor expression in the PAG is sexually dimorphic and provides a primary mechanism for sex differences in morphine potency...|$|E

30|$|Visceral {{sensation}} {{mechanisms and}} pathways have been extensively reviewed by others [11]. Communication of sensory nerves responsive to noxious stimuli (chemical, mechanical, or inflammatory) {{with the central}} nervous system occurs via vagal, pelvic, and splanchnic nerve pathways [11, 12]. Splanchnic and pelvic nerve signals are transmitted via spinal visceral afferents to the spinal dorsal horn where they subsequently communicate to the brain via several ascending pathways including the spinothalamic, spinoreticular, and spinomesencephalic tracts. <b>Descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> influence visceral sensation by modulating (gating) the ascending visceral afferent pathways [12]. Visceral sensation processing is further modulated by mediators and receptors including neurotransmitter receptors, cannabinoid receptors, opioid receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, glutamate receptors, glucocorticoid receptors, inflammatory receptors, and ion channel receptors [11]. Additional psychological factors such as attention/distraction, expectations of pain, emotion, stress, and coping strategies also play a role (Fig.  1).|$|R
30|$|Although CEH is the {{headache}} we best understand, the SMT {{mechanism of action}} is unknown.

40|$|Background/Aims: Hypersensitive pain {{response}} is often observed {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the mechanisms responsible for hyperalgesia are not well understood. Chronic neuroinflammation {{is one of the}} hallmarks of PD pathophysiology. Since the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) is {{an important component of the}} <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway</b> controlling on central pain transmission, we examined the role for pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) system of PAG in regulating exaggerated pain evoked by PD. Methods: We used a rat model of PD to perform the experimental protocols. PD was induced by microinjection of 6 -hydroxydopamine to lesion the left medial forebrain bundle. Pain responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation were first examined in control rats and PD rats. Then, ELISA and Western Blot analysis were used to determine PIC levels and their receptors expression. Results: Protein expression of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α receptors (namely, IL- 1 R, IL- 6 R and TNFR subtype TNFR 1) in the plasma membrane PAG of PD rats was upregulated, whereas the total expression of PIC receptors was not significantly altered. The ratio of membrane protein and total protein (IL- 1 R, IL- 6 R and TNFR 1) was 1. 48 ± 0. 15, 1. 59 ± 0. 18 and 1. 67 ± 0. 16 in PAG of PD rats (P < 0. 05 vs. their respective controls). This was accompanied with increases of PICs of PAG, and decreases of GABA (623 ± 21 ng/mg in control rats and 418 ± 18 ng/mg in PD rats; P < 0. 05 vs. control rats) and withdrawal thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli. Our data further showed that the concentrations of GABA and withdrawal thresholds were largely restored by blocking those PIC receptors in PAG of PD rats. Stimulation of GABA receptors in PAG of PD rats also blunted a decrease in withdrawal thresholds. Conclusions: Our data suggest that upregulation of the membrane PIC receptor in the PAG of PD rats is likely to impair the descending inhibitory pathways in regulating pain transmission and thereby plays a role in the development of hypersensitive pain response in PD...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{knowledge}} {{identifies the}} prefrontal cortex (PFC) as the modulatory area for pain. Previous neuroimaging studies suggest {{the existence of}} the cortico-cortical pathway, an alternative pain modulatory pathway distinct from the descending modulatory pathway of pain. However, little is known of the extent, mechanism and underlying substrate of the modulation. The objective of this study is therefore to explore the role of the PFC in pain modulation. To examine the extent of PFC involvement in pain, meta-analyses of imaging studies in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic pain were performed. Using Gaussian-process regression (GPR) analysis, brain maps were produced from foci of activation as reported in the studies. Since structure dictates function, our next study was to performprobabilistic tractography on diffusion-weighted brain images to ascertain the connection probability of lateral PFC subdivisions and pain-related brain regions as well as intrinsic PFC connections. Two behavioural studies were conducted to investigate cognitive modulation of pain. The first was a study to assess the subjective and physiological correlates of cognitive stress, as previously used in stress-induced analgesia studies. The second was to investigate the involvement of the endogenous opioid system inthe cognitive modulation of pain through effortful reappraisal and contextual modulation. Meta-analyses in healthy volunteers and chronic pain patients revealed activation mainly in the lateral aspect of the PFC due to pain. Distinct pattern of activation was demonstrated in patients with significant ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) activation across subtypes of chronic pain. Probabilistic tractography further illustrate the functional significance of lateral PFC subdivisions by demonstrating differential connection probability to pain-related brain regions; dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) regions displayed higher connection probability with brain regions serving more sensory-discriminative function while VLPFC showed high connection probability with both sensory-discriminative and affective regions. Behavioural study of stress showed that cognitive stress failed to induce significant increases in biomarkers of stress, and was not affected by increased level of difficulty. Lastly, behavioural study on contextual modulation and reappraisal confirmed opioid mediation for contextual modulation while negating its involvement in effortful reappraisal. Findings from this studyillustrate the extent of PFC involvement in pain modulation especially in chronic pain patients and provide further evidence of an alternative pathway distinct from the opioid-mediated <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathway.</b> This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E

40|$|The mechanism(s) of {{analgesic}} action of paracetamol (acetaminophen; N-acetyl-p-aminophenol) remains controversial. Previous studies on rats {{suggested that the}} antinociceptive action of paracetamol might involve the central <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> pain <b>pathways</b> recruiting both a serotoninergic and an opioidergic system. This study explores this issue in mice using paroxetine, the most potent selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and the nonselective opioid pure antagonist naloxone. Animals {{were divided into two}} main groups for two separate experiments, each subdivided into 3 subgroups. In both experiments; the first group served as control, the second group received paracetamol (200 mg/kg, i. p).

In the other experiment, animals of the third group were pretreated with naloxone (5 mg/kg, i. p) 30 min before paracetamol. The antinociceptive effect of paracetamol was tested using the hot plate test. Paracetamol displayed a significant antinociceptive activity that was augmented by pretreatment with paroxetine as was shown by maintenance of its effect beyond that shown by paracetamol alone. On the other hand, pretreatment with naloxone abolished paracetamol’s antinociceptive activity in the hot-plate test.

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} occipital (OC) or retrosplenial (RSC) cortex produces antinociception in the rat tail-flick test. These cortices send inputs to the anterior pretectal nucleus (APtN) which is implicated in antinociception and nociception. At least muscarinic cholinergic, opioid, and serotonergic mechanisms in the APtN are involved in stimulation-produced antinociception (SPA) from the nucleus. In this study, the injection of 2 % lidocaine (. 25 mu L) or methysergide (40 and 80 ng/. 25 mu L) into the APtN reduced the duration but did not change the intensity of SPA from the OC, whereas both duration and intensity of SPA from the RSC were significantly reduced in rats treated with lidocaine or naloxone (10 and 50 ng/. 25 mu L), injected into the ANN. Naloxone or methysegide injected into the APtN was ineffective against SPA from the OC or RSC, respectively. Atropine (100 ng/. 25 mu L) injected into the ANN was ineffective against SPA from either the OC or RSC. We conclude that the APtN acts as an intermediary for separate <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> activated from the OC and RSC, utilizing at least serotonin and endogenous opioid as mediators in the nucleus. Perspective: Stimulation-induced antinociception from the retrosplenial or occipital cortex in the rat tail-flick test depends on the activation of separate <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> that utilize the APtN as a relay station.

40|$|Abstract Background Diffuse noxious {{inhibitory}} controls (DNIC) can {{be produced}} by different types of conditioning stimuli, but the analgesic properties and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to differentiate the induction of DNIC analgesia between noxious electrical and inflammatory conditioning stimuli. Methods First, rats subjected to either a supramaximal electrical stimulation or an injection of high-dose formalin in the hind limb were identified to have pain responses with behavioral evidence and spinal Fos-immunoreactive profiles. Second, suppression of tail-flick latencies by the two noxious stimuli was assessed to confirm the presence of DNIC. Third, an opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone) and an α 2 -adrenoreceptor antagonist (yohimbine) were injected, intraperitoneally and intrathecally respectively, before conditioning noxious stimuli to test the involvement of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> in DNIC-mediated analgesia. Results An intramuscular injection of 100 μl of 5 % formalin produced noxious behaviors with cumulative pain scores similar to those of 50 μl of 2 % formalin in the paw. Both electrical and chemical stimulation significantly increased Fos expression in the superficial dorsal horns, but possessed characteristic distribution patterns individually. Both conditioning stimuli prolonged the tail-flick latencies indicating a DNIC response. However, the electrical stimulation-induced DNIC was reversed by yohimbine, but not by naloxone; whereas noxious formalin-induced analgesia was both naloxone- and yohimbine-reversible. Conclusions It is demonstrated that DNIC produced by different types of conditioning stimuli can be mediated by different <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> controls, indicating the organization within the central nervous circuit is complex and possibly exhibits particular clinical manifestations. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{inferior}} colliculus (IC) {{together with the}} dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), the amygdala and the medial hypothalamus make {{part of the brain}} aversion system, which has mainly been related to the organization of unconditioned fear. However, the involvement of the IC and dPAG in the conditioned fear is still unclear. It is certain that GABA has a regulatory role on the aversive states generated and elaborated in these midbrain structures. In this study, we evaluated the effects of injections of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol (1. 0 and 2. 0 nmol/ 0. 2 mu L) into the IC or dPAG on the freezing and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) responses of rats submitted to a context fear conditioning. Intra-IC injections of muscimol did not cause any significant effect on the FPS or conditioned freezing but enhanced the startle reflex in non-conditioned animals. In contrast, intra-dPAG injections of muscimol caused significant reduction in FPS and conditioned freezing without changing the startle reflex in non-conditioned animals. Thus, intra-dPAG injections of muscimol produced the expected inhibitory effects on the anxiety-related responses, the FPS and the freezing whereas these injections into the IC produced quite opposite effects suggesting that <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> from the IC, probably mediated by GABA-A mechanisms, exert a regulatory role on the lower brainstem circuits responsible for the startle reflex.

40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} causes {{debilitating}} cardiovascular disturbances. The etiology of these disturbances remains obscure, {{partly because the}} locations of spinal cord pathways important for sympathetic control of cardiovascular function have not been thoroughly studied. To elucidate these pathways, we examined regions of the thoracic spinal cord important for reflex sympathetic control of arterial pressure (AP). In anesthetized rats, baroreceptor relationships between pharmacologically induced changes in AP and changes in left renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were generated in spinally intact rats and after acute surgical hemisection of either the dorsal, left, or right T 8 spinal cord. None of these individual spinal lesions prevented the baroreceptor-mediated increases in RSNA caused by decreases in AP. Thus, baroreceptor-mediated increases in RSNA in rats are mediated by relatively diffuse, bilateral, descending, excitatory projections. The ability to reduce RSNA at increased AP was impaired after both dorsal and left hemisections, and baroreceptor gain was significantly decreased. Baroreceptor-induced maximum decreases in RSNA were not affected by right hemisections. However, baroreflex gain was impaired. Because both dorsal and left hemisections, but not right hemisections, attenuated the decrease in RSNA at elevated AP, we conclude that pathways involved in the tonic inhibition of spinal sources of sympathetic activity descend ipsilaterally in the dorsal spinal cord. Our results show that many lesions that do not fully transect the spinal cord spare portions of both descending excitatory pathways that may prevent orthostatic hypotension and <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> that {{reduce the incidence of}} autonomic dysreflexia...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{findings}} that spinal manual therapy (SMT) produces concurrent hypoalgesic and sympathoexcitatory effects {{have led to}} the proposal that SMT may exert its initial effects by activating <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> from the dorsal periaqueductal gray area of the midbrain (dPAG). In addition to hypoalgesic and sympathoexcitatory effects, stimulation of the dPAG in animals has been shown to hal e a facilitatory effect on motor activity. This study sought to further investigate the proposal regarding SMT and the FAG by including a test of motor function in addition to the variables previously investigated, Using a condition randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, repeated measures design, 30 subjects with mid to lon er cervical spine pain of insidious onset participated in the study. The results indicated that the cervical mobilisation technique produced a hypoalgesic effect as revealed by increased pressure pain thresholds on the side of treatment (P = 0. 0001) and decreased resting visual analogue scale scores (P = 0. 049). The treatment technique also produced a sympathoexcitatory effect with an increase in skin conductance (P < 0. 002) and a decrease in skin temperature (P = < 0. 02). There was a decrease in superficial neck flexor muscle activity (P < 0. 0002) at the lower levels of a staged cranio-cervical flexion test. This could imply facilitation of the deep neck flexor muscles with a decreased need for co-activation of the superficial neck flexors, The combination of all findings,would support the proposal that SMT may, at least initially, exert part of its influence via activation of the PAG, (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Several {{investigators}} have coupled toxins to neuropeptides {{for the purpose}} of lesioning specific neurons in the central nervous system. By producing deficits in function these toxin conjugates have yielded valuable information about the role of these cells. In an effort to specifically stimulate cells rather than kill them we have conjugated the neuropeptide substance P to the catalytic subunit of cholera toxin (SP-CTA). This conjugate should be taken up selectively by neurokinin receptor expressing neurons resulting in enhanced adenylate cyclase activity and neuronal firing. Results The conjugate SP-CTA stimulates adenylate cyclase in cultured cells that are transfected with either the NK 1 or NK 2 receptor, but not the NK 3 receptor. We further demonstrate that intrathecal injection of SP-CTA in rats induces the phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and also enhances the expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos. Behaviorally, low doses of SP-CTA (1 μg) injected intrathecally produce thermal hyperalgesia. At higher doses (10 μg) peripheral sensitivity is suppressed suggesting that <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> may be activated by the SP-CTA induced sensitization of spinal cord neurons. Conclusion The finding that stimulation of adenylate cyclase in neurokinin receptor expressing neurons in the spinal cord produces thermal hyperalgesia is consistent with the known actions of these neurons. These data demonstrate that cholera toxin can be targeted to specific cell types by coupling the catalytic subunit to a peptide agonist for a g-protein coupled receptor. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that SP-CTA {{can be used as a}} tool to study sensitization of central neurons in vivo in the absence of an injury. </p...|$|R
40|$|For over 30 years, {{scientists}} have been investigating the phenomenon of pain suppression upon exposure to unconditioned or conditioned stressful stimuli, commonly known as stress-induced analgesia. These studies have revealed that individual sensitivity to stress-induced analgesia can vary greatly and that this sensitivity is coupled to many different phenotypes including the degree of opioid sensitivity and startle response. Furthermore, stress-induced analgesia is influenced by age, gender, and prior experience to stressful, painful, or other environmental stimuli. Stress-induced analgesia is mediated by activation of the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> pain <b>pathway.</b> Pharmacological and neurochemical studies have demonstrated involvement {{of a large number}} of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. In particular, there are key roles for the endogenous opioid, monoamine, cannabinoid, Â¿-aminobutyric acid and glutamate systems. The study of stress-induced analgesia has enhanced our understanding of the fundamental physiology of pain and stress and can be a useful approach for uncovering new therapeutic targets for the treatment of pain and stress-related disorders.

40|$|Previous {{findings}} suggest that spinal manual therapy (SMT) {{has the ability to}} induce pain relief and increase sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. This is suggested to occur due to stimulation of the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways,</b> projecting from the dorsi periaqueductal gray (dPAG) matter of the midbrain. The current study investigated the effects of grade III posteroanterior mobilisations to three thoracic vertebrae, utilising pain pressure threshold (PPT) and SNS activity as measures. PPT was measured at T 4 only in order to compare the effects of mobilising a vertebra directly as well as above and below. 12 healthy male participants (age 77. 3 ± 11. 2 : height, 76. 6 cm ± 11. 3 : mass, 80. 9 kg ± 12. 5) took part in this randomised, repeated measures, cross-over design study. Results reflected an immediate hypoalgesic effect of spinal manual therapy, demonstrated through increased PPT, occurring concurrently alongside increased SNS measures of skin conductance (SC). PPT percentage change (PC) was higher in adjacent vertebrae in comparison to T 4, however a Friedman’s test revealed {{no significant difference between the}} three vertebrae mobilised (χ 22 = 3. 167, P = 0. 205). Therefore SMT demonstrated global effects as well as local. A 2 way repeated measures ANOVA deemed SC as significantly different from pre to post treatment in T 3 (t (11) = - 3. 381, p= 0. 006) and significant differences were noticed in HR over the same time period, in T 3 (t(11) = - 3. 381, p= 0. 006) and T 4 (t(11) = - 3. 643, p= 0. 004). However HR unexpectedly demonstrated a significant decrease. In summary, this study demonstrates immediate effects of SMT both locally and globally, utilising PPT and SNS activity as measures to justify this...|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain is {{believed}} to be related to a dysfunction of descending pain modulatory mechanisms. Functioning of descending pain modulation can be assessed by various methods, including conditioned pain modulation (CPM). CPM refers to the inhibition of one source of pain by a second noxious stimulus, termed the conditioning stimulus. This procedure can activate an endogenous pain inhibitory mechanism that inhibits early nociceptive processing. Chronic pain and anxiety disorders are more prevalent among females and it has been hypothesized that females react with more negative emotions towards unpleasant stimuli and this might be part of the explanation of greater pain sensitivity in females. The present study investigated whether expectations modulate the effect of conditioning stimulation on pain, subjective stress, and heart rate. In addition, we investigated whether the modulation of CPM by expectations differed between males and females. Seventy-two subjects (including 36 women) received six noxious heat stimuli to the forearm. During three of these stimuli, a conditioning stimulus (cold-water bath) was applied to the contralateral arm in order to activate CPM. One third of the subjects were told that this would reduce pain (analgesia group), one-third that it would increase pain (hyperalgesia group), and one third received no information about its effect (no info group). Information that conditioning stimulation decreased or enhanced pain had the corresponding effect in females, but not in males. Conditioning stimulation increased stress, but not heart rate in females in the hyperalgesia group. A higher expectation of analgesia and lower stress during conditioning stimulation was associated with larger inhibitory CPM. These results suggest that reduced inhibitory CPM can be due to contextually induced cognitive and emotional factors and not necessarily a dysfunction of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cough is {{typically}} associated with physical activity in children with asthma, but {{the characteristics of the}} relationship between cough and exercise has not been established under physiological conditions. The aim {{of the study was to}} describe the effect of exercise on the reflex cough response elicited by a single breath of capsaicin in non-asthmatic children. A group of non-asthmatic adults was studied as reference. Thirty children and 29 adults were recruited. The cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin was first determined to establish the dose that provokes 5 cough efforts (C 5). The number of coughs elicited by C 5 (NC 5) was then compared at baseline and during a standardized submaximal treadmill exercise. Data are expressed as median (interquartile range). Children and adults showed a significant decrease in NC 5 (respectively from 5. 0 (4. 0 – 6. 0) to 2. 5 (2. 0 – 4. 0), p < 0. 0005 and from 6. 0 (5. 0 – 7. 0) to 2. 0 (0. 0 – 3. 0, p < 0. 0005). During exercise, NC 5 was observed to decrease in all adult subjects, but in only 24 / 30 children (80 %, p = 0. 02). A trend for a higher incidence of personal and familial atopy was observed in children that lacked cough down-regulation during exercise compared with other children. It is concluded that the cough reflex response to capsaicin is down regulated by exercise in both children and adults. The effect however is less consistently observed in the former. The difference may reflect maturation of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways</b> of the cough reflex, but may also be associated to atopy. The data stress the importance of assessing the time relationship of cough and exercise in questionnaire studies of asthma...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} identified {{a population of}} mechanosensory myenteric S-interneurons in the distal colon of guinea-pigs. However, {{the role of the}} longitudinal (LM) and circular muscle (CM) in transducing these mechanosensory signals into enteric reflexes is unclear. In this study, we have investigated whether the LM or CM layer is necessary for activation of ascending excitatory and <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> neuronal <b>pathways</b> by static stretch of the paralysed isolated guinea-pig distal colon. Simultaneous intracellular recordings were made from pairs of CM cells at either end of isolated sheet preparations of distal colon that were devoid of mucosa and submucous plexus; and were maintained under circumferential stretch. In the presence of nifedipine (1 μm), an ongoing discharge of excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) and inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) were recorded simultaneously at the oral and anal ends of the preparation. When the LM was sharp dissected off the myenteric plexus, the synchronized discharge of ascending EJPs and descending IJPs in the CM layer was unaffected. In contrast, when the majority of CM was sharp dissected off the myenteric plexus, ongoing neural activity was absent, or substantially decreased in both the LM and CM. In these preparations, immunohistochemical staining, together with transmural electrical stimuli confirmed that the myenteric plexus was always present and intact in these preparations. When full-thickness strips of CM were removed from progressively longer lengths of myenteric plexus, a graded reduction in the correlation of coordinated oral EJPs and anal IJPs occurred. However, removing ∼ 40 % of the thickness of CM layer from the entire preparation did not significantly disrupt, nor reduce the degree of correlation between oral EJPs and anal IJPs, suggesting that critical sensory elements did not lie adjacent to the submucosal plexus. It is concluded that mechanosensory transmission that underlies repetitive firing of ascending excitatory and <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> neuronal <b>pathways</b> is critically dependent upon sensory elements within the CM layer. These elements are likely to activate stretch-sensitive interneurons in the myenteric plexus. No evidence was found to suggest that the connectivity between the LM and the myenteric plexus was required for mechanotransduction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Motor cortex {{stimulation}} (MCS) is {{an effective}} treatment in neuropathic pain refractory to pharmacological management. However, analgesia is not satisfactorily obtained in one third of patients. Given the importance of understanding the mechanisms to overcome therapeutic limitations, we addressed the question: what mechanisms can explain both MCS effectiveness and refractoriness? Considering the crucial role of spinal neuroimmune activation in neuropathic pain pathophysiology, we hypothesized that modulation of spinal astrocyte and microglia activity {{is one of the}} mechanisms of action of MCS. Methods Rats with peripheral neuropathy (chronic nerve injury model) underwent MCS and were evaluated with a nociceptive test. Following the test, these animals were divided into two groups: MCS-responsive and MCS-refractory. We also evaluated a group of neuropathic rats not stimulated and a group of sham-operated rats. Some assays included rats with peripheral neuropathy that were treated with AM 251 (a cannabinoid antagonist/inverse agonist) or saline before MCS. Finally, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of glial cells (microglia and astrocytes), cytokines (TNF-α and IL- 1 β), cannabinoid type 2 (CB 2), μ-opioid (MOR), and purinergic P 2 X 4 receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (DHSC). Findings MCS reversed mechanical hyperalgesia, inhibited astrocyte and microglial activity, decreased proinflammatory cytokine staining, enhanced CB 2 staining, and downregulated P 2 X 4 receptors in the DHSC ipsilateral to sciatic injury. Spinal MOR staining was also inhibited upon MCS. Pre-treatment with AM 251 blocked the effects of MCS, including the inhibitory mechanism on cells. Finally, MCS-refractory animals showed similar CB 2, but higher P 2 X 4 and MOR staining intensity in the DHSC in comparison to MCS-responsive rats. Conclusions These results indicate that MCS induces analgesia through a spinal anti-neuroinflammatory effect and the activation of the cannabinoid and opioid systems via <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways.</b> As a possible explanation for MCS refractoriness, we propose that CB 2 activation is compromised, leading to cannabinoid resistance and consequently to the perpetuation of neuroinflammation and opioid inefficacy.

40|$|Tramadol (T) is a {{centrally}} acting analgesic structurally {{related to}} codeine and morphine. This drug displays a weak affinity for the m and d-opioid receptors, and weaker affinity for the k-subtype; it also interferes with the neuronal release and reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline in the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>pathways.</b> The metabolism of this drug has been investigated in different animals (rats, mice, Syrian hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs) and humans; similar metabolites are produced but in different amounts. The major metabolic pathways involved in phase I metabolite production (M 1 M 5) are O-demethylation, N-demethylation, and N,N-demethylation. The aim {{of the current study}} is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of T in the horse, and its M 1, M 2, and M 5 metabolites after single-dose administration (5 mg/kg body weight [BW]) by intravenous, sustained-release tablets and immediate- release capsules. We also will investigate the potential effects of fasting and feeding on bioavailability of immediate-release capsules. The study design was divided into four randomized phases. Twenty-four gelding Italian trotter race horses were divided into four groups (6 animals each) and administered T intravenously, with T immediate-release capsules in a fasting status, T immediate-release capsules in a feeding status, and T sustained-release in fasting status. Blood samples were collected at different times and analyzed by highpressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorimetric detection. The limit of quantification was 5 ng/ml for T, M 1, and M 2, and 10 ng/ml for M 5. A one-compartment model best fit the plasma concentrations of T and M 2 after all treatments. Unfortunately, for M 1 and M 5, it was not always possible to fit plasma curves because of very low and variable concentrations. M 2 was the main metabolite produced in the four different treatments and its concentration was higher than the concentration of T after sustained-release administration. Conversely, M 1, the main metabolite in humans, and M 5 seemed to be only marginally produced in the horse. When T was administered in both fasted and fed states, variations in some pharmacokinetic parameters were not considered clinically significant. We concluded that T could be administered in either a fasted or a fed condition...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{intracellular}} recordings {{were made}} from myenteric neurons and circular muscle (CM) cells in isolated, stretched segments of guinea-pig distal colon. We have shown previously that maintained stretch generates a repetitive and coordinated discharge of ascending excitatory and <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> neuronal reflex <b>pathways</b> in the distal colon. In the presence of nifedipine (1 – 2 μm) to paralyse the muscle, simultaneous recordings {{were made from}} 25 pairs of AH (after-hyperpolarization) -neurons and CM cells separated by 100 – 500 μm. In all 25 AH-neurons, proximal process potentials (PPPs) were never recorded, even though at the same time, all recordings from neighbouring CM cells showed an ongoing discharge of inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) anally, or excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) orally. In fact, 24 of 25 AH-neurons were totally silent, while in one AH-cell, some spontaneous fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (FEPSPs) were recorded. All 10 electrically silent AH-cells that were injected with neurobiotin {{were found to be}} multipolar Dogiel type II neurons. In contrast, when recordings were made from myenteric S-neurons, two distinct electrical patterns of electrical activity were recorded. Recordings from 25 of 48 S-neurons showed spontaneous FEPSPs, the majority of which (22 of 25) showed periods when discrete clusters of FEPSPs (mean duration 88 ms) could be temporally correlated with the onset of EJPs or anal IJPs in the CM. Nine S-neurons were electrically quiescent. The second distinct electrical pattern in 14 S-neurons consisted of bursts, or prolonged trains of action potentials, which could be reduced to proximal process potentials (PPPs) in six of these 14 neurons during membrane hyperpolarization. Unlike FEPSPs, PPPs were resistant to a low Ca 2 + –high Mg 2 + solution and did not change in amplitude during hyperpolarizing pulses. Mechanosensory S-neurons were found to be uniaxonal or pseudounipolar filamentous neurons, with morphologies consistent with interneurons. No slow EPSPs were ever recorded from AH- or S-type neurons when IJPs or EJPs occurred in the CM. In summary, we have identified a population of mechanosensory S-neurons in the myenteric plexus of the distal colon which appear to be largely stretch sensitive, rather than muscle-tension sensitive, since they generate ongoing trains of action potentials in the presence of nifedipine. No evidence was found to suggest that in paralysed preparations, the repetitive firing in ascending excitatory or <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> nerve <b>pathways</b> was initiated by myenteric AH-neurons, or slow synaptic transmission...|$|R
