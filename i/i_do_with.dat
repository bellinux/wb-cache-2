500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. Now that I have a franchise, what do <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 23 February, Missouri and Wisconsin turned their big guns on Kuwait's Faylaka Island to support the US-led {{coalition}} ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a diversionary assault aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion. As part of this attack, Missouri and Wisconsin were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after Missouri completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, Wisconsin, while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her [...] guns. As Wisconsins drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would {{know that they were}} once again being targeted by a battleship. Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneer’s distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of Missouris artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to surrender by waving makeshift white flags, an action dutifully noted aboard Wisconsin. Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drone’s aircrew called Wisconsins commanding officer, Captain David S. Bill III, and asked, [...] "Sir, they want to surrender, what should <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> them?" [...] This surrender to Wisconsins Pioneer has since {{become one of the most}} remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship. Wisconsin drone also carried out a number of reconnaissance missions on occupied Kuwait before the coalition's ground offensive.|$|E

2500|$|Fortunately for Foote, some highly placed {{friends at}} court helped the theatre reopen {{and the play}} continued. In June, Foote offered A Cup of Tea, a {{revision}} of his revue, Diversions, again {{in the guise of}} a culinary offering. After a brief trip to Paris, Foote opened The Auction of Pictures which satirized satirist Henry Fielding. A war of wit was launched with each lambasting the other in ink and onstage. Among the verbal missiles hurled, Fielding denounced Foote in The Jacobite's Journal saying [...] "you Samuel Fut [...] be pissed upon, with Scorn and Contempt, as a low Buffoon; and <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>with</b> the utmost Scorn and Contempt, piss on you accordingly." ...|$|E

Martin opened on Broadway in The Sound of Music as Maria on November 16, 1959 and stayed in the show until October 1961. She won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. The musical gave Martin [...] "the chance to display her homespun charm." [...] In 1966, she appeared on Broadway in the two-person musical I Do! <b>I</b> <b>Do!</b> <b>with</b> Robert Preston and was nominated for the Tony Award (Leading Actress in a Musical).

Where can I put them?". On leaving the room, Brand reported, his military escort had told him that the man who had made that remark was Lord Moyne. Brand then added:'I later learnt that Lord Moyne had often deplored the tragic fate of the Jews. The policy which he had to follow, however, was one dictated by a cold and impersonal administration in London. It may be that he paid with his life for the guilt of others.' ...|$|E

2500|$|The Americans {{inhabited}} {{neighborhoods of}} Port-au-Prince in houses {{that the majority}} of Haitians could only dream of. This neighborhood was called the “millionaires' row.” Hans Schmidt recounted a navy officer's opinion on the matter of segregation: “I can't see why they wouldn't have a better time with their crowd, just as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> mine." [...] American racial intolerance provoked indignation and resentment – and eventually a racial pride that was reflected in the work {{of a new generation of}} Haitian historians, ethnologists, writers, artists, and others. Many of these later became active in politics and government. The elite Haitians, who were mostly mixed race with higher levels of education and capital, continued to dominate the country's bureaucracy and to strengthen its role in national affairs.|$|E

2500|$|Brand {{told this}} story to the Kastner libel trial in 1953, but in his {{autobiography}} published in 1956, he added a caveat [...] "I afterwards heard that the man with whom I spoke was not, in fact, Lord Moyne, but another British statesman. Unfortunately I have no means of verifying this." [...] Brand later testified in the Eichmann trial in 1961 that it was Moyne who said [...] "What shall <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> those million Jews?" [...] The story of the remark, attributed to Moyne, is regularly quoted by historians. Historian Bernard Wasserstein believes that [...] "the truth is that Brand almost certainly never met Moyne". This is supported by Shlomo Aronson, who traces the remark to a comment made {{by the head of}} the Refugee Section of the Foreign Office, Alec Randall, which was later repeated by Moshe Shertok at a meeting which Brand attended.|$|E

2500|$|While it {{had been}} {{acceptable}} prior to {{the turn of the}} 20th century for Canadian governors general to involve themselves in political affairs, being, as they were, representatives of the King in his British Council, Byng's tenure as viceroy of Canada was notable in that he became the first to step directly into political matters since the country had gained a degree of autonomy in the British Empire following the First World War: in the summer of 1926 he denied the recommendation of his prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who sought to have parliament dissolved in order to avoid a vote of non-confidence in his government. The Governor General's course of action in what came to be colloquially known as the King–Byng Affair remains debated, though the consensus amongst constitutional historians is that Byng's moves were appropriate under the circumstances. Mackenzie King, however, made much of the scenario and its outcome in the election that eventually followed on 14 September, in which King's Liberal Party won a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, while Meighen lost his seat. As a result, King was once again appointed prime minister. At the 1926 Imperial Conference, King then went on to use Byng and his refusal to follow his prime minister's advice as the impetus for widespread constitutional change throughout the British Commonwealth. Byng himself said of the matter: [...] "I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the season}} 8 finale, [...] "The Commitment Determination", Sheldon and Amy {{get into a}} fight over their {{definition}} of [...] "commitment". [...] Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has {{decided to take a}} break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. [...] He glumly turns to his Gollum figurine and asks it, [...] "Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings, what do <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> this one?", while simultaneously taking his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom, out of this desk drawer. In the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In [...] "The Earworm Reverberation", Sheldon can't get a song out his head but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that Amy changed his life for the better and then goes to her apartment to profess his love, at which time Amy reciprocates. [...] Amy's date that night was Dave, who has great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect; after seeing how much they love each other, Dave urges Sheldon to kiss Amy. [...] In the following episode, [...] "The Opening Night Excitation" [...] Leonard, Wolowitz and Raj go to see [...] without Sheldon as he has somewhat reluctantly opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. [...] As Amy made Sheldon's birthday party enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate. [...] He tells them that he has narrowed things down to 3 options, the first being a chance to play the harp with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the second being an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's ornithophobia is nothing compares to his Ovinophobia, the fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in coitus, at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. In the tenth season, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility. Afterwards, they decide to move in together permanently. In the final episode of the season, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki; the eleventh season premiere was basically a continuation of this, and Amy accepts his proposal.|$|E
