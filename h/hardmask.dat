For most of these applications, PDMS is processed by replication molding; however, new applications would greatly benefit from the ability to pattern PDMS films using lithography and etching. Metal <b>hardmasks,</b> in conjunction with reactive ion etching (RIE), have been reported as a method for patterning PDMS; however, this approach suffers from a high surface roughness because of metal redeposition and limited etch thickness due to poor etch selectivity. We found that a combination of LOR and SU 8 photoresists enables the patterning of thick PDMS layers by RIE without redeposition problems. We demonstrate the ability to etch 1. 5 -μm pillars in PDMS with a selectivity of 3. 4. Furthermore, we use this process to lithographically process flexible fluidic microactuators without any manual transfer or cutting step. The actuator achieves a bidirectional rotation of 50 ° at a pressure of 200 [*]kPa. This process provides a unique opportunity to scale down these actuators as well as other PDMS-based devices.

A patternable low-κ dielectric material combines the functions of a traditional resist and a dielectric material into one single material. It acts as a traditional resist during patterning and is subsequently converted to a low-κ dielectric material during a post-patterning curing process. No sacrificial materials (separate resists or <b>hardmasks)</b> and their related deposition, pattern transfer (etch) and removal (strip) are required to form dual-damascene BEOL patterns.

With the continuously decreasing feature-size of integrated circuits, manufacturing tolerances are becoming increasingly smaller and complex interactions of plasmas and patterned mask materials require an atomistic understanding to meet future processing tolerances. In this work, we investigated how plasma-material interactions in typical low-k pattern transfer processes depend on individual plasma components and properties of polymeric and metallic masks. First, we studied modifications of 193 nm and 248 nm photoresist (PR) by plasma ultraviolet/vacuum ultraviolet (UV) radiation, quantifying contributions of plasma radiation to the overall material modifications for direct interaction with plasma. Energetic ions (~ 125 eV) led to rapid (~ 3 - 5 s) formation of a graphitic ion-crust (~ 1. 8 nm) and introduced together with simultaneous UV modifications of the material bulk significantly higher roughness for 193 nm PR (~ 6 nm) than for 248 nm PR (~ 1 nm). During ion-crust formation, 193 nm PR softened by chain-scissioning and pendant group detachment in a depth of ~ 60 nm by UV radiation, while 248 nm PR was radiation stable showing surface-close cross-linking (~ 4 nm). Pretreating 193 nm PR with a radiationdominated He plasma and introducing UV modifications before ion-crust formation in the subsequent plasma etch reduces synergistic roughness formation as explained by wrinkling theory. Second, we studied interactions of fluorocarbon (FC) plasmas with Ti and TiN and compared these with organosilicate glass (OSG). Metal <b>hardmasks</b> are expected to provide improved etching selectivity (ES) and low-k damage compared to PR during pattern transfer. Erosion stages and dependencies of etch rates (ER) on FC layer thickness and energy deposition by ions were identified. ES were low (~ 4 - 8) in the diffusion-limited regime (thick FC layers) where OSG experienced strong reduction in ER, but high (up to 15) in the chemical sputtering regime (thin FC layers) at low ion energies where removal of Ti etch products was limited. TiN exhibited higher ER and lower ES than Ti due to increased surface reactivity after rapid removal of N.
