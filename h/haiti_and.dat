This endeavor, however, proved unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The most {{influential}} {{figure in the}} promotion of Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group Exile One (based {{on the island of}} Guadeloupe) that featured mostly the cadence rampa of <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> calypso music from the English-speaking Caribbean. It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Alberto was {{indirectly}} {{responsible for}} two deaths when it made landfall in Florida. Hurricane Ernesto caused heavy rainfall in <b>Haiti,</b> <b>and</b> directly {{killed at least}} seven in <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> the United States. Four hurricanes formed after Ernesto, including the strongest storms of the season, Hurricanes Helene and Gordon. In total, the season was responsible for 14deaths and $500million (2006USD; $ USD) in damage. The calendar year 2006 also saw Tropical Storm Zeta, which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January, only the second such event on record. The storm {{can be considered a}} part of the 2005 and 2006 seasons, although it occurred outside the June 1 – November 30 period during which most Atlantic basin tropical cyclones form.|$|E

5|$|Although Gordon was a {{tropical}} storm {{for most of its}} existence, it caused enormous damage and loss of life. The United Nations estimated death toll in Haiti was 1,122. Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica, five in the Dominican Republic, two in Jamaica, two in Cuba, and eight in Florida. Property damage to the United States was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD). Property damage statistics for the other affected areas are not available, but were reportedly severe in both <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> Cuba.

5|$|As {{the revolutionary}} {{disturbances}} in, and friction between, <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> the Dominican Republic continued apace, De Soto {{returned to the}} West Indies in June, arriving at Port-au-Prince on the 19th. The steamer also patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico, {{with an eye on}} the unsettled conditions in Mexico, where a guerrilla war raged against the French occupation of the country.

5|$|At 18:00UTC on September24, when Edith {{intensified}} into a hurricane, hurricane warnings {{were issued}} from Guadeloupe to Saint Vincent, including Barbados. Gale warnings were also issued for areas north of Guadeloupe to Sint Maarten. As Edith approached Saint Lucia around 08:00UTC on September25, a hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The warnings and advice {{given by the}} San Juan Weather Bureau were credited for limiting damage and loss of life on Martinique. After Edith entered the Caribbean later on September25, the watch was spread to <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> the Dominican Republic, while gale warnings were issued for the south coast of Hispaniola, east of Santo Domingo, as well as Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands. At 08:00UTC on September26, hurricane warnings were issued for southern <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> southwestern Dominican Republic due to the impending threat. After Edith slowed and began a more northerly movement, a hurricane warning was issued for the eastern portion of the Dominican Republic and western Puerto Rico while the warning for western Hispaniola was discontinued at 02:00UTC on September27. Two hours later, the storm had weakened and {{it was evident that}} Edith would pass over the Dominican Republic. As a result, the hurricane warning for Puerto Rico was downgraded to a gale warning.|$|E

Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of the parasite have complicated control measures.|$|E
5|$|Bush also {{expressed}} U.S. {{support for the}} defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.|$|E
