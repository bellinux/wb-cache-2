5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the delegates}} {{turned to the}} vice presidency. Edmund Pettus, {{representing}} Alabama, moved the nomination of William Hayden English, a banker and former representative from Indiana. English, {{a member of the}} Indiana delegation, was fairly unknown to most delegates. He had been a Bayard enthusiast and was known as a successful businessman and <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> supporter; more crucially, he hailed from an important swing state. While Hendricks was a better-known representative of Indiana, Easterners in the party preferred English, who they saw as sounder on the money question. Several states seconded the nomination. John P. Irish of Iowa nominated former governor Richard M. Bishop of Ohio but, after all the other states expressed support for English, the Ohio delegation requested that Bishop's name be withdrawn and English's nomination made unanimous; the motion carried.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} {{concerned}} United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), {{a form of}} fiat currency first issued during the Civil War. The government accepted these notes as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold. The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single, gold-backed currency. Sherman agreed with Hayes's favorable opinion of the Act, and stockpiled gold {{in preparation for the}} exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> men and, as the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the 1837 suspension, the bank had over $1.5 million in federal deposits. Because of the {{nationwide}} suspension, the federal government was desperately short of <b>hard</b> <b>money.</b> Lanier personally delivered $80,000 in <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> to Levi Woodbury, the Secretary of the Treasury, knowing their situation. Because the bank {{was the only one in}} the nation that voluntarily gave <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> to the treasury, the treasury increased their deposit amount in the bank, further adding to its stability.|$|E
25|$|In 1832 President Andrew Jackson vetoed a bill {{to extend}} {{the charter of the}} Second Bank of the United States and removed federal deposits, forcing it to cease most {{operations}} by 1833 {{due to a lack of}} reserve cash. The result caused a shortage of <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> (coin) at a critical time in Indiana's development. The state had just begun a large series of internal improvements and was funding the projects with millions of dollars of loans. The sudden <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> shortage required the use of paper money to pay maintenance on the state's debt, but with the closure of the national bank there was no means by which the state could easily obtain paper money.|$|E

25|$|The Republican Party {{supported}} business generally, <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> (i.e.,the gold standard), high tariffs {{to promote}} economic growth, high wages and high profits, generous pensions for Union veterans, and (after1893) the annexation of Hawaii. The Republicans supported the pietistic Protestants who demanded Prohibition. As the northern post-bellum economy boomed with heavy and light industry, railroads, mines, fast-growing cities and prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and promoted policies {{to sustain the}} fast growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{bank was}} one of the most stable in the country and its {{banknotes}} were accepted throughout the Mississippi Valley and the Midwest. It only suspended exchange of paper money for <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> once, in 1837, when all the other banks in the nation did the same. The bank's coinage was almost exclusively silver, but it did contain a small amount of gold. It increased its gold holding significantly after the 1848 California Gold Rush led to more availability of gold, but silver remained the primary coin in circulation.|$|E
25|$|Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified {{geographically}} or ideologically. However, Whigs {{tended to}} favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, moral reform (such as the temperance movement), and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, <b>hard</b> <b>money,</b> and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery. The Whigs tended to control many newspapers, while Democrats were particularly adept at organizing the masses.|$|E

25|$|President Franklin Pierce {{recognized}} Guthrie's financial acumen {{and appointed}} him Secretary of the Treasury in 1853. Soon, {{he became the}} most influential member of Pierce's cabinet. A <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> Democrat, Guthrie was opposed to a national bank and to the issuance of small distinctive notes by free and charter banks. He advocated for {{the adoption of a}} universal currency that would be convertible to gold on demand. In his first report, he was critical of his predecessor, Thomas Corwin, because he made private arrangements for debt repurchases. He also accused Corwin of conspiring with a New York port master to under-report duties collected and deposit them into a trust. Guthrie caused a brief public uproar by removing the port master from his post.|$|E
25|$|The {{closure of}} the bank {{did not have any}} {{significant}} impact on the regional economy. The state bank notes were exchanged for federal bank notes or <b>hard</b> <b>money,</b> and the surplus of funds was paid out to the bank shareholders. In 1851 General John Coburn, a delegate at the constitutional convention, proposed that any profit the state made from the bank be applied to the state's common school system. At the time most delegate believed the bank would end with a debt and thought the suggestion was fanciful, but the clause was added to constitution. The state's share of the profit, which was more than $3.5 million, was put into an education fund which helped the state continue to maintain the first state funded school system in the nation.|$|E
25|$|Each branch had {{an initial}} {{investment}} of $160,000, at first {{there were only}} ten branches and the total bank's value was $1.6 million. The start up money was all <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> in Spanish and Mexican silver dollars. The money was raised by issuing stock sold at $50 per share. Half of the stock was to be purchased {{by the state and}} the other half was sold to the public. By May 20, 1834, all the public stock for the new bank had been issued. The state allowed the public stock to be sold at $18.75 per share, with the other $31.25 being financed on the state's credit, until the purchaser could pay the full amount back to the state with 6% interest. On August 6, the state completed its purchase of 50% of the bank's stock. The money to purchase the stock came through the sale and mortgage of thousands of acres of public land. On November 19 Governor Noah Noble declared the bank open for business.|$|E

25|$|However, these {{advantages}} held {{within them}} disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, {{there was nothing}} to stop issuing authorities from printing more of it than they had specie to back it with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding <b>hard</b> <b>money,</b> causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{office after}} an {{intensely}} disputed election, Hayes withdrew the last federal {{troops from the}} South, and ended the Reconstruction Era. He attempted to reconcile the divisions {{left over from the}} Civil War and Reconstruction while protecting the civil rights of African-Americans, but largely failed in the latter pursuit. A strong proponent of civil service reform, he challenged his own party in making appointments. Though he was largely unsuccessful in enacting long-term reform, he helped provide a significant impetus for the eventual passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883. He helped put down the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, one of the largest labor strikes in U.S. history, by sending in federal soldiers. Insisting that maintenance of the gold standard was essential to economic recovery, he vetoed the Bland–Allison Act, which would have put silver money into circulation and raised prices. Congress overrode his veto, but Hayes successfully passed the Specie Payment Resumption Act, creating a policy compromise between inflationists and advocates of <b>hard</b> <b>money.</b> His policy toward Western Native Americans anticipated the assimilationist program of the Dawes Act of 1887. In foreign policy, Hayes asserted U.S. influence in Latin America and the continuing primacy of the Monroe Doctrine. Polls of historians and political scientists generally rank Hayes as an average president.|$|E

500|$|Bayard's {{popularity}} with his party had grown {{during his time}} in the Senate, and by 1875 he was seen as a contender for the presidency. [...] His advocacy of <b>hard</b> <b>money</b> had won him friends in some of the Northern cities, and his stance against Reconstruction made him popular throughout the South. [...] Competing for those same factions of the Democratic party was New York governor Samuel J. Tilden, who had gained national fame for fighting the political corruption of William M. Tweed's Tammany Hall machine in New York City. [...] Other contenders included Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana and Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. [...] Tilden's wealth and national renown helped gather delegates to his cause, and in June 1876, he entered the convention with 404½ votes; Bayard placed fifth with 33.

[...] So bitter was the animosity between these two men that Hopkins commenced an action for slander against Ward, putting damages at £40,000.

500|$|From {{the start}} of his congressional career, Bayard was an {{advocate}} of <b>hard</b> <b>money,</b> i.e., a dollar backed by gold.

[...] These United States Notes, popularly known as [...] "greenbacks," [...] had helped to finance the war when the government's gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies. [...] When the crisis had passed, many in Congress (including Bayard) wanted to return the nation's currency to a gold standard as soon as possible. [...] The process of retiring the greenbacks had already begun when Bayard was elected, but stopped when many congressmen thought the fiscal contraction too severe, and likely to be harmful to the economy. [...] In 1869, Congress passed the Public Credit Act of 1869, which required that the government pay its bond holders in gold, not greenbacks. [...] Bayard thought the bill not strong enough, since it did not require removing greenbacks from circulation, and he voted against it.|$|E
