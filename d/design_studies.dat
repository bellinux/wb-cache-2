5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued <b>design</b> <b>studies</b> on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester's {{railway network}} {{historically}} suffered from poor north–south connections {{due to the}} fact that Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, were built in the 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester City Centre. The central commercial district had no rail links, and over the years, a number of unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester's rail termini. In the 1960s, transport <b>design</b> <b>studies</b> were undertaken to address the problems of increasing traffic congestion. A number of urban public transport schemes were evaluated for Manchester, including several types of monorail systems and metro-style systems.|$|E

The full title of the EURISOL <b>Design</b> <b>Study</b> was “European Isotope Separation On-Line Radioactive Beam Facility”. It followed on from the EURISOL Feasibility Study which was led by Jean Vervier during the 5 th Framework Programme. Twenty “Participant ” institutions signed a Consortium Agreement, and engaged to contribute manpower and resources to the <b>Design</b> <b>Study,</b> with some expenses being eligible for reimbursement by the European Commission. The total amount of this reimbursement was 9. 16 million euros.

5|$|None of {{the three}} telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several <b>design</b> <b>studies</b> were carried out and some scale models were made. This was {{partly due to the}} changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold Wilson to a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E

Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA <b>design</b> <b>studies</b> be accelerated. In April 1969, the program officially became the B-1A. This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series, first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.|$|E
5|$|The Arrow was the {{culmination}} of a series of <b>design</b> <b>studies</b> begun in 1953 examining improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. I, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different <b>design</b> <b>studies,</b> one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E
