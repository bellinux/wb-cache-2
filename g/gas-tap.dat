50|$|Fox and {{his mother}} Rosaline lived on 18 shillings per week (£ {{equivalent}} in 2010) between them, supplementing this by cashing worthless cheques and moving from town to town. In 1927, Fox was imprisoned for fraud {{and his mother}} committed to the workhouse. On his release, he commenced a bogus affair with a Mrs Morse for mercenary reasons; she knew nothing of his homosexuality. He used the access given to steal her jewellery, and he also insured her life for £6000 (£ in 2010). Mrs Morse awoke one evening to find the <b>gas-tap</b> in her bedroom turned on. The resultant outcry led to a divorce action being filed by Mr. Morse, naming Fox as co-respondent. Fox was arrested on several charges, imprisoned for the jewellery theft and released in March 1929; {{he and his mother}} found it convenient to renew their travelling life.|$|E
