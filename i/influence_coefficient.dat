50|$|Generally speaking, {{deflections}} (or motions) of an infinitesimal element (which {{is viewed}} as a point) in an elastic body can occur along multiple DOF (maximum of six DOF at a point). For example, a point on a horizontal beam can undergo both a vertical displacement and a rotation relative to its undeformed axis. When there are M degrees of freedom a M x M matrix must be used to describe the stiffness at the point. The diagonal terms in the matrix are the direct-related stiffnesses (or simply stiffnesses) along the same degree of freedom and the off-diagonal terms are the coupling stiffnesses between two different degrees of freedom (either at the same or different points) or the same degree of freedom at two different points. In industry, the term <b>influence</b> <b>coefficient</b> is sometimes used to refer to the coupling stiffness.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{problem of}} 3 D planing surface is studied by a finite element approach. The planing surface {{is represented by}} a number of pressure patches whose strengths are constant at each element. The unknown pressure strength is obtained by using the free surface elevation condition under the planing surface and Kutta condition at the transom stern. Previous studies indicate that, when the constant pressure distribution method is used, the number of buttocks should be less than five or six, otherwise the calculated pressure distribution will start to oscillate and even become divergent. In the present study, after careful examination of the <b>influence</b> <b>coefficients,</b> it is found that the accuracy of the <b>influence</b> <b>coefficients</b> matrix is very important to the convergence of the solution, especially when the number of elements is relatively high. The oscillation of the pressure distribution can be avoided by constant element method if the <b>influence</b> <b>coefficients</b> are sufficiently accurate.

It should also not be surprising that analysts have approached the task by initially addressing the simpler context {monochromatic excitation, absorption effect in binary systems) and gradually addressing the more common and comprehensive context (polychromatic excitation, absorption and enhancement effects defined explicitly from fundamental parameters in multi-component systems]. It is shown that algorithms are independent of analytical contexts, while <b>influence</b> <b>coefficients,</b> on the other hand, are defined specifically for a given analytical context. It is demonstrated that all validly derived algorithms are equivalent as to the physical reality of XRF emissions, but that some are expressed in more convenient models.

40|$|Balancing of {{flexible}} rotor with bow using {{transfer matrix method}} MB Deepthikumar 1, AS Sekhar 2 and MR Srikanthan 1 Synchronous lateral vibration is a frequent cause of machine failure and {{is probably the most}} common source of machine noise and vibration. Among the broad ranges of faults that cause synchronous vibration, mass unbalance and bow are the most common faults present in the rotor and hence their detailed understanding is required. In the present study, a rotor model having both mass unbalance and bow is analyzed to find the influence of these faults on the synchronous response. The synchronous response of a rotor is a function of <b>influence</b> <b>coefficients</b> due to mass unbalance and bow. The <b>influence</b> <b>coefficients</b> are analytically derived using transfer matrix method for rotor bearing system having both mass unbalance and bow. The correction unbalance vector required to balance the rotor at its first bending critical speed is computed using these analytically derived <b>influence</b> <b>coefficients</b> and the rotor responses measured at a speed much lower than the first bending critical speed. The balancing method needs a good mathematical model for the rotor system in finding the <b>influence</b> <b>coefficients</b> for mass unbalance and bow.
