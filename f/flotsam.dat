5|$|In December 2014, it was {{announced}} drummer Jason Bittner would join Arizona thrash metal band <b>Flotsam</b> and Jetsam, and guitarist Matt Bachand would join Act of Defiance, along with the former members of Megadeth.|$|E
5|$|Soon the PNHQ {{deployed}} {{rescue teams}} on patrol vessels {{to recover the}} survivors of Khaibar. As Muhafiz sank before it could transmit, the Pakistanis knew the fate of ship from its few survivors, who were recovered when the patrol vessel steered towards the ship's burning <b>flotsam.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Life Is Peachy, Korn toured with many bands. Initially, Korn joined the Sick of It All Tour. Following the Sick of It All Tour, Korn joined the Danzig 4 Tour. Korn also toured with Megadeth, Fear Factory, and <b>Flotsam</b> and Jetsam. After {{the release of}} Life Is Peachy, Korn toured solo, and headlined and often sold out shows. Korn also toured in the Lollapalooza summer tour.|$|E
5|$|Ghazi, meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances. On {{the night}} of 3–4 December, a muffled {{underwater}} explosion was detected by a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed <b>flotsam</b> near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect a vessel had sunk off the coast. The next day, a clearance diving team was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that Ghazi had sunk in shallow waters.|$|E
5|$|After {{the raft}} was {{attacked}} and {{destroyed by the}} Others, Sawyer (Josh Holloway) surfaces in the ocean. Michael is heard screaming for Walt repeatedly, and Sawyer screams for Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). Sawyer decides to rescue Michael first, and swims over to him, dragging him onto a piece of <b>flotsam</b> and performing CPR. Michael then wakes up, and blames Sawyer for making him fire the flare, drawing their attackers to them. Shortly after, the two notice a shark is encircling them; Michael believes the shark was attracted to Sawyer's bleeding wound, and the two have continuous arguments.|$|E
5|$|Burton's death left Metallica's {{future in}} doubt. The three {{remaining}} members decided Burton would {{want them to}} carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement. Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of <b>Flotsam</b> and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams was recaptured and {{was sent}} to a new camp without news of Judy's survival. However, stories began being told of a dog helping {{drowning}} men reach pieces of debris on which to hold, and others recalled how the dog would bring them <b>flotsam</b> to keep them afloat. The dog would also allow men to hold onto her back while swimming them to safety. She had been found in the water by other survivors of the sinking, and once again hidden from the Japanese. Upon arrival at a dock, she was found by Les Searle who tried to smuggle her onto a truck with him. However, she was discovered by a Japanese Captain who threatened to kill her – whose order was countermanded by the newly arrived former Commander of the Medan camp and she was allowed to travel with Searle onto the new camp.|$|E
5|$|One night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian {{travel to}} the ocean surface to watch a celebration for the {{birthday}} of Prince Eric on a ship. Ariel instantly becomes enamored with Eric. A violent storm arrives, with {{a bolt of lightning}} striking the ship, engulfing it in flames and eventually destroying it, tossing Eric overboard. She rescues Eric and brings him to shore. Ariel sings to Eric, but immediately leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated by the memory of her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and sang to him, and Ariel vows {{to find a way to}} join him and his world. When Triton discovers Ariel's love for Eric, Triton confronts her in the grotto and destroys most of the artifacts with his trident. After Triton leaves, two eels named <b>Flotsam</b> and Jetsam convince Ariel to visit Ursula, a sea witch.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic <b>flotsam</b> {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's herpetofauna {{consists}} of 25 amphibian species and 61 reptile species. The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade {{is believed to}} have arrived by <b>flotsam</b> dispersion from South America. Little evidence exists to support the alternative hypothesis of proto-Antillean vicariance. Other terrestrial herpetofauna are believed to have arrived to the West Indies (and Puerto Rico) by the same method and subsequently undergone vicarization by banks or islands. As a result, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in general, {{has one of the highest}} percentages of endemism among amphibians and reptiles in the world. Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families: Bufonidae (2 species), Hylidae (3), Leptodactylidae (18) and Ranidae (2). Reptiles include turtles (freshwater and marine), lizards, worm lizards, snakes and a caiman.|$|E
5|$|Discovering that Vanessa is {{actually}} Ursula in disguise, Scuttle informs Ariel of Ursula's plan to marry Eric while Sebastian informs Triton about Ursula's actions. Assisted by her friends, Ariel stops Eric's wedding to Ursula, destroying the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck and restoring Ariel's voice. Realizing that Ariel is {{the girl who}} saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets, and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid before Ursula kidnaps her. Triton furiously confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. Ursula tricks Triton into taking Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton {{is transformed into a}} polyp. Ursula steps forward as the new queen, but before she can use the trident, Eric intervenes with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to attack Eric, but inadvertently kills <b>Flotsam</b> and Jetsam in the process. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to expand into monstrous proportions.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion {{of plastic}} <b>flotsam</b> is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition. This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Rameses is {{voiced by}} Sayed Badreya and an {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. Shortly after Drake is knocked out by Rameses, he {{is taken to}} a shipyard where he is tied to a chair. Rameses demands Drake to tell him where Atlantis of the Sands is located. When Drake tells Rameses that he honestly did not know, Rameses walks out and threatens to interrogate Sully. After Drake manages to break free and defeat all of the guards, he climbs onto Rameses' cruise ship. From there he finds a decoy of Sully and realizes that he was never there to begin with. Rameses tells him that he lied - he is after all a pirate. Drake then shoots him, critically wounding him. After Drake makes {{his way into the}} ball room (the ship turned onto its side at this point because it was sinking), Rameses shoots the glass window and causes the rest of the ship to flood, dying in the process. Drake however survives by drifting to shore on a piece of <b>flotsam.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Tales of Monkey Island, set {{several years}} after Escape from Monkey Island, Elaine has once again been kidnapped by LeChuck. In his rescue attempt, Guybrush {{inadvertently}} releases a voodoo pox over Gulf of Melange, which turns LeChuck into a human. While events separate Guybrush and Elaine, she befriends the now seemingly unmalicious LeChuck, and helps him return monkeys used for his voodoo spells to their homes. Elaine also attempts, without success, to arbitrate between merpeople with access to a cure for the pox and infected pirates. When negotiations break down, Elaine participates in a battle around the Jerkbait Islands to drive off the pirates. However, Elaine becomes infected with the pox and loses control, travelling to <b>Flotsam</b> Island to sack the town and kill Morgan LeFlay, a bounty hunter who she sees as a rival for Guybrush's love. Guybrush cures the pox, but LeChuck turns on him and fatally stabs him; Elaine cradles her husband as he dies. LeChuck takes Elaine captive and appears to convince her to join him as his demon bride; however, Elaine only submits to LeChuck to acquire a voodoo cutlass capable of destroying LeChuck. Guybrush returns as a ghost and maneuvers LeChuck into a position where Elaine can attack him with the cutlass. With LeChuck defeated, Guybrush restores himself to life by using a spell with Elaine's wedding ring, and returns to his wife.|$|E
25|$|People {{removing}} {{items from}} the shoreline for their own use could have been faced with prosecution, according to police at the time. Eight extra police were brought over to Scilly from mainland Cornwall to assist, taking notes of who was removing goods. Customs officers said that, under the Merchant Acts of 1894 and 1906, people are obliged to report recovered <b>flotsam</b> to the Receiver of Wreck. There is no known case of police taking up criminal proceedings {{for the removal of}} the <b>flotsam.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{early part}} of Newsted's music career had him {{performing}} bass for <b>Flotsam</b> and Jetsam and their 1986 album Doomsday for the Deceiver. Newsted wrote the majority of lyrics for the album.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} that many other reports of sea monsters are misinterpreted {{sightings}} of shark and whale carcasses (see below), floating kelp, logs or other <b>flotsam</b> such as abandoned rafts, canoes and fishing nets.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{an unusually}} wet and windy winter, {{there was a}} higher than normal amount of <b>flotsam</b> in the waters along the route, some of which was sucked into {{impellers}} for the ferries' engines, causing breakdowns and sailing cancellations.|$|E
25|$|The present {{church was}} built in 1819, after the {{previous}} one was destroyed during British occupation of the island in the early 1810s. There is evidence in the foundations of an even older church. Anholt has a tradition for building houses that include materials from <b>flotsam.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jetsam are {{goods that}} were thrown off a ship, {{which was in}} danger, to save the ship. <b>Flotsam</b> are goods that floated off the ship while it was in danger or when it sank. Ligan or lagan are goods left in the sea on the wreck or tied to a buoy {{so that they can}} be {{recovered}} later by the owners. Derelict is abandoned vessels or cargo.|$|E
25|$|Food {{consists}} {{primarily of}} plants {{gathered in the}} forest, coconuts, which are frequently found on the beaches as <b>flotsam,</b> pigs, and, presumably, other wildlife (which apart from sea turtles is limited to some smaller birds and invertebrates). Wild honey {{is known to be}} collected and the Sentinelese use a kind of rake to pull down branches to gather fruit or nuts, such as sapodilla and pandanus.|$|E
25|$|Independent {{researcher}} Warren Whittaker, who {{had presented}} {{evidence at the}} 2001 seminar based on his and Lindsay Knight's experimental wreck-locating system, wrote in The Weekend Australian in July 2006, reiterating his belief that HMAS Sydney Search Pty Ltd was looking in the wrong area. Through hindcasting based on the known movements of <b>flotsam</b> and the lifeboats from Kormoran, Whittaker incorrectly surmised that both ships would be located {{just west of the}} Abrolhos Islands.|$|E
25|$|Many coastal juveniles use seaweed for {{the shelter}} {{and the food}} that is {{available}} from invertebrates and other fish associated with it. Drifting seaweed, particularly the pelagic Sargassum, provide a niche habitat with its own shelter and food, and even supports its own unique fauna, such as the sargassum fish. One study, off Florida, found 54 species from 23 families living in <b>flotsam</b> from Sargassum mats. Jellyfish are also used by juvenile fish for shelter and food, even though jellyfish may prey on small fish.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom {{under the}} Merchant Shipping Act 1995, jetsam, <b>flotsam,</b> lagan {{and all other}} cargo and {{wreckage}} remain the property of their original owners. Anyone, including recreational divers and beachcombers, removing those goods must inform the Receiver of Wreck to avoid the accusation of theft. As the leisure activity of wreck diving is common, there are laws to protect historic wrecks of archaeological importance and the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 protects ships and aircraft that are the last resting place of the remains {{of members of the}} armed forces.|$|E
25|$|In the game's {{optional}} epilogue, Need asks Max to {{find some}} Zelmite ore in the town's mine {{in order to help}} fuel the Blackstone One. Max heads into the mines and is soon joined by Monica, who has used a Starglass from Madam Crest to travel back in time. They are attacked by the, now mechanical, remains of <b>Flotsam,</b> whom they defeat. They reach the end of the mine, finding the Zelmite, but are then attacked by the Dark Genie from Dark Cloud. They defeat the Genie and return to Palm Brinks with the ore.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1940s, {{during a}} {{depressing}} lull {{in his career}} (his radio show Blue Ribbon Town had failed, he failed to sell his proposed sitcom The <b>Flotsam</b> Family only to see it become a huge hit as The Life of Riley with William Bendix in the title role, and the Marx Brothers as film performers were well past their prime), Groucho was scheduled to appear on a radio show with Bob Hope. Annoyed that he was made {{to wait in the}} Green Room for 40 minutes, Groucho went on the air in a foul mood.|$|E
25|$|Many {{animals that}} live on {{or in the}} sea consume <b>flotsam</b> by mistake, as it often looks similar to their natural prey. Plastic debris, when bulky or tangled, is {{difficult}} to pass, and may become permanently lodged in the digestive tracts of these animals. Especially when evolutionary adaptions {{make it impossible for}} the likes of turtles to reject plastic bags, which resemble jellyfish when immersed in water, as they have a system in their throat to stop slippery foods from otherwise escaping. Thereby blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or infection.|$|E
25|$|Many {{animals that}} live on {{or in the}} sea consume <b>flotsam</b> by mistake, as it often looks similar to their natural prey. Bulky plastic debris may become {{permanently}} lodged in the digestive tracts of these animals, blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or infection. Tiny floating plastic particles also resemble zooplankton, which can lead filter feeders to consume them and cause them to enter the ocean food chain. In samples taken from the North Pacific Gyre in 1999 by the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, the mass of plastic exceeded that of zooplankton {{by a factor of}} six.|$|E
25|$|The British {{once again}} sent ambassadors and Caesar, {{although}} he doubled {{the number of}} hostages, realised he could not hold out any longer and dare not risk a stormy winter crossing, Caesar had set out late in the campaigning season and the winter was approaching, and so allowed them to be delivered to him in Gaul, to which he returned with {{as many of the}} ships as could be repaired with <b>flotsam</b> from the wrecked ships. Even then, only two tribes felt sufficiently threatened by Caesar to actually send the hostages, and two of his transports were separated from the main body and made landfall elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Noted {{producer}} Jim Diamond played bass from 1997 until 2004 {{and during}} that time Diamond also recorded and co-produced the Dirtbombs output with Mick Collins at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit. Troy Gregory (formerly of <b>Flotsam</b> and Jetsam, Prong, and lead singer of The Witches and Troy Gregory & The Stepsisters) played bass from June 2004 to September 5, 2008, also constituting one of the longest runs of any Dirtbombs member: the four-year line-up of Collins, Pantano, Blackwell, Melina, and Gregory is the longest lasting Dirtbombs line-up to date. For a brief time in 2002, the band featured back-up singers Deanne Iovan (also formerly of the Come Ons) and future bass player Ko, in addition to five musicians.|$|E
25|$|On 29 September, the ketch Annie Watt {{arrived in}} Adelaide and her captain {{reported}} {{picking up a}} reel of blue printing paper 18 miles North-West of Kangaroo Island. The paper was identified as part of Loch Vennachar's cargo. Three weeks later, the sea began delivering scraps of her cargo to the jagged coast of Kangaroo Island which confirmed the disaster. The steamer Governor Musgrave was sent on two separate occasions {{to search for the}} wreck and any survivors. Weeks of searching by government and local fishing boats produced only <b>flotsam</b> and the body of a young seaman, who was never identified. He was buried in the sand hills of West Bay. The search was eventually abandoned on 12 October.|$|E
25|$|Jarman is also {{remembered for}} his famous shingle cottage-garden, {{created in the}} latter years of his life, {{in the shadow of}} Dungeness nuclear power station. The cottage is built in vernacular style in timber, with tar-based weatherproofing, like others nearby. Raised wooden text {{on the side of the}} cottage is the first stanza and the last five lines of the last stanza of John Donne's poem, The Sun Rising. The cottage garden was made by {{arranging}} <b>flotsam</b> washed up nearby, interspersed with endemic salt-loving beach plants, both set against the bright shingle. The garden has been the subject of several books. At this time, Jarman also began painting again (see the book: Evil Queen: The Last Paintings, 1994).|$|E
25|$|Jason Curtis Newsted (born March 4, 1963) is an American metal musician, {{known for}} being the third {{recording}} bass guitarist with the band Metallica from October 1986 until his departure in January 2001, {{as well as being}} a part of Voivod and <b>Flotsam</b> and Jetsam. After leaving Metallica he continued with his project Echobrain, played with Ozzy Osbourne and joined heavy metal band Voivod. Newsted uses the pseudonym Jasonic, which serves as both his alias in Voivod and the name of his music publishing company. He is also the founder of the Chophouse Records studio and label based in California. From 2012 to 2014 he played in his self-titled band Newsted, for which he provided lead vocals as well as bass. Newsted lives in Alamo, California.|$|E
25|$|At 3.15 p.m. an {{amphibian}} aircraft, piloted by {{a senior}} {{officer of the}} RAAF based on the Rathmines, took off on a reconnaissance flight to seaward. Soon after taking off the pilot saw smoke several miles out to sea he altered course and made for the spot immediately. He found {{a great deal of}} wreckage was floating on the surface with the amphibian sighting the wreck site within ten minutes of the explosion an. The pilot landed the plane but found the water much rougher than he had expected. Because of the seas and the extent of the wreckage, he was unable to taxi close to one large piece of the <b>flotsam,</b> to which he could see a group of men clinging desperately. He taxied the machine some distance to the lea of a small island, where sheltered water enabled him to take off.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{beaching}} of the MSC Napoli, as {{a result}} of severe damage incurred during European storm Kyrill, there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the <b>flotsam</b> which was washed up on the beaches at Branscombe. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many BMW motorbikes and empty wine casks as well as bags of disposable nappies (diapers). The legal position under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the Receiver of Wreck. Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a criminal record for theft by finding. After several days, the police and Receiver of Wreck, in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted salvors, established a cordon to prevent access to the beach. A similar situation occurred after the wreck of the MV Cita in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The two of {{them are}} taken {{to the edge of the}} Discworld by the ocean {{currents}} and nearly carried over, but they are caught by the Circumfence, a huge net built by the nation of Krull to catch sea life and <b>flotsam</b> washed in from the rest of the Discworld. They are rescued by Tethis the sea troll, a being composed of water who had fallen off the edge of his own world and onto the Discworld, where he was subsequently enslaved by the Krullians. Rincewind and Twoflower are then taken by the Krullians to their capital, where they learn that the Krullians intend to discover the sex of Great A'Tuin by launching a space capsule over the edge of the Disc, and plan to sacrifice Rincewind and Twoflower to get the god Fate to smile on the voyage, Fate insisting on their sacrifice after they caused him to lose the earlier game. Rincewind and Twoflower attempt to escape, but end up stealing the capsule, which is launched with Twoflower inside, the tourist wishing to see the other worlds of the universe. Rincewind is unable to get into the capsule in time, and falls off the Disc alongside it, the Luggage following them soon after.|$|E
