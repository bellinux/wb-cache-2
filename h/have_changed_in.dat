The county borders <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> some instances since (for reasons such as historical ties and requests by cities), with the latest revision taking place in 2006.

25|$|In early 1516, the Ottoman Turks, wary of {{the danger}} of an {{alliance}} between the Mamluks and the Persian Safavids, started a campaign of conquest against the Mamluk sultanate. On 21 September, the Mamluk governor of Damascus fled the city, and on 2 October the khutba in the Umayyad mosque was pronounced in the name of Selim I. The day after, the victorious sultan entered the city, staying for three months. On 15 December, he left Damascus by Bab al-Jabiya, intent on the conquest of Egypt. Little appeared to <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the city: one army had simply replaced another. However, on his return in October 1517, the sultan ordered the construction of a mosque, tekkiye and mausoleum at the shrine of Shaikh Muhi al-Din ibn Arabi in al-Salihiyah. This was to be the first of Damascus' great Ottoman monuments.|$|E

25|$|Motion {{pictures}} {{have been}} {{an important aspect of}} urban culture since 1910. The places where people have watched films, from the nickelodeon to the multiplex, <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> ways that reflect changes in the society generally. The cinema in Edmonton reflected the changing urban landscape. Because the movie houses themselves are part of the entertainment product, the cinema industry follows a cycle of construction, renovation, and demolition. The industry's face is constantly changing in an effort to draw people inside; Edmonton's cinemas have moved with the retail industry from the downtown core to the suburban shopping malls, and are now experimenting with new formats similar to retailers' big boxes. Just as Edmonton is known for massive amounts of retail space, it also {{has one of the highest}} numbers of movie screens in Canada in proportion to its population. Cinemas are thus a revealing aspect of trends in urban development.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare {{wrote the}} role of Lear for his company's chief tragedian, Richard Burbage, for whom Shakespeare was writing {{incrementally}} older characters as their careers progressed. It has been speculated either that {{the role of}} the Fool was written for the company's clown Robert Armin, or that it was written for performance by one of the company's boys, doubling the role of Cordelia. Only one specific performance of the play during Shakespeare's lifetime is known: before the court of King James I at Whitehall on 26 December 1606. Its original performances would have been at The Globe, where there were no sets in the modern sense, and characters would have signified their roles visually with props and costumes: Lear's costume, for example, would <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the course of the play as his status diminished: commencing in crown and regalia; then as a huntsman; raging bareheaded in the storm scene; and finally crowned with flowers in parody of his original status.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist monks do {{not take}} {{perpetual}} vows to remain monks although some become monks permanently. Traditionally, they became monks early in life. It is possible to become a novice at as young an age as seven, but in practice thirteen is the earliest age for novices. A bhikkhu {{must be at least}} twenty. The monk's life is regulated by Buddhist law, and life in the wat adheres to a rigid routine. A bhikkhu follows 227 rules of monastic discipline as well as the 10 basic precepts. These include the five precepts that all Buddhists should follow. The five precepts for monastic asceticism prohibit eating after noon, participating in any entertainment (singing, dancing, and watching movies or television), using any personal adornments, sleeping on a luxurious bed, and handling money. In addition, a monk also is expected to be celibate. Furthermore, monks supposedly avoid all involvement in political affairs. They are not eligible to vote or to hold any political office, and they may not witness a legal document or give testimony in court. Since the person of a monk is considered sacred, he is considered to be outside the normal civil laws and public duties that affect lay people. Some of these practices <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the modern period, however, and in the 1980s Buddhist monks have been active even in the PRK government.|$|E

500|$|Public {{perceptions}} in Western society regarding healthy {{body weight}} {{differ from those}} regarding the weight that is considered ideal – and both have changed {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century. The weight that is viewed as an ideal has become lower since the 1920s. This is illustrated by the fact that the average height of Miss America pageant winners increased by 2% from 1922 to 1999, while their average weight decreased by 12%. [...] On the other hand, people's views concerning healthy weight <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. In Britain, the weight at which people considered themselves to be overweight was significantly higher in 2007 than in 1999. [...] These changes are believed to be due to increasing rates of adiposity leading to increased acceptance of extra body fat as being normal.|$|E
500|$|Janowitz and Mayer {{are said}} to have set out to write a story denouncing {{arbitrary}} authority as brutal and insane. Janowitz said it was only years after the film was released that he realized exposing the [...] "authoritative power of an inhuman state" [...] was the [...] "subconscious intention" [...] of the writers. However, Hermann Warm, who designed the film's sets, said Mayer had no political intentions when he wrote the film. Film historian David Robinson noted Janowitz did not refer to anti-authority intentions in the script until many decades after Caligari was released, and he suggested Janowitz's recollection may <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> response to later interpretations to the film. The film they wrote was entitled Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, using the English spelling [...] "Cabinet" [...] rather than the German [...] "Kabinett". The completed script contained 141 scenes. Janowitz has claimed the name [...] "Caligari", which was not settled upon until after the script was finished, was inspired by a rare book called ‘’Unknown Letters of Stendhal'’, which featured a letter from the French novelist Stendhal referring to a French officer named Caligari he met at the La Scala theatre in Milan. However, no record of any such letter exists, and film historian John D. Barlow suggested Janowitz may have fabricated the story. The physical appearance of Dr. Caligari was inspired by portraits of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. The character's name is spelled [...] "Calligaris" [...] in the only known surviving script, although in some instances the final [...] "s" [...] is removed. Other character names are also spelled differently from the final film: Cesare appears as [...] "Caesare", Alan is [...] "Allan" [...] or sometimes [...] "Alland" [...] and Dr. Olfen is [...] "Dr. Olfens". Likewise, unnamed characters in the final film have names in the script, including the town clerk ("Dr. Lüders") and the house-breaker ("Jakob Straat").|$|E
