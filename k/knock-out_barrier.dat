40|$|An {{efficient}} conditioning technique, {{the so-called}} Brownian Bridge simulation, {{has previously been}} applied to eliminate pricing bias that arises in applications of the standard discrete-time Monte Carlo method to evaluate options written on the continuous-time extrema of an underlying asset. It {{is based on the}} simple and easy to implement analytic formulas for the distribution of one-dimensional Brownian Bridge extremes. This paper extends the technique to the valuation of multi-asset options with <b>knock-out</b> <b>barriers</b> imposed for all or some of the underlying assets. We derive formula for the unbiased option price estimator based on the joint distribution of the multi-dimensional Brownian Bridge dependent extrema. As analytic formulas are not available for the joint distribution in general, we develop upper and lower biased option price estimators based on the distribution of independent extrema and the Fréchet lower and upper bounds for the unknown distribution. All estimators are simple and easy to implement. They can always be used to bind the true value by a confidence interval. Numerical tests indicate that our biased estimators converge rapidly to the true option value as the number of time steps for the asset path simulation increases in comparison to the estimator based on the standard discrete-time method. The convergence rate depends on the correlation and barrier structures of the underlying assets. ...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{trend in}} {{investment}} banking to unify pricing tools in a framework of partial differential equations. The Black-Scholes equation and its extensions are solved numerically with pde-based techniques (instead of rather heuristic techniques like Monte Carlo or Trees). The predominant numerical technique today is Finite Differences. This technique has been studied since L. Euler and is fairly easy to apply. A more modern technique, Finite Elements, can also be applied to solve the pdes. It offers some advantages: 1. The solution is a polynomial approximation to the entire domain. The method of Finite Differences supplies an approximate solution only to distinct points in the domain, so that interpolation becomes necessary. 2. There are several FE methods that supply Delta and Gamma as a by-product. The other Greeks can be computed in a slightly easier manner than with FD. 3. Irregular domains, which occur when <b>knock-out</b> <b>barriers</b> are applied to multi-asset options, can be solved easily since the elements can be adjusted to almost any domain. FD techniques, however, are designed to cover rectangular domains. 4. FD techniques for problems involving Neumann conditions are not straightforward to apply. FE methods, however, have no problems with Neumann conditions. Neumann conditions are easier to apply to financial problems since {{the behavior of the}} function at infinity has to be approximated. Approximating the function at infinity is normally harder than approximating its derivative. We will demonstrate these advantages with various exotic options (for instance, capped power calls, double barrier options on baskets, volatility models, and the like) and bond pricing models (Duffie/Kan, Sandmann/ Sondermann/ Miltersen). We also demonstrate how to use FE for nonlinear models arising through the incorporation of transactions costs and through passport options. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{existing}} literature on barrier options, much effort has been exerted to ensure convergence through placing the barrier in close proximity to, or directly onto, the nodes of the tree lattice. In this paper we show that {{this may not be}} necessary to achieve accurate option price approximations.

We study the convergence properties of various types of options including (but not limited to) double <b>knock-out,</b> exponential <b>barrier,</b> double (constant) linear barriers and linear time-varying barriers.

40|$|In {{this article}} we apply Carr’s {{randomization}} approximation and the operator form of the Wiener-Hopf method to double barrier options in continuous time. Each step in the resulting backward induction algorithm is solved using a simple iterative procedure that reduces the problem of pricing options with two barriers to pricing a sequence of certain contingent claims with first-touch single barrier features. This procedure admits a clear financial interpretation that can be formulated {{in the language of}} embedded options. Our approach results in a fast and accurate pricing method {{that can be used in}} a rather wide class of Lévy-driven models including Variance Gamma processes, Normal Inverse Gaussian processes and KoBoL processes (a. k. a. the CGMY model). At the same time, our work gives new insight into the known explicit formulas obtained by other authors in the setting of the Black-Scholes model. The operator form of the Wiener-Hopf method is generalized for wide classes of processes including the important class of Variance Gamma processes.

40|$|Abstract. Defined benefit {{pension plans}} provide their {{beneficiaries}} with a prespecified retirement income related {{to years of}} service and wage. However, as pension contracts are not entirely legally enforceable, such payments of defined benefit pension plans are not completely irreversible. The pension deal can be closed early or converted, i. e. the sponsor {{might be tempted to}} change the nature of the pension fund liabilities from defined ben-efit to defined contribution to avoid excessive premium increases when the pension plan funding ratio deteriorates and crosses the regulatory minimum. This paper is the first to analyze market–consistent valuation of option–adjusted pension liabilities in a contingent claim framework whereby a <b>knock–out</b> <b>barrier</b> framework is built into the model in order to capture early closure of a pension plan. We mainly investigate two cases which we call “immediate closure procedure ” and “delayed closure procedure”. In an immediate closure procedure, when the assets value hits the regulatory boundary, the pension plan is terminated immediately. Whereas in a delayed closure procedure, a grace period is given to the pension fund for reorganization and recovery and only an underfunding longer than a certain period leads to premature closure.

The bilaterally constrained cash settlements are considered as controls that have to be chosen such that the Delta of the option is {{as close as possible to}} a predefined constant profit/loss. This leads to a control constrained optimal control problem for the two-dimensional Black-Scholes equation with Dirichlet boundary control and finite time control. Based on the variational formulation of the problem in an appropriate Sobolev space setting, we prove the existence of a unique solution and state the first order necessary optimality conditions. A semi-discretization in space by conforming P 1 finite elements with respect to a simplicial triangulation of the computational domain gives rise to a semi-discrete control constrained optimal control problem for a linear system of first order ordinary differential equations. A further discretization in time by the backward Euler scheme results in a fully discrete optimization problem that is solved numerically by the projected gradient method with Armijo line search. Numerical examples for some selected test cases illustrate the benefits of hedging with European double barrier basket options in case of optimally controlled cash settlements...|$|E

40|$|The Thesis {{investigates the}} {{benefits}} of Spectral Methods, which {{are found to be}} an appealing numerical technique when the solution in closed form doesn't exist, but unfortunately it cannot be used in every case. A remarkable case in which it is possible to use the Spectral Methods is for pricing the Double Barrier Options as we have seen in Chapter 3. The main achievement of this Thesis is the introduction of two methods, that we have called Geometrical Approximation and Perturbative Method respectively, by which is possible to evaluate the fair option prices in the Heston and SABR market model. Both proposed methods can be generalised to other market models and for pricing other derivatives contracts, although, in order to show the above methodologies, we have chosen to pricing Options of only two kinds: Vanilla Options and <b>knock-out</b> <b>Barrier</b> Options. On the first, we have that the G. A. method intends to be an alternative method, which can be particularly convenient for sensible values of the model parameters, which allows computation of closed-form expressions of approximated option prices. The option price is approximated since we can get closed-form solutions for the PDE at the cost of modifying the Cauchy's condition, rather than looking for a numerical solution to the PDE with the exact Cauchy's condition. The proposed method has the advantage to compute a solution in closed form, therefore, {{we do not have the}} problems which plague the numerical methods. For example, one can consider the inverse Fourier transform method, in which we have to compute an integral between zero and infinity. In this case in fact, there is always some problem in order to define (in practice) the correct domain of integration; or equivalently, considering also the finite difference method, in which we have to define a suitable grid, in other words we have some problems about the choice of the grid's meshes. In the present work we have used the Geometrical Approximation method in the Heston model and in the SABR model, comparing the Vanilla Option price obtained with these computed by inverse Fourier transform, Monte-Carlo simulation and Finite Difference method or again the Implied Volatility method. The Geometrical Approximation method is more reliable for low values of the correlation between price and variance shocks. In this case, our numerical experiments in a specific but sensible case show that the difference with the Fourier method is of the order of 1...|$|E
