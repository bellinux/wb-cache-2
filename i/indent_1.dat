We have studied, through molecular dynamics simulations, using a many-body empirical potential, the indentation of a hydrogen-terminated, diamond (111) surface, with a proximal probe tip that consists of an open, hydrogen-terminated, (10, 10) carbon nanotubule. The simulations showed that upon <b>indenting</b> <b>1.</b> 8 A, the tubule deforms but returns to its original shape upon retraction.

40|$|In this study, film {{interfacial}} fracture is {{induced by}} nanoindentation {{to quantify the}} practical work of adhesion of a post-CMP copper film to an amorphous silicon nitride passivation film. Poor adhesion of electrodeposited copper to SiN passivation is observed following CMP due to copper oxide growth prior to plasma enhanced silicon nitride deposition. Four point bend testing has shown that failure by brittle fracture of test structures occurs at the Cu/CuO interface. Hydrogen, ammonia, and nitrogen plasma treatments of the post-CMP copper surface {{can be used to}} remove the oxide, shown by auger electron spectroscopy, and to increase the surface roughness of copper, shown by atomic force microscopy. Both effects can be used to improve the Cu/SiN adhesion. Nanoindentation with a conical <b>indenter</b> (<b>1.</b> 59 µm tip radius) was used to induce SiN film delaminations from Cu, the sizes of which were measured and correlated with the practical work of adhesion. [1, 2] In order to more reliably and repeatably produce these delaminations a TiW (10 wt % Ti) superlayer was sputter deposited on to the test structures. [2, 3] Mechanical properties, including elastic modulus and hardness of SiN, electrodeposited copper, and TiW measured by nanoindentation are also reported here...|$|R
