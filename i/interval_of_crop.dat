40|$|Agricultural {{applications}} of El Nino forecasts are already underway {{in some countries}} {{and need to be}} evaluated or re-evaluated. For example, in Peru, El Nino forecasts have been incorporated into national planning for the agricultural sector, and areas planted with rice and cotton (cotton being the more drought-tolerant crop) are adjusted accordingly. How well are this and other such programs working? Such evaluations will contribute to the governmental and intergovernmental institutions, including the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research and the US National Ocean and Atmospheric Agency that are fostering programs to aid the effective use of forecasts. As El Nino climate forecasting grows out of the research mode into operational mode, the research focus shifts to include the design of appropriate modes of utilization. Awareness of and sensitivity to the costs of prediction errors also grow. For example, one major forecasting model failed to predict the very large El Nino event of 1997, when Pacific sea-surface temperatures were the highest on record. Although simple correlations between El Nino events and crop yields may be suggestive, more sophisticated work is needed to understand the subtleties of the interplay among the global climate system, regional climate patterns, and local agricultural systems. Honesty about the limitations of an forecast is essential, especially when human livelihoods are at stake. An end-to-end analysis links tools and expertise from the full sequence of ENSO cause-and-effect processes. Representatives from many disciplines are needed to achieve insights, e. g, oceanographers and atmospheric scientists who predict El Nino events, climatologists who drive global climate models with sea-surface temperature predictions, agronomists who translate regional climate connections in to crop yield forecasts, and economists who analyze market adjustments to the vagaries of climate and determine the value of climate forecasts. Methods include historical studies to understand past patterns and to test hindcasts of the prediction tools, crop modeling, spatial analysis and remote sensing. This research involves expanding, deepening, and applying the understanding of physical climate to the fields of agronomy and social science; and the reciprocal understanding <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> growth and farm economics to climatology. Delivery of a regional climate forecast with no information about how the climate forecast was derived limits its effectiveness. Explanation of a region's major climate driving forces helps to place a seasonal forecast in context. Then, a useful approach is to show historical responses to previous El Nino events, and projections, with uncertainty <b>intervals,</b> <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> response from dynamic process crop growth models. Regional ID forecasts should be updated with real-time weather conditions. Since every El Nino event is different, it is important to track, report and advise on each new event as it unfolds. The stability of human enterprises depends on understanding both the potentialities and the limits of predictability. Farmers rely on past experience to anticipate and respond to fluctuations in the biophysical systems on which their livelihoods depend. Now scientists are improving their ability to predict some major elements of climate variability. The improvements in the reliability of El Nino forecasts are encouraging, but seasonal forecasts for agriculture are not, and will probably never be completely infallible, due to the chaotic nature of the climate system. Uncertainties proliferate as we extend beyond Pacific sea-surface temperatures to climate teleconnections and agricultural outcomes. The goal of this research is to shed as a clear light as possible on these inherent uncertainties and thus to {{contribute to the development of}} appropriate responses to El Nino and other seasonal forecasts for a range of stakeholders, which, ultimately, includes food consumers everywhere...|$|R

With these new approaches comes the need for rapid estimations of existing field population size. Here, we describe the use of simulation modeling with container-inhabiting mosquito simulation (CIMSiM) for estimation of Ae. aegypti pupal crop size in north Queensland, Australia. CIMSiM was calibrated for local conditions by deploying “sentinel key containers” (tire, 2 -liter plastic bucket, 0. 6 -liter pot plant base, and tarpaulin indentation) in which water flux and pupal productivity were studied for 72 d. Iterative adjustment of CIMSiM parameters was used to fit model outputs to match that of sentinel key containers. This calibrated model was then used in a blind field validation, in which breeding container and local meteorological data were used to populate CIMSiM, and model outputs were compared with a field pupal survey. Actual pupae per ha during two 10 -d periods in 2007 fell within 95 % confidence <b>intervals</b> <b>of</b> simulated pupal <b>crop</b> estimates made by 10 replicate simulations in CIMSiM, thus providing a successful field validation.

40|$|Traditional {{irrigation}} was {{practiced in}} Ethiopia since time immemorial. Despite this, water productivity in the sector remained low. A survey on the Godino irrigation scheme revealed that farmers {{used the same}} amount <b>of</b> water and <b>intervals,</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> species and growth stage. In an effort to improve the water productivity, two traditional irrigation scheduling methods were compared with two scientific methods, using furrow irrigation. The growth performance and tuber yield of potato (cv. Awash) revealed that irrigation scheduling using a neutron probe significantly outperformed the traditional methods, followed by the SWB model Irrigation Calendar. Since the NP method involves high initial cost and skills, {{the use of the}} SWB Calendar is suggested as replacement for the traditional methods. SWB is a generic crop growth model that requires parameters specific to each crop, to be determined experimentally before it could be used for irrigation scheduling. It also accurately describes deficit irrigation strategies where water supply is limited. Field trials to evaluate four potato cultivars for growth performance and assimilate partitioning, and onions' critical growth stages to water stress were conducted. Crop-specific parameters were also generated. Potato and onion crops are widely grown at the Godino scheme where water scarcity is a major constraint. These crop-specific parameters were used to calibrate and evaluate SWB model simulations. Results revealed that SWB model simulations for Top dry matter (TDM), Harvestable dry matter (HDM), Leaf area index (LAI), soil water deficit (SWD) and Fractional interception (FI) fitted well with measured data, {{with a high degree of}} statistical accuracy. The response of onions to water stress showed that bulb development (70 - 110 DATP) and bulb maturity (110 - 145) stages were most critical to water stress, which resulted in a significant reduction in onion growth and bulb yields. SWB also showed that onion yield was most sensitive to water stress during these two stages. An irrigation calendar, using the SWB model, was developed for five different schemes in Ethiopia, using long-term weather data and crop-specific parameters for potatoes and onions. The calendars revealed that water depth varied, depending on climate, crop type and growth stage. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Plant Production and Soil Scienceunrestricte...|$|R

This paper proposed a method, based on SVM, to organize the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation practices efficiently from Web Resources. The knowledge organization method <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation was proposed with Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) in the application <b>of</b> the <b>crop</b> cultivation practices. It is that how to organize the existing crop cultivation knowledge, {{according to the requirements}} <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation practices. It mainly includes a text classification method and a search strategy on the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation. For the text classification method, it used a text classification method based on SVM Decision Tree; for the search strategy, it used a strategy, organized by Ontology and custom knowledge bases. The experiment shows that performance of the proposed text classification method and the knowledge organization method with wheat, is workable and feasible...|$|R

However, the contribution <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> residues to the P nutrition <b>of</b> subsequent <b>crops</b> has not been widely recognised, and simple predictive tools are lacking. By reviewing the published literature in which quantitative measurements of P transformations from plant residues applied to soil have been reported, we have evaluated the contribution <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> residue-derived P to the P nutrition <b>of</b> subsequent <b>crops,</b> assessed the key factors involved and summarised the knowledge as an empirical model. The contribution <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> residues to P availability {{is likely to be}} significant only under conditions where large amounts <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> residues <b>of</b> relatively high P concentration are applied to soil. Crop residues with low P concentration, such as cereal stubble (eg. due to re-translocation of a large proportion of stubble P into grain), will not make an agronomically significant contribution to soil P availability, but may reduce P availability due to assimilation in the microbial biomass. However, a productive green manure crop may release sufficient P to meet the requirements of a subsequent cash <b>crop.</b> The release <b>of</b> P from <b>crop</b> residues is significantly reduced in systems where the P-status <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> and soils is low, which reinforces the reliance on external P inputs for sustained crop productivity. The large variability in the potential contributions of plant residues to the P nutrition <b>of</b> subsequent <b>crops</b> suggests that there is a strong need to integrate model predictions of organically-cycled P with fertiliser management strategies...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of geography, the concept <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> {{diversification}} {{is not a new}} one. It indicates raising the variety <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> on arable land. It can be examined over space and time. This is based on agroclimatic, irrigation as well as technological consideration. Crop diversification index method seek to identify the behavior <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> over a period of the and space. It {{is one of the most}} important criteria of agricultural regionalization and useful for the identification <b>of</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern <b>of</b> the region. The main advantage of the study of diversification region lies in the fact that it enables us to understand the impact of physical and socio-economic conditions on the agriculture. Moreover, it helps us in knowing the contemporary competition among crop for area, for rotation and effect on double cropping, total production and per hectare productivity. Crop diversification has attracted the attention of geographers from very beginning of the discipline as an independant branch of agricultural geography. Its measurement in quantitative sense is of a recent origin. Crop diversification patterns Have great relevance like that <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> concentration, in agricultural land use studies. Crop diversity is an important component <b>of</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern <b>of</b> a region. It referes to crop variety. Larger the number crops grown in an area during the year with each crop occupying equal proportion <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> land, the higher is crop diversification, specialization is reverse of diversification. Specialization indicates cultivation of a few number <b>of</b> <b>crops.</b> Where as crop diversification implies raising the variety <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> from the soil. “The keener the competition, the higher the magnitude of the diversification and lesser the competition the greater will the trend toward specialization or monoculture farming where emphasis is on one or two crops ” (Jasbir Singh 1976). In fact it is that the greater the number <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> in combination the greater will be the degree of diversification. An attempt is made here to analysis the nature <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> diversification and its spatiotemporal variations in micro region i. e. Ahmednagar district.
