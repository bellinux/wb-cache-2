40|$|Some {{electrical}} applications have {{a number}} of heat sources. The closed-loop pulsating heat pipe (CLPHP) is applied to transfer heat from these devices. Since the CLPHP primarily transfers heat by means of the working fluid’s phase change in a capillary tube, the thermal performance of the CLPHP significantly depends on the working fluid type and the tube’s internal diameter. In order to provide the fundamental information for manufacturers of heat exchangers, this study on the effect of working fluids and internal diameters has been conducted. Three <b>electrical</b> <b>plate</b> heaters were installed on the CLPHP as the heat sources. The experiments were conducted by varying the working fluid to be R 123, ethanol, and water, and the internal diameter to be 1. 0 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2. 0 mm. For each set of the same working fluid and internal diameter, the input heat fluxes of the heat sources were also made to vary within six different patterns. It can be concluded that when the latent heat of evaporation increases - in the case of vertical CLPHP - and when the dynamic viscosity of the liquid increases - in the case of horizontal CLPHP - the thermal performance decreases. Moreover, when the internal diameter increases, the thermal performance increases for both of vertical and horizontal CLPHPs...|$|E

By comparing the free energies of different configurations, we show that for weak surface fields, the phase of cylinders parallel to the plates makes a direct transition to a phase in which the cylinders are aligned with the field throughout the sample. For stronger surface fields, there is an intermediate phase in which cylinders {{in the interior of}} the film, aligned with the field, terminate near the plates.

40|$|Recent {{heavy ion}} fusion target {{studies show that}} it is {{possible}} to achieve ignition with direct drive and energy gain larger than 100 at 1 MJ. To realize these advanced, high-gain schemes based on direct drive, it is necessary to develop a reliable beam smoothing technique to mitigate instabilities and facilitate uniform deposition on the target. The dynamics of the beam centroid can be explored as a possible beam smoothing technique to achieve a uniform illumination over a suitably chosen region of the target. The basic idea of this technique is to induce an oscillatory motion of the centroid for each transverse slice of the beam in such a way that the centroids of different slices strike different locations on the target. The centroid dynamics is controlled by a set of biased <b>electrical</b> <b>plates</b> called 'wobblers'. Using a model based on moments of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, we show that the wobbler deflection force acts only on the centroid motion, and that the envelope dynamics are independent of the wobbler fields. If the conducting wall is far away from the beam, then the envelope dynamics and centroid dynamics are completely decoupled. This is a preferred situation for the beam wobbling technique, because the wobbler system can be designed to generate the desired centroid motion on the target without considering its effects on the envelope and emittance. A conceptual design of the wobbler system for a heavy ion fusion driver is briefly summarized...|$|R

The exact kernel of the integral equation is applied and all possible current components are taken into account. When the antenna is close to a conducting plate, a strong modification of the surface current distribution is observed. It is demonstrated that for these configurations, the incorporation of the circumferential component of the surface current distribution is needed. At larger distances, the circumferential surface current can be neglected in the total distribution.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} plays {{a critical}} role in thermoelectric (TE) power generation because the higher the heat-transfer rate from the hot to the cold side of the TE material, the higher is the generation of electric power. However, high heat-transfer rate is difficult to achieve compactly when the hot and/or the cold sources are maintained by a flow of gas such as waste heat from the gas exhaust of an engine or a power plant. Also, when the temperature of the hot and the cold sources differs considerably, thermal stress can create damage and thereby affect reliability and service life. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed to evaluate two compact gas-phase heat-exchanger (HX) designs on their ability to enable high heat-transfer rates from the hot to the cold sides of the TE material with minimal thermal stress.
