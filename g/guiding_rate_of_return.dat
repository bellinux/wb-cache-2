Islamic banking is aimed at supporting the implementation of national development in order to improve justice, togetherness, and equitable distribution of welfare. In pursuit of supporting the implementation of national development, Islamic banking often faced stability problems of financing instruments being operated. In this case, it is measured by the gap between the actual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> and the expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> The individual actual RoR of this instrument will generate an expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> This raises the gap or difference between the actual <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> and the expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> individual instruments, which in this case is called the abnormal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> The stability <b>of</b> abnormal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> individual instruments is certainly influenced by the stability <b>of</b> the expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return.</b> Expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> has a volatility or fluctuation levels for each financing instrument.
