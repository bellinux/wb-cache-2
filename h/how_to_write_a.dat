5|$|John Edward Brownlee {{served as}} Attorney-General of the {{province}} of Alberta in western Canada from 1921 until 1926, in the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) government of Herbert Greenfield. As Brownlee was the only lawyer in a caucus formed almost entirely of farmers, his role extended beyond the traditional expectations of an attorney-general, and ranged from providing legal advice to explaining <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> business letter; he also became the government's de facto leader in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.|$|E

In a humorous sketch, the show's title character demonstrated <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> book proposal alongside a sock puppet.

500|$|Brownlee was {{the only}} lawyer in a {{government}} composed primarily of farmers, {{and the rest of}} the cabinet drew heavily on his expertise. Its reliance on him extended beyond legal issues to such matters as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> business letter. Greenfield was among the most dependent, and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorney-general for a draft response; Greenfield often signed the draft and sent it out unchanged. [...] The premier eventually relied on Brownlee so heavily that Brownlee set the agenda for cabinet meetings. [...] The government also relied on Brownlee in the legislature, where it found itself under relentless attack from the John R. Boyle-led Liberals. [...] Brownlee had the widest debating experience of the UFA members, and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks. [...] His maiden speech was typical of him: [...] "I came into this House with considerable trepidation, because I knew that sitting opposite would be the former giants of this House, men with ability, experience, and skill. Since coming in I've listened to all these men—giving their best—and now I blush at my own modesty." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Christian Spurrier, his first writing credit for the series. He joined the Spooks writing staff in January 2008. Producer Katie Swinden wanted to base an episode on the economy, {{which at the time}} was facing a {{recession}} following the financial crisis of the British bank Northern Rock just months before. After trying a few different stories, the producers settled on a story about a bank collapse that is so severe it could result in an economic collapse. Spurrier did research on banking climate in the City of London in March 2008, and realised the economy was going down, but also wanted to exaggerate the numbers for the episode. Ros was chosen to lead because the character had a background in business. In some of the original drafts of the episode, John Castle would return as Jocelyn Myers, Ros' father, but later on the producers realised they did not need him. The producers also wanted to include some jeopardy in the climax, namely adding a gun to a head or a bomb, which created the scenes where Darlek threatened to kill Ros. Spurrier felt he had a [...] "lot of juggling" [...] in writing three separate storylines; the main plot, the Sugarhorse subplot and Jo; but did a lot of learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> Spooks script as he wrote it.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} between {{his senior year}} of high school and his {{freshman}} year of college, Washington grew four inches. He began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance. Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college. He has frequently described his college years as [...] "the happiest time in my life." [...] He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him. A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem. Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams. He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American. Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his {{senior year of high}} school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> report.|$|E
500|$|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari {{makes use}} of a [...] "Rahmenerzählung", or frame story. Both a prologue and {{epilogue}} establish {{the main body of}} the film as a delusional flashback, an innovative technique at the time. Lang has said that, during early discussions about his possible involvement with the film, he suggested the addition of an opening scene with a [...] "normal" [...] style, which would lead the public into the rest of the film without confusion. However, it remains unclear whether Lang suggested the frame story structure itself, or simply gave advice on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> frame story that was already agreed upon, and some writers, like David Robinson, have questioned whether Lang's recollection is correct. Director Robert Wiene was supportive of the changes. Janowitz has claimed he and Mayer were not privy to discussions about adding the frame story and strongly opposed its inclusion, believing it had deprived the film of its revolutionary and political significance; he wrote that it was [...] "an illicit violation, a raping of our work" [...] that turned the film [...] "into a cliché ... in which the symbolism was to be lost". Janowitz claims the writers sought legal action to stop the change, but were unsuccessful. He also claims they did not see the finished film with the frame story until a preview was shown to studio heads, after which the writers [...] "expressed our dissatisfaction in a storm of thunderous remonstrances". They had to be persuaded not to publicly protest the film.|$|E

2500|$|To {{learn more}} about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> {{successful}} comic-book script, he asked advice from his friend, comic-book writer Steve Moore, whom he had known since he was fourteen. Interested in writing for 2000AD, one of Britain's most prominent comic magazines, Alan Moore then submitted a script for their long running and successful series Judge Dredd. Whilst having no need for another writer on Judge Dredd, which was already being written by John Wagner, 2000ADs editor Alan Grant saw promise in Moore's work – later remarking that [...] "this guy's a really fucking good writer" [...] – and instead asked him to write some short stories for the publication's Future Shocks series. While the first few were rejected, Grant advised Moore on improvements, and eventually accepted the first of many. Meanwhile, Moore had also begun writing minor stories for Doctor Who Weekly, and later commented that [...] "I really, really wanted a regular strip. I didn't want to do short stories... But that wasn't what was being offered. I was being offered short four or five-page stories where everything {{had to be done}} in those five pages.

Okay?" [...] Lipstone then disappeared and was not seen at the sessions again. He later summoned Rózsa to his office and reprimanded him for writing [...] "Carnegie Hall music" [...] which had no place in a film. Rózsa took this as a compliment, but Lipstone assured him it was not – and suggested he listen to the music from Madame Curie to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> proper film score. When Rózsa pointed out that Double Indemnity was a love story, Lipstone suggested his music was more appropriate to The Battle of Russia. Lipstone was convinced that as soon as the studio's Artistic Director, Buddy DeSylva, heard the music he would throw it out. At a screening soon after, DeSylva called him over: expecting heads to roll, Lipstone eagerly huddled with his chief – only to have DeSylva praise the music, saying it was exactly the dissonant, hard-hitting score the film needed. The boss's only criticism: there was not enough of it. By this time Lipstone had an arm around DeSylva, asking unctuously, [...] "I always find you the right guy for the job, Buddy, don't I?" ...|$|E
