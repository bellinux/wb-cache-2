5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD <b>Group</b> <b>reported</b> that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E

5|$|Rice cultivation: In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese <b>group</b> <b>reported</b> the {{discovery}} in eastern China of fossilised phytoliths of domesticated rice apparently {{dating back to}} 11,900 BC or earlier. However, phytolith data are controversial in some quarters due to potential contamination problems. It is likely that demonstrated rice was cultivated in the middle Yangtze Valley by 7000 BC, as shown in finds from the Pengtoushan culture at Bashidang, Changde, Hunan. By 5000 BC, rice had been domesticated at Hemudu culture near the Yangtze Delta and was being cooked in pots. Although millet remained the main crop in northern China throughout history, several sporadic attempts {{were made by the}} state to introduce rice around the Bohai Gulf as early as the 1st century.|$|E
5|$|The NZX 50 Index fell by 0.4 {{percent to}} its lowest level since 20 April; within the index, a total of 24 stocks fell, while six rose and 20 {{remained}} unchanged. In addition, the New Zealand dollar declined {{in the wake of}} the disaster, reportedly dropping by nearly 0.01 US dollar, or about 1.3 percent. Following a dramatic decline in event numbers, Vbase, a council-owned venue management company, announced the disemployment of 151 of its full-time staff workers. Nationwide, building consents tumbled considerably, dropping by 4.5 percent {{in the wake of the}} aftershock. The disaster's impact extended beyond national grounds; in light of its occurrence, Insurance Australia <b>Group</b> <b>reported</b> an estimated net claim loss of A$65 million (US$61.5 million).|$|E
5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna <b>group</b> <b>reported</b> the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha decay energy 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the University of California at Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom Hearts {{series has}} been {{critically}} and commercially successful. As of March 2014, the series has sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The three main {{games in the}} series all met with positive sales {{at the time of}} their releases. In the first two months since the North American release of Kingdom Hearts, it was one of the top three highest-selling video games. Chain of Memories sold 104,000 units in 48 hours in Japan, a record for a Game Boy Advance title at the time. Its positive debut sales placed it in the top spot of sales charts in Japan. In the first month of its North American release, it was ranked 1st on GameSpot's ChartSpot for portable systems and 6th for all consoles. Within three days of the Kingdom Hearts II release in Japan, it shipped 1 million copies, selling through within a month. By the end of March 2006, the NPD <b>Group</b> <b>reported</b> that Kingdom Hearts II was the highest-selling console game in North America, with 614,000 copies. In the month after its release in North America, Kingdom Hearts II sold an estimated 1 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} rested {{here when}} the men, horses and several hundred Ottoman prisoners were watered and fed. During {{this time a}} squadron led by armoured cars went ahead to reconnoitre the track across the Mount Carmel Range from Sindiane through the Abu Shusheh Pass. The reconnaissance <b>group</b> <b>reported</b> the track across the Abu Shusheh pass rough and in a bad repair. Macandrews informed Chauvel that his division would not be ready to move from Liktera before 18:15 when the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades would advance without wheels to negotiate the pass at night. As a consequence the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade remained to guard the guns. The artillery and the Jodhpur and 1st Hyderabad Lancers, were to follow at daylight on 20 September, while the Mysore Lancers waited at Liktera for the division's transport, which they were to guard. Chauvel arrived at Liktera after midnight on 19/20 September when he ordered the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade to take the 5th Cavalry Division's guns via J'ara and Abu Shushe. They arrived at Abu Shusheh at 03:00 and rejoin their division at Afulah during the night.|$|E
5|$|The six SNA brigades around Mogadishu were as of July 2013 largely {{composed}} of officers from various Hawiye sub-clans, with some Marehan-Darod and minorities {{also present in}} certain units. Of the brigades, five primarily consisted of Abgaal, Murosade and Hawadle soldiers. In February 2013 the 2nd Brigade was {{under the command of}} Brigadier General Abdullahi Osman Agey. The 3rd Brigade over the same period comprised 840 fighters, most of whom belong to the Hawiye-Habar Gidir/Ayr clan. The unit was around 30% to 50% smaller in size than the other five brigades that are garrisoned in the larger Banaadir region. Led by General Mohamed Roble Jimale 'Gobale', it occupied an area outside of Mogadishu and Merka and along the Afgoye corridor. The Monitoring <b>Group</b> <b>reported</b> that many 3rd Brigade fighters had been drawn from around 300-strong militias controlled by Yusuf Mohamed Siyaad 'Indha Adde', a close associate of Jimale and the former Eritrean-backed chief of defence for the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia-Asmara. However, Siyaad was by then no longer part of the SNA's official military structures.|$|E
