40|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{changed the}} system of <b>delegating</b> <b>executive</b> powers to the European Commission: it {{introduced}} the delegated acts system {{as an alternative to}} comitology, which continues to exist in parallel. This new system allocates veto power to the European Parliament and the Council, in which Member State expert groups are consulted without having a formal vote. The Council fears that the absence of formal voting will tempt the Commission to ignore Member State input in the expert groups. This article investigates to what degree this fear is justified. To what degree do formal voting rights affect the consultation of Member State experts? On the basis of interviews with Member State experts who participate both in expert groups as well as in comitology committees, we demonstrate how consultation patterns differ between the two settings...|$|E

In {{order to}} maximize national interests, the state <b>delegates</b> <b>executives</b> to operate business in the energy sector by combining energy resources with other resources through a series of contracts. Yet the features of state-owned energy enterprises, such as monopoly, negative externalities, strong asset specificity and high opportunism risks, could give rise to some negative impacts. So, in order to avoid negative impacts, improve governance efficiency and achieve harmony between man and nature, we should improve government regulation system, establish a more efficient board, implement a reasonable operator incentive system, and revise the supervision and constraint mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of nondelegation is {{the theory that}} one branch of government must not authorize another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorized to exercise itself.

Although it is usually constitutional for <b>executive</b> officials to <b>delegate</b> <b>executive</b> powers to executive branch subordinates, there can also be improper delegations of powers within an executive branch.|$|R

50|$|The {{constitution}} entrusts {{the cabinet}} to craft and implement {{the most important}} regulations and policies of the state. As such, the constitution <b>delegates</b> <b>executive</b> power to the cabinet. Although the constitution does not equate the council of ministers as 'the government,' due to {{the powers of the}} prime minister, the competences of other ministers, independent bodies, and the direct representatives of the prime minister and the cabinet (voivodes) to the voivodeships who supervise the regional administrations, the cabinet carries out various governmental features. This includes the legislation and implementation of policy conducive of governing the state. Due to its constitutional mandate, the council of ministers acts as the main pillar of political authority, directing state administration, Poland's foreign policy, and much of the republic's domestic policy, unless some competences are reserved (by statute) to other organs or to local authorities.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} timeline {{can serve}} as a rough visual guide to the most important polities in the Islamic world prior to the First World War. It covers major historical centers of power and culture, including Arabia, Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), Persia (modern Iran), Levant (modern Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel/Palestine), Egypt, Maghreb (north-west Africa), al-Andalus (Iberia), Transoxania (Central Asia), Hindustan (including modern Pakistan), and Anatolia (modern Turkey). It is necessarily an approximation, since rule over some regions was sometimes divided among different centers of power, and authority in larger polities was often distributed among several dynasties. For example, during the later stages of the Abbasid Caliphate, even the capital city of Baghdad was effectively ruled by other dynasties such as the Buyyids and the Seljuks, while the Ottomans commonly <b>delegated</b> <b>executive</b> authority over outlying provinces to local potentates, such as the Deys of Algiers, the Beys of Tunis, and the Mamluks of Iraq.|$|R
