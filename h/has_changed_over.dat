5|$|Greek mythology <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time to {{accommodate}} the evolution of their culture, of which mythology, both overtly and in its unspoken assumptions, is an index of the changes.

5|$|The annual {{incidence}} of clinically recognized PanNETs is low (about 5 per one million person-years) and {{is dominated by}} the non-functioning types. Somewhere between 45% and 90% of PanNETs are thought to be of the non-functioning types. Studies of autopsies have uncovered small PanNETs rather frequently, suggesting that the prevalence of tumors that remain inert and asymptomatic may be relatively high. Overall PanNETs are thought to account for about 1 to 2% of all pancreatic tumors. The definition and classification of PanNETs <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time, affecting what is known about their epidemiology and clinical relevance.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the different scales means that {{care must be taken}} when comparing large numbers between languages or countries, or when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant scale <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time. For example, British English, French, and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale, depending on the date of the document, since each of the three countries has used both systems at various times in its history. Today, the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale, but France and Italy use the long scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} {{different from those of}} the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> the centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} the orbit is {{accurately}} known at 5.539years, although this <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time due to mass loss and accretion. The period between the Great Eruption and the smaller 1890 eruption was apparently 5.52years, while before the Great Eruption {{it may have been}} lower still, possibly between 4.8 and 5.4years. The orbital separation is only known approximately, with a semi-major axis of 15–16AU. The orbit is highly eccentric, e = 0.9. This means that the separation of the stars varies from around 1.6AU, similar to the distance of Mars from the Sun, to 30AU, similar to the distance of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{independence}} of Slovenia, the Football Association of Slovenia separated from the Football Association of Yugoslavia and created their own football competitions. For {{the first time in}} history, top Slovenian clubs competed in the newly formed Slovenian football league for the title of Slovenian champion. Of the founding clubs in the PrvaLiga, only Maribor, Gorica and Celje have not been relegated. The format and the number of clubs in the league <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time, ranging from 21 clubs in the first season to 10 clubs in its present form. The top clubs {{at the end of the}} season are awarded a qualifying spot in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League, with the bottom one being relegated to the Slovenian Second League, 2.

5|$|Plant ecology is {{the science}} of the {{functional}} relationships between plants and their habitats—the environments where they complete their life cycles. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists. This information can relay {{a great deal of}} information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> that time. The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has an {{authorised}} {{strength of}} 1,500 regular personnel and 1,500 reservists. It has never reached these totals as funding shortfalls {{have prevented the}} reserve component from being formed and the Army's two regular battalions have remained under-strength. While all the F-FDTL's personnel were initially FALINTIL veterans the force's composition <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time and few soldiers from the insurgency remain due to the force's narrow age requirement. After the F-FDTL's 1st Battalion was established in 2001 recruitment was opened to all East Timorese above the age of 18, including women. Few women have joined the F-FDTL, however, and as at February 2010 only seven percent of new recruits were female.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} ADF {{personnel}} <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> the last 20 years. During the 1990s {{the strength of}} the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the commercialisation of some elements of the military. The ADF began to grow from 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the military's strength, though the size of the military decreased between the 2003–04 to 2005–06 financial due to problems with attracting further recruits. By 2009–10 the ADF was above its budgeted size, leading to reductions until 2014–15. The ADF has not met its recruitment targets over the period since the 1995–96 financial year.|$|E

5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals {{had been known}} to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans {{and the destruction of}} the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpretation}} of Tibbers <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> time, {{and in the}} 18th century it {{was thought to be}} a Roman fort though it was later understood to be a medieval castle. The name of the castle led to the suggestion that it derived from Tiberius Caesar, however 'Tibbers' comes from the Gaelic word 'Toibar' meaning a well. The earliest recorded excavation at Tibbers Castle took place in 1864, which recovered two coins from the reign of Edward II of England (1307–1327) and a dagger from the early 15th century. The site was surveyed in 1912 with no further archaeological investigation until the 21st century. It was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937. In 2013 and 2014 the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland carried out measured and geophysical (using resistivity and a gradiometer) surveys at Tibbers with funding from Historic Scotland and the Castle Studies Trust.|$|E
