The psychologist Millais Culpin wrote the experiment was not scientific and questioned why the experiment was done under the table instead of in a more convenient position on top of it. Before the accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only two pieces, <b>Home</b> <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home</b> and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 she reprised {{her part}} as Christine from Stolen Kisses in Truffaut's Bed and Board as a married woman. The Truffaut films {{influenced}} her type as lovingly gentle modern {{young woman in}} contemporary cinema, which she contrasted in ambivalent figures: Critic Vincent Canby praised her in work in Gérard Brach's The Boat on the Grass (Le bateau sur l'herbe, 1971), in which she starred as Eleonore, a young girl between two friends (Jean-Pierre Cassel, John McEnery). She starred in Hearth Fires (Les feux de la chandeleur, 1972) as Laura, a daughter who wants to reconcile her parents (Annie Girardot, Jean Rochefort) and {{who falls in love}} with her mother's best friend (Bernard Fresson). Alongside Robert Hossein she played the priest's love Françoise in Forbidden Priests (Prêtres interdits, 1973). In <b>Home</b> <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home</b> (1973), she played a hardened nurse who is changed by a love affair with a social worker (Jacques Perrin).|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Sutherland's voice started to decline and her vibrato {{loosened}} to an intrusive extent. However, {{thanks to her}} vocal agility and solid technique, she continued singing the most difficult roles amazingly well. As her vocal security to some extent lessened, paradoxically her dramatic grasp of the theatrical moment heightened. During the 1980s, she added Anna Bolena, Amalia in I masnadieri, and Adriana Lecouvreur to her repertoire, and repeated Esclarmonde at the Royal Opera House performances in November and December 1983. Her last full-length dramatic performance was as Marguerite de Valois (Les Huguenots) at the Sydney Opera House in 1990, {{at the age of}} 63, where she sang <b>Home</b> <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home</b> for her encore. Her last public appearance, however, took place in a gala performance of Die Fledermaus on New Year's Eve, 1990, at Covent Garden, where she was accompanied by her colleagues Luciano Pavarotti and the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. According to her own words, given in an interview with The Guardian newspaper in 2002, her biggest achievement was to sing the title role in Esclarmonde. She considered those performances and recordings her best.|$|E

500|$|Musical duels {{between the}} two sides were common, as they heard each other as the music {{traveled}} across the countryside. [...] The night before the Battle of Stones River, bands from both sides dueled with separate songs until both sides started playing <b>Home!</b> <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home!,</b> at which time soldiers on both sides started singing together as one. [...] A similar situation occurred in Fredericksburg, Virginia in the winter of 18623. [...] On a cold afternoon, a Union band started playing Northern patriotic tunes; a Southern band responded by playing Southern patriotic tunes. [...] This back and forth continued into the night, until at the end both sides played <b>Home!</b> <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home!</b> simultaneously, to the cheers of both sides' forces. [...] In a third instance, in the spring of 1863, the opposing armies were on the opposite sides of the Rappahannock River in Virginia, when the different sides played their patriotic tunes, and at taps one side played <b>Home!</b> <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home!,</b> and the other joined in, creating [...] "cheers" [...] from both sides that echoed throughout the hilly countryside.|$|E

[...] Herriman still produced syndicate work, such as Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade for the World Color Printing Company beginning January 2, 1904. [...] Another of Herriman's obsessive characters, the Major traveled the world in an unsuccessful search for the purest air and spouted poetic dialogue. [...] Major Ozone was so popular that it soon was given the supplement's front page. [...] The same month, Herriman moved from the World to the New York Daily News, where {{he was given a}} larger quantity and variety of work, including cartoon reporting on sports and politics.

Pyle's grocery store. In 1855, Van Hook himself built [...] "Cedar Hill", a lavish mansion on Jefferson Street near the Fox Mansion. Dr. Arthur Christie, a wealthy Englishman, purchased 50 acres (20.25 hectares) of land {{on the north side of}} Harrison Street and named his estate Fairlawn.

2500|$|Taking {{two years}} to write, Caine’s novel The Christian was {{published}} by Heinemann in 1897. It is the first novel in Britain to have sold over a million copies [...] The book was inspired by Rossetti’s verses Mary Magdalene At The Door Of Simon The Pharisee, written for his painting, depicting a man trying to pluck back a woman {{about to enter the}} gates of heaven. Caine followed it with a lecture tour of Scotland, a one-man dramatic performance of his novelette <b>Home</b> <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home.</b> The Christian was serialised in Britain in the Windsor Magazine between December 1896 and November 1897 and in the United States in Munsey's Magazine between November 1896 and January 1898. [...] Mainly set in Victorian London, {{it is the story of}} Glory Quayle, a young woman living an independent life who becomes an actress, and John Storm, who enters the priesthood. It was the first time that Caine had taken up the Woman Question. The character of John Storm is drawn from a composite of the Hon. and Rev. [...] James Adderley, an Anglican priest of Berkley Chapel, Mayfair, London, and Father Stanton, who became an Anglican bishop. [...] Caine dramatised the book in 1896. His play was so popular with the public that the Daily Mail published it in a thick-paper, illustrated edition. He directed the play, travelling to New York where he went on to deliver a series of lectures and readings there. Viola Allen produced the play for the first time on the stage at Albany, New York on 25 September 1898. It opened at the Knickerbocker Theatre on 10 October 1898, running for twenty-one weeks in New York. Almost one thousand clergymen attended a matinee on 15 November 1898. George C. Tyler, reportedly made one million dollars from the Broadway production of The Christian. On his return to London after being on tour, Wilson Barratt gave Caine half of an advance payment received from an Australian manager for Barratt’s stage adaptation of The Christian. Caine rejected both the money and the play. Barratt unsuccessfully sued Caine on the grounds that they had an agreement to collaborate on the dramatisation. The Christian was first produced in England at the Duke of York's Theatre in October 1899. It failed after two months. Caine authorised a touring production with his sister Lily playing Glory Quayle and managed by her husband George Day which in 1907 was still continuously performed by up to three companies. After Finnish politician and writer Aino Malmberg sought aid from Caine on her country’s behalf, he offered the Finnish rights to the Finnish National Theatre. Finland belonged to the Russian Empire and was actively seeking Independence. Malmberg translated Caine's works into Finnish.|$|E
