40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Shovel logging is a {{relatively}} new ground-based method of yarding tinther. It involves moving logs from stump to landing by successive swinging with a hydraulic excavator modified into a log loader by replacing the shovel bucket with a <b>grapple.</b> <b>Loaders</b> used in shovel yarding can weigh in excess of 100, 000 pounds so that the opportunity for soil compaction is great. This study measured the amount of soil compaction that occurs with shovel yarding. The study was done on the Quinault District of the Olympic N. F. in Washington state.

40|$|Time {{equations}} {{are derived}} for felling with chainsaw, skidding with cable wheeled skidder, loading with <b>grapple</b> hydraulic <b>loader</b> and trucking of logs within a cut-to-length harvesting method. The continuous time study method {{was applied to}} collect data for felling, skidding, loading and a transportation model. Multiple regression analysis via SPSS software was applied to develop the time models. Felling time {{was found to be}} highly dependent on diameter at breast height. Skidding distance, winching distance, slope of the trail and piece volume were significant variables for the skidding time prediction model. The loading time model was developed considering piece volume. Transportation distance and load volume were used as independent variables in modeling the transportation time. The net production of felling was estimated at 12 trees/h (56. 65 m 3 /h). The net production rates for skidding, loading and traveling averaged 18. 51, 41. 90 and 3. 32 m 3 /h respectively. The total cost of harvesting from stand to mill was estimated 19. 70 €/m 3. The skidding phase was the most expensive component of the cut-to-length method. The bucking and delimbing components were less costly than the other logging phases. The results of this study can be used for harvesting planning and productivity optimization...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{excavator}} is {{used for}} not only civil engineering but also building demolition, scrap recycling and so on. The reason is thought {{that it has a}} general-purpose power supply system and is able to move by itself. In other words, it could be considered a kind of high-powered robot. As a whole, it consists of several modules. Divided roughly by each function, power module such as an engine and pumps, working module such as front structures and hydraulic actuators, traveling module such as crawlers or wheels, operation module such as control levers and pedals. In this time, to gather and carry lots of objectives in scrap yard or somewhere, both a fork <b>grapple</b> and a <b>loader</b> bucket are equipped as a working module. And to carry the objectives quickly to destination, wheeled traveling system is equipped. As a result, we have produced a multi-functional handling machine which has double front attachments and wheels. Then if operators cooperate the modules effectively, {{they will be able to}} handle their work more efficiently...|$|R
5000|$|A grapple {{truck is}} a truck {{that has a}} <b>grapple</b> <b>loader</b> mounted to its frame which is used for loading and {{sometimes}} hauling bulky waste. A <b>grapple</b> <b>loader</b> is defined by ANSI Z245.1 as:“a hydro-mechanical device able to rotate on an axis with a grapple or bucket attached {{at the end of}} the bottom, which is intended for the collection of waste that due to size and/or weight is impractical to containerize.” [...] Grapple trucks are commonly used by municipal sanitation or public works departments, and by waste collection companies. Grapple trucks can also sometimes be used in road construction and repair. There are six types of bulky waste collection system in which grapple trucks are used: loader and body systems, rear steer system, rolloff systems, rear mounted loader and haul truck systems, rear mounted loader and trailer systems, and transfer systems.|$|E

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 20, 2014). Woody biomass materials which include timber harvest residues, such as tree tops and small diameter trees, {{have the potential}} to be an important source of renewable energy. Their use as an energy feedstock or use as an input for other products is partly dependent on whether the materials can be harvested and transported to markets in a cost-efficient manner. In order to supplement the current knowledge base on woody biomass harvest systems, two integrated harvest systems, a whole tree harvest that extracted tops and a whole tree harvest that extracted tops and small diameter trees, simultaneously harvested woody biomass and conventional solid hardwood products (SHWP) on 30 acres of Missouri forestland. A mechanized system consisting of a feller-buncher, <b>grapple</b> skidder, and <b>loader</b> was used in both harvesting systems. Activity sampling and time-in-motion data were collected on all harvest machinery to determine system efficiency. Joint cost analysis was used to separate costs associated with harvesting SHWP and woody biomass. Marginal cost analysis was used to treat the tops of SHWP that were brought whole tree to the landing as a by-product of the SHWP. A sensitivity analysis was used to test the effects of changes of different costs on the cost per green ton of SHWP and woody biomass. Total cost estimates per green ton of material delivered to the landing at a 5 % interest rate were $ 35. 25 for SHWP and $ 5. 76 for woody biomass in the whole tree (WT) harvest and $ 32. 82 for SHWP and $ 8. 81 for woody biomass in the whole tree with small diameter tree (WTSD) harvest. With the addition of a chipper, woody biomass costs increased to $ 11. 11 per green ton in the WT harvest system and $ 14. 16 per green ton in the WTSD harvest system...|$|R
40|$|The {{cut-to-length}} {{method is}} a preferred method for harvest of pine plantations in Australia. The cut-to-length method studied in southern Tasmania {{consists of a}} feller-buncher, processor, forwarder, <b>grapple</b> <b>loader</b> and tractortrailers that were producing only pulp logs for the plantation owner Norske Skog. An elemental time study method was applied to evaluate the productivity of the machines within the flat terrain, Pinus radiata plantation. Multiple regression was used in SPSS to develop the productivity prediction models. The productivity of the feller-buncher and processor averaged 122. 20 m 3 per productive machine hours excluding all delays (PMH 0) and 84. 32 m 3 PMH 0 − 1, respectively. The average productivity for the forwarder, <b>grapple</b> <b>loader</b> and truck were 80. 90 m 3 PMH 0 − 1, 100. 80 m 3 PMH 0 − 1 and 27. 40 m 3 PMH 0 − 1, respectively. The average fuel consumption of the feller-buncher, forwarder and processor were also documented. The trial assessed harvest residue left on the site and found 238. 7 GMt ha− 1 (31 % of total biomass above the stump) was left of which 46 % was stemwood. These research findings {{can be used for}} harvesting planning and improving logging efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Landings are an {{integral}} part of modern whole-tree harvesting operations in New Zealand. A representative sample of 142 landings were measured using GPS; twelve recently constructed and unused, 38 live and the remaining 92 were older and closed out. The average landing size was 3900 m 2, with a range from 1370 to 12540 m 2. On average the number of log-sorts cut was 11, the landings in use for 4 weeks, estimated daily production was 287 m 3 /day, 47 % were manual processing (53 % mechanised), and 79 % were <b>grapple</b> <b>loader</b> (21 % front-end loader). A regression equation to model landing size indicates that number of log sorts and production levels are the two main factors that determine landing size. Landings do tend to ‘grow ’ over time, with used landings on average being 900 m 2 larger than recently constructed (unused) landings. Most recently constructed landings were much larger than the company design; whereby either 40 x 60 m or 40 x 80 m were common specifications. A comparable study in 1987 showed the average landing to be just over 1900 m 2, indicating landing size has nearly doubled in the last 20 years. Landings serviced by front-end loaders were on average 1100 m 2 larger than those serviced by <b>grapple</b> <b>loader,</b> but this is compounded by front-end loaders being more commonly used in high production systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} on comminution of logging residues with a tub grinder {{was carried out}} in order to calculate the productivity and procurement cost of wood chips. At the investigated site, the tub grinder had a hammer mill crusher {{at the bottom of the}} tub, and a <b>grapple</b> <b>loader</b> and a bucket loader worked as auxiliary machines for the grinder. As a result, the productivity of the tub grinder was 60. 0 loose m 3 /PMH 0, and the total comminuting cost was calculated as 5. 637 US$/m 3, indicating that the comminuting cost of a large-sized crusher was lower than that of a small-sized chipper. The percentage of the cost of loaders, that of carrying in, installing, and carrying out the machines, and that of constructing a landing was 53 % of the total comminuting cost. When a truck with the capacity of 40 m 3 transported wood chips three times a day, the costs of comminution and transportation were 71. 2 US$/t (DM 1), which is almost on a par with those of European countries in which the energy utilization of logging residues is making steady progress. As a result of the discussion about the balance between the processing capacity of the tub grinder and that of other machines, it seemed reasonable for Japanese forestry to consider the use of one tub grinder at several logging sites...|$|E

A representative sample of 142 landings were measured using GPS; twelve recently constructed and unused, 38 live and the remaining 92 were older and closed out. The average landing size was 3900 m 2, with a range from 1370 to 12540 m 2. On average 11 log sorts were cut, the landings in use for 4 weeks, and estimated daily production was 287 m 3 /day. Log processing was mechanised on 53 % of the landings and 47 % was manual processing, and most (79 %) of the operations used tracked grapple loaders (21 % used front-end loaders). A regression equation to model landing size indicated that number of log sorts and production levels are the two main factors that determine landing size. Landing size tended to increase over time, with used landings on average being 900 m 2 larger than newly constructed (unused) landings.

40|$|Landings are an {{integral}} part of modern whole-tree harvesting operations in New Zealand. A representative sample of 142 landings was measured using GPS, whereby nine were recently constructed and unused, 34 were live and the remaining 99 were older and closed out. The average landing size was 3900 m², with a range from 1370 to 12540 m². On average, the number of log-sorts cut was 11, the landings were in use for 4 weeks, estimated daily production was 287 m³/day, 37 % were manual processing (63 % mechanised), 81 % were <b>grapple</b> <b>loader</b> (19 % front-end loader). A regression equation to model landing size indicates that number of log sorts and production levels are the two main driving factors. Landings do tend to ‘grow’ over time, with used landings on average being 560 m² larger than live ones, which in turn were 280 m² larger than recently constructed (unused) landings. Most recently constructed landings were larger than the company design; whereby either 40 mx 60 m or 40 mx 80 m were common specifications. A comparable study in 1987 showed the average landing to be just over 1900 m², indicating landing size has nearly doubled in the last 20 years. Landings serviced by front-end loaders were slightly larger than those serviced by grapple, but this is compounded by front-end loaders being more commonly used in high production systems. Analyses of the schematic drawings for the live landings indicate that as landing size grows, there is a preference for using multiple rows to manage log inventory on the landing. Smaller landings typically prefer to stack around the edge of the landings...|$|E
40|$|Truck loading {{operation}} {{is an important}} task during timber production operations in forestry. In Turkey, approximately 50 million timbers/logs are being produced per year, and then they are loaded into the logging trucks. The timber/logs are transported over the forest roads {{with an average of}} one million roundtrips. However, the traditional loading methods using manpower are mostly performed while some part is done by using loading machines which can be very costly and risky. This study aims developing a combined loading system in which heavy logs are loaded into logging trucks by pulling them by a log-line powered by a portable crane within the chute system. The slope of the log-line from ground to logging truck varied between 1 % and 25 %. Within the each work cycle of {{loading operation}}, only one log was loaded by pulling with portable crane. The average loading time was found as 161. 8 seconds per cycle, in which 67 % of the time was spent on pulling the log into the logging truck. The results indicated that the average pulling speed with crane power was 840. 4 m/hr and productivity was calculated as 4. 94 m 3 /hr. The result on system speed and productivity indicated close relations with results from previous studies. The hydraulic <b>grapple</b> <b>loader</b> or cranes are widely used and common loading machines, but they cannot be efficiently used in forestry operations, especially ones having a low timber productivity rate or having low economic value timber. In these conditions, loading methods that are cost efficient and do not require higher production rate should be employed. Therefore, a combined loading system introduced in this study can be a feasible solution for loading operations in those cases. Furthermore, it is believed that this loading system integrated with a portable crane can be cost efficient and time saving solution, as well as ergonomic and safe method in the field...|$|E
