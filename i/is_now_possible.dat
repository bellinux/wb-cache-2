5|$|The Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing Gum) Regulations {{made under}} the Sale of Food Act prohibits the sale or {{advertisement}} for sale of any chewing gum. The prohibition {{does not apply}} to the sale or advertisement of any chewing gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act. Thus, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to purchase chewing gum for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose of nicotine replacement therapy) from pharmacies without a prescription.|$|E
5|$|The head {{today is}} used {{for a variety of}} reasons. Firstly it is a tourist spot where country walks can be taken all over the head due to the well defined gravel paths, some of which form part of the Bournemouth Coast Path. In 2008, many paths were resurfaced, making more (though not all) parts of the head {{wheelchair}} accessible. For example, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to gain wheelchair access to Quarry Pool. Regular field trips to the site are made by students of all ages and there are occasional guided tours or meetings around the head covering a wide variety of subjects.|$|E

5|$|Although it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> {{to reach}} the station through the Temple Quay office {{development}} (on {{the site of the}} goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E

25|$|Previously, {{the amount}} of water contaminating {{biodiesel}} has been difficult to measure by taking samples, since water and oil separate. However, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to measure the water content using water-in-oil sensors.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, UNESCO {{recognised}} {{the importance}} of the Burgess Shale by naming it a World Heritage site. Access to the Fossil Ridge quarries and Trilobite beds <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> only as part of a guided group, and the sites are under continuous surveillance by Parks Canada, with hefty fines for removing or defacing fossil material.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> {{to install}} and select non-English {{languages}} on a per-user basis which transforms the entire shell and application user interfaces based on that language.

25|$|In recent years, as {{computer}} technology {{has become more}} accessible and music software has advanced, interacting with music production technology <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> using means that bear no relationship to traditional musical performance practices: for instance, laptop performance (laptronica), live coding and Algorave. In general, the term Live PA refers to any live performance of electronic music, whether with laptops, synthesizers, or other devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{non-linear}} {{nature of}} digital audio technology {{has also made}} selecting and accessing the required recordings much more flexible than tape-based models.

25|$|Cryofixation – {{freezing}} {{a specimen}} so rapidly, in liquid ethane, and maintained at liquid nitrogen or even liquid helium temperatures, {{so that the}} water forms vitreous (non-crystalline) ice. This preserves the specimen in a snapshot of its solution state. An entire field called cryo-electron microscopy has branched from this technique. With the development of cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to observe samples from virtually any biological specimen close to its native state.|$|E
25|$|Before O. 53 was amended in 2011, the High Court did {{not have}} {{jurisdiction}} to grant a declaration under O.53 proceedings, as a declaration is not a prerogative order. If an applicant wished to obtain both prerogative orders and declarations, a separate action had to be commenced for the declarations. After the amendment, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to include a claim for a declaration if leave has been granted to the applicant to apply for prerogative orders.|$|E

Bandura instruction is also offered in all music colleges and most music schools, and it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>possible</b> to get advanced degrees specialising in bandura performance and pedagogy. The most renowned of these establishments are the Kyiv and Lviv conservatories and the Kiev University of Culture, primarily because of their well-established staff. Other centers of rising prominence are the Odessa Conservatory and Kharkiv University of Culture.|$|E
