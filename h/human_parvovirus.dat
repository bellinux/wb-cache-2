We identified and analyzed 472 sequences of parvoviruses, among which there were (virtually) full-length genomes of all 41 viruses currently recognized as individual species within the family Parvoviridae. Our phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes as well as open reading frames distinguished three evolutionary groups of parvoviruses from vertebrates: (i) the human helper-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes 1 to 6 and the autonomous avian parvoviruses; (ii) the bovine, chipmunk, and autonomous primate <b>parvoviruses,</b> including <b>human</b> viruses B 19 and V 9; and (iii) the parvoviruses from rodents (except for chipmunks), carnivores, and pigs.

No parvoviruses from invertebrates clustered with vertebrate parvoviruses.

Results: PARV 4 and B 19 V DNA detection was carried out in various tissues of individuals without suspect of acute viral infection, by a real time PCR and a nested PCR, targeting the ORF 2 and the ORF 1 respectively. Low amount of PARV 4 DNA was found frequently (> 40 %) in heart and liver of adults individuals, less frequently in lungs and kidneys (23, 5 and 18 % respectively) and was rare in bone marrow, skin and synovium samples (5, 5 %, 4 % and 5 %, respectively). By comparison, B 19 V DNA sequences were present in the same tissues with a higher frequency (significantly higher in myocardium, skin and bone marrow) except than in liver where the frequency was the same of PARV 4 DNA and in plasma samples where B 19 V frequency was significantly lower than that of PARV 4 Conclusions: The particular tropism of PARV 4 for liver and heart, here emerged, suggests to focus further studies on these tissues as possible target for viral replication and on the possible role of PARV 4 infection in liver an...|$|R
