25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>socket</b> is {{more likely}} to occur {{following}} a difficult tooth extraction.

25|$|Females {{are more}} {{frequently}} affected than males, but {{this appears to}} be related to oral contraceptive use rather than any underlying gender predilection.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of possible intra- and postoperative complications for surgical removal of third molars in the mandible poses a frequent dilemma in oral surgery. In the present study, {{the influence of}} the patient's age and gender, a reduced mouth opening, and the anatomical position of the tooth in the mandible on intra- and postoperative complications were evaluated. In a total of 120 surgically removed third molars, 9. 2 % intraoperative complications occurred, mainly bleeding. Factors influencing the risk for intraoperative complications were a male patient, a reduced mouth opening, and distally angulated teeth. Postoperative complications were encountered in 6. 7 %, mainly <b>dry</b> <b>sockets.</b> For this group, a female gender, a higher age, and distally angulated teeth were identified as risk parameters. As most of the patient- and anatomy-related factors are set parameters when evaluating possible risk factors for third molar surgery, only the timepoint of surgery can be influenced by the surgeon. Regarding the increase in intra- and postoperative complications for third molar removal in higher age groups, the prophylactic third molar surgery between the age of 18 and 25 seems justified.

25|$|A {{systematic}} review {{reported that there}} is some evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12% or 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth reduces the frequency of <b>dry</b> <b>socket.</b> Another {{systematic review}} concluded that there is evidence that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> (and infection and pain) following third molar extractions of wisdom teeth, however their use is associated with an increase in mild and transient adverse effects. The authors questioned whether treating 12 patients with antibiotics to prevent one infection would do more harm overall than good, in view of the potential side effects and also of antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, there is evidence that in individuals who are at clear risk may benefit from antibiotics. There is also evidence that antifibrinolytic agents applied to the socket after the extraction may reduce the risk of <b>dry</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>socket</b> {{occurs in}} about 0.5–5% of routine dental extractions, and in about 25–30% of extractions of {{impacted}} mandibular third molars (wisdom teeth which are {{buried in the}} bone).|$|E
40|$|This {{randomised}} {{prospective study}} aimed at evaluating possible {{differences in the}} post-operative complication rate following lower wisdom tooth surgery performed with either sterile or clean surgical gloves. The microbiological profiles of the tooth sockets and glove surfaces were also evaluated and compared. A total of 275 ASA I, non-smoking and non-drinking patients consented to be randomly assigned into two groups for lower wisdom tooth surgery, performed by operators wearing either sterile or clean gloves. All the patients returned for a post-operative assessment visit one week later. An additional 40 patients were recruited and randomised into the sterile glove group (n = 20) or the clean glove group (n = 20) for the microbiology study. Specimens {{were taken from the}} glove surfaces and the post-operative socket wounds during wisdom tooth surgery. This clinical trial showed {{no significant difference between the}} sterile and clean glove groups in the incidence of acute inflammation, acute infection and <b>dry</b> <b>sockets</b> in the wounds. No single peri-operative factor had a statistically significant effect on post-operative pain intensity. Most of the bacterial isolates from the clean gloves were Gram-positive cocci or spore-forming bacilli. The total number of colony forming units and the variety of bacterial isolates from the socket wounds in the sterile and clean glove groups were similar. The study concluded that there was no advantage in using sterile surgical gloves rather than clean gloves to minimize post-operative complications in wisdom tooth surgery. There was also no apparent relationship between the bacteria contaminating the clean glove surfaces and those isolated from the socket wounds. © 2005 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Exodontia, or {{extraction}} of teeth, {{has been a}} well-documented dental treatment that forms one of the foundations of dentistry. The steps associated with extracting teeth have changed little {{in the last century}} and these steps are largely part of the dogma of dentistry. One such step is that of socket compression post-extraction. Rationale for socket compression after extraction is manifold. They include: shorter healing times, fewer <b>dry</b> <b>sockets</b> and re-approximating walls that were stretched in the elevation and delivery stages of extractions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if post-extraction ridge compression negatively affected alveolar ridge dimensions when compared to sites that are not compressed post-extraction. Secondary outcome measures will identify if socket compression/re-approximation affects the rate of soft tissue closure or occurrence of alveolar osteitis. In this study, 14 subjects were recruited. Eight subjects formed the compression group, while six formed the non-compression group. The subjects in the compression group received compression of their alveolar ridges after extraction to approximate their original pre-extraction width. The subjects in the non-compression group did not receive ridge compression. Each subject had pre-extraction and post-extraction CBCT scans along with post-operative follow up visits at 1, 2, and 4 weeks post-extraction. The present investigation found that with respect to changes in ridge width, sites that were compressed did not lose significantly more dimension than those that were not. With respect to ridge height, sites that were compressed did not lose significantly more dimension than those that were not. Sites that were compressed and sites that were not, healed at approximately the same rate, with respect to soft tissue closure. While the results showed a lack of statistical significance between both groups, there appears to be a trend towards the ridge compression group having a smaller ridge width. Such a trend was not noted with soft tissue closure, thereby invalidating the rationale for socket compression after extraction. One of the limitations of this pilot study is the small sample size. Further validation of these results must be done with a larger sample size in order to provide clinical guidance to dental practitioners...|$|R
25|$|Dry sockets more {{commonly}} {{occur in the}} mandible than the maxilla, due to the relatively poor blood supply of the mandible and also because food debris tends to gather in lower sockets more readily than upper ones. It {{more commonly}} occurs in posterior sockets (molar teeth) than anterior sockets (premolars and incisors), possibly because {{the size of the}} created surgical defect is relatively larger, and because the blood supply is relatively poorer at these sites. <b>Dry</b> <b>socket</b> is especially associated with extraction of lower wisdom teeth. Inadequate irrigation (washing) of the socket has been associated with increased likelihood of <b>dry</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vasoconstrictors {{are present}} in most local anesthetics, and are {{intended}} to increase the length of analgesia by reducing blood supply to the region which reduces the amount of local anesthetic solution that is absorbed into the circulation and carried from the local tissues. Hence, use of local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors is {{associated with an increased}} risk of <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> occurring. However, frequently use of local anesthetic without vasoconstrictors would not provide sufficient analgesia, especially in the presence of acute pain and infection, meaning that the total dose of local anesthetic may need to be increased. Adequate pain control during the extraction is balanced against an increased risk of <b>dry</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
25|$|If a <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> occurs, {{the total}} healing time is increased. Postoperative pain is also {{worse than the}} normal {{discomfort}} which accompanies healing following any minor surgical procedure. The pain may last for seven to forty days.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{most serious}} dental {{injuries}} are avulsion of a tooth in children. Avulsion of permanent teeth accounts for approximately 0. 5 %- 16 % of dental trauma. The prognosis of replanted tooth mainly {{related to the}} injury of the periodontal membrane during the time the tooth is out of its <b>socket.</b> <b>Dry</b> storage of tooth will result in an irreversible injury to periodontal membrane {{with the result that}} the replanted tooth will be lost over a period of time. Objectives: To assess the present knowledge level of tooth avulsion among school children in Nalgonda. Materials & Method: A cross sectional questionnaire study was carried out on primary and secondary school children of Nalgonda, aged 7 - 1 4 years. A total of 500 children were randomly selected from both government and private schools. A close-ended, pretested and self administered questionnaire which was written in local language was distributed. The questionnaire contained 10 questions pertaining to tooth avulsion. Results: Aboutl 8. 8 % of the children had experienced dental trauma in the past, Many children knew that a tooth could be knocked out but few (14. 4 %) had knowledge that same tooth could be replanted. 48. 3 % said that washing tooth was necessary before reimplantation and majority (83. 1 %) said that they had not received any advice on tooth avulsion management. Conclusions: Overall assessment of the children showed a low level of knowledge regarding tooth avulsion and replantation principle. There is need for comprehensive dental educational programmes and oral health promotion amongst school children to improve their knowledge on tooth avulsion and replantation...|$|R
30|$|Nineteen male Sprague–Dawley rats {{weighing}} 250 – 350  g {{were used}} in this study. The experimental protocol {{was approved by the}} Animal Research Ethics Committee of Marmara University, Istanbul, TURKEY (Ethic Protocol Number: 30.2011.mar). The animals were fed with a soft diet (increased fat pellet feed) and water ad libitum after surgery. The animals were divided into three groups involving (1) control (4 rats, 8 teeth), (2) FS group (7 rats 14 teeth) and (3) ATSCs + FS group (8 rats, 16 teeth). The animals received an intramuscular injection of xylazine chlorhydrate (Rompun®, Bayer Healthcare, Toronto, Canada) at the dose of 6  mg/kg to attain muscular relaxation and were anesthetized with ketamine chlorhydrate (Ketasol, Richter Pharma AG, Wels, Australia) at the dose of 35  mg/kg. A clean operational field was obtained with a 2  % chlorhexidine solution (Clorhexidina s; FGM Dental Products, Dentscare Ltda., Setubal, Portugal) followed by syndesmotomy, luxation and non-traumatic extraction of maxillary central incisors (2 incisors per rat) using extraction forceps of all animals simulating a case of tooth avulsion. Dental papilla located in the apical region was removed. To minimize pulpal infection as stimulus for external root resorption, the pulp tissue was extirpated through a retrograde route with a slightly curved # 15 file (Flexofile, Dentsply-Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). Root canal instrumentation was completed using # 20 or # 25 files. Root canals were irrigated with saline (Polifarma Ltda.; Istanbul, Turkey) and fluid was aspirated. Canals were dried with paper points (DiaDent Europe B.V.; Almere, The Netherlands) and obturated with calcium hydroxide paste (Sultan Healthcare, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apical accesses were filled with glass ionomer cement (Kavitan® Plus, Spofa Dental, Jicin, Czech Republic). The extracted teeth were held by their crowns, fixed on a red wax plate and kept dry at room temperature (20 – 24  °C) for 60  min. After 60  min <b>dry</b> storage, the <b>sockets</b> were gently irrigated with saline and the teeth were replanted without any material (control group), with FS (Tisseel Lyo, Eczacıbaşı-Baxter, Istanbul, Turkey) or with ATSCs + FS. In FS group, 200  µl of FS was placed into the alveolar socket before replantation. In ATSCs + FS group, 100  µl thrombin solution containing ATSCs (1  ×  106) was mixed with 100  µl protein concentrate and immediately applied to the alveolar socket just before replantation. The replanted teeth did not receive any immobilization. The animals received a single dose of benzathine G penicillin 20, 000  IU (Deposilin, I.E. Ula gay, Istanbul, Turkey), via intramuscular injection.|$|R
25|$|Other {{possible}} {{risk factors}} include periodontal disease, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, local bone disease, Paget's disease of bone, osteopetrosis, cemento-osseous dysplasia, {{a history of}} previously developing a <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> with past extractions and inadequate oral hygiene. Other factors in the postoperative period {{that may lead to}} loss of the blood clot include forceful spitting, sucking through a straw, and coughing or sneezing.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> occurs {{exclusively}} {{following a}} dental extraction, {{it could be}} considered both a complication and an iatrogenic condition, {{but this does not}} take into account both the reason why the tooth required extraction (i.e., extraction may have been unavoidable due to significant pain and infection) and also the fact that many dry sockets are the result of poor compliance with postoperative instructions, notably refraining from smoking in the days immediately after the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Some dentists {{and oral}} {{surgeons}} routinely debride the bony {{walls of the}} socket to encourage hemorrhage (bleeding) {{in the belief that}} this reduces the incidence of <b>dry</b> <b>socket,</b> but {{there is no evidence to}} support this practice. It has been suggested that dental extractions in females taking oral contraceptives be scheduled on days without estrogen supplementation (typically days 23–28 of the menstrual cycle). It has also been suggested that teeth to be extracted be scaled prior to the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Alveolar osteitis usually occurs {{where the}} blood clot fails to form or is lost from the socket (i.e., the defect {{left in the}} gum when a tooth is taken out). This leaves an empty socket where bone is exposed to the oral cavity, causing a {{localized}} alveolar osteitis limited to the lamina dura (i.e., the bone which lines the socket). This specific type of alveolar osteitis {{is also known as}} <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> or, less commonly, fibrinolytic alveolitis, and is associated with increased pain and delayed healing time.|$|E
25|$|Cochrane {{investigation}} {{found that the}} use of antibiotics either just before or just after surgery reduced the risk of infection, pain and <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> after wisdom teeth are removed by oral surgeons, but that using antibiotics also causes more side effects for these patients. Twelve patients needed to receive antibiotics to prevent 1 infection and for every 21 people who received antibiotics, an adverse event was likely. The conclusion of the review was that antibiotics given to healthy people to prevent infections may cause more harm than benefit to both the individual patients and the population as a whole. Another Cochrane Investigation has found post-operative pain is effectively managed with either ibuprofen, or ibuprofen in combination with acetaminophen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>socket</b> {{typically}} causes pain on {{the second}} to fourth day following a dental extraction. Other causes of post extraction pain usually occur immediately after the anesthesia/analgesia has worn off, (e.g., normal pain from surgical trauma or mandibular fracture) or has a more delayed onset (e.g., osteomyelitis, which typically causes pain several weeks following an extraction). Examination typically involves gentle irrigation with warm saline and probing of the socket to establish the diagnosis. Sometimes part of {{the root of the}} tooth or a piece of bone fractures off and is retained in the socket. This can be another cause of pain in a socket, and causes delayed healing. A dental radiograph (x-ray) may be indicated to demonstrate such a suspected fragment.|$|E
25|$|The cause(s) of <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> are not {{completely}} understood. Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is extravasated into the socket, and a blood clot (thrombus) forms. This blood clot is replaced with granulation tissue which consists of proliferating fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from remnants of the periodontal membrane, surrounding alveolar bone and gingival mucosa. In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, fibrillar bone and finally by mature, woven bone. The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g., secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause sclerotic bone to form). The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the degeneration of the clot and {{may be caused by}} the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and formation of kinins. Factors which promote fibrinolysis include local trauma, estrogens, and pyrogens from bacteria.|$|E
500|$|Antibiotics {{tend to be}} {{extensively}} {{used for}} emergency dental problems. As samples for microbiologic culture and sensitivity are hardly ever carried out in general dental practice, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin are typically used for a short course of about three to seven days. Antibiotics {{are seen as a}} [...] "quick fix" [...] by both dentists, who generally only have a very short time to manage dental emergencies, and by patients, who tend to want to avoid treatments (such as tooth extraction) which are perceived negatively. However, antibiotics typically only temporarily suppress an infection, and the need for definitive treatment is only postponed for an unpredictable length of time. An estimated 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions are made by dentists, a major factor in antibiotic resistance. They are often used inappropriately, in conditions for which they are ineffective, or their risks outweigh the benefits, such as irreversible pulpitis, apical abscess, <b>dry</b> <b>socket,</b> or mild pericoronitis. However, the reality is that antibiotics are rarely needed, and they should be used restrictively in dentistry. Local measures such as incision and drainage, and removal of the cause of the infection (such as a necrotic tooth pulp) have a greater therapeutic benefit and are much more important. If abscess drainage has been achieved, antibiotics are not usually necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking {{and tobacco}} {{use of any}} kind are {{associated}} with increased risk of <b>dry</b> <b>socket.</b> [...] This may be partially due to the vasoconstrictive action of nicotine on small blood vessels. Abstaining from smoking in the days immediately following a dental extraction {{reduces the risk of}} a <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> occurring.|$|E
2500|$|Often, {{the term}} {{alveolar}} osteitis is considered synonymous with [...] "dry socket", but some specify that <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> is a focal or localized alveolar osteitis. An example of {{another type of}} osteitis is focal sclerosing/condensing osteitis. The name <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> is used because the socket has a dry appearance once the blood clot is lost and debris is washed away.|$|E
2500|$|An empty socket, {{which is}} {{partially}} or totally devoid of blood clot. Exposed bone may be visible or the socket may {{be filled with}} food debris which reveals the exposed bone once it is removed. The exposed bone is extremely painful and sensitive to touch. Surrounding inflamed soft tissues may overlie the socket and hide the <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> from casual examination.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{is usually}} symptomatic, (i.e., {{analgesic}} medications) {{and also the}} removal of debris from the socket by irrigation with saline or local anesthetic. Medicated dressings are also commonly placed in the socket; although these will act as a foreign body and prolong healing, they are usually needed due to the severe pain. Hence, the dressings are usually stopped once the pain is lessened. Examples of medicated dressings include antibacterials, topical anesthetics and obtundants, or combinations of all three, e.g., zinc oxide and eugenol impregnated cotton pellets, alvogyl (eugenol, iodoform and butamen), dentalone, bismuth subnitrate and iodoform paste (BIPP) on ribbon gauze and metronidazole and lidocaine ointment. A systematic review of the efficacy of treatments for <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> {{concluded that there was}} not enough evidence to discern the effectiveness of any treatments. People who develop a <b>dry</b> <b>socket</b> typically seek medical/dental advice several times after the dental extraction, where the old dressing is removed, the socket irrigated and a new dressing placed. Curettage of the socket increases the pain and has been discouraged by some.|$|E
