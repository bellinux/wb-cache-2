50|$|<b>Electrostrictive</b> graft {{polymers}} {{consist of}} flexible backbone chains with branching side chains. The side chains on neighboring backbone polymers cross link and form crystal units. The backbone and side chain crystal units can then form polarized monomers, which contain atoms with partial charges and generate dipole moments, shown in Figure 2. When an electrical field is applied, a {{force is applied}} to each partial charge and causes rotation of the whole polymer unit. This rotation causes <b>electrostrictive</b> strain and deformation of the polymer.|$|E
50|$|Because {{materials}} {{exist that}} couple strain to electrical polarization (piezoelectrics, <b>electrostrictives,</b> and ferroelectrics) and that couple strain to magnetization (magnetostrictive/magnetoelastic/ferromagnetic materials), {{it is possible}} to couple magnetic and electric properties indirectly by creating composites of these materials that are tightly bonded so that strains transfer from one to the other.|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} half of the eighties the {{development}} of new kinds of structural systems, called smart, intelligent, or adaptive, was initiated first in the USA and soon after in Japan. Apart from suitable sensors and controllers, emphasis was placed on actuator systems of thermally, electrically or magnetically activaitable materials (piezo-electrics, <b>electrostrictives,</b> magnetostrictives, electro- and magnetorheological fluids, etc.) capable of being inte-grated into appropriate structural components, thus enabling the structure to adapt automatically to changing environmental and operational conditions. Approximately five years later similar efforts were also started in Europe, especially in Germany, leading to the development of so-called adaptronic structures. These structures are characterized by their multifunctionality, i. e. adaptronic actuator systems are structurally integrated such that they serve not only as actuators but also as loadcarrying members of the structure itself. With respect to the fail-safe principle prevalent in aircraft design, this implies that the actuator elements ought to be operated parallel to passive load-carrying structural elements, allowing not only a sensible distribution of operationally induced loads on active and passive structural elements, but sufficient residual strength after a failure of the actuation function as well. The Institute of Structural Mechanics (ISM) at the German Aerospace Center is working on several projects, concerning adaptive structures. This paper focuses on some aeronautical applications, that are subject of current investigations. The following applications have the objective to increase the efficiency of cruise and high lift flight of transport airplanes by deforming the wing trailing edge and building up a bump at the upper surface of the wing. Since the actuation is relatively slow, a so called quasi static actuator concept can be applied. Wings of modern transport airplanes have a fixed geometry, optimized for a certain design point in cruise flight, described by the parameters altitude, mach number and aircraft weight. Since these parameters vary constantly, the airplane normally flies outside the design point, leading to a decreased performance. Changing the geometry of the airfoil during cruise flight by deforming the wings trailing edge leads to a much higher efficiency. The ISM has developed two variable chamber concepts to realize an adaptation of the airfoil, the finger concept and the belt rib concept. Both concepts are even capable of a spanwise differential deformation, enabling them to change the spanwise lift distribution in order to decrease the bending moment at the wing root, allowing a lighter construction of the wing itself. A bump on the upper wing surface decreases the wave drag significantly. The bump is extended in that area of the profile, where an expansion shock due to local supersonic flow speed oc-curs. The position of the bump can be adapted to the position of the expansion shock, thus providing a configura-tion with the lowest possible drag. During high lift flight with flaps extended, these are deformed in spanwise direction due to the applied airload. With a structurally integrated actuator system it is possible to re-deform the flap in order to provide an optimal gap size between wing and flap, leading to a much better high lift behavior. There are also projects, where the dynamic behavior of aerospace structures is increased by means of adaptron-ics. One example is concerned with vibrations of the vertical stabilizer on fighter aircraft due to vortexes, gener-ated by the wings leading edge. They are reduced by means of an active interface, made of piecoceramic stack actuators, thus resulting in reduced structural loading. Adaptronic solutions can also be applied to the suppression of vibrations in propeller-driven airplanes. If some elements of the passive strut/truss structure between power plant and airframe are substituted by active parts, it is possible to reduce propeller induced vibrations, leading to a higher passenger comfort and reduced dynamic loading of the airframe. Present helicopter research mainly focuses on the improvement of the aerodynamic efficiency and on the reduc-tion of vibrations and acoustic emission. Adaptronics have a high potential to efficiently achieve this goal. The Adaptive Blade Twist concept, developed by ISM, allows to directly control the twist of the helicopter blades by smart adaptive elements and through this to positively influence the main rotor area which is the primary source for helicopter noise and vibrations. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the current state of the art of adaptronic applications in the field of aero-nautics with some examples, to point out existing deficits, and to identify new application areas, in order to pre-pare the ground for a rapid transfer of adaptronic concepts into industrial practic...|$|R

50|$|In the future, Woodward {{plans to}} scale thrust levels, {{switching}} {{from the current}} piezoelectric dielectric ceramics (PZT stacks) to new high-κ dielectric nanocomposite polymers, like PMN, PMN-PT or CCTO. Nevertheless, such materials are new, quite difficult to find, and are <b>electrostrictive,</b> not piezoelectric.|$|E
50|$|Copolymers of PVDF {{are also}} used in {{piezoelectric}} and <b>electrostrictive</b> applications. One {{of the most commonly}} used copolymers is P(VDF-trifluoroethylene), usually available in ratios of about 50:50 wt% and 65:35 wt% (equivalent to about 56:44 mol% and 70:30 mol%). Another one is P(VDF-tetrafluoroethylene). They improve the piezoelectric response by improving the crystallinity of the material.|$|E
50|$|As a result, carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have been}} shown to be great materials for actuation related applications. The subfield of carbon nanotube actuators have been quite successful and ready for scalable applications considering there are quite a few conventional and scalable methods for the synthesis of large scale carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotube sheets used as electrodes in electrolyte solutions offered low voltage operations at room temperature with actuation strokes and rates comparable to the conducting polymer actuators, but with higher work densities per cycle and life times. However the actuation strokes are much smaller than those of the <b>electrostrictive</b> rubbers which operate at three orders of magnitude higher voltages. On the other hand, realization of carbon nanotube aerogels made giant strokes possible comparable to <b>electrostrictive</b> rubbers at room temperature, but carbon nanotube aerogels can perform at a very wide range of temperatures, and with very high actuation rates, which are even better than the actuation rate of the human muscles.|$|E

One or more of (active) layers are fabricated from a piezoelectric or <b>electrostrictive</b> material. Electrode structure is patterned on the active layer to facilitate local response. The mirror is deformed when a voltage is applied {{to one or more}} of its electrodes, causing them to extend laterally, which results in local mirror curvature. Bimorph mirrors are rarely made with more than 100 electrodes.|$|E
50|$|Electroactive {{polymers}} (EAPs) are polymers {{that can}} be actuated {{through the application of}} electric fields. Currently, the most prominent EAPs include piezoelectric polymers, dielectric actuators (DEAs), <b>electrostrictive</b> graft elastomers, liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and ferroelectric polymers. While these EAPs can be made to bend, their low capacities for torque motion currently limit their usefulness as artificial muscles. Moreover, without an accepted standard material for creating EAP devices, commercialization has remained impractical. However, significant {{progress has been made in}} EAP technology since the 1990s.|$|E

While {{ferroelectric}} ferroelastics (with their associated piezoelectric and <b>electrostrictive</b> coupling) and ferromagnetic ferroelastics (with piezomagnetic and magnetomechanical coupling) are formally multiferroics, these days the term is usually {{used to describe the}} magnetoelectric multiferroics that are simultaneously ferromagnetic and ferroelectric. Sometimes the definition is expanded to include non-primary order parameters, such as antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism. In addition other types of primary order, such as ferroic arrangements of magneotelectric multipoles of which ferrotoroidicity is an example, have also been recently proposed.|$|E
50|$|Electrohydro{{dynamics}} (EHD), {{also known}} as electro-fluid-dynamics (EFD) or electrokinetics, {{is the study of}} the dynamics of electrically charged fluids. It is the study of the motions of ionized particles or molecules and their interactions with electric fields and the surrounding fluid. The term may be considered to be synonymous with the rather elaborate <b>electrostrictive</b> hydrodynamics. ESHD covers the following types of particle and fluid transport mechanisms: electrophoresis, electrokinesis, dielectrophoresis, electro-osmosis, and electrorotation. In general, the phenomena relate to the direct conversion of electrical energy into kinetic energy, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Dielectric EAPs are {{materials}} in which actuation {{is caused by}} electrostatic forces between two electrodes which squeeze the polymer. Dielectric elastomers are capable of very high strains and are fundamentally a capacitor that changes its capacitance when a voltage is applied by allowing the polymer to compress in thickness and expand in area due to the electric field. This type of EAP typically requires a large actuation voltage to produce high electric fields (hundreds to thousands of volts), but very low electrical power consumption. Dielectric EAPs require no power to keep the actuator at a given position. Examples are <b>electrostrictive</b> polymers and dielectric elastomers.|$|E
50|$|Terpolymers of PVDF are {{the most}} {{promising}} one in terms of electromechanically induced strain. The most commonly used PVDF-based terpolymers are P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE). This relaxor-based ferroelectric terpolymer is produced by random incorporation of the bulky third monomer (CTFE) into the polymer chain of P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer (which is ferroelectric in nature). This random incorporation of CTFE in P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer disrupts the long-range ordering of the ferroelectric polar phase, resulting {{in the formation of}} nano-polar domains. When an electric field is applied, the disordered nano-polar domains change their conformation to all-trans conformation, which leads to large <b>electrostrictive</b> strain and a high room-temperature dielectric constant of ~50.|$|E

The {{effect can be}} observed in single phase and composite materials. Some examples of single phase magnetoelectrics are Cr2O3, and multiferroic materials which show a coupling between the magnetic and electric order parameters. Composite magnetoelectrics are combinations of magnetostrictive and <b>electrostrictive</b> materials, such as ferromagnetic and piezoelectric materials.The size of the effect depends on the microscopic mechanism. In single phase magnetoelectrics the effect can be due to the coupling of magnetic and electric orders as observed in some multiferroics. In composite materials the effect originates from interface coupling effects, such as strain.Some of the promising applications of the ME effect are sensitive detection of magnetic fields, advanced logic devices and tunable microwave filters.|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{actuator}} strain for electrically driven actuators {{of carbon}} nanotube sheets {{can be improved}} up to 0.7% in a 1 M electrolyte once the sheets are annealed in an inert atmosphere at very high temperatures (1100 oC) in contrast to once reported 0.1% or less for low electrochemical potentials (~1 V or less). The maximum strain for the carbon nanotube sheet actuators at low voltages is {{greater than that of}} the high modulus ferroelectric ceramic actuators (~0.1%), but it is lower than that of the low voltage (~0.4 V) conducting polymer actuators (~3% film direction, 20% thickness direction). Strokes were reported as high as 215% for strain biased low modulus <b>electrostrictive</b> rubbers under biases greater than 1kV (corresponding to an electric field 239 MV/m for the geometry mentioned in the reference paper). Spinks et al. realized pneumatic actuation from the carbon nanotube sheets in electrolyte solutions with high electrochemical potential (1.5 V), which cause gas generation in the electrolyte. The released gas dramatically increases the actuator stroke from the carbon nanotube sheet. Thickness of the carbon nanotube sheet expands by ~300% and the sheet plane contracts by 3%.|$|E
50|$|Researchers of AlliedSignal {{initially}} {{demonstrated the}} possibility of electrically powered actuators fabricated by carbon nanotube sheets. They taped carbon nanotube sheets on two sides of a double sided scotch tape and applied potential on the nanotube sheets in a NaCl electrolyte solution. Nanotube sheets are used as electrolyte-filled electrodes of a super capacitor. Nanotube sheets are electrically charged by the double layer formation at the nanotube-electrolyte interface without any need of ion intercalation. Therefore, electrically driven actuators of nanotube sheets are superior to the conjugated polymer actuators which involve solid-state dopant diffusion and structural changes limiting rate, cycle life and energy conversion efficiencies. On the other hand, ferroelectric and <b>electrostrictive</b> materials are also very useful for direct energy conversion, but they require high operation voltages and ambient temperature of a limited range. Nanotube sheet actuators were shown to operate at low voltages (~1 Volts or less) and provide higher work densities per cycle than other alternative technologies. Later Baughman et al. showed that actuator response can be observed up to switching rates of 1 kHz and cycling the nanotube actuator at constant rate of 1 Hz for 140000 cycles decreases the stroke by ~33%. 0.75 MPa of stress were measured on the nanotube sheet actuators, which {{is greater than the}} maximum stress (0.3 MPa) that can be loaded on a human muscle.|$|E
