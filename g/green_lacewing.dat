25|$|A {{variety of}} natural enemies exist. One survey in Egypt noted 12 species of {{parasitoid}} wasps on the citrus mealybug. It also recorded nine predatory insects, including ladybird beetles, moths, a gall midge, and a <b>green</b> <b>lacewing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Agents of {{biological}} control include {{a number of}} parasitoid wasps that attack the nymphs, including Leptomastidea abnormis, Leptomastix dactylopii, Chrysoplatycerus splendens, and Anagyrus pseudococci. Predators include the brown lacewing Sympherobius barberi, the <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> Chrysopa lateralis, hoverfly larvae, and the scale-feeding snout-moth larva. The mealybug destroyer (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri), a ladybird beetle, readily attacks the citrus mealybug.|$|E
25|$|Chrysoperla carnea, {{known as}} the common <b>green</b> <b>lacewing,</b> is an insect in the Chrysopidae family. It is found {{in many parts of}} America, Europe and Asia. Although the adults feed on nectar, pollen and aphid honeydew, the larvae are active predators and feed on aphids and other small insects. It has been used in the {{biological}} control of insect pests on crops.|$|E
25|$|The <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> adults overwinter {{buried in}} leaf litter {{at the edge}} of fields or other rough places, {{emerging}} when the weather warms up in spring. Each female lacewing lays several hundred small eggs at the rate of two to five per day, choosing concealed spots underneath leaves or on shoots near potential prey. The eggs are normally laid during the hours of darkness.|$|E
25|$|The <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> {{eggs are}} oval and secured {{to the plant}} by long slender stalks. They are pale green when first laid but become gray later. The larvae are about one {{millimetre}} long when they first hatch. They are brown and resemble small alligators, crawling actively around in search of prey. They have a pair of pincer-like mandibles on their head with which they grasp their prey, sometimes lifting the victim off the leaf surface to prevent its escape. The larvae inject enzymes into the bodies of their victims which digest the internal organs, after which they suck out the liquidated body fluids. The larvae grow to about eight millimetres long before they spin circular cocoons and pupate.|$|E

5000|$|Chrysoperla {{species are}} {{sometimes}} nearly identical morphologically, {{but can be}} readily separated based on the vibration signals used to attract mates. For example, the southern European Chrysoperla mediterranea looks almost identical to its northern relative C. carnea (common <b>green</b> <b>lacewing),</b> but their courtship [...] "songs" [...] are very different; individuals of one species will not react to the other's vibrations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> adults overwinter {{buried in}} leaf litter {{at the edge}} of fields or other rough places, {{emerging}} when the weather warms up in spring.

50|$|In Chrysoperla carnea, the <b>green</b> <b>lacewing,</b> {{the organ}} is {{involved}} in sexual behaviour and interindividual or even interspecies communication. A velum spans the interior of each leg and is formed by cap cells. Three scolopidia stretch from the velum to the leg wall, each containing one sensory neuron with a dendrite and attached cilia. The dendrite is accompaigned by a so-called scolopale cell which generates an electron-rich intracellular structure surrounding the dendrite.|$|E
50|$|The fossil {{insects are}} {{particularly}} diverse and well preserved, and include an extinct bulldog ant Macabeemyrma ovata, {{a species of}} <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae) (Archaeochrysa profracta), and stick insects (Phasmatodea). A species of fossil freshwater crayfish (Aenigmastacus crandalli) was described from the McAbee Fossil Beds. The very high diversity of fossil insects in the McAbee fossil beds is {{comparable to that of}} modern-day tropical forest areas. Most recently, fossil palm beetles (Bruchidae) were described from the beds, confirming the presence of palms (Arecaceae) in the local environment in the early Eocene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>lacewing</b> larvae have {{voracious}} appetites, so {{will attack}} whiteflies, {{as well as}} other pests, including aphids, mealybugs, spider mites, leafhopper larvae, moth eggs, scales, and thrips. They also can attack other insects, including caterpillars. They are available as eggs from commercial insectaries, and will stay in a larval stage after they hatch for one to three weeks. The adult insects can fly and will feed only on pollen, honey, and nectar to reproduce. Repeated application may be necessary and the eggs could be eaten before they hatch by their natural predators, such as ants or mature green lacewings.|$|E
50|$|In high school, Elgin studied fallout {{levels in}} Oregon {{rainwater}} after {{nuclear weapons tests}} in the Soviet Union. She received her B.A. in chemistry from Pomona College. While at Pomona, she participated in a summer research program at the University of Leeds characterizing the egg stalk of the <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> fly Chrysopa vittata. Elgin did her graduate work in the lab of James Bonner at the California Institute of Technology, isolating and characterizing nonhistone chromosomal proteins from rat livers. She received her Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1972. Elgin stayed at Caltech for her postdoctoral research, working in the lab of Leroy Hood. She continued to isolate and characterize nonhistone chromosomal proteins but started studying Drosophila.|$|E

5000|$|Adults have tympanal organs at the forewings' base, {{enabling}} them to hear well. Some Chrysopa show evasive behavior when they hear a bat's ultrasound calls: when in flight, they close their wings (making their echolocational signature smaller) and drop down to the ground. Green lacewings also use substrate or body vibrations {{as a form of}} communication between themselves, especially during courtship. Species which are nearly identical morphologically may sometimes be separated more easily based on their mating signals. For example, the southern European Chrysoperla mediterranea looks almost identical to its northern relative C. carnea (Common <b>Green</b> <b>Lacewing),</b> but their courtship [...] "songs" [...] are very different; individuals of one species will not react to the other's vibrations.|$|E
50|$|Paleontological and {{geological}} {{studies of}} similar deposits to Driftwood Canyon occurring {{to the east}} and further south in the interior of British Columbia go back to work carried out by George Mercer Dawson and John William Dawson in the 1870s to 1890s as part of the survey of British Columbia for the Geological Survey of Canada, and D.P. Penhallow's work on Cenozoic Era plants. Fossil fish from Driftwood Canyon in the Canadian Museum of Nature include specimens collected in the 1930s; however, the Driftwood Canyon (also known as Driftwood Creek beds) fossils have only been studied since the 1950s. The Driftwood Canyon fossil beds are best known for the abundant and well-preserved insect and fish fossils (Amia, Amyzon, and Eosalmo). The insects are particularly diverse and well preserved, and include water striders (Gerridae), aphids (Aphididae), leaf hoppers (Cicadellidae), green lacewings (Neuroptera), spittle bugs (Cercopidae), march flies (Bibionidae), scorpionflies (Mecoptera), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae), snout beetles (Curculionidae), and ichneumon wasps. A fossil species of <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae) was recently named Pseudochrysopa harveyi to honour the founder of the park, Gordon Harvey. Fossil feathers are sometimes found and rare rodent bones are sometimes found in fish coprolites. Most recently, fossil palm beetles (Bruchidae) were described from the beds, confirming the presence of palms (Arecaceae) in the local environment in the early Eocene.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Cry {{proteins}} of Bacillus thuringiensis on the <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> (Chrysoperla carnea) was studied {{by using a}} holistic approach which consisted of independent, complementary experimental strategies. Tritrophic experiments were performed, in which lacewing larvae were fed Helicoverpa armigera larvae reared on Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 Ab, or Cry 2 Ab toxins. In complementary experiments, a predetermined amount of purified Cry 1 Ac was directly fed to lacewing larvae. In both experiments no effects on prey utilization or fitness parameters were found. Since binding to the midgut is an indispensable step for toxicity of Cry proteins to known target insects, we hypothesized that specific binding of the Cry 1 A proteins should be found if the proteins were toxic to the <b>green</b> <b>lacewing.</b> In control experiments, Cry 1 Ac was detected bound to the midgut epithelium of intoxicated H. armigera larvae, and cell damage was observed. However, no binding or histopathological effects of the toxin were found in tissue sections of lacewing larvae. Similarly, Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac bound in a specific manner to brush border membrane vesicles from Spodoptera exigua but not to similar fractions from <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> larvae. The in vivo and in vitro binding results strongly suggest that the lacewing larval midgut lacks specific receptors for Cry 1 Ab or Cry 1 Ac. These results agree with those obtained in bioassays, and we concluded that the Cry toxins tested, even at concentrations higher than those expected in real-life situations, {{do not have a}} detrimental effect on the <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> when they are ingested either directly or through the pre...|$|E

30|$|Additionally, Dutton et al. (2002) and Obrist et al. (2006) did {{not find}} any direct effect for Cry 1 A protein class on {{lacewing}} larvae. Considering that the <b>green</b> <b>lacewing</b> is a generalist predator which, in addition to feeding on lepidopteran larvae and mites, also feeds on aphids and other insect eggs in the field, {{it is highly unlikely that}} Bt crops pose any risk to this beneficial predator.|$|E
