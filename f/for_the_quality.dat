5|$|A {{video of}} the Stockholm {{performance}} of the Final Fantasy VI Symphonic Poem was released on October 11, 2014, and a full album recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios was released on February 23, 2015 by Merregnon Studios. The album, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the performance and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces {{rather than relying on}} a more traditional medley. The concert series was followed by Final Symphony II, a similar concert tour by Merregnon Studios which began in 2015 with music from Final Fantasy V, VII, IX, and XIII.|$|E
5|$|A {{video of}} the Stockholm {{performance}} of the Final Fantasy VIII section was released on September 23, 2016, and unlike the original Final Symphony no album release has been announced to date. The concerts have been heavily praised, both <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the performance and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the arrangements. Critics have claimed the concerts {{to be one of}} the highest quality video game music orchestral performances produced, along with the original Final Symphony, with the second tour considered to have simpler arrangement styles than the first but in turn be more approachable to audiences.|$|E

These performances featured slightly modified {{versions of the}} original arrangements, and like the original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the performance and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces {{rather than relying on}} a traditional medley.|$|E

Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability.

40|$|Introduction: The {{review of}} medical records {{with the aim}} of {{assessing}} <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of codes has long been conducted in different countries. Auditing medical coding, as an instructive approach, could help to review <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of codes objectively using defined attributes, and this in turn would lead to improvement of <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of codes. Method: The current study aimed to present a model <b>for</b> auditing <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of clinical codes. The audit model was formed after reviewing other audit models, considering their strengths and weaknesses. A clear definition was presented for each quality attribute and more detailed criteria were then set <b>for</b> assessing <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of codes. Results: The audit tool (based on <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> attributes included legibility, relevancy, completeness, accuracy, definition and timeliness); led to development of an audit model <b>for</b> assessing <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of medical coding. Delphi technique was then used to reassure the validity of the model. Conclusion: The inclusive audit model designed could provide a reliable and valid basis <b>for</b> assessing <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of codes considering more quality attributes and their clear definition. The inter-observer check suggested in the method of auditing is of particular importance to reassure the reliability of coding...|$|R

5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter.

5|$|Recalling his {{homesickness}} {{and loneliness}} {{the last time}} he had ventured abroad, for his next foreign trip Etty travelled in the company of Richard Evans, who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence. Despite warnings that Italy would be uncomfortably hot, the two men set out on 23June 1822 with the aim of reaching Rome. Crossing to France by means of the recently developed steamboat, they arrived in Paris on 26June. They stayed in Paris for two weeks, visiting Versailles and the city's public art galleries; they also visited the much-reduced remaining exhibits of the Louvre. The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time, at which Etty felt a great dislike <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of portraiture in France, but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections, in particular Rubens's Marie de' Medici cycle, elements of which he would later reuse in many of his own works.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> {{of the meat}} and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered {{to have some of}} the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
