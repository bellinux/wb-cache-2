5|$|After Groza retired, he entertained {{an offer}} {{to play for the}} San Francisco 49ers, but was {{reluctant}} to do so because {{he did not want to}} move his family and insurance business to the West Coast.

Later in life, he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns, inviting rookies over <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>and</b> helping them find apartments.

5|$|Le dîner (dinner) often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Most {{of the time the}} bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm <b>for</b> <b>dinner,</b> <b>and</b> stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} {{attempts to}} reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds Derek {{at the hospital}} and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>and</b> finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under the pretense of being one of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers). Derek goes to his car with the intent to pursue Lisa, only to find the baby is safely sitting in the back seat. He and Sharon immediately take Kyle to the hospital for a check-up. When Derek and Sharon return home from the hospital, they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves a threatening voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.|$|E

25|$|The canal {{eventually}} {{opened in}} early June 1805. The Committee of Management met at Inverurie, {{where they were}} congratulated on completing the task by the Provost, Magistrates, minister and others. They set off in the barge The Countess of Kintore, suitably decorated for the occasion, and travelled to Kintore, where they were met by the Magistrates and other inhabitants. Several groups of ladies joined them as they approached Aberdeen, and travelled through the locks. Crowds gathered on the banks, and refreshments were served on the boat. The band of the Stirlinghsire Militia accompanied them for the final few miles. After {{seven and a half}} hours, they reached the terminal basin next to the docks, and retired to the New Inn <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>and</b> toasts. Fourteen of the locks failed within the first few months, and reconstruction of the masonry resulted in the canal being shut until October 1806. The engineer Thomas Telford approved the substantial reconstruction. A third Act of Parliament was passed on 13 March 1809, which enabled the company to raise a further £45,000 for work on the canal, but is seems probable that its powers were never used.|$|E
25|$|The Cafritz deal {{stabilized}} Washington Harbour. Cafritz converted some {{retail space}} in the complex to office space (which paid higher rents), {{settled out of court}} in late 1988 the $68 million lawsuit filed by Warner LeRoy, and reduced rents for new tenants in the office space by 16 percent. Two months after Cafritz began his takeover of the property, chef Vittorio Testa opened a new restaurant, Leonardo da Vinci Ristorante, in a portion of the space formerly occupied by Potomac, Testa transformed the space from a bejeweled, chandeliered showroom into a quiet, softly lit restaurant. Leonardo da Vinci Ristorante opened in February 1989. It included a less expensive, more informal dining room and a carryout service on the lower level. In August 1989, Ark Restaurant Corp. announced it had signed a 15-year lease for a new restaurant, Sequoia, at Washington Harbour. The company said the mid-priced fare ($20 <b>for</b> <b>dinner)</b> <b>and</b> smaller size (550 seats, compared to Potomac's 800 seats) would make the new eatery profitable. Sequoia opened in September 1990. By mid 1990, Cafritz had leased much of the empty office space at Washington Harbour as well.|$|E
25|$|Contacts between Russia and Australia {{date back}} to 1803, when Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord Hobart wrote to Governor of New South Wales Philip Gidley King in {{relation}} to the first Russian circumnavigation of the globe by Adam Johann von Krusenstern and Yuri Lisyansky. As the Russian and British empires were allies in the war against Napoleon, the Russian warship Neva, with Captain Ludwig von Hagemeister at the helm, was able to sail into Port Jackson on 16 June 1807. Hagemeister and the ship's officers were extended the utmost courtesy by Governor William Bligh, with the Governor inviting the Russians to Government House <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>and</b> a ball. This was the beginning of personal contacts between Russians and Australians, and Russian ships would continue to visit Australian shores, particularly as a stop on their way to supplying the Empire's North American colonies. The Suvorov commanded by Captain Mikhail Lazarev spent twenty-two days in New South Wales in 1814, when it brought news of Napoleon's defeat, and this was followed up by the 1820 visit of the Otkrytiye and Blagonamerenny. In 1820, Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Vasilyev arrived in New South Wales, on board Antarctic research ships Vostok and Mirny, under the command of Mikhail Lazarev. Bellingshausen returned to Sydney after discovering Antarctica, spending the winter at the invitation of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Macquarie played the greatest role in the expression of Russophilia in the Colony, ensuring that the Russian visitors were made to feel welcome. While in Sydney, Bellingshausen collected information on the colony, which he published in Russia as Short Notes on the Colony of New South Wales. He wrote that Schmidt, a naturalist who was attached to the Lazarev expedition, discovered gold near Hartley, making him the first person to discover gold in Australia. While in Sydney, on 27 March 1820, officials from the colony were invited on board the Vostok to celebrate Orthodox Easter, marking {{the first time that a}} Russian Orthodox service was held in the Australian Colonies.|$|E
