5000|$|In computing, {{the working}} <b>directory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> process is <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{hierarchical}} file system, if any, dynamically {{associated with each}} process. It is sometimes called the current working directory or CWD, e.g. the BSD [...] function. When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative path (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from a root directory), the reference is interpreted relative to the current working <b>directory</b> <b>of</b> the process. So for example a process with working directory /rabbit-shoes that asks to create the file foo.txt will end up creating the file /rabbit-shoes/foo.txt.|$|R

Depending on the implementation, a file change log will record changes such as creates, links, unlinks (deletions), renamed files, data changes, and metadata changes (for example, ACLs and permissions). A file change log can be accessed as a file in the file system, or hidden and accessed only programmatically.|$|R
