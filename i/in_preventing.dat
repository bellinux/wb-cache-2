Exercise is also probably effective <b>in</b> <b>preventing</b> recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful <b>in</b> <b>preventing</b> low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
