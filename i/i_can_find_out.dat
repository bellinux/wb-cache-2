He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved. Darwin concludes: [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> no such case." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 18, 2007, Arar spoke via video-link {{before the}} House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight, and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties {{at a hearing}} that is {{examining}} his case {{and the practice of}} rendition. In his statement to the committee, he detailed his experiences and expressed his hope that his case will not be repeated. [...] "I now understand how fragile our human rights and freedoms are, and how easily they can be taken from us by the very same governments and institutions that have sworn to protect us. I also know that the only way I {{will ever be able to}} move on in my life and have a future is if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> why this happened to me, and help prevent it from happening to others." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{he did not}} {{originate}} the term, Charles Darwin {{identified the}} argument as a possible way to falsify a prediction {{of the theory of}} evolution at the outset. In The Origin of Species (1859), he wrote, [...] "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> no such case." [...] Darwin's theory of evolution challenges the teleological argument by postulating an alternative explanation to that of an intelligent designer—namely, evolution by natural selection. By showing how simple unintelligent forces can ratchet up designs of extraordinary complexity without invoking outside design, Darwin showed that an intelligent designer was not the necessary conclusion to draw from complexity in nature. The argument from irreducible complexity attempts to demonstrate that certain biological features cannot be purely the product of Darwinian evolution.|$|E
