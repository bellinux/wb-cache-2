The tigress was shot, as were two of her four cubs, but the white cub <b>escaped.</b> (<b>Rules</b> of the time allowed the shooting of a tigress with cubs.) The white cub was captured and kept in a large open courtyard within the Maharajah's 150-roomed palace.

The white cub was reintroduced to a repaired courtyard where he lived for the remainder of his life. This tiger was the famed Mohan.|$|R

40|$|Introduction] Exit rules {{allow for}} a {{temporary}} or permanent withdrawal from international cooperative regimes. For the ongoing crisis in the European Monetary Union (EMU), such rules {{are seen as a}} desirable solution to enhance flexibility in case of economic and political shocks in member countries and to restrict fiscal externalities in the Euro zone. As the EU acts as a union of sovereign countries, politically powerful nations like France or Germany are likely to blockade or circumvent such a rule, if it negatively affects their interest. The underlying strategic problem of self-enforceability is largely neglected with respect to an EU exit rule. This contribution to the political economy of exit and <b>escape</b> <b>rules</b> aims at assessing conditions of voluntary adherence to an exit scheme by all parties of a common currency union such as the EMU.

40|$|Abstract — Given {{a subset}} of data that differs from the rest, a user often wants an {{explanation}} as to why this is the case. For instance, in a database of flights, a user may want to understand why certain flights were very late. This paper presents ESCAPE, a sequential covering algorithm designed to generate explanations of subsets that {{take the form of}} disjunctive normal rules describing the characteristics ({attribute, value} pairs) that differentiates the subsets {{from the rest of the}} data. Our experiments demonstrate that ESCAPE discovers explanations that are both compact, in that just a few rules cover the subset, and specific, in that the rules cover the subset but not the rest of the data. Our experiments compare ESCAPE to RIPPER, a popular, traditional rule learning algorithm and show that <b>ESCAPE’s</b> <b>rules</b> yield better covering explanations. Further, ESCAPE was designed to be efficient, and we formally demonstrate that ESCAPE runs in loglinear time...|$|R
