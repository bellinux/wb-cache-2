Such phenolic compounds {{have been known}} to inhibit biogas production during anaerobic digestion. The different phenolic compounds were added in various concentrations: 0, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/L. A difference in inhibition of biomethane production between the phenolic compounds was noted. Hydrolysis rate, during anaerobic digestion of miscanthus was inhibited up to 50 % by vanillic acid, while vanillic acid had no influence on the initial rate of biogas production during the anaerobic digestion of <b>hemp</b> <b>straw.</b> Miscanthus has a higher lignin concentration (12 - 30 g/ 100 g DM) making it less accessible for degradation, and in combination with phenolic compounds released after harsh pretreatments, it can cause severe inhibition levels during the anaerobic digestion, lowering biogas production. To counter the inhibition, lignin degrading enzymes can be used to remove or degrade the inhibitory phenolic compounds. The interaction of laccase and versatile peroxidase individually with the different phenolic compounds was studied to have insight in the polymerization of inhibitory compounds or breakdown of lignocellulose. <b>Hemp</b> <b>straw</b> and miscanthus were incubated with 0, 100 and 500 mg/L of the different phenolic compounds for 0, 6 and 24 h and pretreated with the lignin degrading enzymes.

The processes of manufacturing said materials that are commonly used in construction require very high temperatures. The energy for achieving the necessary temperature is gained mostly by burning fossil fuels. Because of the above mentioned problem we have tried to find the most environmentally friendly solution for building external walls.

Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS) measurements have been performed on different native, washed and steam exploded woody (willow and spruce) and herbaceous (<b>hemp,</b> wheat <b>straw</b> and sweet sorghum bagasse) biomass samples. The main differences between the thermal decomposition of the samples are interpreted in terms of the altered structure of the biomass samples by the effective steam explosion treatment and the different alkali ion contents which have been determined using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) method. In order to separate these two effects, the native biomass samples have been washed with hot water to remove the main parts of the potassium and sodium ions. The concentration of K+ and Na+ has been reduced in the treated biomass samples so the thermal decomposition mechanism has been altered due to the elimination of the catalytic effects. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used to find statistical correlations between the data. The functional group compositions of the lignin molecules have been modified significantly as indicated by the pyrograms and the score plot of the PCA. The amount of hemicellulose has been reduced.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} shortage of raw materials, traditionally used for {{production of wood}} based panels and other composite materials, {{there is a growing}} call for the use of raw materials from agricultural production. Hemp shive, a by-product of <b>hemp</b> <b>straw</b> processing, is in eager demand due to its wood-like material properties. In order to be suitable for industrial use, respective agricultural raw material must be competitive in price, as well as be available in respective quantity and quality. ATB has developed a new processing technology for the cleaning of shive-fibre mixes for better accommodation such requirements. Ultimate goal is the generation of dust and fibre free shives as well as the recovering of high quality short fibres from shive fractionation. This is facilitated by a new type of axial fractionators, which utilizes a multi-stage paddle screw and a screen drum, corresponding with the screw. This allows classification and cleaning of the shives as well as recovering of the short fibres in only one processing step.

40|$|Information as to {{the nature}} of the {{chemical}} changes that occur during the biological retting of hemp is scanty. Flax retting has been far more extensively studied, mostly by European workers; but it has frequently been implied that the principles involved and the problems met with are similar in flax and hemp retting. This subject is well reviewed by Thaysen and Bunker (9). It has been repeatedly stated that the essential biochemical change is the decomposition of the pectic substances present in the middle lamella of the parenchymatous tissue cells as a result of which the bundles become readily separable from the wood and the epidermis. It cannot be said, however, that there is clear analytical evidence for this statement. Moreover, there must be concurrent utilization of other tissue constituents, and progressively an attack on the fiber bundles, manifest in practice by the ultimate weakening and deterioration that occurs in over-retting. The processes that occur in retting constitute in fact the first stages in the decomposition of the <b>hemp</b> <b>straw.</b> Desirable changes that result in the liberation of the fibers pass imperceptibly into undesirable changes that result in impairment of quality. There is no certain way of determining when retting is complete. Reliance ordinarily is placed upon the judgment of the observer, which is based on the appearance of the straw and on simple mechanical tests. Whether the completion of retting under controlled conditions in tanks can properly be judged by standards similar to those applied to field-retted material is doubtful. Although the ultimate result is similar in that the fibers can be separated from the straw, it is not necessarily to be expected that the biochemical changes brought about by populations so different in character as those active in field retting, and those in deep tanks, are identical. In order to obtain information on the nature of the changes that occur to the constituents of the straw, samples of field retted and controlled retted hemp have been analyzed in some detail...|$|E
40|$|This chapter has {{explored}} {{some of the}} key issues with respect to the sustainable use of materials in construction. It has identified the need to produce quality buildings that are comfortable and healthy to inhabit whilst being energy efficient and utilizing natural resources to their optimum potential. It has highlighted the need to evaluate the use of materials with a whole life cycle approach considering impacts of using the material from cradle to grave, from initial mining or harvesting to eventual disposal including the potential for recycling at interim stages. Methodologies such as ‘environmental profiles’ and the ‘code for sustainable homes’ are available in the UK to facilitate improvement of environmental standards however, it is necessary for each material to be considered in the context of its location and availability as they will affect the resource depletion and the requirement for transportation. A material that can be used sustainably {{in one part of the}} world may not be environmentally benign in another. Local materials generally have minimal embodied transport energy and fast growing renewable local materials can have further advantages of carbon sequestration during their growth period thus reducing their net greenhouse gas emissions. Much scientific research is being undertaken to define the physical properties of local crops such as <b>hemp,</b> <b>straw,</b> date palms and pineapple leaves. Understanding individual materials and the processes they have undergone must be key to the optimal use of the earth’s resources. A re-cycled product may not necessarily be the best environmental option if it has been transported around the world to undergo an energy intensive re-cycling process. As ever the designer must make a decision that will involve compromise in order to optimize the environmental impacts of the building. The decision will also be driven through economic constraints but the selection of sustainable construction materials will benefit from the availability of good data bases and an appreciation of the complex inter-relationships of the individual environmental impacts of materials...|$|E

The final product tested {{to determine their}} tensile, flexural, impact strength properties {{as well as some}} physical features such as thickness swelling and water absorptions. The best results were obtained composites containing 30 % nutshell flour. In addition, composites which were produced nutshell provided the values of ASTM D 6662 standard. The data collected in our country which waste a large portion of nutshell allows for the evaluation of the production polymer composites. The incorporation of nutshell flour feasible to produce plastic composites when appropriate formulations were used. As a result hazelnut shell which was considered agricultural waste can be utilized in polymer composite production...|$|R
