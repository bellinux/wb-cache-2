5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a <b>divided</b> <b>government,</b> with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state was faced with a $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E

25|$|At {{the state}} level, {{the pattern of}} split ticket voting and <b>divided</b> <b>government</b> holds. Democrats {{currently}} hold one of the state's U.S. Senate seats, as well as {{four of the five}} statewide offices (Governor, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Secretary of State and State Auditor). The lone congressional district has been Republican since 1996 and in 2014 Steve Daines won one of the state's Senate seats for the GOP. The Legislative branch had split party control between the house and senate most years between 2004 and 2010, when the mid-term elections returned both branches to Republican control. The state Senate is, as of 2015, controlled by the Republicans 29 to 21, and the State House of Representatives at 59 to 41. Historically, Republicans are strongest in the east, while Democrats are strongest in the west.|$|E

500|$|Heffron became Premier, being {{sworn in}} with his cabinet on 23 October 1959 at Government House, Sydney by Governor Sir Eric Woodward. However, his time as Premier was marked by {{significant}} tensions within the Labor Party in NSW and nationally, where although a split involving the Democratic Labor Party had been avoided during Cahill's term, the sectarian and factional undercurrent in the party was very much present in what was increasingly perceived as a tired and <b>divided</b> <b>government.</b> Indeed, the 68-year-old Heffron's government consisted mostly of MPs and Ministers who had come in with McKell after the 1941 election. In parliament, Heffron tended to reflect this by leaving most of the speaking roles to his deputy Jack Renshaw and local government and highways minister Pat Hills. It was clear to many that the aged Heffron's best days as a politician were behind him, as future Labor political advisor Richard Hall noted in The Bulletin: [...] "In the House he tends to ramble on, recalling past glories as Minister for Education or Minister for Emergency Services in answer to questions. In an age where clichés cloak most politicians, Heffron throws them out {{as though they were}} devastating retorts, although occasionally the old radical has shown his teeth, flashed into anger, and for a few minutes reminded us that this was the great mob-orator who led many bitter strikes." [...] His old nemesis Jack Lang also took the opportunity to take a last swipe at him, ridiculing Heffron in his newspaper, Century, as [...] "Mr Magoo". On 14 October 1960, Heffron presided over the official opening of Warragamba Dam, the completion of which meant that it became the primary reservoir and the first reliable water supply for the whole Sydney catchment. At the opening, Heffron declared: [...] "We have come along way from the Tank Stream, Sydney's first water supply".|$|E

6000|$|But the {{strength}} of his arguments is equal to the clearness of his definitions. For, having most ignorantly <b>divided</b> <b>government</b> into three parts, whereof the first contains the other two; he attempteth to prove that the clergy possess none of these by a divine right. And he argueth thus, p. vii. [...] "As to a legislative power, if that belongs to the clergy by a divine right, it must be when they are assembled in convocation: but the 25 Hen. VIII. c. 19 is a bar to any such divine right, because that act makes it no less than a praemunire for them, so much so as to meet without the king's writ, &c." [...] So that the force of his argument lieth here; if the clergy had a divine right, it is taken away by the 25th of Henry the Eighth. And as ridiculous as this argument is, the preface and book are founded upon it.|$|E

6000|$|In Siddermorton Park is Siddermorton House, where old Lady Hammergallow lives, chiefly upon Burgundy and {{the little}} scandals of the village, a dear old lady with a ropy neck, a ruddled countenance and spasmodic gusts of odd temper, whose three {{remedies}} for all human trouble among her dependents are, a bottle of gin, a pair of charity blankets, or a new crown piece. The House is a mile-and-a-half out of Siddermorton. Almost all the village is hers, saving a fringe to the south which belongs to Sir John Gotch, and she rules it with an autocratic rule, refreshing {{in these days of}} <b>divided</b> <b>government.</b> She orders and forbids marriages, drives objectionable people out of the village by the simple expedient of raising their rent, dismisses labourers, obliges heretics to go to church, and made Susan Dangett, who wanted to call her little girl 'Euphemia,' have the infant christened 'Mary-Anne.' She is a sturdy Broad Protestant and disapproves of the Vicar's going bald like a tonsure. She is on the Village Council, which obsequiously trudges up the hill and over the moor to her, and (as she is a trifle deaf) speaks all its speeches into her speaking trumpet instead of a rostrum. She takes no interest now in politics, but until last year she was an active enemy of [...] "that Gladstone." [...] She has parlour maids instead of footmen to do her waiting, because of Hockley, the American stockbroker, and his four Titans in plush.|$|E
60|$|The second {{principle}} {{assumed by}} Mr. Hastings for his justification, namely, that factious opposition and a <b>divided</b> <b>government</b> might create exigencies requiring such supplies, is full {{as dangerous as}} the first; for, if, in the divisions which must arise in all councils, one member of government, when he thinks others factiously disposed, shall be entitled to take money privately from the subject {{for the purposes of}} his politics, and thereby to dispense with an act of Parliament, pretences for that end cannot be wanting. A dispute may always be raised in council in order to cover oppression and peculation elsewhere. But these principles of Mr. Hastings tend entirely to destroy the character and functions of a council, and to vest them in one of the dissentient members. The law has placed the sense of the whole in the majority; and it is not a thing to be suffered, that any of the members should privately raise money for the avowed purpose of defeating that sense, or for promoting designs that are contrary to it: a more alarming assumption of power in an individual member of any deliberative or executive body cannot be imagined. Mr. Hastings had no right, in order to clear himself of peculation, to criminate the majority with faction. No member of any body, outvoted on a question, has, or can have, a right to direct any part of his public conduct by that principle. The members of the Council had a common superior, to whom they might appeal in their mutual charges of faction: they did so frequently; and the imputation of faction has almost always been laid on Mr. Hastings himself.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} puzzles exist {{regarding}} {{the role of}} domestic politics in the likelihood of international conflict. In particular, the sources of incomplete information remain under-theorized and the microfoundations deficient. This study will examine {{the role that the}} unity of the government and the views of the government towards the use of force play in the targeting of states. The theory presented argues that <b>divided</b> dovish <b>governments</b> are particularly likely to suffer from military challenges. In particular, <b>divided</b> <b>governments</b> have difficulty signaling their intentions, taking decisive action, and may appear weak. The theory will be tested on a new dataset created by the author that examines the theory in the context of international territorial disputes. A number of significant findings emerge from the data. First, <b>divided</b> <b>governments</b> are significantly more likely to face challenges and increasing government unity markedly decreases the likelihood of a challenge. Second, unified hawkish governments were far less likely to be the targets of challenges than <b>divided</b> dovish <b>governments.</b> Finally, the substantive impact of key variables was much greater than that of the control variables. The causal process postulated in the theory is examined in eight case studies, two {{for each of the four}} government types. These case studies show that government type not only impacts the signaling of democratic states but also influences the perceptions of potential challengers. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{standard}} academic consensus that semi-presidentialism is perilous for new democracies. In particular, this is because semi-presidential countries {{run the risk of}} experiencing difficult periods of ‘cohabitation’ between a president and a prime minister who are opposed to each other, and because they may also experience periods of <b>divided</b> minority <b>government</b> that encourage the president to rule by decree and subvert the rule of law. This article examines the evidence to support these two arguments. We find very few cases of cohabitation in young democracies and only one case where cohabitation has directly led to democratic collapse. By contrast, we find more cases of <b>divided</b> minority <b>government</b> and more cases where it has been associated with democratic failure. However, we also find that young democracies have survived <b>divided</b> minority <b>government.</b> We conclude that, to date, there is insufficient evidence to support the long-standing and highly intuitive argument that cohabitation is dangerous for new democracies. There is more evidence to support the much newer argument about the dangers of <b>divided</b> minority <b>government.</b> Even so, more work is needed in this area before we can conclude that semi-presidentialism is inherently perilous...|$|R
