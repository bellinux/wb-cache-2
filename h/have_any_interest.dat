5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

25|$|After the autopsies were performed, {{the bodies}} of the Romanovs were washed, dressed in white shrouds, and placed in wooden coffins. There was a funeral service for them on 19 October when the coffins were placed in the crypt of the cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Alapayevsk where they {{remained}} until July 1919. Then, as Alapayevsk, was about to be retaken by the Red Army, the coffins were moved to Irkutsk. There the coffins rested for less than six months, before the advance of the Red army forced their removal eastward. Early in 1920, the coffins with the remains of Grand Duke Sergei and those killed with him, were taken out of Russia by train through Harbin. By April 1920 the coffins were in Beijing, where they were placed in the crypt of the chapel attached to the Russian Mission. They remained there until 1957 when they were buried at the Russian Orthodox cemetery as the chapel was demolished. The government of the USSR did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> in the preservation of the Russian cemetery in Beijing and in the late 1980s the Chinese authorities converted it into a park. It is believed that the coffins are still in place, now buried beneath a parking area. After the Communist regime collapsed the mineshaft, where the Grand Duke was killed with his relatives, became a site of religious pilgrimage, and an orthodox chapel was built there.|$|E

500|$|According to Tripp, sexual {{attraction}} is encouraged by [...] "tension and distance" [...] between {{one person and}} another, and is consequently [...] "seldom aroused and never rewarding unless something in the partner or in the situation itself is viewed as resistant to it." [...] Tripp maintains that societies have increased divisions {{between men and women}} partly to satisfy needs inherent in sexual psychology. He suggests that there are often elements of truth to traditional accusations made against women, such as deviousness, and that derogatory descriptions of women serve to increase divisions between the sexes, create tension between them, and make relations between men and women more exciting. Tripp proposes that social bonds between men are not prone to becoming sexual because the similarity and camaraderie between men make them too close to each other for homosexual activities to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>interest.</b> Tripp maintains that heterosexuality and homosexuality generally develop in parallel ways, but that since homosexuality, unlike heterosexuality, is not encouraged and institutionalized by society, its origins are more [...] "scattered and diverse." [...] He reviewed anthropological evidence on homosexuality.|$|E

500|$|In September 2009 the Maple Leafs and Marlies {{opened their}} new hockey {{practice}} facility, the MasterCard Centre. The arena was {{a joint venture}} between MLSE, the City of Toronto and the Lakeshore Lions Club to replace the nearby Lakeshore Lions Arena, and was built at a cost of $44 million, after cost overruns drove up the cost from $33.65 million. [...] The Lions Club contributed $40 million to the project, with the city providing a $35.5 million loan guarantee. [...] The Toronto District School Board leased the land for the arena to the Lakeshore Lions for a 50-year term. MLSE spent a further $5 million on training and medical facilities, and pays $600,000 annually to rent the building. [...] The arena was originally operated by the Lakeshore Lions Club, but in June 2011, with the arena on the verge of defaulting on its rising debt, the City of Toronto took control and assumed its $43.4 million debt with the intention to return it to private management within 2–3 years.

2500|$|Piquet Jr. was criticised {{by many in}} the {{community}} and some suggest that the controversy effectively ended his hopes of continuing in F1. BBC F1 commentator Martin Brundle suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor would want {{to be associated with the}} Piquet family. Brundle noted that Piquet Jr. [...] "didn't deliver at Renault, he wasn't fast enough, that's why he was released and that's why he has dropped hand grenades into the system ever since". Brundle was also highly critical that Piquet Jr. escaped sanction from the FIA despite admitting to race-fixing, while the others involved were heavily punished. Other leading F1 figures have echoed Brundle's sentiments. Toyota team principal John Howett was quoted as saying, [...] "I think on his performance...disregarding the issue, I probably would not give him a drive and I would probably be further influenced in that decision by what took place."
