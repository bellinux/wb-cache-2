50|$|The Johnston’s organ {{plays a role}} in {{the control}} of flight {{stability}} in hawk moths. Kinematic data measured from hovering moths during steady flight indicate that the antennae vibrate with a <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> wingbeat (27 Hz). During complex flight, however, angular changes of the flying moth cause coriolis forces, which are predicted to manifest as a vibration of the antenna of at about twice wingbeat frequency (~60 Hz). When antennae were manipulated to vibrate at a range of frequencies and the resulting signals from the neurons associated with the Johnston’s organs were measured, the response of the scolopidia neurons to the frequency was tightly coupled in the range of 50-70 Hz, which is the predicted range of vibrations caused by Coriolis effects. Thus, the Johnston’s organ is tuned to detect angular changes during maneuvering in complex flight.|$|E
40|$|SummarySexual {{recognition}} through wing-beat <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> {{was first}} demonstrated in Toxorhynchites brevipalpis, where wing-beat frequencies {{of males and}} females are similar [1]. Here we show <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> in Culex quinquefasciatus, where the wing-beat frequencies {{of males and females}} differ considerably. The wing-beat frequencies converge not on the fundamental but on the nearest shared harmonic (usually female's third and male's second). Frequencies in this range are, however, too high to elicit phasic sensory-neural responses [2, 3] from the Johnston's organ (JO) or to drive the mosquito's motor neurons. Potential cues for <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> are difference tones produced by nonlinear mixing of male and female flight tones in the vibrations of the mosquito's antennae. Receptor potentials and neural-motor activity were recorded in response to difference tones produced when a mosquito was stimulated simultaneously by two tones at frequencies outside the phasic response range of the JO but within range of the antennal vibrations. We demonstrate sexual recognition through matching of flight-tone harmonics in Culex mosquitoes and suggest that difference tones are used as an error signal for <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> beyond the frequency range of the JO's sensory-neural range. This is the first report of acoustic distortion being exploited as a sensory cue, rather than existing as an epiphenomenon...|$|E

Two synthesis methods are outlined, with the merits of each being illustrated by applying them to the lower South Island portion of New Zealand's primary transmission system. Validation of the diakoptical technique used to model the frequency dependent mutual coupling, as well as data preparation, is achieved by using the current source model to inject harmonic currents into the frequency-matched a. c. system equivalent. The need for <b>frequency</b> <b>matched</b> a. c. system equivalents is demonstrated by using the Transient Convertor Simulator program for harmonic penetration studies. Finally {{the effect of the}} frequency-dependence of an a. c. system model on the transient behaviour of a convertor is illustrated by simulating both a. c. and d. c. disturbances. The difference in transient behaviour with asymmetric a. c. faults as well as the harmonic assessment for harmonic penetration studies both demonstrate the need for <b>frequency</b> <b>matched</b> a. c. system equivalents that more accurately model the actual system...|$|R

One benefit of performing as a nonmating partner might be to gain experience as an ‘‘apprentice’ ’ to improve {{the performance of the}} complex duet song and joint dance. We examined the relationship between the age of singers and two measures of singing performance: song variability and sound <b>frequency</b> <b>matching.</b> Singing performance improved with age; variability in four song characteristics of males less than 3 years old was greater than that in their older partners, and <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> increased with the age of the younger partner. Randomization tests of song samples from seven well-established teams showed that males did not track the song-to-song variation in their partners ’ singing. Another randomization test showed that <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> by these teams was higher than that of randomly paired partners. We considered three alternative hypotheses for the congruent songs: (1) short-term accommodation to the partner’s song; (2) active choice of partners with similar intrinsic frequencies; and (3) long-term development of con-gruent song through either practice or song copying. Our results and evidence from long-term monitoring of banded birds best support the hypothesis that <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> develops over several years during the complex and protracted process of partner formation. Nonmating males may benefit from increasing their competence at display, eventually enjoying increased mating success when they inherit display sites from older males.

40|$|Objectives: We {{investigated}} {{the accuracy of}} a web-based protocol for tinnitus <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> {{compared to that of}} tinnitus pitch matching performed by an audiologist using an audiometer in an anechoic chamber. Methods: Twenty subjects underwent tinnitus frequency-matching in a random order using an audiometer in an anechoic chamber and using web-based software with a multiple-choice protocol in octave or half-octave steps from 250 Hz to 12, 000 Hz and a slider in 25 -Hz steps from 20 to 20, 000 Hz. Octave challenge testing was performed. The participants were asked to indicate which protocol resulted in the closest match to their tinnitus frequency. Results: The median tinnitus frequency was 6, 000 Hz (range, 2, 000 to 12, 000 Hz) with use of the audiometer and self-directed multiple-choice protocol. With the slider, the median frequency was 5, 925 Hz (range, 1, 850 to 16, 000 Hz). The patients with a tinnitus frequency higher than 12, 000 Hz experienced a greater level of satisfaction when using the computer- based slider system. Five patients experienced octave confusion with self-directed multiple-choice tinnitus matching that was corrected accurately after the octave challenge step. Conclusions: A web-based protocol for tinnitus <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> is as accurate as a standard audiometric protocol. An octave challenge test might be necessary for patient-directed tinnitus <b>frequency</b> <b>matching.</b> © 2012 Annals Publishing Company. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Compressor and turbine bladed wheels {{interact}} with the fluid distributed by the stator vanes. They are subject to vibration and fatigue loading, especially when resonance conditions are excited. Avoiding resonance is fundamental when designing bladed wheels. The Campbell diagram approach is too conservative since bladed wheels show many close frequency natural modes, thus {{it is almost impossible}} to avoid <b>frequency</b> <b>matching.</b> Singh's Advanced Frequency Evaluation (SAFE) diagram, or interference diagram, also introduces shape matching in addition to the frequency, for resonance prediction, therefore many <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> cases can be identified as non-critical and thus tolerated. The present paper explains and demonstrates the SAFE diagram by introducing an analytical expression to identify bladed wheel resonance conditions. The mode shape matching with a harmonic component is investigated by means of specific examples. Symmetry properties of the matching distribution of harmonic indices and mode shapes are also introduced and demonstrated. Finally, a bladed wheel analysis is used for validation, both in FE simulations and experiments...|$|E
40|$|Mosquitoes {{are more}} {{sensitive}} to sound than any other insect due to the remarkable properties of their antennae and Johnston’s organ {{at the base of}} each antenna. Male mosquitoes detect and locate female mosquitoes by hearing the female’s flight tone, but until recently we had no idea that females also respond to male flight tones. Our investigation of a novel mechanism of sex recognition in Toxorhynchites brevipalpis revealed that male and female mosquitoes actively respond to the flight tones of other flying mosquitoes by altering their own wing-beat frequencies. Male–female pairs converge on a shared harmonic of their respective fundamental flight tones, whereas same sex pairs diverge. Most <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> occurs at frequencies beyond the detection range of the Johnston’s organ but within the range of mechanical responsiveness of the antennae. We have shown that this is possible because the Johnston’s organ is tuned to, and able to detect difference tones in, the harmonics of antennal vibrations which are generated by the combined input of flight tones from both mosquitoes. Acoustic distortion in hearing organs exists usually as an interesting epiphenomenon. Mosquitoes, however, appear {{to use it as a}} sensory cue that enables male–female pairs to communicate through a signal that depends on auditory interactions between them. <b>Frequency</b> <b>matching</b> may also provide a means of species recognition. Morphologically identical but reproductively isolated molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae fly in the same mating swarms, but rarely hybridize. Extended <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> occurs almost exclusively between males and females of the same molecular form, suggesting that this behavior is associated with observed assortative mating...|$|E

40|$|Anopheles gambiae, {{responsible}} {{for the majority of}} malaria deaths annually, is a complex of seven species and several chromosomal/molecular forms. The complexity of malaria epidemiology and control {{is due in part to}} An. gambiae's remarkable genetic plasticity, enabling its adaptation to a range of human-influenced habitats. This leads to rapid ecological speciation when reproductive isolation mechanisms develop [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Although reproductive isolation is essential for speciation, little is known about how it occurs in sympatric populations of incipient species [2]. We show that in such a population of ¿M¿ and ¿S¿ molecular forms, a novel mechanism of sexual recognition (male-female flight-tone matching [7, 8, 9]) also confers the capability of mate recognition, an essential precursor to assortative mating; <b>frequency</b> <b>matching</b> occurs more consistently in same-form pairs than in mixed-form pairs (p = 0. 001).
