2500|$|Flutes (Captivity): The stage {{returns to}} the Archer's Den, where the Twin Brother is imprisoned in a small cage. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches from a distance, holding the flutes that the twins played before their lives were changed forever. All seems lost for the Twin Brother until he finds {{a friend in the}} kind-natured Chief Archer's Daughter, who dares to {{approach}} him. She passes the flutes to the Twin Brother, he begins to play and when she leans towards the cage for a closer look at him, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> to steal a brief kiss. Although the Chief Archer's Daughter is taken aback, as she turns away from the Twin Brother it is obvious that she has also become smitten by him. After their tender moment and after great hesitation, the Chief Archer's Daughter sets the Twin Brother free from his cage, begging him to flee. Before he does, the Twin Brother makes a decision [...] he returns to her his flutes, the precious ceremonial gifts that were treasured by their kingdom. The Twin Brother then escapes, leaving the Chief Archer's Daughter in hope they will meet again. She cannot hide her joy [...] she expresses her love through a touching performance of dance using the twins' flutes. All of this is secretly witnessed by the Counselor's Son, who has desired the Chief Archer's Daughter for years. Engulfed by rage and jelousy of his unrequited love, he prepares for war.|$|E
6000|$|While he is {{speaking}} the door has been opened, and HARRIS has gone [...] swiftly to it, spoken to someone and returned. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> to [...] the MAYOR.|$|E

6000|$|On a flat road {{runs the}} well-train'd runner, [...] He is lean and sinewy with muscular legs, [...] He is thinly clothed, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> as he runs, [...] With lightly closed fists and arms {{partially}} rais'd.|$|E
60|$|Pietro {{is already}} married, yet he behaves {{as if he}} were not. He has been {{carrying}} on with a loose woman, the wife of the citron-coloured barber, the Siciliano. Then he seats himself on the women's side of the theatre, behind a young person from Bogliaco, who also has no reputation, and makes her talk to him. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> resting his arms on the seat before him, stretching his slender, cat-like, flexible loins. The padrona of the hotel hates him--'ein frecher Kerl,' she says with contempt, and she looks away. Her eyes hate to see him.|$|E
6000|$|George buckles {{him into}} the Frame and {{switches}} on the Direct Control. Now under Tim's left toe lies the port-engine Accelerator; under his left heel the Reverse, and so with the other foot. The lift-shunt stops stand out {{on the rim of}} the steering-wheel where the fingers of his left hand can play on them. At his right hand is the midships engine lever ready to be thrown into gear at a moment's notice. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> in his belt, eyes glued to the colloid, and one ear cocked toward the General Communicator. Henceforth he is the strength and direction of [...] "162," [...] through whatever may befall.|$|E

6000|$|LAWTON: 'I suppose I must. I {{shall not}} expect mercy for myself; perhaps you'll say that, {{as an old}} and {{hardened}} offender, I don't deserve it. But I had an accomplice--a young man very respectably connected, and who, whatever his previous life may have been, had managed to keep a good reputation; a young man a little apt to be misled by overweening vanity and the ill-advised flattery of his friends; but I hope that neither of you gentlemen will be hard upon him, but will consider his youth, and perhaps his congenital moral and intellectual deficiencies, even when you find your watches--on Mr. Campbell's person.' <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> rubbing his hands, and smiling upon Campbell, 'How will that do, Mr. Campbell, for a flyer?' ...|$|E
60|$|British {{infantry}} {{keep the}} ground. In front are about fifty Frenchmen in civil dress of every grade of life, workmen and gentlemen, {{in a double}} rank. They are all so wounded that they are back in civil life, but to-day they are to have some solace for their wounds. They lean heavily on sticks, their bodies are twisted and maimed, but their faces are shining with pride and joy. The French General draws his sword and addresses them. One catches words like 'honneur' and 'patrie.' They lean forward on their crutches, hanging on every syllable which comes hissing and rasping from under that heavy white moustache. Then the medals are pinned on. One poor lad is terribly wounded and needs two sticks. A little girl runs out with some flowers. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> and tries to kiss her, but the crutches slip and he nearly falls upon her. It was a pitiful but beautiful little scene.|$|E
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS, dryly: [...] "You shall do {{whatever}} you like, Miss Galbraith, when I've set you free; for I see your dress is caught in the window. When it's once out, I'll shut the window, and you can call the porter to raise it." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> over her chair, and while she shrinks back {{the length of her}} tether, he tugs at the window-fastening. [...] "I can't get at it. Would you be so good as to stand up,--all you can?" [...] Miss Galbraith stands up, droopingly, and Mr. Richards makes a movement towards her, and then falls back. [...] "No, that won't do. Please sit down again." [...] He goes round her chair and tries to get at the window from that side. [...] "I can't get any purchase on it. Why don't you cut out that piece?" [...] Miss Galbraith stares at him in dumb amazement. [...] "Well, I don't see what we're to do: I'll go and get the porter." [...] He goes {{to the end of the}} car, and returns. [...] "I can't find the porter,--he must be in one of the other cars. But"-- brightening with the fortunate conception--"I've just thought of something. Will it unbutton?" ...|$|E

60|$|Some {{quarter of}} an hour's walk from Bedford Park, out on the high road to Richmond, lived W. E. Henley, and I, like many others, began under him my education. His portrait, a {{lithograph}} by Rothenstein, hangs over my mantlepiece among portraits of other friends. He is drawn standing, but, because doubtless of his crippled legs, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> resting his elbows upon some slightly suggested object--a table or a window-sill. His heavy figure and powerful head, the disordered hair standing upright, his short irregular beard and moustache, his lined and wrinkled face, his eyes steadily fixed upon some object, in complete confidence and self-possession, and yet as in half-broken reverie, all are exactly as I remember him. I have seen other portraits and they too show him exactly as I remember him, {{as though he had}} but one appearance and that seen fully at the first glance and by all alike. He was most human--human, I used to say, like one of Shakespeare's characters--and yet pressed and pummelled, as it were, into a single attitude, almost into a gesture and a speech, as by some overwhelming situation. I disagreed with him about everything, but I admired him beyond words. With the exception of some early poems founded upon old French models, I disliked his poetry, mainly because he wrote Vers Libre, which I associated with Tyndall and Huxley and Bastien-Lepage's clownish peasant staring with vacant eyes at her great boots; and filled it with unimpassioned description of an hospital ward where his leg had been amputated. I wanted the strongest passions, passions {{that had nothing to do}} with observation, and metrical forms that seemed old enough to be sung by men half-asleep or riding upon a journey. Furthermore, Pre-Raphaelitism affected him as some people are affected by a cat in the room, and though he professed himself at our first meeting without political interests or convictions, he soon grew into a violent unionist and imperialist. I used to say when I spoke of his poems: 'He is like a great actor with a bad part; yet who would look at Hamlet in the grave scene if Salvini played the grave-digger?' and I might so have explained much that he said and did. I meant that he was like a great actor of passion--character-acting meant nothing to me for many years--and an actor of passion will display some one quality of soul, personified again and again, just as a great poetical painter, Titian, Botticelli, Rossetti may depend for his greatness upon a type of beauty which presently we call by his name. Irving, the last of the sort on the English stage, and in modern England and France it is the rarest sort, never moved me but in the expression of intellectual pride; and though I saw Salvini but once, I am convinced that his genius was a kind of animal nobility. Henley, half inarticulate--'I am very costive,' he would say--beset with personal quarrels, built up an image of power and magnanimity till it became, at moments, when seen as it were by lightning, his true self. Half his opinions were the contrivance of a sub-consciousness that sought always to bring life to the dramatic crisis, and expression to that point of artifice where the true self could find its tongue. Without opponents there had been no drama, and in his youth Ruskinism and Pre-Raphaelitism, for he was of my father's generation, were the only possible opponents. How could one resent his prejudice when, that he himself might play a worthy part, he must find beyond the common rout, whom he derided and flouted daily, opponents he could imagine moulded like himself? Once he said to me in the height of his imperial propaganda, 'Tell those young men in Ireland that this great thing must go on. They say Ireland is not fit for self-government but that is nonsense. It is as fit as any other European country but we cannot grant it.' And then he spoke of his desire to found and edit a Dublin newspaper. It would have expounded the Gaelic propaganda then beginning, though Dr. Hyde had as yet no league, our old stories, our modern literature--everything that did not demand any shred or patch of government. He dreamed of a tyranny but it was that of Cosimo de Medici.|$|E

5000|$|Sheriff Lamb {{hints that}} he was abused by his own father; this is, presumably, his reason for letting Duncan and Veronica go and then {{returning}} to the Manning residence. This also marks {{one of the few}} times that he immediately takes Veronica seriously when she reports a crime.

50|$|The three {{figures in}} a calm green meadow are linked by looks and {{touching}} hands. The Virgin Mary is shown wearing a gold-bordered blue mantle set against a red dress and with her right leg lying along a diagonal. The blue symbolizes {{the church and the}} red Christ's death, with the Madonna the uniting of Mother Church with Christ's sacrifice. With her eyes fixed on Christ, her head is turned to the left and slightly inclined, and in her hands she holds up Christ, as <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> unsteadily to touch the miniature cross held by John. The poppy refers to Christ's passion, death and resurrection.|$|E

50|$|A {{woman named}} Mrs. Balducci {{addresses}} {{the court in}} a Los Angeles courtroom. She asks for leniency for Alex Rich, {{the man who killed}} her son and three other people in a convenience store. The incredulous judge asks her why, because the defendant shows no remorse for his crime. A young woman stands up in the courtroom and asks if remorse would make a difference when someone was guilty of terrible things. The judge orders the woman to sit down, but Mrs. Balducci agrees with her. She says that rather than see Rich put to death, she wants him to be forced to live out his life in prison, endlessly watching videos of his victims' lives. She approaches Rich as she says this, and <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> and bites off the end of her finger.

Charles looks very young for his age and tells Peter he is just twelve years old. He is just over five foot, has blond hair, an unbroken voice and is quite aware he is very attractive. His father is always telling him {{not to talk to}} strange men. Peter suggests a meeting in town. After they sit down, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> to brush ice cream off Charles' cheek yet Charles maintains a cool exterior. On a later trip to the cinema, Peter puts his arm around the boy's shoulder. After the cinema, they go to eat supper in a derelict building, one of the boys' ‘safe houses'. Peter makes advances to Charles, talking about a ‘physically loving' friendship he had when he was Charles' age, and puts his hand on his thigh. Charles jumps up and in the subsequent panic, Peter is accidentally killed and Charles escapes, leaving a burning candle which destroys the building.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBaco, {{the alpha}} male {{of a foreign}} {{community}} {{on the east side}} of the local river, is sitting side by side with Jiro, a young adult male from the west side. They are watching each other closely while chewing on fruit. Seemingly out of the blue and with no hesitation, Jiro reaches up over his head, grabs a branch, and swings his whole body into Baco’s with great force and kicks him in his midsection repeatedly. Baco, who is larger and stronger, sits back and takes the kicking for a few seconds. Then, having had enough of this ‘teenage’ behaviour, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> grabs Jiro’s upper body, and overpowers him while biting his shoulder. Now the tables are turned — but only until Baco’s grip lessens and Jiro escapes. Yet it doesn’t end there. After having finally freed himself, Jiro returns for more. What is going on?The next stage reveals the answer. Baco spreads his legs, displaying his genitalia to Jiro, who crouches down, extends his arm and starts poking the older male’s testicles. Baco starts rocking his body, giving rhythm to this unique exchange. Then Baco starts hitting Jiro with open hands, and I see the alpha male is displaying the unmistakable, relaxed, open-mouthed play face. This is not a fight, this is play: play between two adult bonobo males in their natural habitat, south of the river Congo...|$|E
