50|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} parameter that influences {{the performance of a}} anti-scatter <b>grid,</b> is the <b>grid</b> ratio. The <b>grid</b> ratio is the ratio of the height to the width of the interspaces (not the <b>grid</b> bars) in the <b>grid.</b> <b>Grid</b> ratios of 8:1, 10:1, and 12:1 are most common on radiography. A 5:1 <b>grid</b> is most common for mammography. The <b>grid</b> is essentially a one-dimensional Collimator and increasing the <b>grid</b> ration increases the degree of collimation. Higher <b>grid</b> ratios provide better scatter cleanup, but they also result in greater radiation doses to the patient.|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} computer program, called <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D, {{was developed}} to generate single and composite <b>grid</b> systems within geometrically complex two- and three-dimensional (2 - and 3 -D) spatial domains that can deform with time. <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D generates single <b>grid</b> systems by using algebraic <b>grid</b> generation methods based on transfinite interpolation in which the distribution of <b>grid</b> points within the spatial domain is controlled by stretching functions. All single <b>grid</b> systems generated by <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D can have <b>grid</b> lines that are continuous and differentiable everywhere up to the second-order. Also, <b>grid</b> lines can intersect boundaries of the spatial domain orthogonally. <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D generates composite <b>grid</b> systems by patching together two or more single <b>grid</b> systems. The patching can be discontinuous or continuous. For continuous composite <b>grid</b> systems, the <b>grid</b> lines are continuous and differentiable everywhere up to the second-order except at interfaces where different single <b>grid</b> systems meet. At interfaces where different single <b>grid</b> systems meet, the <b>grid</b> lines are only differentiable up to the first-order. For 2 -D spatial domains, the boundary curves are described by using either cubic or tension spline interpolation. For 3 -D spatial domains, the boundary surfaces are described by using either linear Coon's interpolation, bi-hyperbolic spline interpolation, or a new technique referred to as 3 -D bi-directional Hermite interpolation. Since <b>grid</b> systems generated by algebraic methods can have <b>grid</b> lines that overlap one another, <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D contains a graphics package for evaluating the <b>grid</b> systems generated. With the graphics package, the user can generate <b>grid</b> systems in an interactive manner with the <b>grid</b> generation part of <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D. <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D is written in FORTRAN 77 and can be run on any IBM PC, XT, or AT compatible computer. In order to use <b>GRID</b> 2 D/ 3 D on workstations or mainframe computers, some minor modifications must {{be made in the}} graphics part of the program; no modifications are needed in the <b>grid</b> generation part of the program.

Its corresponding east-west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E
