50|$|Muni Meter is {{the name}} used by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) for its pay and display {{centralized}} parking meter system. The Muni Meter system was introduced broadly in 2009, following a period of experimentation that began in 1999. Muni Meters are located on streets adjacent {{to a group of}} parking spots, with no designated striping that separates spots. A driver parks their car, pays at the Muni Meter (using coins, credit cards, or prepaid parking cards), and takes a receipt provided by the Meter. They then display that receipt on their vehicle's dashboard. The system reduces the number of <b>individual</b> <b>meter</b> devices required, increases the number of parking spots available (by allowing as many cars to park as can fit) and, some argue, reduces losses due to unused time left on meters (which may then be reused by subsequent parkers).|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to look more closely at {{incentives}} for a landlord to use <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> and charging of heat and water. This paper also aims to look at the possible reasons for the differences in use of <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> and charging between Sweden and Germany. Design/methodology/approach – The research in this paper is based on a questionnaire and interviews with landlords, in Sweden, using <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> and charging. Findings – The two main incentives for the landlords in the survey to use <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> are the possibility to save energy and the possibility to create a fair allocation of heating cost between tenants. Sweden has a long history of heat and water included in the rent leading to a possibly tougher transition to <b>individual</b> <b>metering.</b> Originality/value – To see the overall picture and understand the purpose of <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> is important to avoid conflicts between landlords and tenants.

The {{widespread}} {{deployment of}} smart meters for the modernisation {{of the electricity}} distribution network, but also for gas and water consumption, {{has been associated with}} privacy concerns due to the potentially large number of measurements that reflect the consumers behaviour.

40|$|A well studied privacy {{problem in}} the area of smart grids is the {{question}} of how to aggregate the sum of a set of smart meter readings in a privacy friendly manner, i. e., in such a way that <b>individual</b> <b>meter</b> readings are not revealed to the adversary. Much less well studied is how to deal with arbitrary meter crashes during such aggregation protocols: current privacy friendly aggregation protocols cannot deal with these type of failures. Such failures do happen in practice, though. We therefore propose two privacy friendly aggregation protocols that tolerate such crash failures, up to a predefined maximum number of smart meters. The basic protocol tolerates meter crashes at the start of each aggregation round only. The full, more complex, protocol tolerates meter crashes at arbitrary moments during an aggregation round. It runs in a constant number of phases, cleverly avoiding the otherwise applicable consensus protocol lower bound.

40|$|The energy {{issue is}} rising on the agendas {{all over the}} world and energy {{efficiency}} and energy saving become more and more important. The building sector stands for a large part of the total energy used, e. g. for space heating and cooling, heating of domestic hot water and household electricity and there is a recent European directive related to the energy performance of buildings. The influence of occupant behaviour on the use of energy in the residential building sector has furthermore got increased attention in recent years. The overall aim of the work is to contribute to the knowledge about possible energy savings in existing Swedish apartment buildings. The more specific aim is to analyse the influence of demand controlled ventilation and room temperature on the heat requirements in a typical Swedish apartment building. The aim related to demand controlled ventilation is to analyse the performance of a system for Swedish apartment buildings developed as a part of the research work. The aim related to demand controlled room temperature is to analyse a novel system developed as an individual heat (or comfort) metering system. The analysis also includes a more general evaluation of <b>individual</b> <b>metering.</b> The work is strongly related to a comprehensive renovation project recently carried out by the municipal housing company Bostads AB Gårdsten. A demand controlled ventilation system is installed and evaluated in one of the buildings. The analyses related to <b>individual</b> <b>metering,</b> including demand controlled room temperature (comfort metering), are carried out using <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> results in 255 apartments during a period of four years. The analyses show that the performance of the heating system has a major influence on the possibilities to utilise demand controlled ventilation and room temperature in apartment buildings. Another general conclusion is that <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> of heat for space heating has a rather small influence on the overall potential for energy savings in apartment buildings. A third conclusion is that <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> requires a considerable effort by the building owner both concerning operation and maintenance and administration...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{innovative}} energy efficient fluid power systems for mobile applications. The subjects taken up concern {{to what extent}} and how energy losses can be reduced in mobile working hydraulics systems. Various measures are available for increasing energy efficiency {{in these kinds of}} systems. Examples include: Flow controlled systems The pump controller is switched from a load sensing toa displacement controlled one. The displacement is controlled in an open loopfashion directly from the operator’s demand signals. This reduces energy consumptionat the same time as dynamic issues that are attached to LS systemscan be avoided. <b>Individual</b> <b>metering</b> valve systems Flexibility is increased by removing the mechanicalcoupling between the meter-in and meter-out orifices in directionalvalves. An overview of this kind of system is given in the thesis. A designproposal that has been implemented is also presented. Initial test results areshown. Patents for this particular system have been applied for. Displacement control Metering losses are reduced by removing the directional valves. One pump is used for each load in such systems. This hardware layout involvesconsiderable changes compared to conventional systems. Displacementcontrolled systems are not studied in this work. In mobile applications, overall efficiency is often poor and losses are substantial. The measures listed above can help improve this significantly in such applications. A flow dividing system can decrease energy consumption by about 10 % and an <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> system by about 20 %. Losses in pump controlled systems are difficult to give a figure for; the losses are rather attached to the pumps and motors and not to the system layout. However, the losses for these systems are presumably even lower than for <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> systems. The main focus in this work is on <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> systems but questions about which components and so on are also treated.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{compensate}} for imbalance in solar energy between different sides of a building, and the resultant difference in energy availability and (heating/cooling) demand, methods using offsetting were developed to adjust occupiers’ energy bills. In the case of solar electricity generation, a model was considered, {{in which all the}} power is routed through common meter(s), so that total electricity generated is recorded. Equal proportions of this metered energy can then be deducted from occupiers’ <b>individual</b> <b>meter</b> readings, to give the net energy use for which each user is billed. Computer-based models were used to calculate the imbalance on those energy demands, which are affected by solar gain, i. e., space heating and cooling. The offset was calculated, such that all users pay the same bill for a given thermostat setting, and are charged more or less, for settings which result in higher or lower energy consumption respectively. Several case studies were performed, in which one building parameter was changed between successive trials. It was found that the offset was different in each case. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate the offset separately for each location, and for each building, depending on those parameters related to solar and thermal energy exchange...|$|E

FreeStyle Lite system results in these studies were compared to the plasma equivalent glucose values of the fingertip blood samples measured by the YSI Glucose An-alyzer. Subjects participating in the user performance study rated the ease of use of the FreeStyle Lite system. Laboratory studies were performed at Abbott Diabetes Care to validate analytical performance of the FreeStyle Lite system under various testing conditions. Results: In fingertip testing, accuracy of the FreeStyle Lite system was demonstrated by com-paring results from 142 patients with the YSI plasma equivalent glucose values (r = 0. 99, mean absolute bias = 4. 7 %).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} security policy for a distributed utility metering system. The system uses untrusted networks, {{such as the}} Internet, to communicate between service providers (water, gas, electricity etc.) and the gateway servers at customer premises. Within a building, the system uses a low-bandwidth mains-borne network, or Field-Area Network (FAN), such as Fieldbus, to communicate between the gateway server {{and each of the}} utility meters. The FAN is regarded as untrusted, and communications to and from each utility meter must be protected from all other meters and any possible outsiders on the network. It must also be assumed that the gateway server is physically vulnerable to attack, and that its loss must not jeopardise the security of the system. Each service provider must be able to access each utility meter individually. Service providers can send commands to individual utility meters, and obtain <b>individual</b> <b>meter</b> readings applicable to their service. Service providers must not be able to interfere with one another’s service. However, the gateway must be able to interpret communications initiated by individual meters, to ensure that the alarm can be raised to service providers if a meter reading appears to have been tampered with. On high-bandwidth networks, well known symmetric and public-key cryptography techniques can easily provide the required features. However, with a low-bandwidth network such as FANs, the protocol must be carefully optimised to minimise the amount of data transmitted. This dissertation describes a new architecture, in which well-known cryptography principles are applied in the FAN field in a way that has not been described in the literature.

40|$|<b>Individual</b> <b>metering</b> {{of energy}} in flats is a real {{opportunity}} to save energy and money for the occupiers of collective-ownership buildings with centralised heating systems. The individual management of energy, through such devices, make users more responsible and also stimulates them to implement energy retrofit interventions in their flats. The use of <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> systems in existing apartments, however, could have some critical aspects. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyse the application of individual energy systems in existing collective-ownership residential buildings, highlighting the critical aspects and providing practical solutions to overcome them. A study has been made of an <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> application in an existing residential block of flats located in Milan (Italy) with poor thermal insulation between the various dwellings themselves and for the outside walls of the building. Although a net reduction of 50. 4 % in the global costs for winter heating, obtained exclusively through plant-modification works, represents an optimum goal for energy savings, the study highlight some critical aspects. The savings for different apartments differ greatly and depend upon the criteria chosen for burden sharing. This study shows that the phenomenon of ???heat theft??? can prove to be important and provides the possibility of reducing to zero the quota of expenses from consumption whilst still benefiting from comfortable temperatures. Once the problems have been identified, the paper then proposes solutions to overcome them through a revision of the criteria for the allocation of energy costs...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified certain factors {{to have an}} influence on residential water consumption e. g. water metering, price and pricing policies, income level, age of residents, and building age. Their significance varies between countries and by location within an individual country. There is no previously published research on this topic in Finland or other Nordic countries. Therefore, in this master´s thesis, {{an analysis of the}} common influencing factors on the residential water consumption at the metropolitan region Helsinki between 2004 - 2014 is provided, as well as predictions till 2040. The aim of this work is to evaluate the development of the residential consumption since 2004, and to identify influencing factors, which have a positive or negative influence on the consumption of the customers. The influencing factors were analysed and statistically evaluated using a mix method approach with the provided consumption, population, and building information data. Block building type was identified to have the highest water consumption as well as the highest decrease in consumption during the observation period. Focusing on the drivers, the building age and the household size were identified to have the greatest influence on consumption. The expected decrease in consumption due to the use of <b>individual</b> <b>meter</b> was not identified. Water consumption schemes in the future were also analysed, and the predictions are presented for Helsinki on district level until 2025 and for the metropolitan region until 2040. The total consumption was found to increase as a result of rising population, while the consumption per person is decreasing due to the saving potential of renovations and technology. Espoo and Vantaa were identified to have the highest saving potential in per person consumption.

In Sri Lankan distribution network {{most of the new}} technological features {{can be seen in the}} different part such as automated meter reading, remote breaker operations. But distribution system fault identifications, voltage monitoring and network reconfiguration are carried out using basic technologies. Automated Meter Reading (AMR) system is introduced to read analogue energy meters remotely. Research on agent based AMR system is established with four major projects. Those are Agent based meter reading system, network resource planning of the agent based system, agent network reconfiguration and restoration project and Agent based voltage and outage monitoring system This particular research is on a development of Agent based voltage and outage monitoring system formulated for power distribution network using Multi Agent System. Establishment of agent based monitoring system is developed with the defined model in a part of the area network. The model is established to represent the distribution network and to collect voltage and interruption data to the server. Five major agents namely, Database Agent, Meter Agent, Breaker Agent, Area network Agent and Reporting Agent are defined. Voltage data collected from GPRS meter reading technique in Maharagama area is selected for the case study. Six different data sets are considered under the case study. There are four different types of voltage failures are identified as High voltage, low voltage, Branch failures and <b>individual</b> <b>meter</b> faults. These four scenarios are compared with conventional method and agent based system. Agent based monitoring system is continuously updated through GUI and it would visualise the voltage level of the network. It would enhance the functions of the control room operator. Transformer setting changes can be changed while monitoring high voltage and low voltage areas. Distribution network augmentation can be done with monitoring system by increasing transformer capacity or introducing new transformer in identified areas. Different types of GUIs are established to maintain easy monitoring system and reporting system. The reporting system is included the agent based report generation for power quality measurement indexes.

40|$|L'auteur présente les horaires flexibles, leurs avantages pour l'employeur et pour l'employé, leurs modalités d'application et les réactions de différentes parties à cette forme d'aménagement du temps de travail. For {{the last}} five years rigid working {{schedules}} have increasingly been under attack and many new experiences have been tried in many European countries, particularly in Germany and Switzeriand. The essence of these experiences has been to adapt working schedules to each worker through a flexible hour system. The basic principle of such a system is the free and individual choice of entry and exit time within certain limits. The flexible working hours system generally distinguishes three separate components to a working day : a core time when all employees must be at their job and two flexible time periods, at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the working day. Such a system has advantages for both the employer and the employee. As for the employer, such a system facilitates time Computing, encourages a decrease of short term absenteism and turnover, a reduction of internal traffic, a decrease of accidents on the way to work, a reduction of overtime, greater hiring advantages, and a longer service to the consumer. Moreover management workers may work in a more peaceful atmosphere, the social climate is ameliorated and internal conflicts are reduced. As for the employees, a reduction of transportation time has been noted, family and personal needs are given a better chance to be satisfied, and a change of attitude towards work was underlined. There is no best way to design and install such a system. There are many variations to it and adaptation is surely favorized under such a system. Experience, however, teaches some ground rules. First such a system much be progressively introduced. Experimentation is greatly encouraged. Second, it takes time for the system to give good results. Third, trial and error is often the best method. Fourth, rules must be established to avoid misunderstandings. Fifth, pragmatism is the golden rule. Sixth, a clear distinction must be made between exceeding hours and overtime. Seventh, a lot of information is necessary before and during the introduction of the system. Flexible working hours practically require a form of control. This control, however, should itself be as flexible and as discreet as possible. Self control is to be aimed at. Such a control can be made by a time card, posted or not, by a punch clock, by special <b>individual</b> <b>meter</b> or by computer. To the same extent that flexible working hour system is well accepted by employees, to the same extent does it find obstruction at the middle management level. That the system is applied to middle management is perceived as a move to put them on the same level as blue collar workers. But the basic reluctance of white collars comes from the revised notion of authority required by a flexible hour system. If one group needs particular attention when flexible hours are introduced, it is middle management. Eventhough early reluctance of unions has been greatly dissipated, they still feel that such a system decreases the possibility of human contacts and that the greater responsibility left to the workers is subtle moral constraint. Up to now, flexible hours have been very successful. This is not to say that they are a panacea nor that they will settle all personnel problems...|$|E
40|$|The study aims {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} in apartment buildings where <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> and charging of heat is applied. The {{aim is to}} develop planning and design for <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> and charging in apartment buildings. The study is based on literature review, interviews and case study that include analysis of existing documents. Interviews were carried out with the property developer and the involved consultants who planned the apartment building Yasuragi. To investigate the differences the condominium association has noted in heat consumption between flats, the debit values of the heat were used to discern which houses that were furthest from the average consumption. On these flats there were temperature measurements and thermal photo shoots made for discriminating behavior and possible construction techniques which could be the explanation for the heat spread. Boverket shows that the consumption of heat can be reduced by 10 - 20 % after insertion of <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> and charging in an apartment block. Heat spread {{is a problem with}} <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> and charging of heat. The spread of heat consumption in Yasuragi depends on heat hikes, transmission losses, external heat sources, thermal bridges and the user’s behavior. The consultant does not plan and design in the current situation to ensure that all flats will be fully equal with respect to external heat sources. They work to make the best possible plan solutions and to make room for all the systems and to get the systems to work. Since the property developer has no requirements or take initiative on IMD-system to the apartments to be equivalent, there are development opportunities in the current situation. The thesis has reported deficiencies in the design stage and provides improvement suggestions to the actors projecting apartment buildings where the IMD applies. It can also be regarded as a knowledge base for developers. To develop the planning stage, the developer and consultants should have experience and better knowledge of how the system is affected by various factors, as well as the design gets to impact upon the final heat consumption. The property developer may require the consultants that they should describe and take into account that each apartment will function equally.

40|$|Though {{displacement}} controlled {{hydraulic systems}} {{have proven to}} be an efficient way to minimize the valve metering losses to valve controlled actuators, the pump requirement for each actuator makes the multi actuators system more expensive and need more space than the other. Other hydraulic systems with <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> valves and low side pressure maintain line enable the regeneration mode, but only under assistive loads. Topography with Integrated Energy Recovery (TIER) system is used to control the swing, boom, stick and bucket motion of an excavator. The TIER system often has several operating modes available for completing tasks, and some modes involve multiple actuators supplied by a single pump. ^ The objective of this work is to evaluate and characterize a new control mode taking advantage of displacement control and <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> control, where two actuators are supplied by a single pump. This operating mode is within the capabilities of the TIER system. It can also be generalized for other multi-actuator systems served by one pump, including more than two actuators. ^ In support of the control mode development, a hydraulic system simulation model was developed to predict and characterize the performance of the system. The system schematic is a subset of TIER, with one pump, two actuators and eight high speed electrically-actuated proportional valves. A two-level controller including supervisory mode selection and local controller was developed and applied to the hydraulic system model. The hybrid displacement control mode has been simulated using flow control and pressure control algorithms to test the stability of the controller. A loading cycle derived using experimental data from a 5 -ton compact excavator was used as input to the model. From the simulation study with the specific loading cycle, the proposed control mode can work in both assistive and resistive load conditions. The hybrid displacement control reduced fuel consumption for the loading cycle by 14. 8 % compared to the same loading cycle with <b>individual</b> <b>metering</b> control. ...|$|R
