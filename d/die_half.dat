During the 1970s and 1980s, the Grand National saw a total of 12 horses <b>die</b> (<b>half</b> of which were at Becher's Brook); in the next 20-year period from 1990 to 2010, when modifications to the course were most significant, there were 17 equine fatalities.

In 2013, when further changes were made to introduce a more flexible fence structure, there were no fatalities in the race itself although two horses died in run-up races over the same course.

40|$|Introduction: Pigweed is a weed which {{grows in}} the {{pastures}} of Iran. Local people use the plant leaves to cook traditional food. Bermuda grass with its rapid growth and distribution is regarded a real threat to prairies and {{it can lead to}} tremors syndrome in cattle and sheep. Burdock which also grows in many parts of Iran is used as a medicinal herb. In this study, the cytotoxicity potential of the three plants was assessed via Artemia Salina test. Methods: Pigweed, Bermuda grass and burdock were collected from Ghaemshahr in the North of Iran. The leaves were dried and the essence of the three plants was extracted. The larvaes were hatched from cysts of Artemia salina at 26 ˚C in filtered seawater. The plant extracts with different concentration (10, 100 and 1000 ppm) were added to the solution larvaes. Results: The LC 50 values (the concentration which needed to <b>die</b> <b>half</b> the larvaes) were measured for pigweed, Bermuda grass and burdock at 1640, 990, and 840 ppm, respectively.

40|$|In this study, a {{cold-work}} {{plane strain}} extrusion apparatus {{was used to}} perform plasticity analysis of a work piece that was extruded using RBD palm olein as a cold metal forming lubricant. The experimental apparatus consists {{of a set of}} two taper dies with 45 -degree <b>die</b> <b>half</b> angles and a billet (work piece). The experiments were carried out at room temperature, which was within the range of 28 to 32 °C. The testing lubricant was refined, bleached and deodorized palm olein (RBD palm olein). The billet material was annealed pure aluminium, A 1100. The experimental results focused on the extrusion force, surface roughness of both the deformation area and the product surface and sliding velocity. The grid lines, which were scribed on the billet, were used to observe and analyze the plastic flow in the material. The velocity distributions on the experimental surface of the billet were calculated using a visioplasticity method. Similar experimental and analytical investigations were carried out using additive-free paraffinic mineral oil and were compared to the investigation with RBD palm olein. The RBD palm olein showed a reduced extrusion force and a better quality surface roughness. The work piece that was extruded with RBD palm olein showed better plastic behavior as compared to those that were extruded with paraffinic mineral oil. It was confirmed that RBD palm olein shows satisfactory lubrication performance as compared to additive-free paraffinic mineral oil...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is {{the most}} common self-poisoning agent in the UK and a leading cause of fatal hepatotoxicity. Following {{legislation}} in 1998 to limit pack sizes, beneficial effects on paracetamol-related mortality and morbidity were reported in England. However, there are still over 100 deaths a year and evidence of breaches of sales guidelines. AIM: To investigate characteristics of people taking larger paracetamol overdoses and compliance with sales guidelines, to inform possible further initiatives to reduce paracetamol fatalities. DESIGN AND METHODS: Interview study of 60 general hospital patients who took overdoses of over 16 paracetamol tablets (8 g). RESULTS: Half of all paracetamol overdoses involved over 16 tablets. Patients were predominantly young (three-quarters aged 16 - 40 years) and female (58. 3 %); over half (53. 3 %) had taken a previous paracetamol overdose. Three-quarters said they wanted to <b>die.</b> <b>Half</b> took the overdose within an hour of first thinking of it, half (53. 3 %) took tablets already in the home and 58. 3 % bought tablets specifically for the overdose. Ten people tried to buy more than 32 tablets in one transaction; four succeeded. Most knew that a paracetamol overdose could cause death or permanent damage (88. 3 %) and harm the liver (80. 0 %) but 70. 0 % thought they would lose consciousness. Warnings on packs had little deterrent effect. Media and internet influences were identified. Patients chose paracetamol because it was cheap and easily available. CONCLUSIONS: Further measures to reduce breaches of sales guidelines and the dangers of paracetamol overdose are required. Media and internet site producers should follow guidelines on reporting suicide...|$|E
40|$|The ‘full sleeve’ {{construction}} {{has been designed}} and accomplished in the horizontal cold-chamber pressure die casting machine. Main part of this solution is a counter plunger placed in a movable <b>die</b> <b>half</b> which allows for full filling of the shot sleeve and precisely fixes the metal quantity needed for casting. The purpose of this new construction solution is mainly {{the reduction of the}} casting porosity caused by air entrapment and the improvement of both castability and accuracy of the die cavity reproduction. For such a redesigned machine there have been performed examinations consisting in pressure casting of AlSi 9 Cu alloy (EN AC- 46000) at varying plunger velocity in the second stage of injection and varying intensification pressure. The alloy castability (the die filling ability) has been measured for each parameter setting. For the purpose of comparison, similar measurements have been performed also for the conventional system without a counter plunger. The castability examination has been done by means of a specially designed die with an impression of a trial casting of variable wall thickness. The experiments have been held according to the assumed factor design 22, what allowed for determining the mathematical models describing the influence of die filling parameters on the castability and the die cavity reproduction level. Both alternatives of the experiment confirmed the positive influence of plunger velocity and intensification pressure increase on the improvement of castability, the measure of the latter being the filled length of the impression. Applying of the new ‘full sleeve’ solution has improved castability for each experiment by about 20 % as compared with conventional alternative. Castability in the ‘full sleeve’ system has been increased even for low values of plunger velocity and intensification pressure. For both alternative systems the influence of plunger velocity has been found, as an average, by four times greater than the influence of intensification pressure. The possibility of applying lower pressure values has been noticed for the shot sleeve construction with the counter plunger. This can influence favourably both the die and the machine durability. The obtained results have been explained and it has been pointed out that the ‘full sleeve’ construction can be widely adopted in pressure die casting of metal alloys...|$|E
