60|$|The unknown mariner ceased speaking, for the {{situation}} of the periagua, was truly getting to be a little critical. At least so it seemed to the less-instructed landsmen, who were witnesses of this unexpected rencontre. As the ferry-boat had drawn in with the island, the wind hauled more through the pass which communicates with the outer bay, and it became necessary to heave about, twice, in order to <b>fetch</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> of the usual landing-place. The first of these manoeuvres had been executed, and as it necessarily changed their course, the passengers saw that the cutter to which the stranger alluded was enabled to get within-shore of them; or nearer to the wharf, where they ought to land, than they were themselves. Instead of suffering himself to be led off by a pursuit, that he knew might easily be rendered useless, the officer who commanded this boat cheered his men, and pulled swiftly to the point of debarkation. On the other hand, a second cutter, which had already reached the line of the periagua's course, lay on its oars, and awaited its approach. The unknown mariner manifested no intention to avoid the interview. He still held the tiller, and as effectually commanded the little vessel as if his authority were of a more regular character. The audacity and decision of his air and conduct, aided by the consummate mariner in which he worked the boat, might alone have achieved this momentary usurpation, had not the general feeling against impressment been so much in his favor.|$|E

6000|$|Just at that instant, {{some one}} cried out [...] "Sail-ho!" [...] and sure enough, a ship was seen some {{four or five}} miles to leeward, a whaler evidently, turning <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> under easy canvass, in order to rejoin her boat, from which she had lately been {{separated}} by the night and the fog. This, then, {{was no more than}} a whaler and her boat; and, on sweeping the horizon with a glass, Talcott soon discovered, a mile <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> of the boat, a dead whale, with another boat lying by it, in waiting for the approach of the ship, which promised <b>to</b> <b>fetch</b> as far <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> on its next tack.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe spectral method of sea and swell wave forecasting yields more meaningful results than do other forecasting methods. To shorten {{the time required}} to make such a forecast the authors used high-speed computer methods and the Piers on-Neumann-James spectra to make spectral forecasts and display the results in graphic form for several synoptic weather models and a wide range of wind and fetch speeds. Forecasts were completed for a stationary fetch model, a <b>fetch</b> moving <b>to</b> leeward and a <b>fetch</b> moving <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> Computations were made with the assumptions that a rectangular generating area could be delineated; that a spatially-uniform mean wind existed; that this wind did not increase or decrease until the time of forecast; and finally that if the fetch were moving, its movement was steady. The following parameter limits were established: a. wind speeds, 15 to 55 knots; b. speed of the generating area, 15 knots to and including the wind speed; c. forecast times, 6 to 72 hours. Results of the forecasts are plotted on approximately 250 graphs which show the geographic distribution of spectral sea or swell components relative <b>to</b> the <b>fetch</b> at forecast times.

6000|$|The enemy had five-and-thirty days' start; but he {{calculated}} {{that he should}} gain eight or ten days upon them by his exertions. May 15th he made Madeira, and on June 4th reached Barbadoes, whither he had sent despatches before him; and where he found Admiral Cochrane, with two ships, part of our squadron in those seas being at Jamaica. He found here also accounts that the combined fleets had been seen from St. Lucia on the 28th, standing to the southward, and that Tobago and Trinidad were their objects. This Nelson doubted; but he was alone in his opinion, and yielded it with these foreboding words: [...] "If your intelligence proves false, you lose me the French fleet." [...] Sir W. Myers offered to embark here with 2000 troops; they were taken on board, {{and the next morning}} he sailed for Tobago. Here accident confirmed the false intelligence which had, whether from intention or error, misled him. A merchant at Tobago, in the general alarm, not knowing whether this fleet was friend or foe, sent out a schooner to reconnoitre, and acquaint him by signal. The signal which he had chosen happened to be the very one which had been appointed by Col. Shipley of the engineers to signify that the enemy were at Trinidad; and as this was {{at the close of the}} day, there was no opportunity of discovering the mistake. An American brig was met with about the same time, the master of which, with that propensity to deceive the English and assist the French in any manner which has been but too common among his countrymen, affirmed that he had been boarded off Granada a few days before by the French, who were standing towards the Bocas of Trinidad. This fresh intelligence removed all doubts. The ships were cleared for action before daylight, and Nelson entered the Bay of Paria on the 7th, hoping and expecting to make the mouths of the Orinoco as famous in the annals of the British navy as those of the Nile. Not an enemy was there; and it was discovered that accident and artifice had combined to lead him so far to leeward, that there could have been little hope of <b>fetching</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> of Granada for any other fleet. Nelson, however, with skill and exertions never exceeded, and almost unexampled, bore for that island.|$|R
60|$|This {{ended the}} {{conversation}} at that time, for {{just then the}} party reached the Peak. Little, however, did the governor, or his pretty wife, imagine how much the future was connected with the interest of which they had just been speaking, or dream of the form in which the serpent of old was about to visit this Eden of modern times. But occurrences of another character almost immediately attracted their attention, and absorbed all the care and energy of the colony for some time. Scarcely was the party on the Peak, when the keen, lively eyes of the younger Bridget caught sight of a strange sail; and, presently, another and another came into view. In a word, no less than three vessels were in sight, the first that had ever been seen in those seas, {{with the exception of}} the regular and well-known craft of the colony. These strangers were a ship and two brigs; evidently vessels of some size, particularly the first; and they were consorts, keeping in company, and sailing in a sort of line, which would seem to denote more of order and concert than it was usual to find among merchantmen. They were all on a wind, standing to the southward and eastward, and were now, when first seen, fairly within the strait between the Peak and the group, unquestionably in full sight of both, and distant from each some five or six leagues. With the wind as it was, nothing would have been easier for them all, than <b>to</b> <b>fetch</b> far enough <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> <b>to</b> pass directly beneath the western cliffs, and, consequently, directly in front of the cove.|$|R
6000|$|The {{land and}} light were now close aboard us, and I {{expected}} every moment {{to hear the}} brig's keel grinding on the bottom. At this instant I caught a faint glimpse of a vessel at anchor to the eastward of the point, and apparently distant {{about a quarter of}} a mile. The thought struck me that she might be an English cruiser, for they frequently anchored in such places; and I called out, as it might be instinctively, [...] "luff!" [...] Neb was at the helm, and I knew by his cheerful answer that the fellow was delighted. It was lucky we luffed as we did, for, in coming to the wind, the vessel gave a scrape that was a fearful admonisher of what would have happened in another minute. The Amanda minded her helm beautifully, however, and we went past the nearest land without any further hints, heading up just high enough <b>to</b> <b>fetch</b> a little <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> of the vessel at anchor. At the next moment, the lugger, then about a cable's length from as, was shut in by the land. I was now in great hopes the Frenchman would be obliged to tack; but he had measured his distance well, and felt certain, it would seem, that he could lay past. He reasoned, probably, as Nelson is said to have reasoned at the Nile, and as some of his captains unquestionably did reason; that is, if there was water enough for us, there was water enough for him. In another minute I saw him, jammed nearly into the wind's eye, luffing past the point, and falling as easily into our wake as if drawn by attraction.|$|R
