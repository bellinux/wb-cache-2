50|$|Alamein Farm, {{also known}} as Ruzambu Farm, is a 5,000 hectare farm at Beatrice, in the Mashonaland East area of Zimbabwe, 72 km south of the capital Harare. It was a highly {{productive}} commercial farming operation, employing around one thousand people and producing large quantities of tobacco, maize and Rhodes grass, as well as cattle and <b>farmed</b> <b>game.</b> The farm gained notoriety in 2002, when General Solomon Mujuru and his wife, Zimbabwean Vice President Joice Mujuru, evicted the farm owner and all farm inhabitants {{under the auspices of}} the Land Reform Programme, and became the first of President Robert Mugabe's inner circle to be found guilty of unlawful land seizures. Under General Mujuru, the farm continued to produce tobacco, maize and game. Farm workers also produced their own tobacco on land allocated to them.|$|E

The main goal {{of this study was}} to focus on the quality parameters of the meat or game meat and also on the already existing conclusions of those scientific studies, which dealt with some specific indicators of farmed and hunting game meat quality. The thesis includes the game's devision, description of some of its kinds and information on game keeping, hunting development and even on gaining the game itself. Besides it covers also veterinary and hygienic requirements on the meat and on the release of the game to the market. Considerable part of the thesis deals with possible biological, chemical and physical risks of meat consumption. The major differences between farmed and hunting game as well as selected kinds of <b>farmed</b> <b>game</b> are described in the conclusion of the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Human-wildlife {{conflict}} between carnivores and livestock and game owners {{is an issue}} of high conservation concern and has led to the global decline of many large carnivore species. Research has shown that carnivores are often blamed for higher levels of predation of livestock and game than actually occurs and this often leads to retaliatory killing. The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain information via scat analysis on the range of prey species taken by leopards in the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa, and combine these data with self-reported accounts of livestock predation from local landowners to examine differences between real and perceived leopard predation. Results showed that despite landowners reporting frequent events of leopard predation of livestock and introduced <b>farmed</b> <b>game</b> across the Soutpansberg farming community, no evidence of these species were found in leopard diets. The most frequently eaten species by relative biomass were bushbuck, hyrax and vervet monkeys; in contrast, the farmers reported cattle and impala as often being taken by leopards. Despite sharing the landscape with domestic cattle and introduced game, leopards in the Soutpansberg do not frequently utilise these species as prey and instead focus their diets on wild species. Human-carnivore conflict can be reduced by overcoming the mismatch between actual and perceived levels of predation via landowner education, effective anti-predation measures, an improved government response to reports of livestock predation and potentially giving economic value to problem animals via trophy hunting...|$|E

40|$|African {{wild dogs}} (Lycaon pictus) {{have been the}} focus of {{intensive}} conservation concern due a severe reduction in range, successive extinctions even in protected areas, and the endangered status of the remaining 3, 000 - 5, 000 individuals. Like many large carnivores, mortality due to conflict with humans, particularly control associated with livestock depredation, is a major cause of decline. Reversal of the decline will require mitigating the conflict, which in turn necessitates assessment of the problem and a more complete understanding of wild dog depredation behavior. I discuss depredation studies in North America and Europe that may inform wild dog conflict and behavior, although research on wild dogs and other predators in African contexts is urgently needed. Intricately linked to the negative values that many Africans hold for the species, wild dogs prey on domestic stock, including sheep, goats, cattle, and <b>farmed</b> <b>game</b> animals, wherever researchers have looked in human communities. The magnitude of actual wild dog predation is little studied, however. I propose to investigate wild dogs in livestock areas of central Botswana where a poorly known population exists across several land-use patterns and in conflict with human communities. By understanding the conditions in which wild dogs prey on domestic stock, conservation biologists, together with wildlife managers and livestock producers, can work toward preventing depredation loss or increasing local tolerance. Human-carnivore coexistence will be a major challenge in most African contexts where economic losses, even when small, can be significant to small-scale producers and lethal control can be convenient and effective...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} if Coxiella burnetii, the causative {{agent of}} Q fever, genotypes circulating in wildlife {{are associated with}} those infecting livestock and humans, multiple-locus variable number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA- 6 -marker) was carried out over C. burnetii obtained from red deer (Cervus elaphus), Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), black rat (Rattus rattus), and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). MLVA typing was performed by using six variable loci in C. burnetii: Ms 23, Ms 24, Ms 27, Ms 28, Ms 33, and Ms 34. The C. burnetii cooperative database from MLVABank 5. 0 was employed to compare genotypes {{found in this study}} with 344 isolates of diverse origin. Twenty-two genotypes from wildlife and two genotypes from domestic goats were identified. Some MLVA genotypes identified in wildlife or in <b>farmed</b> <b>game</b> clustered with genotypes of human Q fever clinical cases, supporting the idea that humans and wildlife share C. burnetii genotypes. The major part of genotypes identified in coexisting red deer and rabbits clustered according to their host of origin, suggesting host specificity for particular C. burnetii genotypes. These findings provide important insights to understand the epidemiology of C. burnetii at the wildlife-livestock-human interface.

40|$|Abstract The red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta leporina) {{produces}} precocial {{young and}} is the most hunted and <b>farmed</b> <b>game</b> species in several Neotropical countries. An understanding of the reproductive biology, including the relationship between litter size and teat functionality is crucial for conservation management of this animal. In precocial mammals, as the red-rumped agouti, maintaining maternal contact to learn foraging patterns {{may be more important}} than the energy demands and nutritional constraints during lactation and suckling may not play important roles when compared to altricial mammals. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the relationship between mammary functionality with litter size, litter birth weight, and parturition number in captive red-rumped agouti. Functionality was assessed by manual palpation of teats from un-sedated females (N= 43). We compared the average birth weight of all newborns, male newborns and female newborns among agoutis with different litter sizes and different parturitions by one way ANOVA’s, while Pearson’s Chi-squared tests were used to detect relationships between teat functionality, litter size, and parturition number. Parturition number had no effect on the mean birth weight of all young (F 0. 822, P > 0. 05), male young (F 0. 80, P > 0. 05) or female young (F 0. 66, P > 0. 05) in the litters. We found (i) no significant correlations (P > 0. 05) between teat functionality and litter size and (ii) no significant correlations (P > 0. 05) between teat functionality and parturition number. This suggests that whilst all teat pairs were functional, functionality was a poor indicator of litter size; suggesting that female agouti young may not have a high dependency on maternal nutrition; an possible evolutionary strategy resulting in large wild populations; hence its popularity as a game species...|$|E

40|$|Lead and cadmium are toxic elements, {{which are}} {{a natural part of}} earth crust. They are taken up from the soil and {{transferred}} upwards in the plant and animal food chain. Cadmium is widely distributed throughout the natural environment with human activities having an important role in its dispersion into the biosphere. The natural sources of cadmium are volcanic eruptions and old granite rocks, {{which are a}}n important geochemical source. Anthropogenic sources of cadmium are related mainly to mining, fertilizers and atmospheric deposition. Leaded gasoline has been most important source of atmospheric lead. However, most countries have now prohibited the use of leaded gasoline. This action has greatly reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere. Anthropogenic sources of lead other than traffic are typically fossil fuel combustion, non-ferrous metal production and iron and steel production. Zinc and copper are important constituents {{in a number of different}} enzyme functions in man and animals. Zinc and copper reach the environment via industrial releases involving production and refining of metals. In 1997 emissions of heavy metal particulates were only a third of their values in the early 1990 s due to the installation of sulphur removal systems. In this study lead, cadmium, copper and zinc levels in Finnish game animals (moose, hares) and <b>farmed</b> <b>game</b> animal (reindeer) were studied during twenty years period. About 500 moose were collected between 1980 and 1999 from south western, southern, central and south eastern Finland. About the same number of Mountain and European hare samples were collected during the period 1980 and 1993 from south western, southern, south eastern and northern Finland. About 300 reindeer were collected in 1990 – 1992 from southern, eastern, western and northern Lapland. After these initial projects, it was decided to collect moose and reindeer samples every year as part of national residue control program; fifteen moose and ten reindeer per year. In this residue control program, also cattle samples have been collected regularly; muscle, liver and kidney from 30 animals in every year. The lead and cadmium levels in muscle tissue has decreased in all studied animals during the monitoring years being now near to the limit of quantification; 0. 01 mg/kg w. w. for lead and 0. 001 mg/kg w. w for cadmium. Also the lead levels in liver and kidney samples have decreased during the monitoring period but the moose cadmium levels have increased. The zinc levels had also increased in moose samples but there were no significant 5 correlation with increasing cadmium and zinc levels. The lead levels in liver and kidney in moose varied in 1999 from 0. 04 to 0. 07 mg/kg w. w. and 0. 05 - 0. 07 mg/kg w. w. The corresponding values for cadmium are 0. 71 - 1. 28 mg/kg w. w. and 4. 95 - 6. 18 mg/kg w. w. The cadmium and lead levels in Mountain hares are higher than in European hares and the kidney cadmium levels in Mountain hares are statistically significantly higher than the kidney cadmium levels in moose. The lead levels in liver and kidney samples in both adult and calves of reindeer have been invariably below the recommended maximum level in the EU (0. 5 mg/kg). However, the kidney cadmium level exceeds the maximum level (1. 0 mg/kg) in almost all adult reindeer samples and also in some calves. The meat of Finnish moose, reindeer and hares does not contain residues of cadmium and lead and therefore consumers can be assured that consumption of the meat is not a health risk. The consumption of the organs of the animals studied may represent a health risk for human. However, the levels are far from the toxic levels to the animals themselves...|$|E
40|$|Meat {{inspection}} (MI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely implemented and longest running systems of surveillance. It was primarily introduced to identify meat of animals that is not fit for human consumption. Additionally, MI was progressively recognised as a suitable source of data collection and for monitoring a broad spectrum of diseases and conditions concerning animal health and welfare. For Europe, MI tasks are regulated at the European rather than country level and include a set of activities before and after stunning (ante and post mortem inspection) involving visual inspection, palpation and incisions. Over the last decade, the current MI protocol has been challenged because of its low sensitivity for important public health hazards. We aimed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of current MI protocols with primary focus on its utility in the context of animal health – including both notifiable and production diseases – and welfare, i. e. its capacity to detect cases with an aim to quantify the frequency of animal disease and welfare cases. The consequences of an alternative inspection protocol using visual-only inspection were also explored. As a first step, a review of grey and published literature was conducted for a selected number of diseases and welfare conditions in seven species or species groups: swine, poultry, bovines, small ruminants, solipeds and <b>farmed</b> <b>game,</b> represented by red deer, wild boar, rabbits and ostriches. This review highlighted a substantial lack of suitable and accessible published data on the frequency of occurrence of many diseases and conditions affecting food animals in Europe. Additionally, there were very limited data on the detection performance of MI, particularly in relation to specific degrees of severity of clinical signs. Due to the data gaps, a large proportion of input data used in this work was based on expert opinion and general biologic manifestations of the conditions investigated. The probability of case detection was quantified using a scenario tree modelling approach, taking into account the frequency of case presentation and inspection coverage. In general, the performance of MI was highly correlated with the presence of clinical and/or pathological signs in affected animals. Early or subclinical cases were likely to be “non-detectable” at slaughter. Regarding detectable cases, the impact of moving to visual-only inspection was negligible for most notifiable diseases and conditions considered with a few exceptions, primarily detectable cases of tuberculosis. Current MI activities were found to be effective to detect the majority of animal welfare conditions considered by species, predominantly by ante mortem inspection. The effectiveness of MI was also considered for endemic diseases that are not currently subject to systematic control efforts. These included respiratory diseases and parasite infections. It was shown that MI could provide an efficient means of identifying producers in need of animal health advice, provided that information is collected and fed back to veterinarians and livestock farmers. Within an integrated information system, MI could substantially contribute to the control of a considerable range of animal health and welfare issues. Data already collected need to be made available for on-farm decision making. It was also noted that if the slaughter population is strongly affected by international trade, i. e. where a large proportion of animals originate from one country and are slaughtered in another, the usefulness of MI for endemic disease surveillance will be affected by either reduced coverage or bias or both. In conclusion, our results indicate that while ante mortem inspection remains essential for the detection of animal welfare conditions, a move to visual-only post mortem inspection has - for the diseases and conditions considered - negligible negative impact on disease control. However in countries or regions that are not free of TB, special relevance of palpation and cutting of lymph nodes will have to be considered. MI information has considerable potential to inform disease control efforts, but only few countries use it systematically limiting the actual benefit that is achieved by these data. Finally, MI can also provide “back-up” surveillance in a situation where other means of detection fail and may represent the sole means of case detection for certain infections (e. g. liver fluke or cestodes) ...|$|E
