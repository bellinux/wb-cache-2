Unlike the French CEE7/6 plug, the earthing pin is on the plug, not in the socket. The Danish socket need not be recessed to protect the earthing pin. The Danish standard provides for sockets to have child-resistant shutters.|$|E
25|$|Laycock {{held the}} rank of a colonel (rather than brigadier) on the staff, because his command was not {{formally}} and organisationally a full brigade, with all its supporting elements, although, with a strength of over 2,000 men it was equivalent. For reasons of security, the commandos were organised into four battalions and were renamed, No. 7 Commando became 'A' Battalion, No. 8 (Guards) became 'B' Battalion, No. 11 (Scottish) became 'C' Battalion and No. 50 and No. 52 were amalgamated to form 'D' Battalion. Together they were to operate as a brigade of the British 6th Division, attached to the 8th Army. Each battalion was placed {{under the command of}} a lieutenant colonel and consisted of a headquarters, a signals section, a specialist <b>equipment</b> <b>section</b> equipped with a form of collapsible canoe known as a 'folbot', and two commando companies with five troops, each troop consisting of 50 men.|$|E

For a year, she worked at the OSS Emergency Rescue <b>Equipment</b> <b>Section</b> (ERES) in Washington, D.C. as a file clerk and then as an assistant to developers of a shark repellent needed to ensure that sharks would not explode ordnance targeting German U-boats. In 1944, she was posted to Kandy, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where her responsibilities included [...] "registering, cataloging and channeling a great volume of highly classified communications" [...] for the OSS's clandestine stations in Asia. She was later posted to Kunming, China, where she received the Emblem of Meritorious Civilian Service as head of the Registry of the OSS Secretariat. When Child was asked {{to solve the problem of}} too many OSS underwater explosives being set off by curious sharks, [...] "Child's solution was to experiment with cooking various concoctions as a shark repellent," [...] which were sprinkled in the water near the explosives and repelled sharks. Still in use today, the experimental shark repellent [...] "marked Child's first foray into the world of cooking..." [...] For her service, Child received an award that cited her many virtues, including her [...] "drive and inherent cheerfulness." [...] As with other OSS records, her file was declassified in 2008; however, unlike other files, her complete file is available online.|$|E

He became executive officer of the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle in 1951 and participated in Exercise Mainbrace. Promoted to captain on 31 December 1952, he was posted to Buenos Aires as naval attaché to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay in September 1953 before commanding the destroyer [...] during the Suez Crisis in 1956. He became Head of the Weapon <b>Equipment</b> <b>Section</b> at the Admiralty in 1957 and Director of the Tactical and Weapons Policy Division there in 1958.

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1964 New Year Honours. He was made Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet in June 1964 during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and, having been promoted to vice admiral on 7 August 1965, he became Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel and Logistics) at the Ministry of Defence in 1966. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1967 New Year Honours. Becoming Second Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel in January 1967, it was in this capacity that he took the brave decision to abolish the Royal Navy's traditional daily rum ration. He went on to be Vice Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1967 and, having been promoted to full admiral on 1 October 1968, he became Commander-in-Chief Far East Command in March 1969.

5000|$|In November 1964, von Braun {{proposed}} a more ambitious {{plan to build}} a much larger station built from the S-II second stage of a Saturn V. His design replaced the S-IVB third stage with an aeroshell, primarily as an adapter for the CSM on top. Inside the shell was a 10 ft cylindrical <b>equipment</b> <b>section.</b> On reaching orbit, the S-II second stage would be vented to remove any remaining hydrogen fuel, then the <b>equipment</b> <b>section</b> would be slid into it via a large inspection hatch. This became known as a [...] "wet workshop" [...] concept, because of the conversion of an active fuel tank. The station filled the entire interior of the S-II stage's hydrogen tank, with the <b>equipment</b> <b>section</b> forming a [...] "spine" [...] and living quarters located between it and the walls of the booster. This would have resulted in a very large 33 by 45 ft living area. Power was to be provided by solar cells lining the outside of the S-II stage.|$|E

50|$|The <b>equipment</b> <b>section,</b> {{with the}} MIRV, then aims the reentry {{vehicles}} (RV) towards earth. The payload is then {{released from the}} MIRV platform. To prevent the PBCS correctional thrust from interfering with the RV when released, the <b>equipment</b> <b>section</b> initiates the Plume Avoidance Maneuver (PAM). If the RV will be disrupted by the PBCS nozzle's thrust, the nearest nozzle will shut off until the RV is away from the MIRV. The PAM is used only when a nozzle's plume will disrupt the area near an RV. The PAM is a specialized design feature added to the Trident II to increase accuracy.|$|E

The third-stage hull is also reinforced by carbon fiber and kevlar.|$|E
