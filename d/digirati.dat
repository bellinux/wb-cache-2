The word is a portmanteau, derived from [...] "digital" [...] and [...] "", and {{reminiscent of the}} earlier coinage glitterati (glitter + literati). Famous computer scientists, tech magazine writers, digital consultants with multi-year experiences and well-known bloggers are included among the digerati.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the intense}} media {{coverage}} that the Internet has attracted {{over the past}} few years, one might reasonably argue that the Internet needs no introduction. It has successfully permeated into our everyday lives in a myriad of ways. Every parent must now feel the obligation to ensure that their child has access to the Internet as part of their overall education. Similarly, no advertising campaign is now complete without reference to a Web site {{and if you want to}} know something about an unknown organisation (whether company, University or law firm), the first thing you do is look up their Web site. Over the past few years, most Internet users have ceased worrying about what the Internet is and how it works and have begun to treat it more like the telephone – a convenient appliance for certain tasks. But at the same time, the Internet is becoming an increasingly complex place. There are an ever-increasing number of different terms that are being used in Internet circles – not only do we have e-mail, we now have e-anything e. g. e-commerce, e-business, e-journals, esolutions and not just the Internet but intranets and extranets as well. Meanwhile the <b>digirati</b> are dreaming up ever more obscure terms of art – channels, clickstream and enterprise information portals to name but a few of the current buzzwords. This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part is designed to explain a little of how the Internet works, both in terms of the technology and the administration. In the second part, the main legal issues relating to the Internet are addressed. This second part of this chapter is intended to set the stage for the remainder of this book...|$|E
40|$|The {{travel and}} {{hospitality}} industry is one which relies especially crucially on word of mouth, {{both at the}} level of overall destinations (Australia, Queensland, Brisbane) and {{at the level of}} travellers’ individual choices of hotels, restaurants, sights during their trips. The provision of such word-of-mouth information has been revolutionised over the past decade by the rise of community-based Websites which allow their users to share information about their past and future trips and advise one another on what to do or what to avoid during their travels. Indeed, the impact of such user-generated reviews, ratings, and recommendations sites has been such that established commercial travel advisory publishers such as Lonely Planet have experienced a pronounced downturn in sales ¬– unless they have managed to develop their own ways of incorporating user feedback and contributions into their publications. This report examines the overall significance of ratings and recommendation sites to the travel industry, and explores the community, structural, and business models of a selection of relevant ratings and recommendations sites. We identify a range of approaches which are appropriate to the respective target markets and business aims of these organisations, and conclude that there remain significant opportunities for further operators especially if they aim to cater for communities which are not yet appropriately served by specific existing sites. Additionally, we also point to the increasing importance of connecting stand-alone ratings and recommendations sites with general social media spaces like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and of providing mobile interfaces which enable users to provide updates and ratings directly from the locations they happen to be visiting. In this report, we profile the following sites: *	TripAdvisor, the international market leader for travel ratings and recommendations sites, with a membership of some 11 million users; *	IgoUgo, the other leading site in this field, which aims to distinguish itself from the market leader by emphasising the quality of its content; *	Zagat, a long-established publisher of restaurant guides which has translated its crowdsourcing model from the offline to the online world; *	Lonely Planet’s Thorn Tree site, which attempts to respond to the rise of these travel communities by similarly harnessing user-generated content; *	Stayz, which attempts to enhance its accommodation search and booking services by incorporating ratings and reviews functionality; and *	BigVillage, an Australian-based site attempting to cater for a particularly discerning niche of travellers; *	Dopplr, which connects travel and social networking in a bid to pursue the lucrative market of frequent and business travellers; *	Foursquare, which builds on its mobile application to generate a steady stream of ‘check-ins’ and recommendations for hospitality and other services around the world; *	Suite 101, which uses a revenue-sharing model to encourage freelance writers to contribute travel writing (amongst other genres of writing); *	Yelp, the global leader in general user-generated product review and recommendation services. In combination, these profiles provide an overview of current developments in the travel ratings and recommendations space (and beyond), and offer an outlook for further possibilities. While no doubt affected by the global financial downturn and the reduction in travel that it has caused, travel ratings and recommendations remain important – perhaps even more so if a reduction in disposable income has resulted in consumers becoming more critical and discerning. The aggregated word of mouth from many tens of thousands of travellers which these sites provide certainly has a substantial influence on their users. Using these sites to research travel options has now become an activity which has spread well beyond the <b>digirati.</b> The same is true also for many other consumer industries, especially where there is a significant variety of different products available – and so, this report may also be read as a case study whose findings are able to be translated, mutatis mutandis, to purchasing decisions from household goods through consumer electronics to automobiles. ...|$|E
