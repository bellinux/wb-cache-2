For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main rotor blade and tail <b>folding</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Since Corsairs {{were being}} {{operated}} from shore bases, while still awaiting approval for U.S. carrier operations, {{a number of}} FG-1As were built without their hydraulic wing <b>folding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> being installed, hoping to improve performance by reducing aircraft weight, with {{the added benefit of}} minimizing complexity. (These Corsairs’ wings could still be manually folded.) [...] USMC aircraft historian Jack Elliot’s research has determined that only about 60 FG-1As were manufactured before these modifications were terminated because there was little performance advantage, while there were real logistical challenges for Goodyear. [...] A second option was to remove the folding mechanism in the field using a kit, which could be done for Vought and Brewster Corsairs as well. [...] On Dec 6, 1943, the Bureau of Aeronautics issued guidance on weight-reduction measures for the F4U-1, FG-1, and F3A. [...] Corsair squadrons operating from land bases were authorized to remove catapult hooks, arresting hook, and associated equipment, which eliminated 48 pounds of unnecessary weight. [...] While there is no data to indicate to what extent these modifications where incorporated, there are numerous photos in evidence of USMC Corsairs, of various manufacturers and models, on islands in the Pacific without tailhooks installed.|$|E

40|$|The <b>folding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of many {{proteins}} {{involves the}} population of partially organized structures {{en route to the}} native state. Identification and characterization of these intermediates is particularly difficult, as they are often only transiently populated and may play different mechanistic roles, being either on-pathway productive species or off-pathway kinetic traps. Following different spectroscopic probes, and employing state-of-the-art kinetic analysis, we present evidence that the <b>folding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the thermostable cytochrome c 552 from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus does involve the presence of an elusive, yet compact, on-pathway intermediate. Characterization of the <b>folding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of this cytochrome c is particularly interesting for the purpose of comparative folding studies, because H. thermophilus cytochrome c 552 shares high sequence identity and structural homology with its homologue from the mesophilic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c 551, which refolds through a broad energy barrier without the accumulation of intermediates.

Despite impressive advances in decoding their structure-function relationships, the <b>folding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of neuronal calcium sensors is still elusive. We used single-molecule optical tweezers to study the <b>folding</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the human neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS 1). Two intermediate structures induced by Ca 2 + binding to the EF-hands were observed during refolding. The complete folding of the C domain is obligatory for the folding of the N domain, showing striking interdomain dependence. Molecular dynamics results reveal the atomistic details of the unfolding process and rationalize the different domain stabilities during mechanical unfolding. Through constant-force experiments and hidden Markov model analysis, the free energy landscape of the protein was reconstructed. Our results emphasize that NCS 1 has evolved a remarkable complex interdomain cooperativity and a fundamentally different <b>folding</b> <b>mechanism</b> compared to structurally related proteins...|$|R

50|$|As {{computing}} power has grown exponentially {{this approach to}} research, {{often referred to as}} in silico (as opposed to in vitro), has amassed more attention especially in the area of bioinformatics. More specifically, within bioinformatics, is the study of proteins or proteomics, which is the elucidation of their unknown structures and folding patterns. The general approach in the elucidation of protein structure has been to first purify a protein, crystallize it and then send X-rays through such a purified protein crystal to observe how these x-rays diffract into specific pattern—a process referred to as X-ray crystallography. However, many proteins, especially those embedded in cellular membranes, are nearly impossible to crystallize due to their hydrophobic nature. Although other techniques exists, such as ramachandran plotting and mass spectrometry, these alone generally do not lead to the full elucidation of protein structure or <b>folding</b> <b>mechanisms.</b>|$|E
50|$|Single {{molecule}} {{techniques such}} as optical tweezers and AFM {{have been used to}} understand protein <b>folding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of isolated proteins as well as proteins with chaperones. Optical tweezers have been used to stretch single protein molecules from their C- and N-termini and unfold them to allow study of the subsequent refolding. The technique allows one to measure folding rates at single-molecule level; for example, optical tweezers have been recently applied to study folding and unfolding of proteins involved in blood coagulation. von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a protein with an essential role in blood clot formation process. It discovered - using single molecule optical tweezers measurement - that calcium-bound vWF acts as a shear force sensor in the blood. Shear force leads to unfolding of the A2 domain of vWF, whose refolding rate is dramatically enhanced in the presence of calcium. Recently, it was also shown that the simple src SH3 domain accesses multiple unfolding pathways under force.|$|E
