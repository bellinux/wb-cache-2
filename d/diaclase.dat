40|$|The cave of Nossa Senhora das Lapas {{is a small}} <b>diaclase</b> in the Dogger limestones {{that define}} the left margin of the river Nabao, 10 km north of Tomar, in central Portugal. Excavation of the sire began in 1988, {{as part of a}} {{research}} programme concerned with the late prehistory of the North Ribatejo, and it forms a part of a necropolis of several burial caves. The aim of this excavation was to study the single evidence of a cave burial which was in use from c. 5000 B. C. to c. 3000 B. C...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a part of a wide multi scale {{research}} based on in situ experimentations and laboratory tests. The latest, radial water injections in the centre of the lower joint wall are done at constant normal stress from 0 to 110 MPa and at pressures from 0 to 4 MPa. Four hydro mechanical tests have been performed at the L 3 S laboratory on fractured limestone samples (two <b>diaclase</b> and two bedding plane). The measurement analysis shows a relation between the contact surface variations and the flow values inside the fracture. The hydro mechanical modelling performed using 3 DEC code can be improved from the previous analysis through the modification of the relation between the joint hydraulic opening and the joint mechanical closure. The remaining gap between simulations and measurements can be related to fracture asperity degradation and turbulent flow that have not been taken into account in the modelling...|$|E
