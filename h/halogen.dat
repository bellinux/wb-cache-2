5|$|As a <b>halogen,</b> {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators considered it a metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a <b>halogen</b> and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|In some {{reactions}} between highly {{reactive metals}} (usually from Group 1 or Group 2) and highly electronegative <b>halogen</b> gases, or water, the atoms can be ionized by electron transfer, a process thermodynamically understood using the Born–Haber cycle.|$|E

50|$|The group XCX {{is used to}} {{take the}} {{pairwise}} interaction of <b>halogens</b> connected to a single carbon into account. Its contribution has to be added once for two <b>halogens</b> but three times for three <b>halogens</b> (interactions between the <b>halogens</b> 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3).|$|R

50|$|The {{group of}} <b>halogens</b> {{is the only}} {{periodic}} table group that contains elements {{in three of the}} four main states of matter at standard temperature and pressure. All of the <b>halogens</b> form acids when bonded to hydrogen. Most <b>halogens</b> are typically produced from minerals or salts. The middle <b>halogens,</b> that is chlorine, bromine and iodine, are often used as disinfectants. Organobromides are the most important class of flame retardants. Elemental <b>halogens</b> are dangerously to potentially lethally toxic.|$|R
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. This {{is an example of a}} <b>halogen</b> addition reaction.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its great}} reactivity, all {{chlorine}} in the Earth's crust {{is in the}} form of ionic chloride compounds, which includes table salt. It is the second-most abundant <b>halogen</b> (after fluorine) and twenty-first most abundant chemical element in Earth's crust. These crustal deposits are nevertheless dwarfed by the huge reserves of chloride in seawater.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest <b>halogen</b> and exists {{as a highly}} toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative element, it is extremely reactive: almost all other elements, including some noble gases, form compounds with fluorine.|$|E
5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} iodine {{are the highest}} among the <b>halogens,</b> {{conforming}} to the increasing trend down the group, since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them {{that is the most}} easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der Waals interactions among the <b>halogens.</b> Similarly, iodine is the least volatile of the <b>halogens.</b> Because it has the largest atomic radius among the <b>halogens,</b> iodine has the lowest first ionisation energy, lowest electron affinity, lowest electronegativity and lowest reactivity of the <b>halogens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most interhalogens are {{covalent}} gases. Some interhalogens, {{especially those}} containing bromine, are liquids, and most iodine-containing interhalogens are solids. Most of the interhalogens composed of lighter <b>halogens</b> are fairly colorless, but the interhalogens containing heavier <b>halogens</b> are deeper in color {{due to their}} higher molecular weight. In this respect, the interhalogens {{are similar to the}} <b>halogens.</b> The greater the difference between the electronegativities of the two <b>halogens</b> in an interhalogen, the higher the boiling point of the interhalogen. All interhalogens are diamagnetic. The bond length of interhalogens in the XY series increases with the size of the constituent <b>halogens.</b> For instance, ClF has a bond length of 1.628 Å, and IBr has a bond length of 2.47 Å.|$|R
50|$|At {{slightly}} elevated temperatures, the <b>halogens</b> bromine (Br2) and iodine (I2) also form diatomic gases. All <b>halogens</b> {{have been}} observed as diatomic molecules, except for astatine, which is uncertain.|$|R
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} can {{be produced}} from their constituent ions by evaporation, precipitation, or freezing. Reactive metals such as the alkali metals can react directly with the highly electronegative <b>halogen</b> gases to form an ionic product. They can also be synthesized {{as the product of}} a high temperature reaction between solids.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} gases released during {{volcanic activity}} are water, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride. These sulfur and <b>halogen</b> gases and metals {{are removed from}} the atmosphere by processes of chemical reaction, dry and wet deposition, and by adsorption {{onto the surface of}} volcanic ash.|$|E
5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic <b>halogen</b> molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a <b>halogen,</b> such as bromine, results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} rate {{is influenced by}} the reactivity of <b>halogens,</b> iodide and bromide being favored. Fluoride is not a good leaving group, so eliminations with fluoride as the leaving group have slower rates than other <b>halogens.</b>|$|R

50|$|Germanium forms two hydrides: GeH4 and Ge2H6. Germanium forms tetrahalides {{with all}} <b>halogens</b> except {{astatine}} and forms dihalides with all <b>halogens</b> except bromine and astatine. Germanium bonds to all natural single chalcogens except polonium, and forms dioxides, disulfides, and diselenides. Germanium nitride has the formula Ge3N4.|$|R
5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases {{together with the}} number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic <b>halogen</b> molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of chlorine are intermediate between those of fluorine and bromine: chlorine melts at −101.0°C and boils at −34.0°C. As a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of chlorine are again intermediate between those of bromine and fluorine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: thus, while fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is distinctly yellow-green. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a <b>halogen,</b> such as chlorine, results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital.

5|$|Germane (GeH4) is a {{compound}} similar in structure to methane. Polygermanes—compounds {{that are similar}} to alkanes—with formula GenH2n+2 containing up to five germanium atoms are known. The germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH3 which contain the GeH3− anion. The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three <b>halogen</b> atoms are colorless reactive liquids.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing basic ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. Ionic compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent, precipitation, freezing, a solid-state reaction, or the electron transfer reaction of reactive metals with reactive non-metals, such as <b>halogen</b> gases.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the <b>halogen</b> series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the <b>halogen</b> trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals {{is by no}} means clear. The result is that a few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid, particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a metalloid and a <b>halogen,</b> is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources of}} bromine are in the United States and Israel. The element is liberated by <b>halogen</b> exchange, using {{chlorine}} gas to oxidise Br− to Br2. This is then removed with a blast of steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth {{the size of the}} chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.|$|E
50|$|The pseudohalogens are polyatomic analogues of <b>halogens,</b> whose chemistry, {{resembling}} that of {{the true}} <b>halogens,</b> allows them to substitute for <b>halogens</b> in several classes of chemical compounds. Pseudohalogens occur in pseudohalogen molecules, inorganic molecules of the general formsPs-Ps or Ps-X (where Ps is a pseudohalogen group), such as cyanogen; pseudohalide anions, such as cyanide ion; inorganic acids, such as hydrogen cyanide; as ligands in coordination complexes, such as ferricyanide; and as functional groups in organic molecules, such as the nitrile group.Well-known pseudohalogen functional groups include cyanide, cyanate, thiocyanate, and azide.|$|R

5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = <b>halogen).</b> So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined {{fluorite}} {{and over}} 40% of hydrofluoric acid, with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share. Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through <b>halogen</b> exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E
5|$|Some of astatine's {{reported}} {{properties are}} nonmetallic. It has the narrow liquid range ordinarily associated with nonmetals (mp 302°C; bp 337°C). Batsanov gives a calculated band gap energy for astatine of 0.7eV; {{this is consistent}} with nonmetals (in physics) having separated valence and conduction bands and thereby being either semiconductors or insulators. The chemistry of astatine in aqueous solution is mainly characterised by the formation of various anionic species. Most of its known compounds resemble those of iodine, which is a <b>halogen</b> and a nonmetal. Such compounds include astatides (XAt), astatates (XAtO3), and monovalent interhalogen compounds.|$|E
