5|$|Some folk {{figures are}} based on semi or actual {{historical}} people whose story has been passed down centuries; Lady Godiva for instance {{was said to have}} ridden naked on horseback through Coventry, Hereward the Wake was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, Herne the Hunter is an equestrian ghost associated with Windsor Forest and Great Park and Mother Shipton is the archetypal witch. On 5 November people make bonfires, set off fireworks and eat toffee apples in commemoration of the foiling of the Gunpowder Plot centred on Guy Fawkes. The chivalrous bandit, such as Dick Turpin, is a recurring character, while Blackbeard is the archetypal pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day, such as Morris dancing, Maypole dancing, Rapper sword in the North East, Long Sword dance in Yorkshire, Mummers Plays, bottle-kicking in Leicestershire, and cheese-rolling at Cooper's Hill. There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the Pearly Kings and Queens associated with cockneys, the Royal Guard, the Morris costume and Beefeaters.|$|E

25|$|Late in 1965, {{the communists}} greatly {{increased}} their infiltration along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The United States decided to concentrate airpower upon a small {{segment of the}} Trail closest to South Vietnam and used most extensively by the enemy. As a result, Operation Tiger Hound was initiated in December 1965, utilizing aircraft from the Air Force, the United States Navy, and U.S. Marines, the Vietnamese Air Force, and the Royal Laotian Air Force. On 11 December, B-52 heavy bombers were called <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> tactical operation, in their first use over Laos.|$|E

25|$|After Florida, {{the campaigns}} focused their {{attention}} on the 21 states voting on February 5, known as Super Tuesday. McCain {{was seen as the}} front-runner for the nomination heading <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> most important of primary dates. He had the lead in delegates to the national convention, and on January 30 he was officially endorsed by the withdrawing Giuliani. The candidates sparred at a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California on January 30, with former First Lady Nancy Reagan present in the front row. The most heated exchange came as Romney accused McCain of dirty tricks in his misleading Florida statements about Romney having proposed an Iraq withdrawal timetable.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but {{the irony is that}} animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
2500|$|After his win in South Carolina, Obama {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} Caroline Kennedy, daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, as well as Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, the former President's brother. Ted Kennedy's endorsement was considered [...] "the biggest Democratic endorsement Obama could possibly get short of Bill Clinton or Al Gore." [...] In particular, it gave the possibility of improving Obama's support among unions, Hispanics, and traditional base Democrats, all demographics that Clinton had been stronger <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point. Obama won 13 of 22 states on Super Tuesday (February 5, 2008): Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, and Utah. His campaign claimed to have won more delegates.|$|E

In its report, released in November, the committee [...] "recommends the NSW Education Department requires schools under the Controversial Issues in Schools policy to consult with parents prior to any implementation of the Safe Schools program, and require that parents choose whether to opt <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> program".|$|E
2500|$|Rand {{completed}} her screenplay in June 1944. The setting of The Fountainhead is a collective {{society in which}} individuals and new ideas of architecture are not accepted, and all buildings must be constructed [...] "like Greek temples, Gothic cathedrals, and mongrels of every ancient style they could borrow", as Roark's patron Henry Cameron {{puts it in his}} deathbed speech. Rand's screenplay, among other things, criticized the Hollywood film industry and its self-imposed mandate to [...] "give the public what it wants". Roark, in his architecture, refuses to give <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> demand [...] "by the public". He refuses to work in any way that compromises his integrity and in which he would succumb to [...] "popular taste". In a similar vein Rand wrote a new scene for the film, in which Roark is rejected as architect for the Civic Opera Company of New York, an allusion to Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Civic Light Opera Company of Pittsburgh.|$|E
2500|$|The {{international}} {{offices of}} some of the unions and the national leadership of the AFL began to exert pressure on the General Strike Committee and individual unions to end the strike. Some locals gave <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> pressure and returned to work. The executive committee of the General Strike Committee, pressured by the AFL and international labor organizations, proposed ending the general strike at midnight on February 8, but their recommendation was voted down by the General Strike Committee. On February 8, some streetcar operators returned to work and restored some critical city transportation services. Seattle's main department store reopened as well. Then teamsters and newsboys returned to work. On February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the general strike on February 11 and by noon on that day it was over. It stated its reasons: [...] "Pressure from international officers of unions, from executive committees of unions, from the 'leaders' in the labor movement, even from those very leaders who are still called 'Bolsheviki' by the undiscriminating press. And, added to all these, the pressure upon the workers themselves, not of the loss of their own jobs, but of living in a city so tightly closed." ...|$|E
