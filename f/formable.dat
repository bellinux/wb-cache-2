5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a <b>formable,</b> high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, <b>formable,</b> liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Sumser summarises Basedow’s {{emphasis}} {{as being}} on a [...] "cosmopolitan, nonconfessional, and pragmatic system of education which proved inspirational to a younger generation of pedagogues." [...] One of Basedow's fundamental concepts was that education occurs when the students are taught {{as much as possible}} in real life and application of the knowledge was highly important. Classes were often held outside or with the use of pictures to make the subject as real as possible. The subjects taught at the Philanthropinum were Mathematics, Languages: French, German and Latin, Eloquence, All religions, Craftwork, Sciences, Sports: Fencing and Gymnastics. Among those pedagogues were German educators such as Joachim Heinrich Campe (1746-1818), Ernst Christian Trapp (1745-1818), Christian Gotthilf Salzmann (1744- 811) but later also the Austrian Vincenz Eduard Milde (1777-1853). Their educational ideas are based on a notion that a human being is not born fully formed but is essentially <b>formable,</b> a notion inspired by Locke’s concept of the tabula rasa. In particular the philanthropinists' goals included education to bliss, to a way of thinking as proposed by Immanuel Kant, to human dignity and morality. Another aspect dealt with the balance between individual perfection and an individual’s utility for civil society, which both needed to be attained without one hazarding the other.|$|E
5000|$|Ebbinghaus was {{determined}} to show that higher mental processes could actually be studied using experimentation, which was {{in opposition to the}} popularly held thought of the time. To control for most potentially confounding variables, Ebbinghaus wanted to use simple acoustic encoding and maintenance rehearsal for which a list of words could have been used. As learning would be affected by prior knowledge and understanding, he needed something that could be easily memorized but which had no prior cognitive associations. Easily <b>formable</b> associations with regular words would interfere with his results, so he used items that would later be called [...] "nonsense syllables" [...] (also known as the CVC trigram). A nonsense syllable is a consonant-vowel-consonant combination, where the consonant does not repeat and the syllable does not have prior meaning. BOL (sounds like [...] "Ball") and DOT (already a word) would then not be allowed. However, syllables such as DAX, BOK, and YAT would all be acceptable (though Ebbinghaus left no examples). After eliminating the meaning-laden syllables, Ebbinghaus ended up with 2,300 resultant syllables. [...] Once he had created his collection of syllables, he would pull out a number of random syllables from a box and then write them down in a notebook. Then, to the regular sound of a metronome, and with the same voice inflection, he would read out the syllables, and attempt to recall them {{at the end of the}} procedure. One investigation alone required 15,000 recitations.|$|E

5000|$|Jack was {{primarily}} a welded steel sculptor. His work reflected those who had influenced him. Many of his early works were figurative. His later works integrated hard steel forms with welded steel figures. He {{had a vision of}} art that was truly unique. Often, he would disassemble his works and rearrange them to suit his mood. Sadly, he would lose interest in them, sell them for ridiculous low prices or even give them away. His <b>formable</b> catalog was reduced to those few pieces he enjoyed having in his environment. His attitude toward art was that it had become pretty things for the rich and he despised the rich. Jack's work was totemic in nature. He used vertical lines to establish height, and then expanded the sculpture horizontally above the viewer. He used cubic planes to define form and break them up the establish a visual rhythm. He used changes in surfaces to make interplay. He used welded steel figures, hung off the sculpture, very much like pacific Native American totems. This continued to be a theme even near his death, where he decorated his grandson's rowboat with a Pacific Native American motif stemhead. He painted his work but would allow them to age. His work was very much contemporary with similar work of the period. The difference was Jack's were better in construction and realized in form. His hallmark was perfect. Not a weld could be found that was poor nor did it look contrived. Jack's work was cross disciplined. The Basis of his master catalog was welded steel forms. He often blurred the lines between art and lifestyle, as he rebuilt his home, into a lovely cottage. The existing workshop, which was made from railroad ties, he covered with found objects. His sense of form and balance could be seen even in the junk he hung by the door of his studio. Jack's belief in original work was great. He once said, to one of his students, [...] "If you don't pick the piece out of the fire with your bare hands, it ain't art." [...] The meaning is art has to be on the ragged edge of your ability, both in style and craftsmanship or you aren't doing art. Jack believed in even breathing art. His world was a vast brush stroke. He taught that and encouraged people to see the world as an artist. He jaded everyone with this attitude towards art. He was an infection of creativity.|$|E

We show that, unlike other lizards, in their feasible dances chameleons can touch and re-peat steps. Also, they can do this even if they are asynchronous. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{treatment}} of choice for an ingrowing nail has been surgical rather than nonsurgical. Yet, surgical treatments are far from successful, cause pain and patient apprehension, and leave disfigurement. Further, there is misunderstanding about the disease pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate {{the benefits of a}} noninvasive method of treatment for an ingrowing nail using gutter splint and <b>formable</b> acrylics and to present a current understanding of the disease pathophysiology. METHODS: From a total of 541 cases of ingrowing nails treated, full follow-up data were obtained between January 1979 and March 2002. <b>Formable</b> acrylic treatments were carried out in 106 cases treated with acrylic-affixed gutter splint, 17 cases with sculptured nails, and 28 cases in which the two treatments were combined. These were then compared with 233 cases treated with adhesive tape-attached gutter splint and the remainder with other conservative modalities. RESULTS: Acrylic treatment with gutter splint and sculptured nail was found to be vastly superior to the other methods described, especially in the ability to firmly affix the gutter splint and sculptured nail for the extended period required for treatment. The treatment leads to a complete remission with almost instant alleviation of pain, with no disfigurement, while allowing for the resumption of daily activities. CONCLUSION: Conservative methods utilizing <b>formable</b> acrylics are highly beneficial in the {{treatment of}} an ingrowing nail and should be viewed as the first treatment option...|$|E
