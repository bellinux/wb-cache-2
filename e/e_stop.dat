40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for addressing the question of when transactions should be carried out within a firm and when through the market. Following Grossman and Hart, we identify a firm with the assets that its owners control. We argue that the crucial difference for party 1 between owning a firm (integration) and contracting for a service from another party 2 who owns this firm (nonintegration) is that, under integration, party 1 can selectively fire the workers of the firm (including party 2), whereas under nonintegration he can "fire" (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>stop</b> dealing with) only the entire firm: the combination of party 2, the workers, and the firm's assets.

Two simulator experiments (N = 24 and 27) were conducted, each testing four automation levels ranging from manual control (MC) to highly automated driving. In both experiments, participants about once every 3 min experienced an event that required intervention. Participants performed a secondary divided attention task while driving. Automation generally resulted in improved secondary task performance and reduced self-reported physical demand and effort as compared to MC. However, automated speed control was experienced as more frustrating than MC. Participants responded quickly to the events when the stimulus was salient (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>stop</b> sign, crossing pedestrian, and braking lead car), but often failed to react to an automation failure when their vehicle was driving slowly.

We define a cost for each mobile {{that consists of}} a weighted sum of power and square of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) error and obtain the static Nash equilibrium for the resulting costs.

Additional simulations show that the benefit of the Nash equilibrium power control over the power balancing solution increases as receiver noise power or number of users in the cell increases.

It is less clear whether tolerance develops to the impairing effects of THC in heavy users of cannabis. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess neurocognitive performance during acute THC intoxication in occasional and heavy users. Twenty-four subjects (12 occasional cannabis users and 12 heavy cannabis users) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way mixed model design. Both groups received single doses of THC placebo and 500 microg/kg THC by smoking. Performance tests were conducted at regular intervals between 0 and 8 h after smoking, and included measures of perceptual motor control (critical tracking task), dual task processing (divided attention task), motor inhibition (stop signal task) and cognition (Tower of London). THC significantly impaired performance of occasional cannabis users on critical tracking, divided attention and the stop signal task. THC did not affect the performance of heavy cannabis users except in the stop signal task, i. <b>e.</b> <b>stop</b> reaction time increased, particularly at high THC concentrations. Group comparisons of overall performance in occasional and heavy users did not reveal any persistent performance differences due to residual THC in heavy users.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} suggesting a shared genetic susceptibility between many neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy. The sodium channel, voltage-gated type II α subunit gene SCN 2 A has been shown to exhibit loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in individuals with seizure disorders, ID, autism and schizophrenia. The role of LoF mutations in schizophrenia is still uncertain with only one such mutation identified to date. METHODS: To seek additional evidence for a role for LoF mutations at SCN 2 A in schizophrenia we performed mutation screening of the entire coding sequence in 980 schizophrenia cases. Given an absence of LoF mutations in a public exome cohort (ESP 6500, N= 6503), we did not additionally sequence controls. RESULTS: We identified a novel, nonsense (i. <b>e.</b> <b>stop</b> codon) mutation in one case (E 169 X) that is absent in 4300 European-American and 2203 African-American individuals from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. This is the second LoF allele identified in a schizophrenia case to date. We also show a novel, missense variant, V 1282 F, that occurs in two cases and is absent in the control dataset. CONCLUSION: We argue that very rare, LoF mutations at SCN 2 A act in a moderately penetrant manner to increase the risk of developing several neuropsychiatric disorders including seizure disorders, ID, autism and schizophrenia...|$|E

Method: A qualitative design based {{on the principles of}} Grounded Theory was employed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen patients and/or carers (depending on whether the patient was able to be interviewed) where the issue of dialysis abatement was being considered, or had recently been decided. Results: Of 52 participants considered for entry into the study 41 were ineligible, with impaired cognition, rapid medical deterioration, and inability to speak sufficient English being the main reasons for exclusion. The desire not to burden others and the personal experience of a deteriorating quality of life were crucial elements in the decision to stop or decline dialysis. The problem of prognostic uncertainty and a sense of abandonment were also prominently expressed.

Although these processes have been separately studied in young and old adults, {{little is known about}} the age-related changes in PMBS during selective inhibitory control (i. <b>e.</b> <b>stop</b> a part of an action). The present study examines the age-related modulations of PMBS associated with sensory reafferences and inhibitory processes in selective inhibitory control. Young (n = 17) and old (n = 13) participants performed a switching task first engaging bimanual finger tapping then requiring to stop the left while maintaining the right unimanual tapping (i. e. selective inhibition) at an imperative stimulus. Age groups were compared on behavioral (mean, variability and percentage of errors of inter-tap interval during and after the switching) and electrophysiological (time–frequency and source estimations in the 14 – 30 Hz beta frequency range) data time-locked on the imperative stimulus. Behaviorally, old adults showed larger variability and percentage of errors during the switching but performed as well as young adults after the switching. Electrophysiologically, PMBS significantly increased after the switching in the old compared to the young group within bilateral frontal and parietal areas. Our results show that the effort to maintain selective inhibition involves increased brain activation in old compared to young adults. The larger PMBS within frontal and parietal regions in old adults may reflect an age-related brain compensation enabling to efficiently maintain post-switching inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Public {{transport}} network design determines the quality for travellers {{as well as}} operational costs. Network design is therefore crucial for the cost effectiveness of urban public transport. In urban public {{transport network}} design it is commonly assumed that all travellers walk to the stops. This might be true for short access distances, but if stop and line spacing increase other modes such as bicycles might become interesting as an alternative access mode. An analytical model is presented that determines optimal network characteristics, i. <b>e.</b> <b>stop</b> spacing, line spacing, and frequency, and that explicitly accounts for alternative access modes. The objective used is maximising social welfare. Results show that, if cycling is considered as an alternative access mode, all three network characteristics mentioned above should be increased, offering benefits for the traveller, the operator {{as well as the}} society. However, if there is a large sub-population of travellers who are not able to use the alternative mode, or if there are barriers for using an alternative mode to access the urban public transport system, it is better to assume that walking is the only access mode available. In the case of cycling as an access mode there are possibilities for positive benefits, at least in countries such as Denmark or the Netherlands.

40|$|The Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory {{proposes that}} a neurobiological system, the Behavioral Activation System, defines {{individual}} {{differences on the}} subject’s sensitivity and reactivity to appetitive stimuli associated with mesocorticolimbic structures, while this system does not mediate aversive stimulus processing. However, Jeffrey A. Gray’s model also predicts the system’s antagonism between this appetitive system and another aversive stimulus sensitive system, the Behavioral Inhibitory System/Fight-Flight-Freeze System, mostly associated with limbic structures. Therefore, direct modulation of brain activation during appetitive stimulus processing should be expected from the Behavioral Activation System, while inverse modulation during aversive stimulus processing {{may be expected to}} reflect the system’s antagonism. Using the Sensitivity to Reward scale of the SPSR questionnaire to assess individual differences in the activity of the reward system, we present different behavioral and neuroimaging data to illustrate our view. The first experiment was based on a simple letter-judgment task while viewing erotic and aversive pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. A second experiment employed a task performed by participants to detect infrequent aversive (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>stop)</b> signals when responding to reward. The results from these studies were consistent with the idea that Behavioral Activation System-related personality traits mediate the brain activation associated with appetitive stimulus processing in reward-related areas, while it also showed its antagonism to aversive systems through a negative mediation on the limbic cortex activation. To conclude, sensitivity to reward may be understood as a form of impulsivity related to both better appetitive learning and poorer aversive learning...|$|E
40|$|Traffic signal assigns the {{right-of-way}} {{to various}} conflicting traffic movements at an intersection. However, when a driver’s approaches a signalized intersection {{at the onset}} of amber, he/she is forced to make decisions about whether to pass or stop during a very short time period. This can be a difficult decision when the vehicle is located within the dilemma zone. It may result in a rear-end crash due to a sudden stop or red-light violation due to insufficient time to stop safely. In the present study six intersections, two with countdown timer, two with no-countdown timer and two with vehicle actuated system were analyzed to study the effect of various traffic signal systems on red light violation. The data of off-peak hour traffic was collected to minimize the influence of congestion on driver’s behavior by using video-recording technique. The data collected are those pertaining to the analysis of vehicles’ approaching speed distance from the stop line, the decision made by driver (i. <b>e.</b> <b>stop</b> abruptly, accelerate through amber and run red light) at onset amber as well as the types of vehicles driven. The finding of the study indicates that relatively large proportion of drivers did not willing to stop at onset of amber signal.

Changes include tuning parameter values, topi c expansion and exploitation of sentences context. According to our method, a sentence is considered a srelevant if it matches the topic with {{a certain level of}} coverage. This coverage depends on the category of the terms used in the texts. Four types of terms have been defined highly relevant, s carcely relevant, non-relevant (lik <b>e</b> <b>stop</b> words), highly non-relevant terms (negative terms). Term categorization is based on topic analysis: highly non-relevant terms are extracted from the narrative parts that describe what will be a non-relevant document. The three other types of terms are extracted {{from the rest of the}} query. Each term of a topic is weighted according to both its occurrence and the topic part it belongs to (title, descriptive, narrative). Additio nally we increase the score of a sentence when either the previous or the next sentence is relevant. When topic expansion is applied, terms from relevant sentences (task 3) or from the first retrieved sentences (task 1) are added to the initial terms.

40|$|Background and Aims: Adaptive {{behavior}} {{depends on}} the ability to voluntarily suppress context-inappropriate behaviors, a process referred to as response inhibition. Stop Signal tests (SSTs) are the most frequently studied paradigm used to assess response inhibition. Previous studies of SSTs have indicated that inhibitory control behavior can be explained using a common model in which GO and STOP processes are initiated independent from one and another, and the process that is completed first determines whether the behavior is elicited (GO process) or terminated (STOP process). Consistent with this model, studies have indicated that individuals strategically delay their behaviors during SSTs in order to increase their stopping abilities. Despite being controlled by distinct neural systems, prior studies have largely documented similar inhibitory control performance across eye and hand movements. Though, no existing studies have compared the extent to which individuals strategically delay behavior across different effectors is not yet clear. Here, we compared the extent to which inhibitory control processes and the cognitive strategies that support them during oculomotor and manual motor behaviors. Methods: We examined 29 healthy individuals who performed parallel oculomotor and manual motor SSTs. Participants also completed a separate block of GO trials administered prior to the Stop Signal tasks to assess baseline reaction times for each effector and reaction time increases during interleaved GO trials of the SST. Results: Our results showed that stopping errors increased for both effectors as the interval between GO and STOP cues was increased (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>stop</b> signal delay), but performance deteriorated more rapidly for eye compared to hand movements with increases in stop signal delay. During GO trials, participants delayed the initiation of their responses for each effector, and greater slowing of reaction times on GO trials was associated with increased accuracy on STOP trials for both effectors. However, participants delayed their eye movements to a lesser degree than their hand movements, and strategic reaction time slowing was a stronger determinant of stopping accuracy for hand compared to eye movements. Overall, stopping accuracies for eye and hand movements were only modestly correlated, and the time it took individuals to cancel a respons...|$|E
40|$|Growth {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} characteristics of biological systems. The study of eye growth regulation presents an interesting window that allows for the investigation {{of the role of the}} visual environment on internal processes. We now know that there is an intricate circuitry within the eye, independent of higher brain processes, that controls the growth of the eye but more needs to be elucidated about these local regulatory circuits. An improved understanding of this circuitry is critical to developing new therapies for abnormalities in eye growth regulation such as myopia, which is impacting more and more individuals around the world each day and in its more severe from, is linked to potentially blinding ocular complications. 	The role of retinal glucagon, a neuropeptide, in the regulation of eye growth and refractive error has attracted the interest of researchers over the past 15 years yet there remain many unresolved questions. The research described in this dissertation aimed to elucidate the respective roles in eye growth regulation of specific subpopulations of retinal glucagonergic amacrine cells, which have been the subject of much speculation as the source of inhibitory growth signals, i. <b>e.</b> <b>stop</b> signals, yet not thoroughly investigated. The approach taken to investigate this problem is to ablate glucagonergic amacrine cells in vivo using different neurotoxins, and to examine how this affects the sign-dependent circuitry of eye growth regulation. In addition, with the advent of advancements in high resolution imaging and electrophysiology, we were able to characterize the effects of these neurotoxins on the region-specific and time-sensitive changes in the structure and function of the living retina. That the inhibitory response induced by imposed myopic defocus remains intact, in spite of total ablation of glucagon cells (Chapter 5) or elimination of the peripheral glucagon cells (Chapter 3) and other unintended adverse retina effects, compared to findings from previous studies involving QUIS (Chapter 2) of this thesis, is a novel finding. These results point to the same conclusion that glucagon cells themselves are not responsible for the decoding of the sign of optical defocus, but appear to have a role in fine-tuning of compensatory growth responses. The results of our experiments also suggest that the choroid may serve as an intermediate relay, and the altered anterior chamber development raise the further possibility that retina-derived growth modulatory factors also regulate the anterior segment, perhaps reaching this more remote site by diffusion forward through the vitreous chamber or via the uvea...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Coding region {{microsatellite}} instability (MSI) results in loss of gene products {{and promotion of}} microsatellite-unstable (MSI-H) carcinogenesis. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} MSI within 3 '-untranslated regions (3 'UTRs) may post-transcriptionally dysregulate gene products. Within this context, we conducted a broad mutational survey of 42 short 3 'UTR microsatellites (MSs) in 45 MSI-H colorectal tumors and their corresponding normal colonic mucosae. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to estimate the overall susceptibility of MSs to MSI in MSI-H tumors, the observed MSI frequency of each MS was correlated with its length, interspecies sequence conservation level, and distance from some genetic elements (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>stop</b> codon, polyA signal, and microRNA binding sites). All MSs were stable in normal colonic mucosae. The MSI frequency at each MS in MSI-H tumors was independent of sequence conservation level and distance from other genetic elements. In contrast, MS length correlated significantly with MSI frequency in MSI-H tumors (r= 0. 86, p= 7. 2 x 10 (- 13)). 3 'UTR MSs demonstrated MSI frequencies in MSI-H tumors higher than the 99 % upper limit predicted by MS length for RB 1 -inducible coiled-coil 1 (RB 1 CC 1, mutation frequency 68. 4 %), NUAK family SNF 1 -like kinase 1 (NUAK 1, 31. 0 %), and Rtf 1, Paf 1 /RNA polymerase II complex component, homolog (RTF 1, 25. 0 %). An in silico prediction of RNA structure alterations was conducted for these MSI events to gauge their likelihood of affecting post-transcriptional regulation. RB 1 CC 1 mutant was predicted to lose a microRNA-accessible loop structure at a putative binding site for the tumor-suppressive microRNA, miR- 138. In contrast, the predicted 3 'UTR structural change was minimal for NUAK 1 - and RTF 1 mutants. Notably, real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed significant RB 1 CC 1 mRNA overexpression vs. normal colonic mucosae in MSI-H cancers manifesting RB 1 CC 1 3 'UTR MSI (9. 0 -fold; p = 3. 6 x 10 (- 4)). CONCLUSIONS: This mutational survey of well-characterized short 3 'UTR MSs confirms that MSI incidence in MSI-H colorectal tumors correlates with MS length, but not with sequence conservation level or distance from other genetic elements. This study also identifies RB 1 CC 1 as a novel target of frequent mutation and aberrant upregulation in MSI-H colorectal tumors. The predicted loss of a microRNA-accessible structure in mutant RB 1 CC 1 RNA fits the hypothesis that 3 'UTR MSI involves in aberrant RB 1 CC 1 posttranscriptional upregulation. Further direct assessments are indicated to investigate this possibility. Bogdan C. Paun, Yulan Cheng, Barbara A. Leggett, Joanne Young, Stephen J. Meltzer, Yuriko Mor...|$|E
