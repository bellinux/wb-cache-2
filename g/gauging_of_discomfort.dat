40|$|This article {{argues for}} {{conducting}} emancipatory narrative {{research with the}} explicit intent of transforming participants’ lives by opening up new subjective possibilities. Drawing from Megan Boler’s pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and Gubrium and Holstein’s active interviewing, a narrative research method called an inquiry <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> is proposed. An inquiry <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> emphasizes the proactive and transformative potential of research projects for both researcher and participant. The aim of an inquiry <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> is to identify and promote a beneficial shift from dualistic, categorical, and entrenched subjective positionality to a more ambiguous engagement with social reality. The argument is considered in light of preliminary empirical findings from a narrative pilot study of masculine heterosexual subjectivity in graduate education, conducted {{in the fall of}} 2003.

40|$|CONTEXT: A gold {{standard}} or validated tool for monitoring the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> during continuous palliative sedation (CPS) is lacking. Therefore, {{little is known}} about the course <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> in sedated patients, the efficacy of CPS, and the determinants <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> during CPS. OBJECTIVES: To identify the course <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> in patients receiving CPS. METHODS: A prospective observational multicenter study in nine hospices and palliative care units was performed. The <b>Discomfort</b> Scale-Dementia <b>of</b> Alzheimer Type (DS-DAT) was independently assessed for monitoring <b>of</b> patient <b>discomfort</b> during CPS. The DS-DAT scores range from 0 (no observed discomfort) to a maximum of 27 (high level <b>of</b> observed <b>discomfort).</b> Using a mixed model, the mean group score <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> between four predefined time frames of CPS was compared, correcting for confounding patient characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were sedated, and the DS-DAT was completed in 106 patients at least once. The median duration of the sedation in these 106 patients was 25. 5 hours (range 2 - 161). The mean score of the DS-DAT in the phase before sedation was 12. 16 (95 % CI 9. 83 - 14. 50) and decreased significantly to 8. 06 (95 % CI 5. 53 - 10. 58) in the titration phase of sedation. The mean score of the DS-DAT in the final phase of sedation was 7. 42 (95 % CI 4. 90 - 9. 94). CONCLUSION: This study shows that CPS is associated with a decrease in the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> within an acceptable time frame, although in some sedated patients higher levels <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> in the last hours of life occurred. Although the DS-DAT seems to be of value for monitoring the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> during CPS, the results of this study should be interpreted within the constraints of the limitations, and further research on the psychometric properties of this tool is needed before the DS-DAT can be used in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Road {{geometry}} and traffic conditions influence strongly drivers behaviour. The authors propose {{a model for}} the evaluation of driver’s level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> LD locally induced by different road environments and traffic flow conditions. The main theoretical hypothesis behind the model is that a significant indicator of the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> is computed as proportional to the difference between driver’s desired speed Sd and the operating speed So imposed by local traffic density. To evaluate the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> for an homogeneous road segment, the variation of road characteristics and traffic conditions in terms of flow and composition must be taken into account. Moreover driver’s desired speed depends on the individual reason of the travel. Therefore, considering a traffic condition, the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> at a specific road location will assume different value for each flow typology. The greater the difference between driver’s desired speed and flow speed, the higher the level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> Twenty-five Italian rural two way-two lane road segments have been analysed. Field surveys were needed for data collection. The discrepancies between drivers expectations and operating conditions have been analysed. These data have been correlated with road dependent collisions of each road segment. This paper shows the results and points out the validity and applicability of the model to actual case studies for the evaluation of the expected accident occurrence {{as a function of the}} level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> suffered by road users...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} dependence <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> caused by vertical mechanical shocks {{has been investigated}} with 20 seated males exposed to upward and downward shocks at 13 fundamental frequencies (1 – 16  Hz) and 18 magnitudes (± 0. 12 to ± 8. 3  ms − 2). The rate <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> with increasing shock magnitude depended on the fundamental frequency of the shocks, so the {{frequency dependence}} of equivalent comfort contours (for both vertical acceleration and vertical force measured at the seat) varied with shock magnitude. The rate <b>of</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> was similar for acceleration and force, upward and downward shocks, and lower and higher magnitude shocks. The frequency dependence <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> from shocks {{differs from that of}} sinusoidal vibrations having the same fundamental frequencies. This arises in part from the frequency content of the shock. Frequency weighting W b in BS 6841 : 1987 and ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 provided reasonable estimates <b>of</b> the <b>discomfort</b> caused by the shocks investigated in this study. Practitioner Summary: No single frequency weighting can accurately predict the discomfort caused by mechanical shocks over wide ranges of shock magnitude, but vibration dose values with frequency weighting W b provide reasonable estimates <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> caused by shocks similar to those investigated in this study with peak accelerations well below 1  g. </p...|$|R
30|$|Patients have {{identified}} anxiety, pain, thirst, and sleep disturbance as major sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and stress during their ICU stay [1 – 4]. Our {{results indicate that}} caregiver’s identification <b>of</b> sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> at least partly overlaps with patient experience, with caregivers viewing pain and anxiety as the main sources <b>of</b> patient <b>discomfort.</b> Pain is a major source <b>of</b> <b>discomfort,</b> with half <b>of</b> the patients surveyed in previous studies reporting that they experienced pain during their ICU stay [1, 2]. Because pain {{has been linked to}} delirium and PTSD [10, 11], rapid, patient-tailored pain relief is strongly recommended.

40|$|Background: While {{there is}} {{debate about whether}} it may be better to forgo than to {{initiate}} artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) in nursing home patients with severe dementia, the consequences of forgoing ANH in these patients, in particular their discomfort, {{have not yet been}} investigated. Methods: In this prospective, longitudinal, observational study of 178 patients in Dutch nursing homes, discomfort was measured at all measurement times according to the observational <b>Discomfort</b> Scale-Dementia <b>of</b> Alzheimer Type. Furthermore, at all measurement times, plausible determinants <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> were registered. Data were analyzed with the statistical technique of generalized estimated equations. Results: Decisions to forgo ANH were made most often in severely demented, female patients with an acute illness as the most important diagnosis at that time. The mean level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> was highest {{at the time of the}} decision and decreased in the days thereafter. There were substantial differences in level <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> between patients. Dyspnea, restlessness, and physicians' observations of pain and dehydration were associated with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> Furthermore, patients who were awake had higher levels <b>of</b> observed <b>discomfort</b> than patients who were asleep. Conclusions: Forgoing ANH in patients with severe dementia who scarcely or no longer eat or drink seems, in general, not to be associated with high levels <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> The individual differences emphasize the need for constant attention for possible discomfort. © 2005 American Medical Association.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{stay in the}} {{intensive}} care unit (ICU), although potentially life-saving, may cause considerable discomfort to patients. However, retrospective assessment <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> is difficult because recollection of stressful events may be impaired by sedation and severe illness during the ICU stay. This study addresses the following questions. What is the incidence <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> reported by patients recently discharged from an ICU? What were the sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> reported? What was the degree of factual recollection during patients' stay in the ICU? Finally, was discomfort reported more often in patients with good factual recollection? METHODS: All ICU patients older than 18 years who had needed prolonged (> 24 hour) admission with tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were consecutively included. Within three days after discharge from the ICU, a structured, in-person interview was conducted with each individual patient. All patients were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of 14 questions specifically concerning the environment of the ICU they had stayed in. Furthermore, they were asked whether they remembered any discomfort during their stay; if they did then they were asked to specify which sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> they could recall. A reference group of surgical ward patients, matched by sex and age to the ICU group, was studied to validate the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients discharged from the ICU were included in this study. Data for 123 ICU patients and 48 surgical ward patients were analyzed. The prevalence of recollection of any type <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> in the ICU patients was 54 % (n = 66). These 66 patients were asked to identify the sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort,</b> and presence <b>of</b> an endotracheal tube, hallucinations and medical activities were identified as such sources. The median (min-max) score for factual recollection in the ICU patients was 15 (0 - 28). The median (min-max) score for factual recollection in the reference group was 25 (19 - 28). Analysis revealed that discomfort was positively related to factual recollection (odds ratio 1. 1; P < 0. 001), especially discomfort caused by the presence of an endotracheal tube, medical activities and noise. Hallucinations were reported more often with increasing age. Pain as a source <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> was predominantly reported by younger patients. CONCLUSION: Among postdischarge ICU patients, 54 % recalled discomfort. However, memory was often impaired: the median factual recollection score of ICU patients was significantly lower than that of matched control patients. The presence of an endotracheal tube, hallucinations and medical activities were most frequently reported as sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> Patients with a higher factual recollection score were at greater risk for remembering the stressful presence of an endotracheal tube, medical activities and noise.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{postoperative}} signs <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and complications {{associated with}} use of CO 2 laser for onychectomy {{with those of the}} scalpel technique in cats. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, masked clinical trial. ANIMALS: 20 client-owned cats. PROCEDURE: Forelimb feet (right, left) were randomly assigned to laser and scalpel treatment groups. Signs <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> (lameness and signs of pain) and complications (hemorrhage, swelling, and discharge) were assessed on days 0, 1, and 7. Surgeries were performed by 1 experienced surgeon. Evaluations were performed by 2 individuals without knowledge of treatment group. Signs <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and complications were scored on scales of 0 to 8 and 0 to 9, respectively. RESULTS: Onychectomy did not result in high discomfort or complication scores 1 day after surgery, regardless of technique used, although the laser-treated group had significantly lower scores for signs <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> and complications. Seven days after surgery, significant differences were not detected between groups for signs <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> or complications. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The CO 2 laser can be an excellent tool for onychectomy in cats, with excellent hemostasis and minimal postoperative discomfort and complications. Differences in discomfort and complications between groups treated via scalpel versus CO 2 laser were not clinically relevant and were only observed 1 day after surgery.

It is a significant challenge to design a seat that remains comfortable for the occupant over the several hours required for many long-distance journeys. When designing seats, {{an indication of the}} perception of comfort/discomfort can be useful either for research and development purposes or potentially for automated systems to take actions that might mitigate discomfort. This paper considered a system that uses measurements of body movement in a seat to provide an objective measure <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> The system uses cameras and image processing to recognize when a seat occupant makes a movement in the seat which could be associated with relief <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> The system was validated using a laboratory driving simulator. 10 participants volunteered to complete a study in which they drove for 90 minutes and gave subjective ratings <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> every 10 minutes, whilst also being observed using the camera system.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Comfort is an {{important}} factor in the acceptance of transport systems. In 2010 and 2011, the European Commission (EC) put forward its vision for air travel in the year 2050 which envisaged the use of in-flight virtual reality. This paper addressed the EC vision by investigating the effect of virtual environments on comfort. Research has shown that virtual environments can provide entertaining experiences and can be effective distracters from painful experiences. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which a virtual environment could distract people from sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> METHODS: Experiments which involved inducing discomfort commonly experienced in-flight (e. g. limited space, noise) in order to determine the extent to which viewing a virtual environment could distract people from discomfort. RESULTS: Virtual environments can fully or partially distract people from sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort,</b> becoming more effective when they are interesting. They are also more effective at distracting people from discomfort caused by restricted space than noise disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual environments have the potential to enhance passenger comfort by providing positive distractions from sources <b>of</b> <b>discomfort.</b> Further research is required to understand more fully the reasons why the effect was stronger for one source <b>of</b> <b>discomfort</b> than the other...|$|R
