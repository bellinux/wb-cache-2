50|$|The basic tool <b>for</b> <b>econometrics</b> is the {{multiple}} linear regression model. In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression {{is still the most}} frequently used starting point for an analysis.

5000|$|The basic tool <b>for</b> <b>econometrics</b> is the {{multiple}} linear regression model. [...] Econometric theory uses statistical theory and mathematical statistics to evaluate and develop econometric methods. Econometricians try to find estimators that have desirable statistical properties including unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. Applied econometrics uses theoretical econometrics and real-world data for assessing economic theories, developing econometric models, analyzing economic history, and forecasting.|$|E

50|$|More {{recently}} Nell {{has worked}} with his colleague Karim Errouaki on the methodological foundations of structural econometrics. The position exposed by Martin Hollis and E.J Nell (1975)'s Rational Economic Man was further extended and developed in their recent book Rational Econometric Man, Edward Elgar, 2013). They argued that is not too farfetched to see Hollis and Nell (1975) Rational Economic Man {{as a foundation for}} reconstructing the scientific foundations of structural econometrics; one might say Rational Econometric Man. They argued that there are good reasons for considering Hollis and Nell's (1975) framework as a foundation for reconstructing structural econometrics, a foundation that complements and extends the original ideas of Trygve Haavelmo. Haavelmo's (1944) work is probably the most important landmark in the history of econometric modelling. It is a remarkable monograph which, unfortunately <b>for</b> <b>econometrics,</b> became a classic much too early, part of the reason it is misunderstood.

They present their distinctive methodological contribution as a blend of fieldwork and conceptual analysis designed to ensure that their models are well grounded in reality and at the same time, conceptually coherent as well as statistically adequate. In so doing, they also outline a number of elements that will be needed to develop a 'good' macro-econometric model of an advanced economy.|$|E

5000|$|The methodology/philosophy which {{underlies}} the Theory of Transformational Growth {{is a form}} of realism, based on filling in conceptual truths by doing fieldwork and then building models of solidly based institutionally grounded relationships. The result will be open models, which can only be closed temporarily by setting certain inherently unreliable relationships. This has implications <b>for</b> <b>econometrics</b> - not all economic relationships are on a par. Some are reliable and can be reliably established; others are inherently unreliable, especially those which are forward-looking. They are likely to change spontaneously. They have to be estimated on a temporary basis by fieldwork and good guessing. Nor is there anything wrong with this. But it means that an econometric model must be divided into two parts - the reliable relationships and the volatile ones.|$|E
