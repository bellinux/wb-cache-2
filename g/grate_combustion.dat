40|$|The Refuse Disposal plant being erected at Edmonton for the Greater London Council is {{the first}} of its kind to be built in this country. It is {{designed}} to handle automatically 1333 tons of crude refuse every 24 hours, untouched by hand. The refuse is used as a fuel to produce steam for the generation of about 30 MW of electric power, the exact amount depending on the throughput and calorific value of the fuel. A brief description of the plant is followed by the reasons and economic considerations associated with the overall cdncept.

40|$|MSW {{incineration}} {{consists of}} combustion of heterogeneous waste on a moving grate that transports and mixes the waste during the combustion process. The <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> process involves drying, devolatilization, gasification/combustion and char burn-out. Also gasification and pyrolysis are subsets of combustion. Mathematical modeling of combustion on the grate requires determining the flow field and concentrations of gaseous species in a reacting and moving bed, {{taking into account}} various heat transfer mechanisms. Development of an accurate mathematical model of the incineration process {{is limited by the}} lack of measured data for validation. Requirements for specific (in-situ) data essential for the development of an incinerator burning bed model and {{a better understanding of the}} <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> process prompted accurate measurement of concentrations of selected gases within a moving, burning bed of solid waste.

40|$|When {{rape oil}} is {{chemically}} extracted, rape seed meal, a solid residue remains. Currently, {{it is used}} as animal feed. Several plants {{for the production of}} rape methyl ester (RME, biodiesel) are in operation or under construction. Combustion properties have been studied for rape seed meal produced as a by product to rape-methyl esther (RME, biodiesel). Composition of the material has been measured, using proximate and ultimate analysis. The lower heating value was 18. 2 ± 0, 3 MJ/kg d. w. and the ash content was 7 - 8 percent d. w. The material is rich in nitrogen and sulphur. Concentrations of K, P, Ca and Mg are high in the fuel. Rape seed meal was mixed with bark and pelletised. Bark pellets were also used as a reference fuel. Pellets with 10 and 30 percent rape seed meal were produced. Material with 80 percent rape seed meal and 20 percent planer shavings was also pelletised. Wood had to be added to provide enough friction in the pelletising process, with adapted equipment rape seed meal could probably be easily pelletised). The material was studied using Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), and compared with data from tests with wood powder. The pyrolysis of the rape seed meal has a characteristic temperature of 320 oC. Devolatilisation starts at 150 oC (at a lower temperature than for wood powder), and proceeds within a rather wide temperature range. The probable cause is the difference in organic content, in particular protein content. The result does not suggest that the material will be difficult to ignite. Experiments in a bench-scale fluidised bed (5 kW) showed that pellets containing only bark, and the mixture rape seed meal/wood had a bed agglomeration temperature well over the normal operational bed temperature. For the fuel mixtures rape seed meal and bark, the agglomeration temperature was slightly over the operational temperature. Particle emissions from fluidised bed combustion and <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> were, the latter simulated using a commercial pellet burner, were roughly doubled with fuels containing rape seed meal compared to bark. In the powder burner tests, particle emissions increased with a factor 17 with rape seed meal compared to wood powder. The emitted particles were mainly found in the fine (1 µm) and a fine mode fraction. The particles from <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of bark contain mostly K, S, Na and Cl apart from oxygen and carbon. When rape seed meal is present, Cl and Na concentrations decrease considerably and the main contents of the particles are K and S (and O and C). The results from the X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD) analyses showed the presence of crystalline K 2 SO 4 och KCl. The fine particles (< 1 µm) from powder combustion contain mainly K, P and S. The only identified crystalline phase was K 2 SO 4, suggesting that most phosphorus was in the amorphous phase, i. d. most probably molten. The deposit formation on a cooled probe was studied during the fluidized bed and powder combustion experiments. The fine particles deposited during fluidised bed combustion contained K, Cl and S. When bark was combusted in the fluidised bed, the coarse fraction contained Ca and Si, when rape seed meal in different mixes was combusted this changed to P, K, Ca and Mg. The deposits formed during combustion of rape seed meal in the powder burner were mainly made up of phosphates (Ca-, Mg/K-, Ca/Mg-phosphates) and MgO. Sintered material (slag) from <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of bark contained mainly Si, Ca, K and Al, probably as silicates. Adding rape seed meal tended to increase P, Ca and Mg while Si and Ca content tended to decrease. Through XRD a number o crystalline phases in the sintered material {{and the rest of the}} bottom ashes could be identified. NO emissions from the combustions tests increased two to four times with rape seed meal compared to typical wood fuels. For the fluidised bed test, SO 2 concentrations were rather high for the rape seed meal pellets (with 20 percent wood), still only about 20 percent of the sulphur in the fuel formed SO 2. For the <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> and powder burner combustion, 60 percent and 70 percent of the sulphur respectively formed SO 2. HCl emissions were low for all tests. The rather high emissions of NOx and SOx mean that the material should be used in large-scale facilities with external SOx and NOx cleaning. In smaller facilities, the material may be used in small amounts mixed with other fuels. The risk of slagging is not very high, and should not rule out <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of pellets with rape seed meal mixed with other fuels. The risk of corrosion of superheater surfaces during combustion is probably low since the smaller-size particles formed at fluidised bed combustion and <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> contain K 2 SO 4. However, a large fraction of the particles formed in powder burner combustion probably contains low temperature melting K 2 PO 4, making the risk for deposit formation significant. Rape seed meal for powder burner applications should be used with care. The content of phosphorus in the material may be an advantage when mixes of rape seed meal and other fuels are considered. The high affinity between potassium and phosphorus means that more sulphur in the fuel will be available for sulphatising of any KC. (formed from combustion of many forest and agricultural fuels). Use of rape seed meal as a sulphur containing additive could thus be an option. For <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> and fluidised bed combustion, addition of rape seed meal may reduce the risk of slagging and bed agglomeration, respectively. Full scale tests in fluidised beds or grate combustors with problematic biofuels (containing Cl and K) would be useful to test whether ash-reduced operational problems could be reduced through the addition of rape seed meal. Effektiva värmevärdet hos rapsmjöl är 18, 2 +/- 0, 3 MJ/kg TS och askhalten varierar mellan 7 - 8 %. Bränslet har högt N- och S-innehåll, och bränslet är rikt på K, P, Ca och Mg. Partikelemissionerna från fluidbäddseldning och rosterförbränning med rapsmjölsblandningar var ungefär dubbelt så höga som från barkförbränning. Vid pulverförbränning av rapsmjöl ökade partikelemissionerna med en faktor 17 jämfört med träpulver. De höga NOx och SOx emissionerna från rapsmjölsförbränning innebär att materialet bör utnyttjas i storskaliga anläggningar med extern svavel. - eller NO-rening, eller i relativt låga inblandningsgrader i andra bränslen. Mindre anläggningar med enbart cyklonrening är olämpliga på grund av de höga stofthalterna.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste (particularly of municipal solid waste) that cannot be minimized, recycled or reused presents a huge international problem. The last 20 years {{is characterized by a}} gradual transition from landfilling of the municipal solid waste (MSW) to incineration. The incineration of MSW under existing legislation and operational boundary conditions is a very complex process with the application of two-stage combustion, minimization of emissions and production of energy (generally heat and electricity). In MSW incinerators, the first stage consists of combustion of heterogeneous waste on a moving grate that transports and mixes the waste during the combustion process. The <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> process involves drying, devolatilization, gasification/combustion and char burn-out. Thus, gasification and pyrolysis are subsets of the combustion problem. Mathematical modeling of combustion on the grate requires the solution of the flow field and concentrations of gaseous species in a reacting and moving bed, taking into account various heat transfer mechanisms. Development of an accurate mathematical model of the incineration process is limited by the lack of measured data for validation. Requirements for specific (in-situ) data essential for the development of an incinerator burning bed model and {{a better understanding of the}} <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> process prompted accurate measurement of concentrations of selected gases within a moving, burning bed of solid waste. For this purpose we have designed and developed a special cube-capsule with insulating refractory ceramic fibres and materials with cooling effects enabling measurements of CO and temperature by an electrochemical sensor, small gas pump and electronics placed inside. This unique self-contained and mechanically/thermally protected probe consisting of measuring and recording electronic components was able to withstand temperatures over 1000 °C for a period longer than two hours. The measurement technique differs from all conventional methods of measurements in that the capsule (casket) can be introduced into the incinerator together with the waste and hence experiences the same conditions on the grate as the waste material. This novel device proved to be convenient for in-situ measurements in moving grate incineration. The capsule with sensor for CO measurement passed through three incinerator furnaces burning MSW and recorded CO concentration and two temperatures on opposing sides of the capsule, saving all data onto a computer memory chip. The cube-capsule was recovered from the incinerator ash pit and the recorded information was downloaded onto an Excel spreadsheet for subsequent analysis. A similar capsule/casket being designed with thermal insulation/cooling could be used for simultaneous measurement of CO, oxygen, CO 2 (or pollutants as HCl) and temperatures to characterize the combustion process of waste. A vibration sensor, detection of casket position on the grate and measurement of temperatures and intake of gas samples from more surface positions will further improve the record of the trajectory/rolling of the capsule, to elucidate the effects of horizontal and vertical distance on the grate within the furnace and the overall history (residence time in various sections) experienced on the grate by waste.

The aim {{of this research was}} to develop and evaluate methods for in-situ characterisation of fine and ultrafine particles and to determine their deposition in the human airways. The aim was also to increase knowledge about health and environmentally relevant properties of aerosols from biomass combustion and selected indoor sources. The methods include instrumental techniques such as Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Electrical Low-Pressure Impactor (ELPI), Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and Tandem Differential Mobility Analysers (TDMA) based on volatility and hygroscopic growth. Filter samplers and impactors were used for collecting particles on substrates for subsequent chemical analysis. Emissions from local district heating plants (0. 5 - 12 MW), based on moving <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of woody fuels, were sampled with a dilution system and characterised. Particles from the indoor sources of cigarettes, incense and candles were examined in the laboratory by using an airtight 22 m 3 stainless steel chamber. A set-up to determine respiratory deposition in humans was constructed. It was automatised and uses an electrical mobility spectrometer with an improved inversion algorithm to perform fast measurements of particles of different sizes in the inhaled and exhaled air. It was evaluated on human test-persons. The investigated biomass combustion sources emit high concentrations of fine and ultrafine particles. The chemical composition is dominated by KCl and K 2 SO 4; Zn, Cd and Pb were also quantified. Elemental carbon was identified in particles larger than 150 nm during periods of incomplete combustion. The particle concentration depends on the fuel ash content and the combustion efficiency. The aerosol is essentially internally mixed with hygroscopic growth factors significantly higher than reported for diesel exhaust and environmental tobacco smoke. The particles restructure from agglomerates to a more compact shape upon first exposure to moderately high relative humidity. This results in an increase in effective density and fractal dimension. Hygroscopic growth of these particles reduces the respiratory dose by a factor of 3 - 4 compared to hydrophobic particles of the same size. The biomass combustion particles mainly consist of soluble ash components and need to be treated differently in future health effect assessments compared to particles from incomplete combustion, e. g. from diesel engines, wood stoves and cigarette smoke. Sidestream cigarette and incense smoke are well internally mixed aerosols dominated by organic compounds. Each particle consists of components with a relatively wide range in vapour pressure. The volatile fraction decreases at lower particle concentrations in the chamber and upon ageing, which is attributed to different degrees of evaporation from the particle to the gas phase. Four different particle types were identified in emissions from candles. The feasibility of the ELPI and the APS to assess mass size distributions was investigated. It was found that the measurement quality is dependent on the size distribution of the aerosol. The set-up for respiratory deposition has low inherent particle losses. Determinations of precision, accuracy and sensitivity show that it can be used for field measurements in typical urban and indoor environments. Methods for characterisation of aerosols containing fine and ultrafine particles have been developed, evaluated and applied. The results can be used to improve exposure assessments in toxicological and epidemiological studies and for risk assessments. Papers included in the thesis I.

40|$|Abstract Combustion {{of biomass}} in {{small-scale}} furnaces {{is widely used}} in many countries and in different applications. Often, the technology used is fixed <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> in small batch furnaces. The efficiency of such furnace is often low which results in a high environmental impact due to the poorly controlled combustion of the wood logs that are largely used as the heat source for baking bread in wood-fired bakery ovens. This work has been undertaken {{in order to develop}} an efficient and environment friendly bakery oven furnace fired by biomass. The work was performed in Mozambique, and a survey was used to evaluate the consumption of wood and the technology used in the process of bread baking in two selected townships. The data collected from the 104 bakeries consisted of the dimensions of the oven, the temperature profiles within the combustion chamber and baking oven and, finally, the baking time. The circulation of hot gases within the baking oven was used to describe and predict the behaviour of the heat exchange {{and the quality of the}} products produced. Bi-dimensional cold flow equipment and a CFD model were used in conjunction to estimate the flow pattern inside the oven, which is one of the key factors in determining the baking efficiency of such ovens. Experiments were conducted in a physical model; various velocities were used to simulate changes in the air flow within the combustion chamber of the bakery ovens. Mathematical modelling was used to describe the flow using a standard k-ω model, which took the effects of the feeding door into account. As much as 60 tons/day of green wood are consumed in the bread baking process in the investigated area. The bread baking process in a semi-direct bakery oven occurs when contact is made between the bread/dough and the flue gases as they exit the combustion chamber. The relationship between the mass of firewood consumed and mass of wheat processed (specific consumption) was found to be 0. 55 in indirect ovens and 0. 90 in semi-direct. The temperature profile in a semi-direct oven beyond the inlet airflow is affected negatively by the feeding door, an effect that is magnified with manual feeding of the dough causing lack of uniformity on the quality of the bread produced. Surrounding air rushes in via the bottom edge of the feeding door when it is opened, whilst hot gases exit rapidly, flowing oven the top edge of the door, and thus affects the overall heat transfer by changing the effective thermal conductivity. Urgent improvement to this system is recommended not only to minimize this phenomenon but also to improve the efficiency of such ovens and the quality of the bread produced therein. Comparisons made between the flow pattern achieved by the bi-dimensional cold flow model and the CFD model show acceptable agreement. The flow pattern inside the baking oven varies with variations in the hot gases leaving the combustion chamber. The increment in velocity directly improves the baking conditions in the temperature range desired by increasing the circulation and effective thermal conductivity of the hot gases within the baking oven...|$|E

Biomass has a great potential for domestic and industrial heating applications and these are amongst the most promising uses for biomass as they combine high efficiency and ease of use. Pellets are a good method for biomass distribution due to its quality standards and energy density which make them attractive to distribution and handling.

Pellets were characterized according to their chemical and physical composition. They were subsequently burned in an automatic boiler rated at 15 kW. A probe in the exhaust chimney was used to continuously analyze the flue gases. In addition, the ashes chemical composition was also analyzed. The results show that these pellets have a good thermal efficiency in domestic boilers, releasing however large emissions of NOx, originated from the high concentration of nitrogen in its chemical composition.

In conclusion, these pellets can be explored for industrial applications, with better control of its chemical composition. For domestic boilers however, these can cause serious ash problems.

40|$|Most {{widely used}} concept for {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) incineration is combustion on a moving grate with energy recovery. In MSW incinerators fresh waste stacked on a <b>grate</b> enters the <b>combustion</b> chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs. Ignition front propagates downwards producing heat for drying and devolatilisation of the fresh waste below until it reaches the grate. The present project is investigating the so called reversed combustion of waste on a grate. In this new concept the fuel layer is ignited by means of preheated air from below without any external ignition source. As a result a combustion front will be formed close to the grate and will propagate upwards. In order to investigate reversed combustion an experimental set-up that is able to simulate a real moving grate furnace is designed. Experimental {{study was conducted to}} determine the influence of different factors (amount of primary air, fuel moisture content etc.) on process parameters.

40|$|Residues from {{biochemical}} {{production of}} liquid transport biofuels will probably become available for energy use if more gasoline and diesel is substituted. For processes used in northern Europe they amount to 35 - 65 % of the feedstock energy and despite interest from energy companies, their fuel properties are largely unknown. Combustion-relevant material properties have been characterized and fuel-specific combustion properties determined for powder-, grate- and fluidized bed combustion. Suitable combustion applications have been identified. A techno-economic evaluation of utilization of a selected residue for supplying process heat and electricity to the transport biofuel production, combined with sale of surplus energy has been done. Residues studied are rape-seed meal (RM) from biodiesel production, wheat distillers dried grain with solubles (wheat DDGS) from grain-based ethanol production and hydrolysis residue (HR) from wood-based ethanol production. For RM and wheat DDGS, mixtures with typical forest- and agricultural fuels were also studied. Combustion experiments were {{performed in a}} fluidized (quartz) bed (5 kW), an under-fed pellet burner (12 kW), and in a powder burner (150 kW). The calorific value for HR was higher than for wood, for RM and wheat DDGS it was similar to wood. More char was produced from HR, otherwise TGA results showed that thermal kinetics was similar to wood for all fuels. All pulverized residues had better feeding properties than wood powder. While RM and wheat DDGS ash contents were higher than for most common forest and also for some agricultural fuels, HR mostly had very low contents of ash, alkali, Cl, S and N. RM and DDGS had high concentrations of S, N, K and P compared to most other biomass fuels. RM had higher Ca and Mg concentrations than DDGS. The Cl content of wheat DDGS was similar to wheat straw, while RM had a lower Cl content, similar to wood. Combustion of all pulverized residues was stable with CO emissions not higher than for wood powder. While the bed agglomeration tendency of RM was low and comparable to many forest fuels the wheat DDGS bed agglomeration tendency was high and comparable to wheat straw. The K, P and Si contents of wheat DDGS formed layers of K-phosphates/silicates on the quartz grain particles, with low melting temperatures and therefore sticky, resulting in bed agglomeration. For RM, this effect was mitigated by the considerable Ca and Mg concentrations, making the layers formed less sticky, despite the high K and P concentrations. For basically the same reason, the slag formation tendency of RM was moderate and comparable to many forest fuels while wheat DDGS had a slag formation tendency which was even higher than for typical wheat straw. HR had very low bed agglomeration and slagging tendencies. For RM and wheat DDGS, emissions of NO and SO 2 were generally high, for HR considerably lower. While HCl emissions for RM were low, they were relatively high for fluidized bed combustion of wheat DDGS. Particle emissions from RM and wheat DDGS were generally high. For powder combustion of RM and wheat DDGS, particle emissions were 15 - 20 times higher than for wood. The particle emissions from combustion of HR were generally low. For fluidized bed- and <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> of RM the finer particles (< 1 μm) contained mainly alkali sulfates. RM addition to bark tended to lower the particle Cl concentrations, potentially lowering the risk of high-temperature corrosion. For fluidized bed combustion of wheat DDGS and wheat DDGS-mixtures the finer particles contained mainly K and S. The Cl concentrations of the fine particles in fluidized bed combustion were reduced when wheat DDGS where added to logging residues and wheat straw in fluidized bed combustion. In <b>grate</b> <b>combustion</b> the Cl- and P-concentrations in the finer particles during combustion of the wheat DDGS-mixtures were considerable higher than during fluidized bed combustion. The fine particles from powder combustion of RM mainly contained P and K, while they mainly contained K, P, Cl, Na and S from wheat DDGS (apart from C and O). A possible use of RM is as a sulfur-containing additive to biomass fuels rich in Cl and K in large-scale fluidized-bed and grate combustors for avoiding ash-related operational problems in fluidized beds and grate combustors originated from high KCl concentrations in the flue gases. Due to its high slagging and bed agglomeration tendencies, {{the best use of}} wheat DDGS may be to mix it with other fuels, preferably with high Ca and Mg contents (e. g. woody biomass fuels), so that only a minor fraction of the total ash-forming elements is contributed by the wheat DDGS. Because of their high N- and S contents, RM and wheat DDGS require applications with flue-gas cleaning, economically viable at large-scale. Powder combustion of RM and wheat DDGS should be used with caution, as potassium phosphate particles have low melting temperatures and could therefore increase the risk of deposit formation. Use of HR in small-scale pellet appliances is an interesting option due to low emissions, low ash content and low slagging tendency. While most large-scale combustion uses of HR would be feasible, the low ash and alkali contents and stable powder combustion of HR may be better exploited in a combined-cycle process, as the alkali content can be kept sufficiently low for use in robustgas turbines, simplifying the gas cleaning. In the techno-economic assessment, residue (HR) was assumed to be combusted on site, to supply process steam and electricity to the liquid biofuel production (wood-based ethanol) with surplus residue either sold as solid fuel or used for additional heat and power generation. With a combined cycle to increase electricity production, a location with a large district heating base load is not needed. As electricity replaced is largely generated with fossil fuels, a combined cycle is significantly more effective as a climate mitigation measure than a steam-cycle only, with about 25 percent greater reduction in CO 2 emissions per litre of ethanol produced. While it is generally accepted that energy use of the residue is important to the process economy and environmental benefits of ligno-cellulosic ethanol production, it can be concluded from this study that the choice of integrated process design has a significant impact on CO 2 emissions.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis describes the fundamentals ofmathematical modeling for the industrial furnaces and boilersand {{presents the results}} from the numerical simulations of sometypical applications in advanced industrial furnaces andboilers. The main objective of this thesis work is to employcomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology as an effectivecomputer simulation tool to study and develop the newcombustion concepts, phenomena and processes in advancedindustrial furnaces and boilers. The applications concern onfrom retrofitted conventional grate boilers to the mostadvanced highly preheated and diluted air combustion (HPDAC) furnaces. In this work, several topics are specially concernedwhen applying CFD technology to combustion cases. These topicsare including grate bed model, NOxmodeling, mixing problem, air staging system, andhighly preheated and diluted air combustion technology. In thiswork, a black-box grate bed model is developed and used inmodeling of grate fired furnaces and boilers. It is based onthe thermodynamic calculations and a set of conservationequations of mass, energy of fuel and air on the grate bed. Oneof benefits of this bed model is simple and feasible to be putinto use in industry. For NOxmodeling, besides the thermal NO and prompt NO,the HCN route fuel NO has been employed to predict the fuel NOemissions in coal/biomass fired furnaces. In addition, based onNH 3 route of fuel NO formation, a SNCR scheme for NOxabatement has been proposed also. For mixingproblem, the concepts of global degree of mixing and individualdegree of mixing have been proposed and used successfully inpractical applications. The new definition of degree of mixingovercomes some shortages of existed mixing parameters, such asthe mixing factor and the degree of non-mixing, which arenon-normalized and may lose physical meaning in some regions ofthe system. A new air staging system has been studied. It isused to improve the secondary or over-fire air configuration,thus to reduce the pollutant emissions and to enhance thecombustion facilities' efficiencies. In this work, the airstaging system has been employed in coal and biomass combustionfor grate fired furnaces/boilers. The performance of the newair staging system has been evaluated and optimized by usingnumerical modeling method together with physical modelingmethod. Results show that the new air staging system has a goodpotential of improving the combustion quality and reducing thepollutant emissions in industrial furnaces and boilers. Recently, the highly preheated and diluted air combustiontechnology has been regarded as the new generation energytechnology for advanced industrial furnaces and boilers. Inthis work, the highly preheated and diluted air combustionphenomena have been studied by using different numericalmodels. A hybrid procedure of both the large eddy simulationusing subgrid-scale stress Smagorinsky model and the Reynoldsstress model with eddy dissipation model has been alsoinvestigated to study the dynamic combustion process under theconditions of highly preheated and diluted air combustion. Results show that HPDAC technology possesses advantages ofsaving energy and low NOxemission, thus it has high potential to be usedfor the next generation of industrial furnaces and boilers. Thelarge eddy simulation using subgrid-scale stress Smagorinskymodel together with Reynolds stress model / eddy dissipationmodel are possible to study the HPDAC dynamic process. Finally,this work shows that numerical modeling method is a verypromising tool to deal with the complicated combustionprocesses even for practical applications in industry.

40|$|This thesis {{constitutes}} fundamental {{experimental and}} computational investigations on gasification and combustion in a packed bed of biomass. Packed bed gasification-combustion in counter-current mode {{is used in}} two applications -(1) Gasifier stove in reverse downdraft mode (or equivalently, top-lit updraft mode) that constitutes the idea behind efficient and clean burning domestic stoves. (2) Combustion-on moving grate for boiler application, studied widely in Europe. While {{a large part of}} the present study is around domestic stoves, a crucial part of the study aims to address the second application as an extension of the approach taken in the first part to clarify conflicting conclusions of earlier studies and explain the aero-thermochemical behavior over the entire range of superficial velocities, V s (this is velocity of air through the empty cross section of the reactor). Operational differences between the two applications lie in the range of superficial velocity - 3. 5 to 6 cm/s for domestic stoves and 15 to 30 cm/s for <b>grate</b> <b>combustion.</b> Lower values of Vs are chosen for domestic stoves to limit the particulate emissions; higher values of V s for combustion-on-grate to maximize the conversion rate. Present work deals with a fan based gasifier stove, Oorja, built by BP, India (currently transferred to FEPL, Pune) and disseminated to over 400, 000 households between 2005 and 2009. The technology was developed at CGPL, IISc and transferred to BP for commercialization. Work reported in this thesis was started to resolve issues of higher CO emissions in char mode operation and occasional smoking during transition from flaming to char mode. The contribution of the thesis is split into two parts. (a) Use of the principles of gasification to improve the performance of the stoves to the highest possible level, balancing between efficiency and ash fusion issues for domestic and industrial applications and (b) fundamental studies to unravel the flame structure in the two-phase gasification-combustion process over the entire range of Vs. Improving the stove performance It has been known that in most free-convection based stoves, like three stone fire and others developed over the last two decades, the amount of energy extracted from the stove by a cooking pot, usually measured as water boiling efficiency, is between 15 to 35 % with CO emissions of more than 1. 5 g/MJ. Oorja stove had demonstrated water boiling efficiency of 50 % and CO emissions of 0. 75 g/MJ. Operational issues noticed in the field provided an opportunity to further improve the performance by conducting detailed thermo-chemical studies. Towards this, the components of water boiling efficiency in different phases and from different modes of heat transfer were determined. Optimizing the ratio of air flow rate between combustion air from top and gasification air through the grate (denoted by R) was the key to improving the performance. The maximum water boiling efficiency obtained was 62 % with 0. 53 g/MJ CO for a 320 mm diameter vessel; under these conditions, the first phase, termed flaming mode, involving pyrolysis-gasification-gas phase combustion contributed 45 % to the total efficiency and 0. 4 g/MJ CO at R = 4. 8 and the second phase, termed char mode, involving char surface oxidation-gasification-gas phase combustion contributed 17 % and 0. 13 g/MJ CO at R = 1. 9. Under optimal air flow conditions, efficiency depends on the size of the vessel used; reactive flow calculations were performed with fast chemistry (using mixture fraction approach) in a zone that includes the free space of the combustion chamber and the vessel to obtain the heat transfer efficiency and bring out the effect of vessel size. Experiments aimed at evaluating the performance of the stove on either side of stoichiometry, revealed that while the stove could be operated on the rich side, it was not possible to operate it on the lean side -it was always tending towards the stoichiometric point with enhanced power. Computational studies showed that increased air flow from the top caused enhanced recirculation around the fuel bed bringing more oxygen that reacted closer to the surface and transferred additional heat enhancing the pyrolysis rate, explaining the observed shift towards stoichiometry. An examination of literature showed that the energy balance for stoves had long remained unexplained (unaccounted losses in stoves were up to 40 %). Using the different components of efficiency obtained from experiments and computations, a heat balance was established to within 5 %. This vast improvement in the heat balance is due to the fact that the unaccounted loss in the earlier estimates was essentially due to poor combustion, but was not so recognized. The very significant increase in combustion efficiency in this class of stoves allowed the possibility of estimating other components reasonably accurately. This is a direct consequence of the two stage gasification-combustion process yielding steady flow of gases which contain 80 % (gasification efficiency) of the input energy enabling near-stoichiometric combustion with the help of controlled supply of combustion air. Fundamental studies Experiments with wood chips (615 kg/m 3) and pellets (1260 kg/m 3) showed that particle density has no effect on single particle and packed bed combustion in flaming mode beyond the role played through the surface energy balance (involving the product of fuel density and propagation rate, ˙r). Same is true for single char particles. A transport controlled combustion model taking into account the ash build up over the char surface confirmed this behaviour and showed that the phenomenon follows d 2 law, where d is the equivalent diameter of the fuel particle, consistent with the experimental results. But packed bed of char particles showed distinct dependence on particle density. Differences were traced to poor thermal environment faced by low density wood char pieces compared to pellet char leading to variations in the volumetric heat release rate. A composite picture of the operational behaviour of the packed bed flame propagation was obtained from the measurements of exit gas composition, bed temperature, temperature of gas phase and condensed phase surface using 100 µm thermocouples, O 2 drop across the flame front using lambda sensor as a function of Vs. The packed bed studies were conducted in insulated steel and glass reactors. These studies clearly showed distinctive regimes in the bed behavior. In the first regime from Vs = 3 to 17 cm/s, (a) the propagation rate increases with Vs, (b) the fractions of CO, H 2 are at least 10 %, CH 4 drops from 3 to 1 %, (c) the oxygen fraction is near zero, (d) the gas phase temperature in the bed is constant at about 1600 K, (e) the condensed phase surface temperature increase from 850 K to 1600 K and (f) oxygen fraction drops from 0. 21 to 0. 0 within a single particle depth and coincides with the gas phase ignition. The inferences drawn from these data are that (i) the process is diffuusion controlled (ii) the bed operates in fuel rich mode, (iii) char participates only in reduction reactions. In the second domain from V s = 17 cm/s up to about 50 cm/s, (a) the propagation rate is nearly constant (b) the mass fractions of CO and H 2 drops to less than 5 %, CH 4 decreases further, (c) oxygen fraction remains near zero, (d) CO 2 increases, (e) gas phase and surface temperatures are nearly equal and increase from 1600 K to 2200 K and match with the equilibrium temperature at that equivalence ratio, (f) oxygen fraction drops from 0. 21 to 0 in one particle depth like in the first regime indicating diffuusion limitedness in this regime as well, (g) unlike in the first regime, volatiles from biomass are convected up to the next layer suppressing a local flame and char oxidation dominates. Beyond Vs = 50 cm/s, the propagation ceased to occur. The precise value of the extinction V s depended on the rate of increase of Vs in this range. A faster change initiated the extinction earlier. Observations showed that extinction began at some location around the periphery and spread laterally. Extinction at one layer was adequate to complete the extinction process. To explain the observed behaviour a simple zero-dimensional model tracking the heating of a fresh biomass particle upstream of the propagating flame front because of radiative heat transfer was set up. This equation was coupled with the equation for single particle flaming combustion to explain the behavior in the first regime. In order to explain the observed flattening of propagation rate in the second regime, it was found essential to account for the effect of the ash layer building on the oxidizing char particle and the temperature dependence of ash emissivity, on the radiative heat transfer to fresh biomass. The results of the model coupled with the experimental data from all sources on a corrected propagation rate vs. V s showed a universal behaviour that is considered a very important recognition of the packed bed propagation behaviour. Combining theory and experiments was essential to explain the extinction. The features are: (a) the presence of ash layer over the surface is shown to be responsible for maintaining a steady char conversion in a single particle at low stream speeds, (b) the feature that the ash layer would be blown away at stream velocities of 2. 5 to 3 m/s in a single particle combustion, (c) with V s close to 50 cm/s, local velocities of air ﬂow through the bed can reach 2 to 3 m/s, this value being sensitive to the bed arrangement (with slight shifting or settling of one particle leading to increase of the local velocity at the periphery). Thus, the high local speeds of flow through the bed (more than 2 m/s) was considered responsible for removal of ash layer such that radiation losses would be dominant and cause local extinction of the reaction front at the char surface. Thus, this study has led to a comprehensive understanding of the gasification-combustion behavior of packed bed in stoves and on grates. It has also led to the evolution of parameters for obtaining high efficiency and low emissions (HELE) from stoves -both domestic and industrial. Most interestingly, it has resulted in recognition of an universal behavior of flame propagation rate through packed bed of biomass...|$|E
40|$|To avoid extreme {{temperatures}} and reducing conditions along <b>combustion</b> <b>grate</b> surfaces {{reducing the risk}} of grate material deterioration-the configuration and out-placing of air passages through a grate have been investigated by mathematical modeling. In the two-dimensional CFD-simulations of wood-char combustion On top of the grate, the number and width of the air passages through the grate were varied. The different grate configurations were further investigated for different air flux rates and for the recirculation of flue gases to the combustion air. The results of the simulation; show that the maximal temperature in the grate is sensitive to the amount of air fed to the bed and,,at constant air flow rate, to the entering velocity of the combustion air to the fuel bed. The possibility of using the air flow, as a control parameter in modern grate :Furnaces is limited, due to a general wish to reduce the air flow through the grate to reduce nitric oxide emissions. Extreme temperatures in the grate should, therefore, according to the modelin;, be avoided by making sure that the entering velocity of the air to the Fuel bed is sufficiently high. Practically, this can be achieved by reducing the number of passages in the grate, or by introducing flue-gas recycling. However, to avoid areas of reducing conditio as along the grate, the number of passages should not be reduced further than resulting in a maximal distance of 4 - 5 cm between them, when working with pure air...|$|R

40|$|Packed bed {{combustion}} is {{the burning}} of solid fuel particles supported by a <b>grate</b> with the <b>combustion</b> air supplied from below. The combustion process is divided into four main stages: drying, devolatilization, volatiles combustion and char combustion. Biomasses proposed as renewal energy sources, such as wood, {{have a very high}} volatile content (∼ 80 %). Therefore mechanistic models developed for the prediction of bed characteristics during biomass combustion must include devolatilization and volatile combustion stages in order to correctly predict combustion behaviour for better emissions control and process efficiency. A novel in-situ sampling method for tar, a major pyrolysis product, was developed that allows its concentration to be measured at various heights within the packed bed and appears to work satisfactorily. A series of experiments on packed bed combustion were conducted in a laboratory 'pot' type combustor. Two different equivalent particle size diameters (2. 8 cm and 3. 2 cm) of untreated spruce wood and two different airflow rates (0. 025 kg/m 2 s and 0. 03 kg/m 2 s) were tested at a 22 cm bed height. Although the experimental data show scatter, the measurements indicated that pyrolysis occurred primarily within two particle diameters of the top of the bed, with large amounts of tar and CO and somewhat less CO 2 being produced. This research also expanded a numerical model for packed bed combustion of solid fuels {{with the addition of a}} simple first order pyrolysis reaction, in which fixed proportions of the products were set as light volatiles of CO and CO 2 with the balance as tar.

Polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, kitchen waste, paper, textile, etc. were chosen to simulate the MSW. The effects of temperature, air staging, and moisture on the CO formation and emissions were analysed for both the <b>grate</b> drying bed <b>combustion</b> and the CFB <b>combustion.</b> In the <b>grate</b> drying bed, the low temperatures increased the carbon to CO conversion rate which also increased slightly with the moisture content. Industrial field tests in a commercial grate–CFB incinerator showed that the CO concentration at the grate drying bed exit was very high and decreased along furnace height. The carbon to CO conversion rates were 0 – 20 % for the grate drying bed which exceeded the range of 0. 8 – 16 % measured in a grate drying bed exit of the commercial grate–CFB incinerator tests. In the commercial grate–CFB incinerator tests, at excess air ratios ranging from 1. 5 – 2. 0 or more, the CO emissions decreased to a low and stable level, whose corresponding carbon to CO conversion rates were far lower than 0 – 10 %.

40|$|Waste <b>combustion</b> on a <b>grate</b> {{with energy}} {{recovery}} {{is an important}} pillar of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the Netherlands. In MSW incinerators fresh waste stacked on a <b>grate</b> enters the <b>combustion</b> chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs. Typically, the reaction zone starts {{at the top of}} the waste layer and propagates downwards, producing heat for drying and devolatilization of the fresh waste below it until the ignition front reaches the grate. The control of this process is mainly based on empiricism. MSW is a highly inhomogeneous fuel with continuous fluctuating moisture content, heating value and chemical composition. The resulting process fluctuations may cause process control difficulties, fouling and corrosion issues, extra maintenance, and unplanned stops. In the new concept the fuel layer is ignited by means of preheated air (T > 220 °C) from below without any external ignition source. As a result a combustion front will be formed close to the grate and will propagate upwards. That is why this approach is denoted by upward combustion. Experimental research has been carried out in a batch reactor with height of 4. 55 m, an inner diameter of 200 mm and a fuel layer height up to 1 m. Due to a high quality two-layer insulation adiabatic conditions can be assumed. The primary air can be preheated up to 350 °C, and the secondary air is distributed via nozzles above the waste layer. During the experiments, temperatures along the height of the reactor, gas composition and total weight decrease are continuously monitored. The influence of the primary air speed, fuel moisture and inert content on the combustion characteristics (ignition rate, combustion rate, ignition front speed and temperature of the reaction zone) is evaluated. The upward combustion concept decouples the drying, devolatilization and burnout phase. In this way the moisture and inert content of the waste have almost no influence on the combustion process. In this paper an experimental comparison between conventional and reversed combustion is presente...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} carry out the design of a {{pelleting}} machine with a capacity of 900 kg per hour for the Company X. Apparently the boilers at the plant are using wood chips, a by-product from the milling operations as their source of fuel but off late the plant has been experiencing a serious fuel shortage. The fuel crisis emanated from low plant availability caused by old and dilapidated machinery. Major breakdowns that brings the plant to a halt for long hours are abrupt and rampant and during that time no wood chips are produced resulting in a fuel shortage. Following this fuel shortage the boiler operators have resorted to rationing the fuel input into the boiler as it has to run continuously regardless of whether the plant is moving or not. This rationing has resulted in poor boiler performance and low efficiency which has in turn affected the timber drying kilns. The boilers are producing poor quality steam which has had the effect of doubling the timber drying cycles. As a result of doubled timber drying cycles half of the timber produced is sold as wet off sawn at a relatively low price which is a loss to the company. The management and the engineering team in a bid to do away with this problem proposed the use of sawdust as additional boiler fuel. After a consideration of the type of boiler fire grates at the plant it was found that raw sawdust cannot be used as it has a tendency of choking the <b>grates</b> blowing out <b>combustion</b> so it has to be pelletized. With this problem at hand this project zeroed in at the design and development of a pelleting machine that will specifically meet the pellets need at the wattle company. Literature review was done on several types of pelleting machines’ operating mechanisms and from this literature three possible concepts were generated. These concepts were evaluated and the best was chosen and developed into a finished design ready for fabrication with all working drawings available for each component. The machine was designed with a constraint budget of USD $ 10 000 and it will provide a backup and additional boiler fuel to the already being used wood chips...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance the}} overall {{efficiency}} {{of the use of}} biomass in the energy sector in Europe, the large electricity production potential from small-scale biomass heating systems should be utilised. So far, no technologically sound (in terms of efficiency and reliability) and economically affordable micro- and small-scale biomass CHP technologies are, however, available. Therefore, the present ERA-NET project (MiniBioCHP) aimed at the further development and test of new CHP technologies based on small-scale biomass combustion in the electric capacity range between some W and 100 kW. Within the project, an international consortium consisting of 12 partners from 4 countries, including university institutions, institutes and industry (both engineering and manufacturing), collaborated closely to perform high level R&D on three promising micro/small-scale biomass based CHP technologies which are covering a broad range of applications in the residential heating sector. The Austrian engineering company BIOS, coordinated the international project. The project was based on earlier basic research and development work related to these promising new technologies and aimed at the achievement of a technological level which allows a first (commercial) demonstration {{after the end of the}} project. The three CHP concepts included in the MiniBioCHP project were; 1. Pellet stoves with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) 2. Small-scale biomass boilers (10 - 30 kWth) with a micro-ORC process 3. High temperature heat exchanger (HT-HE) for an externally fired gas turbine (EFGT) The Swedish part of the project was focused on the development of the concept of biomass based EFGT with dedicated R&D activities related to the development of the HT-HE system. The Swedish project consisted of the research partners Umeå University (project leader), Luleå University of Technology, Chalmers University of Technology and RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, together with the industrial partners Enertech AB/Osby Parca and Ecergy. The expertise of the Swedish partners regarding ash related problems, <b>grate</b> boiler <b>combustion</b> and modelling, deposit formation and high temperature corrosion, were combined with the know-how of a Polish partner regarding HT-HE design, construction, testing and optimisation. The HT-HE is the most crucial component in EFGT processes significantly influencing the investment costs, availabilities as well as the efficiencies that can be achieved. With a thermal capacity from several hundred kW up to 2 - 3 MWth) the CHP technology based on a biomass boiler and an EFGT is suitable for district heating systems, or process heat consumers. The electricity produced by the gas turbine (up to some 100 kWel) can be used to cover the own electricity consumption of a company and/or fed into the grid. Even though the concept of biomass based EFGT has been an interesting alternative for small-scale CHP production for some decades, and R&D activities have been undertaken, tackling both economic and technical aspects, only a few pilot-plants have been in operation and no initiative has so far reached the level of commercial implementation. Thus, the concept of EFGT fed with biomass is still considered to be in a rather early development stage and the main technical challenges are related to alkali deposit induced corrosion and thermal stress of the HT-HE material, turbine design/operation and system integration. Within the present project, a HT-HE prototype aimed for an EFGT system was therefore designed, constructed and successfully tested at flue gas temperatures up to 900 °C. Thus, appropriate guidelines for a compact design of the HT-HE and recommendations have been worked out to minimize thermal stresses as well as ash related problems regarding ash deposit formation and high temperature corrosion in a biomass boiler system. Furthermore, different concepts for the overall biomass based EFGT system have been worked out and evaluated. The outcome of the project will hopefully be used in the further development work and form the basis for a first testing and demonstration plant within the coming years. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{radiation}} {{is an important}} physical phenomenon in combustion environments. For the understanding of existing- and the design of new combustion environments computational modelling is a useful tool as it can describe the different transport phenomena. This thesis has focused on studying thermal radiative property models of the participating media, gases and particles. Two specific combustion environments have also been studied, from a thermal radiation perspective. The focus is on radiative property models that are useful specifically for engineering purposes. These property models are often developed from more advanced spectral models by means of correlative or other methods to simplify {{the treatment of the}} radiative transfer. One such model is the non-correlated statistical narrow band (SNB) model, which drops spectral relation between intensity and transmissivity, which is used in the correlated SNB model. By doing so a significant decrease in computational demand can be achieved. The accuracy of this model has been questioned in the literature although it has been suggested as an appropriate option for sooty environments. The assessment of the model revealed that it only gives good predictions in large geometries and highly sooty environments. Because of the model’s limited applicability and a still rather high computational demand it is not recommended for use even in sooty environments. A simpler model, and computationally much faster, called the weighted sum of gray gas (WSGG) model accompanied the assessment of the non-correlated SNB model. The WSGG model was shown to be a better choice than the non-correlated SNB model in sooty environments. A gray gas property model was compared with a WSGG model in combustion environments resembling the ones found in grate fired furnaces. In these environments, which also contains particles, the gray model was shown to give predictions of wall heat flux in close agreement with the WSGG model. This shows how the simplest model, which the gray model is, can sometimes be a suitable choice, especially when particles are present. Particle property models were evaluated in various combustion environments. A common approach is to use Planck mean coefficients to represent the particle properties. The use of Planck mean coefficients for fly-ash particles, common in furnaces combusting solid fuels, is shown to give large errors in prediction of both radiative heat flux and the source term in particular. The two investigated combustion environments are those found in grate fired furnaces and environments with high CO mole fraction. The grate fired furnace was studied in both modelling- and measurement work. Specifically the importance of particle radiation was investigated in the <b>grate</b> fired <b>combustion</b> environment. A preliminary study of the grate fired furnace was a parametric study. The parameters investigated were different particles originating from combustion of biomass and municipal solid waste, different furnace size, and boundary emissivities. The most significant effect on the overall radiative heat transfer is that of particles from municipal solid waste; moderate effects are seen when particles come from biomass. Increased furnace size most affected the heat flux to the hot bed and source term compared with a case without any particles. The choice of emissivity can be as important as considering particles or not. The measurement and modelling work were carried out on a 400 kW grate fired furnace combusting biomass. The boundary temperatures, flue gas temperature, gas mole fraction, particle mass-size distribution, and wall irradiation were measured. A so-called indirect wall irradiation was retrieved when the furnace was modelled with the implemented measured parameters. This indirect wall irradiation was compared with the directly measured wall irradiation. The study revealed that particle {{radiation is}} very important in the evaluated furnace, it doubles the wall irradiation in the hot flame zone compared with irradiation only from gases. The CO contribution to the total directional radiation was studied in environments with high mole fractions of CO, often found in gasifiers. CO is normally disregarded in environments where the fuel is fully oxidised, as it is a weak radiating species and small mole fractions of CO exist in these types of environments. The evaluation reveal that disregarding CO is still a good approach even in gasifier environments. These environments still contain small volume fractions of CO 2 and H 2 O, which compared with CO are much stronger radiators. The rotational-vibrational bands of these two species overlaps the important fundamental band of CO reducing the importance of CO to the total directional radiative heat flux...|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{of fixed}} fuel beds in grate {{furnaces}} {{is one of}} the most common techniques within production of heat and power from solid fuels. The grate furnace used to be a working horse for combustion of hard coal, while today the incitement of using renewable fuel sources has turned biomass and municipal waste into dominating fuel types. These fuels are more conveniently managed by the robust grate furnace than by, for example, fluidised bed or suspension boilers. However, the introduction of the, in many cases, complicated and heterogeneous biomass and waste fuels have, while at the same time subjected to increasingly stringent demands on efficiency and emission of harmful substances, given rise to diffuse challenges to the operation and design of grate furnaces. The influence of the heterogeneous fuels and the low air flow rate required for low nitric oxide emissions are, to a large extent, unclear. The outcome is that different furnaces not only rely on diverging strategies of design and operation – they also show a variety of disturbance characteristics. To make way for more efficient use of modern biomass fuels in grate furnaces, by improving the understanding of the combustion situation and disturbance characteristics, the following steps were made in this study: (1) a set of grate furnaces were investigated separating hands-on problems from underlying research oriented questions, (2) three methods for detecting and measuring disturbances in grate furnaces were developed, and (3) the fundamentals behind disturbances in the part of a fuel bed of grate furnace dominated by char conversion were addressed by mathematical modelling. The outcome of the inventory of furnaces is that fuel-bed channelling and grate material deterioration are common – the first causing increased emissions of unburned carbon compounds and nitric oxides, while the latter giving rise to high material costs and operation failures. In some furnaces, the disturbances could be detected by logical reasoning and visual observations while abated by hands-on adjustments to the fuel handling, operation conditions or grate design. The continued study adds two instruments to further improve this category: (1) a method of video recording inside furnaces to detect, quantify and fend off disturbing channelling, and (2) a new method of on-line monitoring of the fuel moisture content to detect disturbing changes in fuel moisture content during operation. Furthermore, a third developed method of analysing the residence time field of the gas flow in a furnace by mathematical modelling provides an opportunity to optimise the furnace chamber for both steady conditions and transient disturbances. The inventory of furnaces also identified some fundamental question marks concerning the conversion of the fuel bed – how channels in the fuel bed arise and how these disturbances may be avoided, also during low combustion air flow, without causing grate-material deterioration. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling of two-dimensional conversion of a fixed char bed was developed and used for investigating these matters, in which it was confirmed that a provoked change of bed porosity may cause process disturbing channelling. An obvious solution to avoid bed-channelling is, therefore, to create an as homogeneous fuel bed as possible. However, the structure of the fuel bed may only to a certain extent be affected; the low cost of the inferior quality fuel is, to a large extent, attributable to the fact that it is heterogeneous and, furthermore, advanced fuel pre-treatments drastically reduce the economical outcome. Thus, the most powerful parameter to avoid disturbances in a heterogeneous fuel bed is to manipulate the distribution of air by means of grate design. Here, a considerable flow resistance across the grate – an effect which may be achieved by reducing the amount and/or size of the air holes in the grate rods – was found to dampen channelling. The CFD modelling, however, indicates that the placing or shaping of these holes, under certain circumstances during the char conversion, may cause thermal and/or carburizing material deterioration – one of the most common disturbances in the inventory of furnaces. Consequently, recommendations for placing of holes along the lower part of a <b>combustion</b> <b>grate,</b> counter-acting the risk of grate material deterioration, could be given from the modelling outcome. These recommendations, which also include recirculation of flue-gases into the combustion air, may in a straight forward manner be applied to the design of future grate furnaces to improve the combustion of heterogeneous fuel beds...|$|R
