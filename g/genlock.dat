500|$|In August 1989, Chahi was {{impressed}} by the flat-color animations that the Amiga version of Dragon's Lair had and thought that {{it would be possible to}} use vector outlines to create a similar effect using much less computer storage. After first attempting to write the graphical routines in C, he turned to assembly language. He wrote a polygon routine for the Motorola 68000 on an Atari ST to test his theory, with much success. Later, he found that he could run the code on the Amiga platform and achieve a frame rate of about 20 frames per second, later recognizing this as [...] "a major turning point in the creation of the game" [...] and the point where he knew the polygon approach would work. He was able to take advantage of the Amiga's <b>genlock</b> capabilities to create rotoscoped animations with the polygons, using video recordings of himself performing various actions. Though he had tried to use smaller polygons (which Chahi called [...] "pixigons") to construct the backgrounds for the scenes based on Deluxe Paint artwork, the process of creating them was excruciatingly slow, and he returned to using bitmapped images.|$|E

Other upgrades include <b>genlocks,</b> network cards for Ethernet, modems, sound cards and samplers, video digitizers, extra serial ports, and IDE controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are USB cards. The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards.

50|$|The {{other problem}} {{presented}} by latency variation {{is that it}} makes synchronization more complex by making the recovery of the underlying timing of the video signal far more difficult. This is typically solved by <b>genlocking</b> both ends of the system to external station sync signals, typically generated from sources such as GPS or atomic clocks, thus only requiring the extraction of coarse timing information at the receiving end in order to achieve high-quality video synchronization. The extraction of coarse timing data is typically done using a phase locked loop with a long time constant.|$|R

50|$|The Amiga chipset can <b>genlock,</b> {{which is}} the ability to adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an {{incoming}} NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do character generation and CGI effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. This ability has been frequently utilized by wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and desktop videographers. The NewTek Video Toaster was made possible by the <b>genlock</b> ability of the Amiga.|$|E

A camera with the minimum requirements typically being the inclusion of three CCDs and relatively low-compression analog recording or digital recording capability {{with little or no}} chroma subsampling, and the ability to be <b>genlocked.</b> The advantages of three CCDs include better color definition in shadows, better overall low-light sensitivity, and reduced noise when compared to single-CCD systems. With continuing improvements in image sensors, resolution, recording media, and codecs, by 2006 the term no longer carried much weight in the marketplace.|$|R
50|$|The Pioneer PR7820 was {{the first}} mass-produced {{industrial}} LaserDisc player, sold originally as the MCA DiscoVision PR-7820.

50|$|Originally, {{waveform}} monitors {{were entirely}} analog devices; the incoming (analog) video signal was filtered and amplified, {{and the resulting}} voltage was used to drive the vertical axis of a cathode ray tube. A sync stripper circuit was used to isolate the sync pulses and colorburst from the video signal; the recovered sync information was fed to a sweep circuit which drove the horizontal axis. Early waveform monitors differed little from oscilloscopes, except for the specialized video trigger circuitry. Waveform monitors also {{permit the use of}} external reference; in this mode the sync and burst signals are taken from a separate input (thus allowing all devices in a facility to be <b>genlocked,</b> or synchronized to the same timing source).|$|R
5000|$|Kelly's {{idea was}} to adapt the McIdas concept for lower cost home {{computer}} systems that were appearing in the late 1970s. Their first system, [...] "LiveLine", {{was based on the}} Apple II. Its graphics system could not be <b>genlocked,</b> so a TV camera had to be pointed at the screen to send the video into the production systems. This initial system was soon replaced by a similar one running on Cromemco computers using a modified version of their Dazzler color-graphics card. In spite of its simplicity and low resolution, the fast production and [...] "high tech" [...] look caught on, and by the mid-1980s the system was almost universal, replacing bluescreen systems on cardboard maps that had previously been used. The company notes that 70% of the top 50 TV markets were using the system by 1982.|$|R
2500|$|The system {{displays}} {{video in}} analog RGB [...] PAL or [...] NTSC through a proprietary DB23M connector and in NTSC mode the line frequency is [...] HSync for standard video modes, which {{is compatible with}} NTSC television and CVBS/RGB video, but out of range for most VGA-compatible monitors, while a multisync monitor is required {{for some of the}} higher resolutions. This connection can also be <b>genlocked</b> to an external video signal. The system was bundled with an RF adapter to provide output on televisions with a coaxial RF input, while monochrome composite video is available via an RCA connector (also coaxial). There is also a Zorro II bus expansion on the left side (behind a plastic cover). Peripherals such as a hard disk drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's AutoConfig standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to [...] of “fast RAM" [...] can be added using the side expansion slot.|$|R

50|$|For {{synchronisation}} {{to broadcast}} or post-production editing house <b>genlock</b> systems, U-Matic VCRs required a time base corrector (TBC). Some TBCs had a drop-out compensation (DOC) circuit which would hold lines of video in temporary digital memory {{to compensate for}} oxide drop-out or wrinkle flaws in the videotape, however the DOC circuits required several cables and expert calibration for use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} video {{synthesis}} {{is tied to}} a [...] "real time performance" [...] ethic. The equipment is usually expected to function on input camera signals the machine has never seen before, delivering a processed signal continuously and {{with a minimum of}} delay in response to the ever-changing live video inputs. Following in the tradition of performance instruments of the audio synthesis world such as the Theremin, video synthesizers were designed with the expectation they would be played in live concert theatrical situations or set up in a studio ready to process a videotape from a playback VCR in real time while recording the results on a second VCR. Venues of these performances included [...] "Electronic Visualization Events" [...] in Chicago, The Kitchen in NYC, and museum installations. Video artist/performer Don Slepian http://DonSlepian.com designed, built and performed a foot-controlled Visual Instrument at the Centre Pompideau in Paris (1983) and the NY Open Center that combined <b>genlocked</b> early micro-computers Apple II Plus with the Chromaton 14 Video Synthesizerhttp://www.audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/chroma14/chroma14.htm and channels of colorized video feedback.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first software <b>genlocking</b> approach for unmodified Microsoft Windows systems, requiring no specialized graphics boards {{but only a}} low-cost signal generator as additional hardware. Compared to existing solutions for other operating systems, it does not rely on any real-time extensions or kernel modifications. Its novel design {{can be divided into}} two parts: First, an external synchronization signal is transmitted over interrupt lines to a dedicated driver. Second, a user-space application performs the synchronization by inserting or removing lines to the invisible part of the image. Robustness to potential frame losses is achieved through continuous consistent timestamping. Tests yield an accuracy of up to ± line deviation from the external signal and a low CPU load of 2 % on current PC systems. Our system has been designed to be compatible with off-the-shelf graphics hardware and digital output devices based on LCD or DLP technology. Our solution can be employed to build cost-effective VR installations such as large tiled and spatially immersive displays using commodity PC clusters.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} {{was to determine the}} contributions made by wrist, shoulder, and hip joint torques in maintaining a handstand. Methods: Handstand balances (N = 6) executed on a force plate and recorded with two <b>genlocked</b> video cameras were subjected to inverse dynamics analysis to determine anterior-posterior joint torques st the wrists, shoulders, and hips. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate which of the joint torques were influential in accounting for anterior-posterior whole-body mass center (CM) movement. Results: Results demonstrated that, in general, all calculated joint torques contributed to CM movement. In a number of trials, wrist torque played a dominant role in acccounting for CM variance. Ostensibly, superior handstand balances are characterized by important contributions from wrist torques and shoulder torques with little influence from hip torques. In contrast, hip torques were found to be increasingly influential in less successful balances. Conclusions: It is concluded that multiple joints are utilized in maintaining a handstand balance in the anterior-posterior direction. and there appears to be two joint involvement strategies, which supports similar findings from postural research On normal upright stance...|$|R
