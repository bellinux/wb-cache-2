50|$|Language {{analysis}} for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (LADO) is an instrument used in asylum cases to determine the national or ethnic origin of the asylum seeker, through an evaluation of their language profile. To this end, {{an interview with the}} asylum seeker is recorded and analysed. The analysis consists of an examination of the dialectologically relevant features (e.g. accent, grammar, vocabulary and loanwords) in the speech of the asylum seeker. LADO is considered a type of speaker identification by forensic linguists. LADO analyses are usually made at the request of government immigration/asylum bureaux attempting to verify asylum claims, but may also be performed as part of the appeals process for claims which have been denied; they have frequently been the subject of appeals and litigation in several countries, e.g. Australia, the Netherlands and the UK.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increase}} in the on-line availability of dialect corpora, databases and search, analysis and visualisation tools (cf. www. dialectsyntax. org). Although primarily intended for linguistic research, this infrastructure provides rich resources for courses on sociolinguistics, dialectology, formal linguistics and linguistic methodology. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the Dutch linguistic microvariation research tool MIMORE (www. meertens. knaw. nl/mimore) for a course in applied linguistics, more specifically on Language Analysis for the <b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> (LADO). LADO is used in asylum procedures as a means to determine whether an asylum seeker originates from the country or area that s/he claims to originate from. It is a task of linguists to make clear if and how LADO can be a valid method, and what kind of linguistic expertise is needed. MIMORE contains three databases with (morpho-) syntactic and (morpho‐) phonological data from a large number of locations in the Dutch language area. The paper describes how the MIMORE data and tools have been used in the course as training material, to introduce students to the different levels of language variation, to teach them how to recognize linguistic differences and make these explicit and to show them the complications involved in using linguistic properties to locate speakers...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{exchange}} ofCa 2 + and Na + by tanthanide ions (Ln 3 + = Pr 3 +, Gd 3 +, Er 3 +) in montmorillonite {{was investigated}} at two different ionic strengths (0 - 01 and 0. 1 mol/kg). Preferential sorption of Ln 3 + was observed and variable selectivity coefficients were found {{depending upon the}} lanthanide concentration n the solid, and ionic strength. The highest exchange extent of Ln 3 + always occurred for the system Na+/Ln 3 +, but the exchange s lectivities of Ln 3 + were generally higher in the exchange system Ca 2 +/Ln 3 +. Although the relative affinity of montmorillonite for the three lanthanide ions was similar, distinctive b haviour between Pr 3 + and the heavier lanthanides, Gd 3 + and Er ~+, was noted. The study of Ln 3 + adsorption i trace amounts showed specific adsorption f lanthanides at high concentrations of Na + in the external solution and that the exchange stoichiometries in the interlayer regions were 3 : 1 at equilibrium pH = 4. The interaction of lanthanide ions (Ln 3 +) with clay minerals {{has been the subject}} of considerable study for purposes as varied as application to industrial catalytic processes (Shabtai, 1980), radioactive waste storage (Komarneni & White, 1983), and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of parent rocks (Steinberg & Courtois, 1976).

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to present the possibility of an alternative production base for clothing busi-ness of South Korea through the analysis about textile/clothing industry production activities in the Gaeseong industrial complex. It is necessary for the Gaeseong industrial complex to cope with the issue about FTA and country of origin, manpower supply and demand, paying wages and labor productivity, the exclusive industrial complex of clothing. The Country of Origin on imports and exports tells the country of manufacture or production, where the product comes from. Rules of Origin are the special regulations to determine the country of origin of a product and exist in the forms of inter-national law, legislation, precedent and administrative decisions. But the economy in the North and the Gaeseong indus-trial complex is a comparative advantage combined with elements of North-South interdependence as a South-North economic cooperation business and can contribute significantly to the stabilization of the North-South relations. Among the models using criteria of the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> it has directly provided the models of general regulation for off-shore products, of limited offshore products. These models are to help Korean exporters in understanding and utilizing the Rules of Origin for their manufacturing.

40|$|Language {{analysis}} for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (LADO) {{has been used as}} part of the asylum process since 1993. A language analysis can be requested when the origin of an asylum claimant is unverified or unknown. In most cases, an analysis of the claimant’s speech is conducted in order to determine whether it shows the characteristics expected of a particular place of origin. Today there are five established commercial and government owned agencies based in Sweden, the Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as independent experts, that offer this service. Though it is now 23 years since LADO began, there is minimal research surrounding the use of such language analysis. Detailed information pertaining to the methodologies and practices of agencies who conduct this work remains largely unavailable to the public, direct empirical research on any aspect of the field is scarce, and yet governments throughout the world continue to utilise LADO regularly in problematic asylum cases. Public interest is also growing, with the media questioning the overall validity of the field and the professionalism of practitioners. The aim of this thesis is to take a detailed look at LADO, its history, the research surrounding it, and current issues. It also collates all readily available information on practices adopted by the aforementioned language analysis agencies. Finally, it puts forward suggestions and plans for future research that is desperately needed, both for the field to progress and for LADO to be validated as a worthy contribution to an asylum seeker’s case...|$|E

30|$|Chlorite {{precipitation}} implies basic pore solutions {{enriched in}} Fe 2 + and Mg 2 + (Small et al. 1992). A {{large volume of}} basic water source is sea water which is typically buffered between pH 8.0 and 8.4 (Brownlow 1979). The results of pore water analysis of the samples across the basin show a near similar condition. The LST shows average pH of 7.10, conductivity (Ec) average of 0.65  mS, and average redox potential (Eh) 0.16  V (Table  2). Within the TST the average pH is 7.32, with Ec average of 0.56  mS and Eh of 0.15  V (Table  2). The HST has an average pH of 7.52, Ec of 0.72  mS and average Eh of 0.74  V (Table  2). These conditions support clay conversion (De Ros et al. 1994). The pH values within the stratigraphic settings exceed 7, thereby facilitating the reaction of HCO 3 − with dissolved Ca 2 + to form calcite (Morse and Mackenzie 1990; Schulz and Zabel 2000). It is inferred that montmorillonite might have been converted to chlorite in the basin based on the XRD results and the dominance of chlorite over montmorillonite in the thin sections. The prevailing condition of the basin using chemical evaluation parameter discussed above satisfies Krumbein and Garrels (1952) explanations for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of these authigenic minerals. Pyrite found in the basin might have been formed from precipitation in alkaline condition. The silica precipitation requires weakly alkaline condition for its precipitation. The hematite that requires oxidizing condition for its precipitation can also persist in slightly reducing alkaline condition (Krumbein and Garrels 1952).|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{studies were}} {{performed}} on 101 cases of confined placental mosaicism (CPM) involving autosomal trisomy. The origin of the trisomic cell line was determined in 54 cases (from 51 pregnancies), 47 of which were also analyzed {{for the presence of}} uniparental disomy (UPD) in the disomic cell line. An additional 47 cases were analyzed for parental origin in the disomic cell line only. A somatic (postmeiotic) origin of the trisomy was observed in 22 cases and included the majority of cases with CPM for trisomy 2, 7, 8, 10, and 12. Most cases of CPM involving trisomy 9, 16, and 22 were determined to be meiotic. Fetal maternal UPD was found in 17 of 94 informative CPM cases, involving trisomy 2 (1 case), 7 (1 case), 16 (13 cases), and 22 (2 cases). The placental trisomy was of meiotic origin in all 17 cases associated with fetal UPD (P =. 00005). A meiotic origin also correlated with the levels of trisomy in cultured chorionic villi samples (CVS) (P =. 0002) and trophoblast (P =. 00005). Abnormal pregnancy outcome (usually IUGR) correlated with meiotic origin (P =. 0003), the presence of fetal UPD (P = 4 x 10 (- 7)), and the level of trisomy in trophoblast (P = 3 x 10 (- 7)) but not with the level of trisomy in CVS or term chorion. The good fit of somatic errors with the expected results could have been observed only if few true meiotic errors were misclassified by these methods as a somatic error. These data indicate that molecular <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is a useful predictor of pregnancy outcome, whereas the level of trisomy observed in cultured CVS is not. In addition, UPD for some chromosomes may affect prenatal, but not postnatal, development, possibly indicating that imprinting effects for these chromosomes are confined to placental tissues...|$|E
40|$|Caper {{is one of}} {{the most}} renowned Italian {{products}} in the world. For this reason, it is important to develop a scientific method for determining geographic origin to safeguard this product of “Made in Italy”. To identify the relationship between geochemistry of soil and chemical composition of caper, a geochemical characterization of caper from Aeolian Islands, was performed. The Aeolian Islands are recognized to be an important place of caper production due to favourable environmental conditions such as Mediterranean climate, the volcanic soil and exposure to wind and sea spray deposition (Barbera & Di Lorenzo 1982). All these features permit to define the geographic context and the territoriality of agricultural products. The sites tested refer to three cultivations area located in Lipari and Salina. The studied areas in the Island of Lipari, Lami and Pianogreca, belong to the Pomiciazzo and Pianoconte Formation respectively (Forni et al., 2013), while the area of Salina Island, Leni, is on colluvial deposits produced by erosion of the Formations Punta Fontanelle, Pianoconte and Serra di Sciarato (Lucchi et al., 2013). Geologic features of the production area, such as soil type, are assumed to be important factors affecting the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (Bong et al., 2013). We detected the relationship between major and trace elements in soil and their concentration in caper according to geographic origin. Major and trace elements were investigated by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Data were elaborated with multivariate statistics (Principal Component Analysis, PCA). The analyses of soil by XRF and ICP-MS allowed us to geologically characterize each one of the three areas and to determine a chemical composition of major and trace elements in caper. By the geochemical and statistical analyses we discriminated the soils according to geo-lithological characteristics of each area and identified possible geochemical fingerprint of caper in the Islands of Lipari and Salina...|$|E
