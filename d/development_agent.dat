25|$|The country's {{infrastructure}} benefited through massive {{road construction}} programs. With {{the decision to}} shift the capital city from Zomba to Lilongwe (against vociferous objections from the British preference for the economically healthy and well-developed Blantyre), a new road was built linking Blantyre and Zomba to Lilongwe. The Capital City Development Corporation (CCDC) in Lilongwe was itself a beehive of infrastructure development, supported by planning and funds from apartheid-era South Africa. The British refused to finance the move to Lilongwe. The CCDC became the sole <b>development</b> <b>agent</b> for Lilongwe; putting up roads, the government seat at Capital Hill, etc. Other infrastructure entities were added, such as Malawi Hotels Limited, which undertook massive projects such as the Mount Soche, Capital Hotel and Mzuzu Hotel. On the industrial side, Malawi Development Corporation (MDC) was tasked with setting up industries and other businesses. Meanwhile, Dr. Banda's own Press Corporation Limited and MYP's Spearhead Corporation embarked on business initiatives that lead to an economic boom during the mid- to late 1970s.|$|E

According to the transcripts of lectures, discussions and articles written by <b>development</b> <b>agents,</b> {{it seems that the}} ten <b>development</b> <b>agents</b> analysed dealt with three major themes, all of which concern the new skills required by rural development actors. The first of these concerns social learning in general and, in particular, the complex interactions between public policies, as they are applied through decrees, and new local initiatives. The second theme concerns learning processes at work in rural development professions and new skills required by <b>development</b> <b>agents.</b> Finally, the third theme deals with the sensitive relationship between learning by <b>development</b> <b>agents</b> and learning by local communities or by organizations with which, or for whom, these agents work...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Wisconsin-River Falls, 2012. viii, 93 leaves. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 61 - 63). The Hispanic {{population in}} Wisconsin {{is continuing to}} increase, {{with each of the}} 72 counties having Hispanic residents. As this population continues to increase, Extension and 4 -H need to find ways to better meet the needs of Hispanic community members. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the perspectives of Wisconsin 4 H/Youth <b>Development</b> <b>agents</b> and staff on Hispanic 4 -H programming. In particular, this study sought to find out what types of Hispanic 4 -H programming are currently in existence in Wisconsin, whether or not Hispanic 4 -H programming is seen as a necessity, and what Wisconsin 4 -H/Youth <b>Development</b> <b>agents</b> and staff see as the major benefits and challenges of offering 4 -H programming to the Hispanic population. This research was conducted through the use of a survey that was developed using the online survey tool, Qualtrics. In total, 84 Wisconsin 4 -H/Youth <b>Development</b> <b>agents</b> and staff were sent an email invitation to participate in this survey. The survey consisted of both closed and open-ended questions and also included a 17 item five point Likert-type scale. The questions in the survey sought to determine background information, such as county Hispanic population and 4 -H enrollment, as well as to find out information about existing programs and the perspectives of Wisconsin 4 -H/Youth <b>Development</b> <b>agents</b> and staff. Results of this research indicated that only a few of the counties in Wisconsin currently offer some type of 4 -H programming for the Hispanic population, although every county has Hispanic residents. The Wisconsin 4 -H/Youth <b>Development</b> <b>agents</b> and staff surveyed indicated that increased programming for underrepresented audiences and programming that increased cultural awareness were of importance. This research also shows that additional research in the area of Hispanic 4 -H programming needs to be conducted to determine how to better meet the needs of the Wisconsin 4 -H/Youth <b>Development</b> <b>agents</b> and staff who plan and develop these types of programs...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of social and}} vocational integration is directly linked to local development and local employment initiatives, as part of which a number of agents are actively engaged in the integration process, namely employment and local <b>development</b> <b>agents.</b> These agents target their resources and efforts to social and vocational integration, mainly {{within the framework of}} local government, and help promote the social economy by supporting the creation of local companies. Given the prominent role that these agents perform in terms of social and vocational integration, this paper represents an empirical study of the current reality of agents of social and vocational integration in Spain, involving the creation and analysis of a national and regional directory of agents. The aim is to demonstrate the enormous complexity of the concept and the significant regional variations in the implementation and performance of this model of local <b>development.</b> Local <b>development,</b> <b>agents</b> of social and vocational integration, social economy, local employment policies, self-employment and company creation. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{study has}} also shown the {{importance}} of access to information, which is crucial to enhance farmers’ awareness and knowledge of coping and adaptation strategies for their particular conditions. This information can be provided using communication media such as radio and through <b>development</b> <b>agents.</b> Use of <b>development</b> <b>agents</b> in assisting farmers related to environmental changes and adaptation strategies should be strengthened in Ethiopia in general and CRV in particular. Moreover, improving communication media (e.g. mobile network) and providing information regarding environmental changes and appropriate adaptation strategies is crucial in the CRV of Ethiopia. Finally, {{it is important to}} emphasize that subsistence and smallholder farmers are very susceptible to rainfall variability and changes. Hence, holistic efforts are required to build resilience of communities to the range of environmental shocks and stresses.|$|R

40|$|This study {{contributes}} new {{empirical evidence}} on the gender difference in access to extension services in Ethiopia and how this translates to observed differences in technology adoption and agricultural productivity. Our results suggest that female house-hold heads and plot managers {{are less likely to}} get extension services and are less likely to access quality services than their male counterparts. Receiving advice from <b>development</b> <b>agents,</b> as agricultural extension officers in Ethiopia are called, is strongly and positively related to adoption of improved seed and fertilizer for both female and male headed households. How-ever, visits by or advice from <b>development</b> <b>agents</b> do not significantly affect productivity, for both females and males.
