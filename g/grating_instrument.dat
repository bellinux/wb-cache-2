A second problem is that the resolution is so high that above about 80 eV, it is much smaller than the lifetime broadening of any known absorption resonance, making any determination of resolution difficult.

40|$|Context: The flight {{calibration}} of {{the spectral}} response of charge-coupled device (CCD) instruments below 1. 5 keV is difficult in general {{because of the}} lack of strong lines in the on-board calibration sources typically available. This calibration is also a function of time due to the effects of radiation damage on the CCDs and/or the accumulation of a contamination layer on the filters or CCDs. Aims: We desire a simple comparison of the absolute effective areas of the current generation of CCD instruments onboard the following observatories: Chandra ACIS-S 3, XMM-Newton (EPIC-MOS and EPIC-pn), Suzaku XIS, and Swift XRT and a straightforward comparison of the time-dependent response of these instruments across their respective mission lifetimes. Methods: We have been using 1 E 0102. 2 - 7219, the brightest supernova remnant in the Small Magellanic Cloud, to evaluate and modify the response models of these instruments. 1 E 0102. 2 - 7219 has strong lines of O, Ne, and Mg below 1. 5 keV and little or no Fe emission to complicate the spectrum. The spectrum of 1 E 0102. 2 - 7219 has been well-characterized using the RGS <b>gratings</b> <b>instrument</b> on XMM-Newton and the HETG <b>gratings</b> <b>instrument</b> on Chandra. As part of the activities of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), we have developed a standard spectral model for 1 E 0102. 2 - 7219 and fit this model to the spectra extracted from the CCD instruments. The model is empirical in that it includes Gaussians for the identified lines, an absorption component in the Galaxy, another absorption component in the SMC, and two thermal continuum components with different temperatures. In our fits, the model is highly constrained in that only the normalizations of the four brightest lines/line complexes (the O[*]vii Heα triplet, O[*]viii Lyα line, the Ne[*]ix Heα triplet, and the Ne[*]x Lyα line) and an overall normalization are allowed to vary, while all other components are fixed. We adopted this approach to provide a straightforward comparison of the measured line fluxes at these four energies. We have examined these measured line fluxes as a function of time for each instrument after applying the most recent calibrations that account for the time-dependent response of each instrument. Results: We performed our effective area comparison with representative, early mission data when the radiation damage and contamination layers were at a minimum, except for the XMM-Newton EPIC-pn instrument which is stable in time. We found that the measured fluxes of the O[*]vii Heαr line, the O[*]viii Lyα line, the Ne[*]ix Heαr line, and the Ne[*]x Lyα line generally agree to within ± 10...|$|R

The flight {{calibration}} of {{the spectral}} {{response of the}} Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) below 1. 5 keV is difficult {{because of the lack}} of strong lines in the calibration source on-board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We have been using 1 E 0102. 2 - 7219 (the brightest supernova remnant in the SMC) to evaluate the ACIS response matrices, since this remnant has strong lines of O, Ne and Mg below 1. 5 keV. The spectrum of 1 E 0102. 2 - 7219 has been well-characterized using the gratings on Chandra and XMM. We have used the high-resolution spectral data from both <b>gratings</b> <b>instruments</b> to develop a spectral model for the CCD spectra.

We have fit the data with the latest response matrix for the S 3 device released in August 2001 (available in CALDB 2. 7 or higher). We have also applied the charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI) correction software (version 1. 37) developed at Penn State to both the Backside-illuminated (BI) and Front-side illuminated (FI) data and fit the data with the associated CTIcorrected response matrices. All fits show a significant improvement in the low energy response with the new matrices.

40|$|This program {{predicts the}} spectra {{resulting}} from electronic transitions of diatomic molecules and atoms in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The program produces a spectrum by {{accounting for the}} contribution of each rotational and atomic line considered. The integrated intensity of each line is distributed in the spectrum by an approximate Voigt profile. The program can produce spectra for optically thin gases or for cases where simultaneous emission and absorption occurs. In addition, the program can compute the spectrum resulting from the absorption of incident radiation by a column of cold gas or the high-temperature, self-absorbed emission spectrum from a nonisothermal gas. The computed spectrum can be output directly or combined with a slit function and sensitivity calibration to predict the output of a grating spectrograph or a fixed wavelength radiometer. Specifically, the program has the capability to include the following features in any computations: (1) Parallel transitions, in which spin splitting and lambda doubling are ignored (ignoring spin splitting and/or lambda doubling means that the total multiple strength is assumed to reside in a single "effective" line), (2) Perpendicular transitions, in which spin splitting and lambda doubling are ignored, (3) Sigma Pi transitions, in which lambda doubling is ignored, (4) Atomic lines, (5) Option to terminate rotational line calculations when the molecule dissociates due to rotation, (6) Option to include the alternation of line intensities for homonuclear molecules, (7) Use of an approximate Voigt profile for the line shape, and (8) Radiative energy transport in a nonisothermal gas. The output options available in the program are: (1) Tabulation of the spontaneous emission spectrum (i. e., optically thin spectrum) for a 1. 0 cm path length, (2) Tabulation of the "true" spectrum, which incorporates spontaneous emission, induced emission, absorption, and externally incident radiation through the equation of radiative transfer, (3) Tabulation of the curve of growth for an arbitrary number of wavelength intervals, (4) Tabulation of the integrated intensity over an arbitrary number of wavelength intervals, and (5) Tabulation of the output signal produced by a radiometer or spectrometer by specifying an instrument calibration. The instrument slit function can be approximated by up to 99 straight line segments or by a Gaussian curve. The computation can be made at a fixed wavelength to simulate a radiometer or by scanning across any specified wavelength interval to simulate a <b>grating</b> <b>instrument.</b> In the latter case, the sensitivity can be varied {{as a function of}} wavelength to accurately simulate a grating-instrument calibration.

40|$|The {{isomerization}} of polyacetylene {{from the}} to the trans form has been monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and by magic angle 13 C {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (NMR). The importance of using thin films (< 10 µm) for determination of isomeric composition with <b>grating</b> IR <b>instruments</b> is emphasized. A method utilizing integrated intensities (areas) of the IR peaks at 740 and 1013 cm. - 1 was developed. NMR data was found to correlate with the FTIR data. The kinetics are not simple. In order to obtain activation energies the correct kinetic equations must be used; such equations will be described elsewhere. Trans units are generated randomly in the cis matrix (NMR evidence). The presence significant (∼ 7 %) residual cis content even at extended times and temperatures (FTIR evidence) is observed. These facts indicate an average trans sequence length of 15 double bonds or less...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{spectral}} astronomy or time resolved astronomy is {{the study}} of astrophysical phenomena that show spectral variability on very short timescales. These timescales are often too short to be resolved by current astronomical equipment. The lack of detailed observations in this area keeps important theoretical descriptions of astronomical events unclear or incomplete. To resolve this, instruments with very high spectral resolution and fast read-out speeds are needed. Photonic devices such as fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) offer potential advantages. The use of Bragg gratings in optical fibres allows for very high spectral resolution and the stability and precision needed for the observation of the fast variation of one particular spectral line, with the potential to observe multiple spectral lines at once. Here, we present the concept for a fibre Bragg <b>grating</b> based <b>instrument</b> specifically for temporal spectral astronomy and we discuss the different profiles of FBGs for such applications. © 2010 SPIE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
