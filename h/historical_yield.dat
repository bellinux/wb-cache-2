50|$|Factor models use a {{large sample}} of <b>historical</b> <b>yield</b> curve data and {{construct}} {{a set of}} basis functions that can be linearly combined to represent these curve movements in the most economical way. The algorithm always attributes {{as much of the}} curve movement to the first basis function, then as much as possible to the second, and so on. Since these functions roughly correspond to our shift and twist motions, this approach attributes almost all of the curve change to these two modes, leaving a very small contribution from higher modes. Typical results attribute 90% of curve movements to shift changes, 8% to twist, and 2% to curvature (or butterfly) movements. However, the issue that these basis functions may be different from those in which the risk decisions were expressed is not widely appreciated.|$|E
5000|$|Catastrophic crop {{insurance}} (CAT) is {{a component of}} the U.S. federal {{crop insurance}} program, originally authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. 103- 354). CAT coverage compensates farmers for crop yield losses exceeding 50% of their average <b>historical</b> <b>yield</b> at a payment rate of 55% of the projected season average market price. CAT coverage requires that a farmer realize a yield loss of more than 50% and only makes payments on losses exceeding the 50% threshold. Producers pay no premium for CAT coverage, but except for cases of financial hardship must pay an administrative fee of $300 per crop. A producer has the ability to purchase additional insurance coverage (or buy-up coverage) beyond CAT coverage, but must pay a premium, partially subsidized by the government.|$|E

Aquacrop model is a new crop model that developed by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), that is a model for simulation of crop yield based on “yield response to water“ with meteorological, crop, soli and management practices data as inputs. This model has to be calibrated and validated for each crop species and each location. In this paper, the Aquacrop has been calibrated and evaluated for rainfed wheat in Sisab station (Northern Khorasan).

To {{take into account the}} characteristics of the sugarcane crop management (15 -month cycle for a ratoon, accompanied with continuous harvest in Western Kenya), the temporal series of NDVI was normalized through an original weighting method that considered the growth period of the sugarcane crop (wNDVI), and correlated it with <b>historical</b> <b>yield</b> datasets. Results when using wNDVI were consistent with <b>historical</b> <b>yield</b> and significant at P-value = 0. 001, while results when using traditional annual NDVI integrated over the calendar year were not significant.

40|$|Current crop {{insurance}} rating procedures consider only {{performance for the}} individual crop in ques-tion. Recent farm legislation has given producers considerable planting flexibility and, as a result, many have shifted to new crops. Producers without a production history for the new crop may be of-fered levels of insurance that do not accurately reflect their expected yields. Likewise, premium rates may not reflect a producer’s actual risk for a new crop. We examine {{the extent to which}} information about expected yields may be gleaned from a consideration of historical performance on other crops. We also consider the extent to which yield performance exhibits learning by doing such that yields improve with experience. Though the results are mixed, we generally find that yield performance tends to improve with experience. However, when yields are conditioned on <b>historical</b> <b>yield</b> performance for other crops, the importance of experience is diminished significantly.

Net returns {{to land and}} management per acre for each of 13 production systems are calculated several different ways. Net returns are calculated using the 10 -year average yield for each crop, the average crop price from 2009, and 2009 input prices. A distribution of net returns is also calculated using the actual <b>historical</b> <b>yields</b> and crop prices from 1997 to 2006 and 2009 input prices. This process is repeated, except average crop prices from 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 are now used. Finally, net returns are calculated using simulated yield and price distributions based on actual <b>historical</b> <b>yields,</b> four <b>historical</b> monthly price series, and 2009 input costs. Overall, the reduced-tillage wheat-soybean systems (RTWS) have the greatest net returns {{for each of the}} net return distributions. No-tillage wheat-soybean (NTWS) generally has the second highest net returns. Stochastic Efficiency with Respect to a Function (SERF) is used to determine the preferred management strategies under various risk preferences. SERF analysis indicates that RTWS is the system most preferred by all producers, regardless of their level of risk aversion. NTWS is typically the second most preferred system to RTWS. Using historical annual prices for 1997 to 2006 and the simulated monthly prices series for 2006 to 2009 and 2007 to 2009 to calculate the net return distributions, managers with higher levels of risk aversion prefer reduced-tillage wheat-grain sorghum (RTWG) over no-tillage wheat-soybean (NTWS). Sensitivity analysis shows that as the price of glyphosate falls, no-till systems become relatively more profitable. SERF analysis using the historic yields, 2006 to 2009 simulated monthly prices, and 2009 input costs with reduced glyphosate prices indicate that NTWS would be the system most preferred by producers at all levels of risk aversion.

Ensembles from a crop model and climate projections form part of the dual ensemble methodology to assess climate change impacts on sugarcane productivity for three major sugarcane-growing regions in Australia—Burdekin, Mackay and New South Wales (NSW). Different parameterisations of a crop model injected with climate outputs from eleven statistically downscaled general circulation models (GCM) were used to estimate regionally averaged sugarcane yields for the base period 1971 to 2000. The forward stagewise algorithm selected crop model parameterisations that best explained the observed yields. Leave-one-out cross validation assessed the predictive capability of the equally weighted crop ensemble members characterised by the selected crop model parameterizations. A Monte Carlo permutation testing procedure was employed to measure the significance of the predictive correlations. The predictive correlations between <b>historical</b> <b>yields</b> and simulated <b>historical</b> <b>yields</b> for the Burdekin, Mackay and NSW were 0. 69 (p= 0. 030), 0. 83 (p< 0. 001) and 0. 70 (p= 0. 034), respectively. Simulations were run based on GCM projections for 2046 to 2065 for a low (B 1) and a high (A 2) emission scenario, with and without elevated CO 2 levels. We found it was plausible for industry to consider an increase in yields to all three regions under the B 1 scenario and highly plausible for NSW under the A 2 scenario. Higher CO 2 levels resulted in lower demand of water for the crop, particularly in the Burdekin region and suggested that industry could expand into regions currently considered as marginal owing to the benefits of increased transpiration efficiency that are associated with increased CO 2.
