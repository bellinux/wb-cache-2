25|$|Modern {{video games}} {{frequently}} include aspects of parkour as major game-play elements. The Assassin's Creed series makes heavy use of parkour movement (called <b>freerunning</b> in the game). The Mirror's Edge games are heavily inspired by parkour, consisting entirely of efficiently moving around buildings, rooftops, and other obstacles. Brink introduced a parkour mechanic into a realistic first person shooter. Prince of Persia and Dying Light include a central parkour mechanic, while Crackdown and Crackdown 2 include {{an emphasis on}} gripping and vaulting from ledges and protruding objects. Tony Hawk's American Wasteland allows the character to use several <b>freerunning</b> techniques while not on the skateboard. Tron Evolutions basic movements and combat were based on parkour and capoeira.|$|E
25|$|MTV's show Ultimate Parkour Challenge premiered as {{a one-hour}} special in October 2009 {{starring}} the athletes of the World <b>Freerunning</b> & Parkour Federation. This was followed in May 2010 with a six-episode {{series of the}} same name. The athletes were Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff, Ryan Doyle, Michael Turner, Oleg Vorslav, Ben Jenkin, Daniel Arroyo, Pip Andersen and King David. The programme format was a two-part weekly competition in different Southern California locations.|$|E
25|$|Parkour is {{not defined}} {{by a set of}} rules or guidelines, which has been {{particularly}} attractive to young people, allowing them to explore and engage in the activity on their own terms. It can be easily accepted by all cultures as a means of personal expression and recreation. For example, in 2010 The New York Times published a short video featuring three young men from the Gaza Strip who were active members of the parkour community. In 2014, the BBC covered youth parkour participation in Jammu and Kashmir. Zahid Shah founded the Kashmir <b>Freerunning</b> and Parkour Federation, finding hope in the non-violent discipline of parkour.|$|E

2500|$|The {{remaining}} seven Yamakasi members {{continued to}} use the term [...] "l'art du déplacement, also not wanting to associate it too closely with parkour. Similar to Sébastien's <b>freerunning,</b> l'art du déplacement was less about the hard discipline from the original Yamakasi group, more a participatory approach focused on making the teaching more accessible. David Belle kept the term [...] "parkour", saying the group contributed to the development of it, but that his father was the source of his motivation, who had verbally communicated this method only to him.|$|E
2500|$|Because parkour {{philosophy}} is about learning to control oneself in {{interaction with the}} environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and <b>Freerunning</b> Federation, said [...] "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you {{a higher risk of}} doing just that. Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task." [...] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Parkour {{is practiced}} without {{equipment}} of any kind. Practitioners normally train wearing light, non-restrictive casual clothing. Traceurs who wear gloves are rare—bare hands are considered better for grip and tactile feedback. Light running shoes with good grip and flexibility are encouraged. Practitioners often use minimalist shoes, sometimes as a progression to bare feet, for better sensitivity and balance, while others prefer more cushioning for better absorption of impacts from large jumps. Barefoot training {{is done by}} some for movement competency without gear—as David Belle noted, [...] "bare feet are the best shoes." [...] Various sneaker manufacturers have developed shoes specifically for parkour and <b>freerunning.</b> Many other companies {{around the world have}} started offering clothing targeted at parkour.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} the name free running was {{an idea of}} a person called Guillaume Pelletier who worked with us {{at the time of}} Jump London. Because some people think what I'm doing is not Parkour now I call it [...] "freerunning." [...] Because there is a misunderstanding and people put a definition on what I'm doing! I create <b>freerunning</b> and I'll put my official definition. What is <b>Freerunning?</b> Everything I'll say it's no more Parkour, it's <b>freerunning!</b> <b>Freerunning</b> it's a lifestyle and an attitude. <b>Freerunning</b> is to see your environment differently and being able to utilize it to develop yourself! My Parkour lifestyle is <b>Freerunning.</b> My way has no name. <b>Freerunning</b> is the name people have given to my way! [...] "Freerunning is following your own way, and this is my way." ...|$|E

5000|$|Foucan {{explains}} freerunning: <b>Freerunning,</b> for me, is my Parkour evolution. I can't say {{any more}} that I do Parkour, because if I {{want to be}} free to do flips, or let's say I'm learning breakdancing, and I would like to incorporate it into my Parkour expression...Not to say I am doing capoeira, breakdancing, Parkour and anything else. <b>Freerunning</b> is the way I choose to name my own expression. Now people recognize Parkour with flips (acrobatics) as <b>freerunning.</b> But only the action of doing Parkour and flips is not <b>freerunning.</b> It's the action of adding more stuff into your expression. That's the <b>Freerunning</b> attitude.|$|E

5000|$|Foucan {{was born}} in Paris, of Guadeloupean descent. He {{is the founder of}} <b>freerunning</b> and {{considered}} an early developer of parkour. Known for his views on the philosophy of Parkour and <b>freerunning,</b> Foucan stresses the need for training in the basics of both for individual safety and to maintain a positive public perception of the activities. As creator of <b>freerunning,</b> Foucan has stipulated its values: ...|$|E
50|$|He defines <b>Freerunning</b> as a {{discipline}} for self-development, following one's own way. Foucan's dissatisfaction with Parkour's limited creativity and self-expression motivated him to develop a similar art of movement which became known as <b>freerunning.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The central {{principle}} of <b>freerunning</b> {{is that one}} should express oneself by moving fluidly in one's environment; there are no limitations on the form of this movement. [...] Foucan expands {{on a number of}} basic principles of the sport in his book, <b>Freerunning.</b> [...] Other practitioners have suggested other principles. For example, Daniel Ilabaca encourages people to think positively, suggesting that practitioners of <b>freerunning</b> will sometimes fall—largely because they think they might.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{people in}} the {{worldwide}} parkour community also accused UF of distorting the image of parkour, associating it with the flips and artistic movements of <b>freerunning</b> and tricking. Because of this, in 2006 many UF team members walked out. Some critics have even {{gone as far as}} making public demonstrations against Urban Freeflow, such as burning UF memorabilia.Furthermore, Urban Freeflow was criticized for organizing <b>freerunning</b> competitions sponsored by Barclaycard. The critics believed that <b>freerunning,</b> like parkour, should be a non-competitive activity. There are also complaints of the corporate nature of the event, many <b>freerunning</b> sites saying that the introduction of merchandising and sponsorships would compromise {{the true nature of the}} sport. To this one of the founders of Urban Freeflow, Ez has replied [...] "The people who are saying this are the ones who don't have any sponsorship,". However many people practicing parkour and <b>freerunning</b> believe that they are [...] "free" [...] disciplines and they don't belong to corporations, sponsors and medias.Sébastien Foucan has since commented on the matter, that free running is about following your 'own way,' and though he himself does not personally believe in competition, others might believe that to be their 'way.' ...|$|E

Foucan started what he termed [...] "freerunning" [...] in 2003, which he developed as a more inclusive form of parkour. [...] Parkour's development from military obstacle course training lends itself to martial art as a means of weapons avoidance and efficiently closing a distance to an opponent. <b>Freerunning</b> is a version of parkour that adds acrobatic moves that are purely aesthetic, also known as tricking.|$|E
