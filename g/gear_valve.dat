50|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} the T7 and E10 {{locomotives}} was the <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The <b>valves</b> for the inside cylinders were operated by Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> and the <b>valves</b> for the outside cylinders were operated by Joy <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R

50|$|Five {{of these}} {{locomotives}} were delivered with Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The last engine, no. 879, was built with Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> for experimental purposes.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in {{the location of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> In British practice, inside <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> is usually of the Stephenson type while outside <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> is usually of the Walschaerts type. However, this is not a rigid rule and most types of <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> are capable of being used either inside or outside. Joy <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> was once popular, e.g. on the LNWR G Class.|$|R

50|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of these engines was {{their use of}} external <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> Using external cylinders, <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> and Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> rather than Stephenson link were all features of the same post-war trends that also appeared in the BR Standard classes, but they were largely alien to traditional industrial saddle tanks.|$|R
50|$|The first {{thirteen}} Class 19B locomotives {{were delivered}} with Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> but like Class 16DA no. 879 {{of the same}} year, no. 1414 was equipped with Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> as an experiment. In January 1943, after thirteen years in service, the Caprotti rotary cam poppet <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> was removed at the Uitenhage workshops and replaced with Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The experiment did result in the successor Class 19C being built with rotary cam poppet <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 1926, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway {{equipped}} four-cylinder 4-6-0 locomotive no. 5908 of the Claughton Class with Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> and poppet <b>valves.</b> Following trials, {{nine more}} were rebuilt in 1928 with Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> poppet <b>valves</b> and larger boilers, {{and also in}} 1928 ten others of the same class were given the larger boiler but retained the Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> and piston <b>valves</b> with which this class was originally fitted, to enable comparisons to be made between {{the two types of}} <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> Later that year, no. 5908 was also given a larger boiler. It was found that the Caprotti-fitted locomotives were more economical on coal and water than those with Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> but it was later found that some of the losses of the Walschaerts locomotives was due to leakage of steam past the valve heads, where a single wide ring was used. New piston valves having several narrow rings were fitted to one locomotive, and it was then found that the Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> could be just as economical as the Caprotti, but with considerably less cost of fitment. No more Claughtons were fitted with Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> and the ten locomotives were withdrawn in 1935-36.|$|R

25|$|The Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> {{was slow}} to gain popularity. The Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> {{remained}} {{the most commonly used}} <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> on 19th-century locomotives. However, the Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> had the advantage that it could be mounted entirely {{on the outside of the}} locomotives, leaving the space between the frames clear; which resulted in it being adopted in some articulated locomotives.|$|R

50|$|In 1921 {{locomotive}} 740.324 {{became the}} first FS locomotive to be fitted experimentally with Caprotti valve gear; the results were satisfactory, and locomotives 740.440-740.445 were modified during construction with the new <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> and were classified in the separate Class 741, to be renumbered in 1930 as 740.691-697. An improved <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> was fitted in 1932 to 740.352, which was renumbered 740.852; the <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> was replaced by standard Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> in 1955, and the remaining locomotives with Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> (which, although more efficient, required more refined maintenance) were withdrawn by the 1960s.|$|R

50|$|In 1931 five engines, 13118, 13122, 13124, 13125 and 13129 were {{fitted with}} Lentz <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> They were renumbered as 42818, 42822, 42824, 42825 and 42829 after nationalisation. In 1953 the Lentz <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> on these engines was {{replaced}} with Reidinger <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bagnall-Price <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> {{is a type}} {{of steam}} engine <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> {{developed}} at locomotive manufacturer W.G.

50|$|Large {{stationary}} engines {{often used}} an advanced form of <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> developed by George Henry Corliss, usually called Corliss <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> This <b>gear</b> used separate <b>valves</b> for inlet and exhaust {{so that the}} inlet cut-off could be controlled precisely.

50|$|The usual {{locomotive}} <b>valve</b> <b>gears</b> such as Stephenson, Walschaerts, and Baker <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> can be {{used with}} either slide valves or piston valves.

50|$|Following a {{high-speed}} incident that caused severe damage to its frame and cylinders, No. 1090 was rebuilt with 3 simple expansion cylinders in 1908, as a {{comparison to the}} GCR Classes 8D and 8E. These cylinders had their Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> replaced with Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> which was the only application of this <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> excluding railcars, on a GCR locomotive. The experiment was reverted in 1922 when No. 1090 was rebuilt, with the original 2 cylinders and Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> being refitted.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} used Murdoch's D unbalanced slide valves, arranged horizontally {{above the}} cylinders outside the plate frames and actuated by Heusinger <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> These <b>valves</b> caused considerable wear on motion pins and were later replaced by Trick ported balanced slide valves.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the free}} running that was {{achieved}} with the Classes 15E, 16E and 19C which all entered service in 1935 and were all equipped with rotary cam poppet <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> Watson decided to adopt this type of <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> for all his future designs. Most <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> components of the Class 15E were interchangeable with similar parts of the Class 16E. Like the other classes with poppet <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> the Class 15E was fast, but some trouble was initially experienced with the <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> in the reverse position. This was corrected by modifying the reversing cams and these, {{as well as new}} forward cams, were manufactured at the Salt River shops in Cape Town.|$|R
