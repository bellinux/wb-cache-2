40|$|Tuba is a multidomain {{scaffolding}} {{protein that}} links cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking pathways. <b>The</b> N-terminus <b>of</b> Tuba binds dynamin 1, and the C-terminus contains domains that can interact with signaling pathways and cytoskeletal regulatory elements. We investigated Tuba localization, distribution and function in B 16 melanoma cells. Tuba overexpression stimulated dorsal ruffles that occurred independently of dynamin function. Tuba expression induced actin-driven motility of small puncta {{that required the}} C-terminal SH 3, GEF and BAR domains. Additionally, Tuba was recruited to lipid vesicles generated by overexpression of phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate 5 -kinase type I{alpha} (PIP 5 K{alpha}), localizing prominently to <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> and at lower levels along the actin tail. We propose that Tuba facilitates dorsal ruffling of melanoma cells through direct interaction with actin-regulatory proteins and <b>the</b> recruitment <b>of</b> signaling molecules to lipid microdomains for <b>the</b> coordinated assembly <b>of</b> a cytoskeletal network. Knockdown of Tuba by RNA interference (RNAi) attenuated PIP 5 K{alpha}-generated <b>comet</b> formation and <b>the</b> invasive behavior <b>of</b> B 16 cells, implying that Tuba function is required for certain aspects of these processes.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the presence and extent of the atomic sodium observed in comet Hale-Bopp raises {{a number of questions}} related to the production, motion, and lifetime of these Na atoms under the action of the solar radiation near 1 AU. Here we report on data which pertain to the study of sodium in the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet,</b> yielding information on the Na emission in the coma out to ~ 0. 15 x 10 (6) km on the sunward side, to ~ 0. 2 x 10 (6) km tailwards. The observations were carried out at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, with the 1. 93 m telescope and the ELODIE spectrometer, which is fed by a pair of optical fibers with 2 -arcsec apertures separated by 1. 8 arcmin. In particular, spectra were obtained on 15 - 17 April, 1997, near the discovery date of the sodium tail at the La Palma Observatory. These spectra (resolution ~ 7 km/s) were used to determine Na D line profiles, as well as the relative intensities of the emissions corresponding to the two positions observed simultaneously. The main outcome of our first analysis concerns the profiles recorded some distance away from the optical centre, which all show velocity shifts and asymmetric line broadening in the direction of anti-sunward velocities. Some evidence is found to suggest the existence of an extended or multi-source production of sodium atoms, at least in the coma. Another series of spectra secured just before perihelion, 25 - 27 March, was analysed {{in the same way as}} the April spectra. Comparison between the two sets of data provides a nice illustration of the marked influence of the heliocentric radial velocity, not only upon the strength of the fluorescence ("Swings effect"), but also upon the motion of the emitting atoms, which are accelerated by the radiation pressure to widely different degrees as their excitation wavelengths fall at different places within the Fraunhofer Na D line profiles...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} water vapor production and distribution in comet P/Halley, based upon interpretation of observational data obtained during the recent 1985 - 86 apparition. The data was acquired using the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory charge-coupled device (CCD) on the 154 -cm Catalina telescope of the University of Arizona Observatories. Our data acquisition system was employed in two modes. The long-slit (∼ 200 ") spectroscopy mode covered the wavelength range 5200 - 10400 Å at a spectral resolution ∼ 14 Å. The narrow band filter imaging mode allowed two-dimensional mapping of selected cometary emission features, {{as well as the}} continuum, with a field of view of roughly 10 arc-min. Both neutral and ionized (H₂O⁺) water species were studied, with emphasis on the ion distribution. This involved comparing long-slit spatial profiles obtained ∼UT 1986 March 05. 5, as well as cuts across filter images (∼ March 06. 5) centered on the H₂O⁺ 0, 8, 0 -band emission, with the Vega- 1 spacecraft in situ ion density measurements (∼ March 06. 3). Our March 05 spectroscopic data revealed a central dip, of order 30 % relative to the profile peak, in H₂O⁺ column density in the inner coma (inside ∼ 2 x 10 ⁴ km from the nucleus), which filled in farther tailward. Similarly the BD - 3 plasma detector aboard Vega- 1 measured a decrease in local ion density, of roughly 60 % at the closest approach distance (∼ 9000 km sunward of the nucleus), relative to the inbound maximum density at R ≃ 12000 km from the nucleus. These results suggest a bimodal flow of ions out of the coma and/or an extended region over which the H₂ 0 molecules were being ionized. Our imaging data showed that, while the falloff in ion density was relatively rapid sunward of the nucleus, it was much more gradual in the anti-solar direction. This is due to the solar wind sweeping ions from the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> into the plasma tail, whose width was of order 10 ⁵ km in the inner coma, diverging slowly and breaking up into a ray pattern farther tailward. The distribution of neutral water was mapped out using the [O I] λ 6300 emission as diagnostic probe. In contrast to the ions, the H₂ 0 molecules were mainly confined to the inner few x 10 ⁴ km of the coma, and exhibited a much more symmetrical distribution. Integration of the [O I] slit profiles, assuming azimuthal symmetry, allowed calculation of the H₂ 0 production rate, which ranged from ∼ 10 ²⁸ molecules s⁻¹, when Halley was at a distance r≳ 2 AU from the sun, to a value of ∼ 1. 5 x 10 ³⁰ molecules s⁻¹ for 1986 March 05 (r ≃ 0. 78 AU). Using the latter production rate, and assuming a 100 / 1 production ratio of H₂ 0 / H₂O⁺, a spatially-averaged, tailward flow speed of ions out of the inner coma, ≃ 16 km s⁻¹, was derived by integrating our March 05 H₂O⁺ profile, for which the slit was oriented across the coma, just tailward of the nucleus...|$|E

50|$|In 1574 Taqi ad-Din {{proposed}} the new observatory to Sultan Murad III who, having {{an interest in}} astronomy, provided the financing for a new observatory {{to be built in}} Istanbul.

A few months after opening, on <b>the</b> first day <b>of</b> Ramadan, a <b>comet</b> appeared in <b>the</b> night sky. This was unfortunate timing as the current Sultan was about to march on Persia and his fathers death had been heralded by a comet. It sat in the night sky for 40 nights growing slowly brighter.

Taqi noted that both <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> seemed to be pointing in the direction on Persia indicating that {{it was more of a}} bad omen for them and not for the Ottoman Empire.

40|$|Alzheimer’s {{disease is}} {{the most common cause of}} late-life {{dementia}} and the fourth leading cause <b>of</b> death in <b>the</b> developed world. <b>The</b> aetiology <b>of</b> AD has not yet been resolved. It has been suggested that AD could result from multifactorial process involving both a genetic predisposition and an exposure to environmental factors modulated by the biological aging process. To date, epidemiological and molecular genetic data have led to <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> three genes, amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS 1) and presenilin 2 (PS 2) genes, which, when mutated, can cause an early onset form of AD. Genetic linkage studies and association studies have also shown that the ε 4 allele <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apolipoprotein E gene increases risk for AD in a dose dependent manner in both early onset and late onset AD. Recently, it has also been suggested that environmental factors may interact with a genetic predisposition to modify <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> AD. Extensive research is underway to identify environmental and genetic risk factors for this complex disease. Over 40 genes have been tested as AD candidates yet none has been clearly established as an AD risk factor. Currently scientists are investigating the interrelationship between various gene loci and how environmental factors could affect an individual’s susceptibility to AD. This study evaluated <b>the</b> genotoxicity <b>of</b> environmental agents such as hydrogen peroxide, cadmium chloride and γ radiation induced oxidative DNA damage in lymphocytes and within specific DNA sequences of APP (exon 15 - 18) and PS 1 (exon 3 - 12) genes of AD patients and age-matched control subjects. As indicators of oxidative DNA damage, <b>the</b> frequencies <b>of</b> DNA strand breaks, oxidized pyrimidines and altered purines was assessed using <b>the</b> alkaline <b>Comet</b> assay modified with lesion-specific endonucleases, endo-III and fpg; and fluorescence in situ hybridisation. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> APP and PS 1 hybridisation spots per comet were used as an indicator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> damage. <b>The</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hybridisation spots in <b>the</b> <b>head</b> or tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> were recorded to further determine whether <b>the</b> gene <b>of</b> interest lies within or in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> a damaged region <b>of</b> DNA. With <b>the</b> alkaline <b>Comet</b> assay modified with endo-III and fpg, it was demonstrated that patients with AD had significantly increased levels of DNA strand breaks, oxidized pyrimidines and altered purines induced by hydrogen peroxide, cadmium chloride and γ radiation compared with control subjects (p< 0. 05). This was further confirmed by the fluorescence in situ hybridisation modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alkaline <b>Comet</b> assay by demonstrating a significant increase in <b>the</b> mean number <b>of</b> APP and PS 1 gene hybridisation spots per comet in AD patients compared with control subjects. Moreover, the gene sensitivity index of APP and PS 1 to hydrogen peroxide, cadmium chloride and γ radiation were found to be higher in AD patients than in control subjects. Taken together, our results suggest (i) that lymphocytes from patients with AD are sensitive to these environmental genotoxic agents and (ii) there was an overall increase in the mean number and sensitivity index of APP and PS 1 genes to environmental genotoxic agents which might link a genetic cause to oxidative stress in peripheral cells of AD patients than in control subjects. Although the mechanisms by which these environmental agents induced oxidative DNA damage remained to be elucidated, our data suggest that increased oxidative stress is an inherent property of cells carrying genes associated with AD.

50|$|<b>The</b> reason <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet's</b> {{brightness}} in SWAN remains unknown, {{though it}} is thought that <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> experienced an outburst a few days before discovery which rendered it much brighter than it was otherwise.

As a result, only higher-than-average-velocity meteoroid dust, ejected earlier in <b>the</b> approach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet,</b> allow for impacts on Mars, its moons, and orbiting spacecraft. Dust particles ejected from <b>the</b> nucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet,</b> at {{more than double the}} expected velocity when <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> was 3 AU from the Sun, could reach Mars approximately 43 to 130 min after <b>the</b> closest approach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>comet.</b> There is a possibility for millimeter- to centimeter-size particles released more than 13 AU from the Sun, however, this is considered unlikely, although massive ejections from farther out have been deduced.|$|R
