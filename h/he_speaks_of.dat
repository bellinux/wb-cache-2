He is present when staff is named and an uprising is planned. After the uprising is defeated, Bouckman is killed at the same location as Macandal is burned alive.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to this is where <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5|$|After {{thinking}} {{a bit more}} about Emile and deciding she has become attracted {{on the basis of}} little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him ("I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"). When he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, however, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings ("I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy").|$|E

But now she yearned to have him [...] "propose," [...] in the most stupid, conventional, pink-romance fashion. [...] "Why can't we be married?" [...] she fancied herself saying to him, but she never dared say it aloud.|$|R

25|$|The {{dry white}} wine is a wine without sugar (the sugar ratio is {{generally}} less than 4 grams per litre).

25|$|Around 1830, Newman {{developed}} {{a distinction between}} natural religion and revealed religion. Revealed religion is the Judeo-Christian revelation which finds its fulfilment in Jesus Christ. Natural religion refers to the knowledge of God and divine things that has been acquired outside the Judeo-Christian revelation. For Newman, this knowledge of God is {{not the result of}} unaided reason but of reason aided by grace, and so <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> natural religion as containing a revelation, even though it is an incomplete revelation.|$|E
25|$|Written in a lucid vernacular language, Luo's {{texts are}} characterised by an egalitarian tone, erasing {{differences}} between lay and clergy, {{upper and lower}} classes, and men and women. Drawing on his own experience as an orphan, Luo describes the human condition of being lost and in search of one's true home and refuge. <b>He</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the final destination that is the absolute principle of being, variously representing it through abstract symbols. An experience {{similar to that of}} Luo {{can be found in the}} biography of Lin Zhao'en, the founder of the Sanyi teaching.|$|E
25|$|In the Glossolalia {{he states}} that shamanism is not a fixed belief-system. The Southwark Mysteries {{explicitly}} honour the poetic “Spirit” above “the letter of the law”, art over religion, “Liberty” as a spiritual state in which contrary energies find creative expression. His essay Transgressive Shamanism considers how the West has appropriated the practices of indigenous shamans, especially relating {{to the use of}} psychoactive sacraments. It charts the transgressive use of such substances by artists, suggesting alternative “lines of transmission” in art. His Shamanic Playhouse workshops explore other ways of effecting altered mind-states. <b>He</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> “repatterning reality” and of the associations of the number 23 with “revelation and transformation”.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> a Theophilus who was {{bishop in}} the 10th year of Commodus (c. 189), of a Theoctistus (216–258), a {{short-lived}} Domnus and a Theotecnus, and an Agapius (?–306). Among {{the participants in}} the Synod of Ancyra in 314 was a bishop of Caesarea named Agricolaus, who may have been the immediate predecessor of Eusebius, who does not mention him, or who may have been bishop of a different Caesarea. The immediate successors of Eusebius were Acacius (340–366) and Gelasius of Caesarea (367–372, 380–395). The latter was ousted by the semi-Arian Euzoius between 373 and 379. Lequien gives much information about all of these and about later bishops of Caesarea.|$|E
25|$|Necessarily {{much of the}} {{information}} in this large compilation varies in value. The Panarion reflects the character of Epiphanius and his method of working. Sometimes, his intense passion prevents him from inquiring carefully into the doctrines he opposes. Thus, on his own avowal (Haer., lxxi), <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> Apollinarianism on hearsay. At Constantinople, he had to acknowledge to the Origenist monks, whom he opposed, that he was not acquainted with either their school or their books, and that he only spoke from hearsay (Sozomen, Hist. eccl., VIII, xl). There is, however, much information not found elsewhere. Chapters devoted only to the doctrinal refutation of heresies are rare. As an apologist, Epiphanius appeared generally weak to Photius.|$|E
25|$|Myshkin {{makes the}} {{acquaintance}} of Lizaveta Prokovyevna {{and her three}} daughters—Alexandra, Adelaida and Aglaya, the last being the youngest and the most beautiful. They are all very curious about him and not shy about expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E

25|$|There is {{controversy}} in the academic world though as to who is really {{the topic of the}} machinations of the Gallo-Romano Aristocracy after the death of Avitus who was of Gallic origin and from amongst their own ranks. Many scholars old and new have either read the name of the event Marcellini, Marcelliniana instead of Marcellana. This does not make much sense to place Marcellinus as the person in question for this action of the Gallic aristocracy since he is not Gallic and most likely comes from a wealthy Dalmatian family. The assumption to place Marcellinus as the person being spoken of has only led others to assume then that he is Gallic in origin when there is absolutely no evidence to support this. Mathisen has shown that Marcellinus cannot be the person in question and that Apollinaris Sidonius was speaking of a Marcellus, who was a Gallic aristocrat. He demonstrates why Marcellinus cannot logically be the person in question by comparing other names written by the same author and showing that Sidonius using the same style in writing the names thus giving the support it is Marcellus not Marcellinus <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{this subject}} the king's prejudices were insurmountable, and his ministers had the {{weakness}} {{to give way}} to them. It was impossible to defend a system which confined the suffrage to 200,000 citizens and returned a chamber of whom half were placemen. Nothing would have been easier than to strengthen the conservative party by attaching the suffrage to the possession of land in France, but blank resistance was the sole answer of the government to the moderate demands of the opposition. Warning after warning was addressed to them in vain by friends and by foes alike, and they remained profoundly unconscious of their danger till the moment when it overwhelmed them. Strange to say, Guizot never acknowledged either at the time or to his dying day the nature of this error, and <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> himself in his memoirs as the much-enduring champion of liberal government and constitutional law. He utterly failed to perceive that a more enlarged view of the liberal destinies of France and a less intense confidence in his own specific theory might have preserved the constitutional monarchy and averted a vast series of calamities, which were in the end fatal to every principle he most cherished. But with the stubborn conviction of absolute truth he dauntlessly adhered to his own doctrines to the end.|$|E
500|$|U2's 1987 song [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] from The Joshua Tree was {{inspired}} after lead vocalist Bono visited El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War and witnessed how {{the conflict between}} rebels and the U.S.-backed government affected local civilians. During a spoken word passage of the song, <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> being approached by a man, [...] "his face red like a rose on a thorn bush, like all the colors of a royal flush, and he's peeling off those dollar bills, slapping them down, 100, 200". Bono said the person {{he had in mind}} while writing these lyrics was Reagan, whose administration backed the military regimes in Central and South America that Bono encountered on his trip.|$|E

500|$|Michael Rosen, {{a novelist}} and poet, {{advocated}} {{the books were}} not suited for children, who {{would be unable to}} grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that [...] "J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer." [...] The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards. His overall view of the series was negative – [...] "the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain", and <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> [...] "a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style". Ursula K. Le Guin said, [...] "I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying on about the 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it {{to find out what the}} fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a [...] "school novel", good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited." ...|$|E
500|$|Pickett's {{official}} {{report to}} Taylor was signed [...] "G.E. Pickett, Major-Gen., Commd'g." [...] This is the April 11 report mentioned by Freeman above. Thus in Pickett's official report to Taylor <b>he</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> commanding his men and interacting with his superior officer {{right up until}} the surrender at Appomattox. Taylor attempted to explain the apparent contradiction by telling Fitzhugh Lee that he addressed his request in the manner he did because Pickett was not dismissed from the Army, and for the period in question, Pickett was initially in command. This explanation, however, leaves unanswered the question of how Taylor expected Pickett to answer for the period of time Pickett purportedly was not in command. The explanation does not explain Pickett's report which covered the entire period, nor the fact that Pickett signed the report as the acting commander, nor did it explain Longstreet's interactions with Pickett over this period of time. Furthermore, there is no record of Taylor requesting reports from any other officers dismissed from the service on the movements of their former troops, nor of his referring to such officers in a manner which would connote active command.|$|E

Benbow left the Navy and entered the merchant service, sailing a merchant vessel from London and Bristol to ports in Italy and Spain.

In May 1687 he commanded a merchant vessel, the Malaga Merchant, and was aboard {{her when she was}} attacked by a Salé pirate. He mounted a successful defence and beat off the attack. It was claimed afterwards that he cut off and salted the heads of thirteen Moors who were slain aboard his ship, and then took them into Cadiz to claim a reward from the magistrates.
