5|$|Nevertheless, the new {{values were}} still {{higher than the}} levels that Vespasian and Titus had {{maintained}} during their reigns. Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years.

Its façade is built with large limestone blocks and <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> two-register relief decoration illustrating a drunken revelry in honor of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. Among the temple reliefs, one shows a man attempting to seize a large rooster which was the common sacrificial animal for Eshmun-Asclepius.|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{reveal that}} young Dutch {{children}} <b>display</b> <b>a</b> [t]-bias {{in the middle}} of words in pronunciation (e. g. van der Feest 2007; Kerkhoff 2007). First graders, however, <b>display</b> <b>a</b> -bias {{in the middle of}} words in their writings (Neijt & Schreuder 2007). The present study investigates children’s spelling and pronunciation of word medial d and t to examine this apparent contrast. It turned out that first graders started with a -bias in their spellings while later on they <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> -bias. A similar development was found for pronunciation: Kindergartners <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> [t]-bias, while second graders <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> [d]-bias instead. Our explanation is that this change is caused by overgeneralization, due to differences between Dutch pronunciation and orthography. We conclude that the orthographic system, although learned later in life, affects children’s earlier acquired pronunciation...|$|R
50|$|Outside {{of weekly}} worship services, many small gatherings of Unitarian Universalists {{incorporate}} a lit chalice, {{often accompanied by}} readings, {{as a reminder of}} the religious nature of the gathering. Unitarian Universalists, Unitarians and Universalists might also <b>display</b> <b>a</b> flaming chalice on clothing, jewelry, their cars, or in their homes as a symbol of their faith, much as Christians <b>display</b> <b>a</b> cross or as Jews <b>display</b> <b>a</b> Star of David.|$|R

5|$|The {{constitution}} of the AFM blends {{at the national level}} the elements of a presbyterian polity with an episcopal polity. Decentralization is a major feature of its constitution, which allows local churches to develop their own policies.

50|$|Additionally, {{other presidents}} never <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> {{tree in the}} White House. First U.S. President George Washington held office {{at a time when}} there was no White House, thus it is {{impossible}} for him to have <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> tree there. There is no evidence that Abraham Lincoln ever <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> Christmas tree in the White House. In 1922 First Lady Florence Harding's illness led to a more subdued Christmas celebration at the White House and no Christmas tree.|$|R

The Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome also <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> related Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of partially competitive inhibition {{is similar to}} that of non-competitive, except that the EIS complex has catalytic activity, which may be lower or even higher (partially competitive activation) than that of the enzyme–substrate (ES) complex.

The ship's bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, was added to the memorial in St Magnus'. A number of bodies, including some that could not be identified, were interred at the naval cemetery in Lyness.|$|E

5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} seen as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest Dog in the World.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the main}} scoreboard, the {{ballpark}} has three more LED <b>displays.</b> <b>A</b> display in the left-center field wall is used for showing player introductions, in-game pitching statistics, upcoming batters, and advertisements. LED ribbon boards are installed on the facings of {{each side of the}} upper deck; these are used to display the inning, score, count, player introductions, and advertisements. The stadium's three pitch clocks—part of professional baseball's pace-of-game initiatives implemented in Triple-A and Double-A baseball games in 2015— are located on the straightaway center field wall and {{on each side of the}} backstop.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the male moults its brown {{feathers}} and <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> fiery red plumage.

It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in {{what appears to be}} a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male in an act of apparent aggression.|$|E
