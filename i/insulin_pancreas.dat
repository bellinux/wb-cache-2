30|$|The exact {{relationship}} between ZnT 8 activity and diabetes risk, however, remains controversial. Zn ions have several {{effects on the}} regulation of insulin production and clearance. Co-secretion of Zn ions with insulin from beta cells inhibits insulin production in an autocrine and paracrine fashion through the K-ATP channel (Bancila et al., 2005; Prost et al., 2004). Beta cell-secreted Zn ions also regulate hepatic clearance of insulin. A recent study showed that beta-cell specific deficiency of ZnT 8 results in low peripheral insulin level but hypersecretion of <b>insulin</b> from <b>pancreas</b> (Tamaki et al., 2013). Further, ZnT 8 deficient mice and humans with the Trp 325 Arg ZnT 8 variant exhibit increased insulin clearance. This in turn stimulates the secretion of <b>insulin</b> by <b>pancreas</b> and increases susceptibility to developing type II diabetes (Tamaki et al., 2013).|$|R

50|$|Tolbutamide is a first-generation {{potassium}} channel blocker, sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic medication. This drug {{may be used}} in the management of type 2 diabetes if diet alone is not effective. Tolbutamide stimulates the secretion of <b>insulin</b> by the <b>pancreas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Acetohexamide lowers {{blood sugar}} by {{stimulating}} the <b>pancreas</b> to secrete <b>insulin</b> {{and helping the}} body use <b>insulin</b> efficiently. The <b>pancreas</b> must produce <b>insulin</b> for this medication to work. For this reason, acetohexamide is not used to treat diabetes mellitus type 1.|$|R
50|$|When liver {{cells and}} other cells that remove glucose {{from the blood}} become less {{sensitive}} (more resistant) to the <b>insulin,</b> the <b>pancreas</b> increases secretion {{and the level of}} insulin in the blood rises. This increased secretion can compensate for reduced sensitivity for many years, with maintenance of normal glucose levels. However, if insulin resistance worsens or insulin secretion ability declines, the glucose levels will begin to rise. Persistent elevation of glucose levels is termed diabetes mellitus.|$|R

Combined Pancreas-kidney transplantation is usually performed, but the value of pancreas after kidney transplant recently increased dramatically. Novel surgical techniques together with very effective immunosuppression (e. g.

50|$|Pulsatile {{intravenous}} insulin therapy, {{sometimes called}} metabolic activation therapy, or cellular activation therapy describes in a literal sense the intravenous injection of insulin in pulses versus continuous infusions. Injection of insulin in pulses mimics the physiological secretions of <b>insulin</b> by the <b>pancreas</b> into the portal vein which then drains into the liver. In healthy, non-diabetic individuals, pancreatic secretions of insulin {{correspond to the}} intake of food. The pancreas will secrete variable amounts of insulin based upon {{the amount of food}} consumed (basically speaking, the more food that is consumed, the more <b>insulin</b> the <b>pancreas</b> will secrete) among other factors. Continuous exposure to insulin and glucagon is known to decrease the hormones’ metabolic effectiveness on glucose production in humans due to the body developing an increased tolerance to the hormones. Down-regulation at the cellular level may partially explain the decreased action of steady-state levels of insulin, while pulsatile hormone secretion may allow recovery of receptor affinity and numbers for insulin. Intermittent intravenous insulin administration with peaks of insulin concentrations may enhance suppression of gluconeogenesis and reduce hepatic glucose production.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} methods for transdermal {{delivery}} of insulin. Pulsatile insulin uses microjets to pulse insulin into the patient, mimicking the physiological secretions of <b>insulin</b> by the <b>pancreas.</b> Jet injection had different insulin delivery peaks and durations {{as compared to}} needle injection.

50|$|After a meal, {{when the}} blood {{concentration}} of fatty acids rises, {{there is an}} increase in uptake of fatty acids in different cells of the body, mainly liver cells, adipocytes and muscle cells.

50|$|Mannoheptulose {{has been}} {{reported}} to inhibit <b>insulin</b> secretion from <b>pancreas.</b> This inhibition occurs because when mannoheptulose is present the glycolysis is inhibited (because there is no production of glucose-6-P) therefore no increase in ATP concentration which is required to close the KATP channel in the beta cells of the pancreas causing a diminution of calcium entry and insulin secretion.|$|R
50|$|Nateglinide lowers {{blood glucose}} by {{stimulating}} {{the release of}} <b>insulin</b> from the <b>pancreas.</b> It achieves this by closing ATP-dependent potassium channels in the membrane of the β cells. This depolarizes the β cells and causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open. The resulting calcium influx induces fusion of insulin-containing vesicles with the cell membrane, and insulin secretion occurs.|$|R
40|$|Objective The aim of {{the study}} was to {{increase}} the number of human islet beta-cells after transplantation with injections of human growth hormone (hGH). Interventions Human islets and fetal rat islets were transplanted under the left kidney capsule and under the right kidney capsule, respectively in nude normoglycemic mice which were then given a daily injection of 200 µg hGH for 1 - 4 weeks. Main outcome measure Beta-cell proliferation was determined using thymidine incorporation and the beta-cell area was assessed using light microscopy. Results Mice given hGH increased their body weight one week after transplantation and had a more efficient removal of glucose after 3 and 4 weeks. Treatment with hGH resulted in increased beta-cell proliferation in human and fetal rat beta-cells, and the beta-cell area tended to increase. However, serum <b>insulin</b> concentrations and <b>pancreas</b> <b>insulin</b> content remained unchanged. Conclusions hGH increased the proliferation of transplanted human beta-cells as well as improving the glucose tolerance of the transplanted mice...|$|R
5000|$|An article he {{read about}} the {{pancreas}} piqued Banting's interest in diabetes. Banting had to give a talk on the pancreas {{to one of his}} classes at the University of Western Ontario on November 1, 1920, and he was therefore reading reports that other scientists had written. Research by German pathologist Bernhard Naunyn, Oskar Minkowski, American physician and pathologist Eugene Lindsay Opie, English physiologist Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer, and others suggested that diabetes resulted from a lack of a protein hormone secreted by the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Schafer had named this putative hormone [...] "insulin". Insulin was thought to control the metabolism of sugar; its lack led to an increase of sugar in the blood which was then excreted in urine. Attempts to extract <b>insulin</b> from ground-up <b>pancreas</b> cells were unsuccessful, likely because of the destruction of the insulin by the proteolysis enzyme of the pancreas. The challenge was {{to find a way to}} extract <b>insulin</b> from the <b>pancreas</b> prior to it being destroyed.|$|R

The method correlates the fluctuations in intensity of fluorescent labeled membranes and encapsulated (macro) molecules (labeled with second fluorophore) for each liposome diffusing through the observation volume. The analysis provides quantitative information on the concentration of macromolecules inside the liposomes and the fraction of functional channel proteins.

40|$|Persistent hyperinsulinemic {{hypoglycemia}} of infancy (PHHI) is {{a disorder}} of childhood associated with inappropriate hypersecretion of <b>insulin</b> by the <b>pancreas.</b> The pathogenesis {{of the condition}} has hitherto remained controversial. We show here that insulin-secreting cells from a homogeneous group of five infants with PHHI lack ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K(ATP)) activity. As a consequence, PHHI β-cells are spontaneously electrically active with high basal cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations due to Ca 2 + influx. Our findings define the pathogenesis of this disease as a novel K+ channel disorder...|$|R
50|$|Diabetes is a {{metabolic}} disorder {{where the body}} is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either {{because of a lack}} of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Both of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and <b>insulin</b> resistance. The <b>pancreas</b> is the organ responsible for the secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions. If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the <b>insulin</b> that the <b>pancreas</b> is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.|$|R

40|$|The clonal {{isolation}} of putative adult pancreatic precursors {{has been an}} elusive goal of researchers seeking to develop cell replacement strategies for diabetes. We report the clonal identification of multipotent precursor cells from the adult mouse pancreas. The application of a serum-free, colony-forming assay to pancreatic cells enabled the identification of precursors from pancreatic islet and ductal populations. These cells proliferate in vitro to form clonal colonies that coexpress neural and pancreatic precursor markers. Upon differentiation, individual clonal colonies produce distinct populations of neurons and glial cells, pancreatic endocrine beta-, alpha- and delta-cells, and pancreatic exocrine and stellate cells. Moreover, the newly generated b- like cells demonstrate glucose-dependent Ca 2 + responsiveness and <b>insulin</b> release. <b>Pancreas</b> colonies do not express markers of embryonic stem cells, nor genes suggestive of mesodermal or neural crest origins. These cells represent a previously unidentified adult intrinsic pancreatic precursor population and are a promising candidate for cell-based therapeutic strategies...|$|R
