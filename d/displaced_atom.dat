50|$|Atoms {{can only}} be {{displaced}} if, upon bombardment, the energy they receive exceeds a threshold energy Ed. Likewise, when a moving atom collides with a stationary atom, both atoms will have energy greater than Ed after the collision only if the original moving atom had an energy exceeding 2Ed. Thus, only PKAs with an energy greater than 2Ed can continue to displace more atoms and increase {{the total number of}} displaced atoms. In cases where the PKA does have sufficient energy to displace further atoms, the same truth holds for any subsequently <b>displaced</b> <b>atom.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} on materials {{is rooted in}} the initial event in which an energetic projectile strikes a target. While the event is made up of several steps or processes, the primary result is the displacement of an atom from its lattice site. Irradiation displaces an atom from its site, leaving a vacant site behind (a vacancy) and the <b>displaced</b> <b>atom</b> eventually comes to rest in a location that is between lattice sites, becoming an interstitial atom. The vacancy-interstitial pair is central to radiation effects in crystalline solids and is known as a Frenkel pair (FP). The presence of the Frenkel pair and other consequences of irradiation damage determine the physical effects, and with the application of stress, the mechanical effects of irradiation by the occurring of interstitial, phenomena, such as swelling, growth, phase transition, segregation, etc., will be effected. In addition to the atomic displacement, an energetic charged particle moving in a lattice also gives energy to electrons in the system, via the electronic stopping power. This energy transfer can also for high-energy particles produce damage in non-metallic materials, as so called ion tracks.|$|E

Positron measurements were supplemented by ion backscattering/channeling to determine <b>displaced</b> <b>atom</b> distributions, and infrared absorption measurements to determine divacancy concentrations.

He-irradiated silicon was restored toward single crystal quality as measured by both infrared and positron methods. For the same anneal, Si-irradiated silicon shows partial restoration of crystallinity (RBS), and removal of the optically-active divacancies, but no change in positron trapping characteristics.

The epilayers contain voids of dollar∼dollar 6 mm diameter, which constitute efficient positron traps. The densities and sizes of voids in the epilayers were determined by transmission electron microscopy. Extremely narrow positron annihilation lineshapes were measured, and attributed to the formation of positronium within the voids.

40|$|The damage {{evolution}} and concomitant dopant redistribution {{as a function}} of ion fluence during ultra shallow, heavy ion implants into Si have been investigated using medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). These studies involved As and Sb ions implanted at room temperature, at energies of 2. 5 and 2 keV to doses from 3 × 1013 to 5 × 1015 cm− 2. MEIS is capable of detecting both the <b>displaced</b> <b>atom</b> and implant profiles with sub-nanometre depth resolution. These studies show that for doses up to 1 × 1014 cm− 2 (at which an amorphous layer is formed) the damage build up does not follow the energy deposition function. Instead it proceeds through the initial formation of a ∼ 4 nm wide amorphous layer immediately under the oxide, that grows inwards into the bulk with increasing dose. This behaviour is explained in terms of the migration of some of the interstitials produced {{along the length of the}} collision cascade to the oxide or amorphous/crystal Si interface, where their trapping nucleates the growth of a shallow amorphous layer and the subsequent planar growth inwards of the damage layer. Although for doses ⩾ 4 × 1014 cm− 2 the As depth profiles agreed well with TRIM calculations, for lower doses As was observed to have a shallower profile, ∼ 2 nm nearer to the surface. This behaviour is related the growth of the amorphous layer and ascribed to the movement of As into the near-surface amorphous layer (probably mediated by point defect migration) in which the larger dopant is accommodated more easily. SIMS studies have confirmed this dopant segregation effect. Shallow Sb implants also exhibit this novel dopant movement effect for low doses in combination with a damage evolution similar to As...|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{channeling}} of ions {{can also}} be used to analyze a crystalline sample for lattice damage. If atoms within the target are displaced from their crystalline lattice site, this will result in a higher backscattering yield in relation to a perfect crystal. By comparing the spectrum from a sample being analyzed to that from a perfect crystal, and that obtained at a random (non-channeling) orientation (representative of a spectrum from an amorphous sample), it is possible to determine the extent of crystalline damage in terms of a fraction of <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms.</b> Multiplying this fraction by the density of the material when amorphous then also gives an estimate for the concentration of <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms.</b> The energy at which the increased backscattering occurs {{can also be}} used to determine the depth at which the <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms</b> are and a defect depth profile can be built up as a result.|$|R
50|$|Most of the <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms</b> {{resulting}} from electron irradiation {{and some other}} types of irradiation are PKAs, since these are usually below the threshold displacement energy {{and do not have}} sufficient energy to <b>displace</b> more <b>atoms.</b> In other cases like fast neutron irradiation, most of the displacements result from higher energy PKAs colliding with other atoms as they slow down to rest.|$|R
40|$|The velocity-Verlet {{molecular}} dynamics {{has been applied}} to study the radiation damage created in collision cascades in an aluminium crystal harbouring an isolated edge dislocation with 1 / 2 〈 110 〉 Burgers vector. The total of more than 150 displacement cascades formed by the recoil of primary knock-on atoms with energy EPKA= 5 keV in crystals at temperatures 100 K⩽T⩽ 600 K were simulated. Three different mechanisms of the interaction of collision cascades with edge dislocations in aluminium have been observed. At low and room temperatures the dislocations climb by absorption of <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms</b> from the collision cascade region. Capture of vacancies and <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms</b> by dislocation core at high temperatures leads to dislocation climb up and down. At room and especially at high temperatures dislocation climb by absorbing <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms</b> is accompanied by the formation of stacking fault tetrahedra {{in the vicinity of the}} dislocation line. In order to quantify the redistribution of radiation defects, the number of residual vacancies and self-interstitials created in collision cascades near edge dislocations was evaluated and compared with the number of Frenkel pairs formed in collision cascades in the pristine material under the same irradiation conditions. © 2012, Elsevier B.

40|$|Rational drug {{design for}} {{flexible}} proteins like human aldose reductase comprises special challenges to find novel lead compounds or to improve known inhibitors. In this thesis, diverse {{aspects of the}} complexity of such a task were investigated to find promising new lead scaffolds and enhance the affinity of known aldose reductase inhibitors. Within different design cycles, the prediction of ligand binding modes in a binding pocket capable to adapt to a bound ligand is such a challenging task. A benzothiazole scaffold originating from a virtual screening run was kinetically and structurally evaluated. An unexpected binding mode in complex with wild-type aldose reductase and a new protein conformer provided the basis for a further drug design cycle to optimize the scaffold. The benzothiazole core was expanded to explicitly address an additional subpocket of the protein to enhance both affinity and selectivity over a closely related protein. Flexibility is a common feature of many proteins. For human aldose reductase, a variety of conformers are adopted with different inhibitors. In Chapter 3, the known inhibitors zopolrestat and IDD 393 each in complex with a threonine 113 mutant and a benzothiazole inhibitor in complex with the wild type of aldose reductase were investigated with respect to the impact of inhibitor binding on protein conformation. Though the interaction to the mutated residue does not directly alter the binding mode of zopolrestat, a shift of its basic scaffold is induced and subsequently affects the interaction to a flexible loop and introduces disorder. With IDD 393, two distinct binding site conformations resulting in different crystal forms can be directly compared. Improvements of the computational methods for affinity prediction from the structure of protein-ligand complexes requires {{a better understanding of the}} nature of molecular interactions and biomolecular recognition principles. In Chapter 4, the binding of two chemically closely related human aldose reductase inhibitors have been studied by high resolution X-ray analysis (0. 92 A- 1. 35 A) and isothermal titration calorimetry against a series of single-site mutants of the wild-type protein. A crucial active site threonine, thought to be involved in a short bromine-to-oxygen halogen bond to the inhibitors in the wild type has been mutated to the structurally similar residues alanine, cysteine, serine, and valine. Overall, structurally the binding mode of the inhibitors is conserved; however, small but significant geometrical adaptations are observed as a consequence of the spatial and electronic changes at the mutation site. They involve the opening of a central bond angle and shifts in consequence of the lost or gained halogen bonds. Remarkably, the tiny structural changes are responded by partly strong modulation of the thermodynamic profiles. Even though the free energy of binding is maximally perturbed by only 7 kJ/mol, much stronger modulations and shifts in the enthalpy and entropy signature are revealed which indicate a pronounced enthalpy/entropy compensation. However, facing these perturbances against the small structural changes, an explanatory correlation can be detected. This also provides deeper insights how single-site mutations can alter the selectivity profile of closely related ligands against a target protein. High resolution structural data of protein inhibitor complexes is the key to rational drug design. Synchrotron radiation allows for atomic resolution but is frequently accompanied by radiation damage to protein complexes. In Chapter 5, a human aldose reductase mutant complexed with a bromine substituted inhibitor was determined to atomic resolution. Though the radiation dose was moderate, a selective disruption of a bromine-inhibitor bond during the experiment was observed while the protein appears unaffected. A covalent bond to bromine is cleaved and the <b>displaced</b> <b>atom</b> is not scattered throughout the crystal but can most likely be assigned as a bromide ion to an additional difference electron density peak observed in the structure: The bromide relocates to an adjacent unoccupied site where promising interactions to protein residues stabilize its position. These findings were verified by a second similar structure determined with considerably higher radiation dose...|$|E
50|$|A curious {{feature of}} {{collision}} cascades {{is that the}} final amount of damage produced may be {{much less than the}} number of atoms initially affected by the heat spikes.

In MPM, modified interpolation shape functions are adopted to reduce artificial {{forces on the}} background hierarchical grids. The multi-scale method is validated using the example of wave propagation within a bar. The method is applicable to several kinds of potentials including the Lennard-Jones, EAM and a bonding-angle related potential for silicon. Examples of high energy Cu-Cu and Si-Si cluster impact are presented. The kinetic energy of the cluster is the critical process parameters. The evolution of <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms</b> is found {{to depend on the}} underlying lattice structures. For the case of Cu-Cu cluster impacts, stacking faults play an important role.

However, it is in many cases not straightforward to analyze what is the actual defect structure underlying the RBS/C signal. To reveal insights of RBS/C signals from arbitrarily complex defective atomic structures, we develop here a method for simulating the RBS/C spectrum from a set of arbitrary read-in atom coordinates (obtained, e. g., from molecular dynamics simulations). We apply the developed method to simulate the RBS/C signals from Ni crystal structures containing randomly <b>displaced</b> <b>atoms,</b> Frenkel point defects, and extended defects, respectively. The RBS/C simulations show that, even for the same number of atoms in defects, the RBS/C signal is much stronger for the extended defects.

50|$|Protons, {{which are}} {{approximately}} 1800 times more massive than electrons, have deeper penetration in materials and travel {{in an almost}} straight path. This feature allows the fabrication of three-dimensional, high aspect ratio structures with vertical, smooth sidewalls and low line-edge roughness. Calculations have also indicated that p-beam writing exhibits minimal proximity effects (unwanted exposure due to secondary electrons), since the secondary electrons induced in proton/electron collisions have low energy. A further advantage stems from the ability of protons to <b>displace</b> <b>atoms</b> while traversing material, thereby increasing localized damage especially {{at the end of}} range.

A lattice remains unchanged only when we displace it by a particular distance (integer times of lattice constant), so a crystal has only discrete translation symmetry. The phase transition between a liquid and a crystal is a transition that reduces the continuous translation symmetry of the liquid to the discrete symmetry of the crystal. Such change in symmetry is called symmetry breaking. The essence {{of the difference between}} liquids and crystals is therefore that the organizations of atoms have different symmetries in the two phases.|$|R

By doing this, there would be less radiation-induced segregation of elements, which would in turn lead to more ductile grain boundaries and less intergranular stress corrosion cracking. Blocking dislocation and defect movement would also help to increase the resistance to radiation assisted creep. Attempts have been reported of instituting yttrium oxides to block dislocation motion, but it was found that technological implementation posed a greater challenge than expected.
