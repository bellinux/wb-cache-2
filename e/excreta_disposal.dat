The sources of sodium ion (Na+) {{are from the}} weathering products of silicate rocks and its movement from the absorbed complex of soil and rocks by magnesium and calcium. The {{concentrations of}} Na+ varied between 2.90 and 5.10  mg/L, {{with a mean of}} 3.81  mg/L. The Na+ concentrations were below the WHO recommended limits of 200  mg/L. The levels of K+ in the surface water samples ranged between 0.40 and 3.90  mg/L, with a mean value of 1.00  mg/L and the levels were below the permissible limit of 12  mg/L by WHO (2011). The low concentration of K+ in the surface water samples was due to its affinity to be immobilised by clay minerals to partake in forming secondary minerals. The levels of Ca 2 + ion in the Birim River basin ranged from 12.80 to 41.60  mg/L, with a mean 22.40  mg/L. The levels of Mg 2 + varied between 5.13 and 16.66  mg/L, with a mean level of 8.90  mg/L. The concentration of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions, respectively, in all the river water samples, fall below the WHO maximum acceptable limit of 75 and 150  mg/L. Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are serious hydrochemical elements in water (Razowska-Jaworek 2014). Ca is a significant ion that affects the hardness of water and has been the most abundant elements found in water resources. The anion chemistry of Birim River basin was dominated by HCO 3 − followed by Cl−, SO 42 −, NO 3 − and CO 32 −. The Cl− content in the Birim water samples varied from 11.98 to 69.96  mg/L, with a mean of 27.76  mg/L and all the surface water samples were below the acceptable limits of 250  mg/L recommended by the WHO (2011). Sulphate (SO 42 −) ions are limited by Ca 2 + ions in surface water. The major source of sulphate in water resources is sedimentary rock, such as anhydride and gypsum. The sulphate concentration in the Birim River basin ranged between bd and 1.00  mg/L, with a mean value of 11.98  mg/L. The SO 42 − contents in the Birim River samples were below the acceptable limits of 250  mg/L recommended by WHO. The HCO 3 − and CO 32 − concentrations ranged from 19.99 to 160.84  mg/L and 0.01 to 0.16  mg/L, with mean values of 78.63 and 0.05  mg/L, respectively. The levels of nitrate (NO 3 −) in surface water {{can be attributed to the}} oxidation of nitrogenous waste products in animal and human <b>excreta,</b> wastewater <b>disposal</b> and agricultural activity. The concentrations of NO 3 − in surface water can vary depending on surface runoff of fertiliser, denitrification by bacteria and uptake by phytoplankton. The level of NO 3 − in surface water was moderately low, ranged from bd to 1.00  mg/L, with a mean value of 0.38  mg/L. The levels of NO 3 − were below the acceptable limits of 45  mg/L.

40|$|SANITATION, PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT The {{approach}} to sanitation {{worldwide should be}} ecologically sustainable, i. e. concerned with protection of the environment. This means that sanitation systems should neither pollute ecosystems nor deplete scarce resources. It further implies that sanitation systems should not lead to degrading water or land and should, where possible, ameliorate existing problems caused by pollution. More research and better designs are needed. Human excreta can be rendered harmless, and toilet designs that do this in harmony with agricultural and social customs hold promise for the future. Problems with conventional sanitation systems {{have been shown to}} include inadequate institutional capacity to deal with the sanitation process, a fixation with providing either a full waterborne system or a VIP toilet, the social acceptability of various systems, and the perception that dry, on-site sanitation systems are inherently inferior. The basic purpose of any sanitation system is to contain human excreta (chiefly faeces) and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, while avoiding damage to the environment. An alternative sanitation technology known as urine-diversion (UD) performs these functions with fewer operational and maintenance problems than those associated with conventional VIP toilets, (for example, it is a major and expensive operation to desludge full pits, which is not the case with UD toilets as the vaults can be quickly and easily emptied using hand tools) and also provides a free, easily accessible and valuable agricultural resource for those who wish to use it. This technology represents one aspect of an approach, or philosophy, termed “ecological sanitation” or “ecosan. ” Key features of ecosan are prevention of pollution and disease caused by human excreta, treatment of human excreta as a resource rather than as waste, and recovery and recycling of the nutrients. In nature, excreta from humans and animals play an essential role in building healthy soils and providing valuable nutrients for plants. Conventional approaches to sanitation misplace these nutrients, dispose of them and break this cycle. UD systems have been successfully implemented in many countries, including South Africa where more than 60 000 of these toilets have been built since 1997. However, despite much research having been carried out internationally and locally, various questions still remain, particularly on the health aspects of operation, maintenance, and <b>excreta</b> use or <b>disposal.</b> Not enough is known about the dehydrating processes taking place inside the faeces vault, and there is still disagreement on safe retention periods and microbiological stability of the final product. The roles of dryness, pH, temperature and time in pathogen destruction also need to be further clarified. In addition, it is critically important that toilet users are able to operate and maintain their systems easily and safely, particularly while emptying the vaults and recycling or otherwise dealing with the contents. Engineers need to understand and take all these issues into consideration before they can properly design and implement sustainable UD sanitation systems. It is therefore important to develop guidelines for sanitation practitioners that set out best practices for construction and operation of UD toilets. Construction recommendations are important because good construction facilitates easy operation, and also promotes rapid pathogen destruction. Easy operation in turn directly influences the health risks associated with removing faecal material from the vaults. Handling of faecal material is an aspect inherent in the operation of UD ecological sanitation systems, because emptying of the vault is usually done using hand tools. If the faecal material is also used for agricultural purposes then further handling must of necessity take place. As such, there is a health concern, both for the person(s) handling the material and for the wider public who may be consumers of the fertilised crops. It is therefore necessary that these health concerns be quantified, in order that proper regulation may take place. 35 t/ha), while the helminth ova content varied, both in leaves and stems, depending on the quantity of material applied. Helminth ova content was, for both crops, more prevalent in leaves, suggesting that the ova adhere preferentially to plants rather than soil. It was thus illustrated that there is a health implication involved in growing edible crops in soils amended with ecosan biosolids. Even if in this case the spinach and carrots were cooked before consumption, normal handling of the crops during harvesting and preparation could have caused infection if personal hygiene was unsatisfactory. It is therefore important that crop growers and consumers, as well as proponents of biosolids use, are aware of the storage and treatment requirements for ecosan biosolids before these are applied to soils where crops are grown. DETAILED INVESTIGATION INTO VAULT PROCESSES It is hypothesised that the most advantageous {{approach to}} pathogen destruction in a UD toilet vault is to maximise the effects of various environmental factors, e. g. high pH, high temperature, low moisture, type of bulking agent and storage time. In order to quantify these effects a field experiment was set up consisting of 12 UD toilet vaults, each with a different combination of faeces and bulking agent (soil, ash, wood shavings, NaOH or straw), ventilation (ventpipe / no ventpipe) and vault lid material (concrete, metal or perspex). Faecal material was obtained from UD toilets in the eThekwini area, as described above. Temperature probes, which were connected to a data logger, were inserted in the heaps and the logger monitored over a period of nearly 10 months. This enabled a number of graphs to be drawn illustrating the effect of the above parameters on heap temperature over the experimental period. During the coldest week in winter the mean heap temperatures averaged 16, 8 °C, while the minimum and maximum averaged 14, 8 °C and 18, 8 °C respectively. During the warmest week in summer mean heap temperatures averaged 27, 6 °C, while the minimum and maximum averaged 25, 6 °C and 29, 3 °C respectively. In addition, samples were taken at various intervals from each vault {{as well as from the}} main heap of faecal material that was left exposed to the elements. The samples were subjected to microbiological testing in order to quantify the pathogen die-off over time for each vault as well as for the main heap. In the vaults, total coliform reduced by 3 log 10 (99, 9 %) at between 130 and 250 days, faecal coliform between 100 and 250 days, and faecal streptococci from 125 days and longer. In the main heap, these times varied from 115 days for both total and faecal coliform to 140 days for faecal streptococci. Viable Ascaris ova were reduced to zero between 44 and 174 days in the vaults and by 44 days in the main heap. The conclusions drawn from the xperimentation were the following: Influence of ventpipe Ventilation of the vault by means of a ventpipe does not result in any meaningful difference in either the vault temperature or rate of pathogen die-off. Influence of vault lid material The lid material, and by inference also the material of the vault walls, has no significant effect on the temperature of the heap or the associated pathogen die-off. Type of bulking agent While the type of bulking agent used does not significantly influence the temperature of the faecal material, it does have an effect on the rate of pathogen die-off. The ordinary soil mix was seen to give the best results, and this was ascribed to the effect of competing microorganisms in the soil itself. Influence of sunshine and rain The main heap of material (faeces/soil mix) that was exposed to the elements performed among the best in terms of pathogen die-off. Apart from the influence of competing microorganisms in the soil on the pathogens as described above, this good performance was also ascribed to the effect of UV radiation and alternate wetting/drying and heating/cooling cycles, which suggests that open-air exposure is likely to provide the best treatment. Comparing the results of this research with other local and international research, it appears that there is a great deal of convergence in the results. It is concluded that vaults of UD toilets should be sized for a storage period of 12 months from last use. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND REGULATION OF URINE-DIVERSION TOILETS The standard of UD toilets in South Africa varies greatly. While there are many good examples of the technology, there are also many that have been ill-conceived and are badly built and poorly operated. Project implementers are responsible for the quality of sanitation schemes and should be equipped with the necessary information to oversee the process. The guidelines are aimed at providing implementers with, firstly, the necessary technical information to build good quality UD toilets and, secondly, the basic operation and maintenance tasks that should be conveyed to the toilet owners. Basic regulatory guidelines for the responsible authorities are also given. The guidelines are intended to be a stand-alone document and some repetition of information from earlier chapters is thus unavoidable. The technology of urine diversion is introduced, followed by basic design and construction guidelines, including drawings, for the superstructure and vault of a UD toilet. Both single- and double-vault toilets are discussed. A number of photographs are also provided, illustrating good and bad building practices. Further aspects discussed are requirements for urine pipes and ventilation. Operation and maintenance of UD toilets are subsequently covered. Topics discussed are dehydration, odour, fly control, cleaning of the pedestal, disposal of anal cleansing material, urine collection and disposal, clearing of blockages in urine pipes, and faeces management. The above guidelines are aimed at designers, builders and toilet users. However, organisations responsible for administering public and environmental health, such as Departments of Health, Environmental Affairs, etc, as well as the local and regional authorities that actually implement the sanitation schemes, should become actively involved in regulating the operation of UD toilets, particularly the removal and disposal of faecal material. Some regulatory guidelines are therefore also included to assist these organisations to set uniform (high) standards in their respective jurisdictions. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH RELATED TO THIS THESIS It is deemed important that the field trials conducted in the various vaults as described earlier are repeated in other climatic areas, for example a hot and dry area, as it is likely that different results regarding recommended minimum storage periods will be obtained. This should be supplemented by trials involving co-composting of the faeces mix with other organic material, in order to compare the efficacy of this method with the dehydration process. Further, vault lids made of PVC should be tested for enhancing heat gain in the vaults. Finally, long-tem measurements of heap pH should be made in order to ascertain if high pH amendments (wood ash, lime, etc) do in fact maintain their initial pH level. Additional field trials, similar to those described earlier for spinach and carrots, should be undertaken with a view to making recommendations regarding maximum application rates of faecal material. These should consist of food crops where the edible portions are either in or near to the soil, such as beetroot, onion, potatoes, tomatoes, etc. Trials involving urine should also be considered in order to determine the most advantageous application rate for the various crops. Another important topic is recommended for further research on the subject of UD toilets. At present, virtually all the UD toilets built in the country have been for communities on the lower end of the income scale and who previously had no formal sanitation facility at all or, at best, an unimproved pit toilet. Research carried out by CSIR in a number of communities has revealed people’s resistance to handling their faecal material, while in others it has not been a problem. There is often a general viewpoint in a village that “the municipality must take the faeces away. ” However, willingness has also been expressed in some villages to pay for a faeces removal service. For instance, this has borne fruit in an area of Kimberley with UD toilets where householders pay a local resident to remove the faecal material on a regular basis. This is done by means of a wheelbarrow, and the material is stockpiled at a nearby approved facility from where it is destined for co-composting with other municipal waste. However, this has not yet been attempted on a large scale in an area with hundreds, or even thousands, of UD toilets. While a theoretical desktop study has been carried out on the feasibility of setting up a large-scale faeces collection concern, such an enterprise does not yet exist in the country. It is suggested that one be set up utilising a horse- or donkey-drawn cart in a village, or group of villages, with sufficient UD toilets available to ensure that a viable business can be conducted. The cooperation of the particular local authority will be required. If successful faeces collection/disposal services could be established in areas with UD toilets it would greatly enhance the social acceptability, and therefore the viability, of this sanitation technology.

Likewise, the addition of hygiene education is required to see health impacts materialize, in particular the basic issues of hand washing, proper disposal of faeces, and protection of drinking water.

The SSI consists of 15 self-report items and two sub-scales, Latrine Use Frequency and Seven-Day Open Defecation Rate. Households are scored on a standardized scale from 0 (no defecation safely captured) to 100 (all defecation safely captured). We present results of a pilot study in Odisha, India to apply the Index to assess <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal</b> behaviors among rural households and evaluate {{the reliability and validity}} of the Index for estimating the rate of correct and consistent sanitation facility usage of household with an improved latrine...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is proposed that relates {{the level of}} ingestion of diarrhoea-causing pathogens to the frequency of diarrhoea in the community. The implications of this model are that, in poor communities with inadequate water supply and <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal,</b> reducing the level of enteric pathogen ingestion by a given amount will have {{a greater impact on}} diarrhoea mortality rates than on morbidity rates, a greater impact on the incidence rate of severe diarrhoea than on that of mild diarrhoea, and a greater impact on diarrhoea caused by pathogens having high infectious doses than on diarrhoea caused by pathogens of a low infectious dose. The impact of water supply and sanitation on diarrhoea, related infections, nutritional status, and mortality is analysed by reviewing 67 studies from 28 countries. The median reductions in diarrhoea morbidity rates are 22 % from all studies and 27 % from a few better-designed studies. All studies of the impact on total mortality rates show a median reduction of 21 %, while the few better-designed studies give a median reduction of 30 %. Improvements in water quality have less of an impact than improvements in water availability or <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal...</b>|$|E

40|$|The sociocultural and {{socioeconomic}} situation of sanitation in Dar-es-Salaam (Dsm), Tanzania, was studied with explicit emphasis on pit-latrines. Without considering the sociocultural conditions, the so-called best solution {{might not be}} the right one. Therefore, in order to achieve the intended goal, a literature review, a questionnaire survey, and personal visits to the chosen study areas were done. In total, 207 household questionnaires were filled in 16 areas of the city. Interviewers did house-to-house visits and questionnaires were filled out on the spot. Results indicated that the city population is about 3. 8 million at present, with over 80 ␘f the dwellers using pit-latrines; some 3 ␞se septic tanks with soakage pits, about 6 re connected to the sewerage system, and 1 ␑ave no <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal</b> facility. Difficulties faced include dismal budget allocations, fragmentation of sanitation activities among subsectors, lack of or poor sanitation record keeping, unsatisfactory machinery for septic tank and pit-latrine emptying, lack of a clear policy on pit-latrine handling and, in competition for resources, low priority is accorded to an <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal</b> system among the people. City residents will continue to use the pit-latrines {{for a long time to}} come. Reusing the fecal sludge is not known by most city dwellers and is influenced by sociocultural habits. To prevent groundwater pollution and to recover useful products in human excreta and urine, ecological sanitation toilets and anaerobic digesters offer a good option...|$|E
40|$|After {{presenting}} {{background information}} on urbanization in Uganda, the chapter {{provides an overview}} of sanitation in the urban centres, where different social classes reside in separate zones. Factors determining sanitation provision and the use of sanitary facilities particularly in the informal settlements, or slums, of the larger cities are identified. Substantial groups among the population {{do not have access to}} formal sanitation facilities and have to resort to improvized unhygienic means of human <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal</b> that pose health risks. This situation underlines the need for innovative community-oriented approaches to address the sanitation challenge. By examining centralized water-based systems of sanitation vis-à-vis decentralized options, opportunities for including the urban poor in environmental service provision are identified...|$|E

40|$|Background : Diarrhea {{is still}} a health problem and {{cause of death in}} infants. Environmental sanitation, lack of support {{followed}} by the bad behavior can lead to high incidence of diarrhea. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between environmental sanitation and maternal health behavior in the incidence of diarrhea in infants in the Subdistrict of West Pemulutan, Ogan Ilir Regency on 2012. Methods : Used observational study using a design with Cross Sectional approach. The subject of this study were mother who had children aged 12 - 59 months at the February until May 2012 with a population of 683 toddlers, Elections were conducted using purposive sampling, while the toddler is done by proportional random sampling generates random sample of 85 toddlers. Statistically using the Chi Square test using SPSS computer program. Results : Results showed that there was no relationship between the water source (p = 0. 085, OR = 4. 00) and knowledge of the mother (p = 0. 949, OR = 1. 02) with the incidence of diarrhea in infants, and there were a relationship between the provision water (p = 0. 002, OR = 2. 47) quality of <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal</b> (latrines) (p = 0. 003, OR = 2. 77), waste disposal (p = 0. 048, OR = 4. 93) and maternal behavior (p = 0. 002, OR = 3. 14) with the incidence of diarrhea in infants. Conclusion : The environmental sanitation factors that may be contributing factors toddler diarrhea is the provision of clean water, <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal</b> (latrines), waste disposal and maternal behavior, so it is necessary to improve access to sanitation facility for the community as well as increased awareness and knowledge of people, especially mothers to the prevent the onset of diarrhea in infants...|$|E
40|$|A {{general theory}} on the {{relationship}} between water supply and sanitation investments and health, the threshold-saturation theory, is proposed. The theory takes into consideration three variables: health status, socioeconomic status, and sanitation level, and attempts to encompass, {{for the first time in}} one general theoretical framework, numerous conflicting empirical findings. The two-tiered S-shaped logistic form of the relationship that is proposed assumes that at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum there is a threshold below which investments in community water supplies and/or <b>excreta</b> <b>disposal</b> facilities alone result in little detectable improvement in health status. Similarly, at the higher end of the socioeconomic scale, it is suggested that a point of saturation is reached beyond which further significant health benefits cannot be obtained by investments in conventional community sanitation facilities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe use {{of waste}} to produce biogas not only limited to the waste from nature such as {{agricultural}} waste, food waste, or cattle manure; but can also use human waste hereinafter called human excreta.
