A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973. In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> reform—a private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> employer mandate and replacement of Medicaid by state-run <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> plans available to all, with income-based premiums and cost sharing.|$|E
5|$|Health-care {{coverage}} in the United States {{is a combination of}} public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> reform—an employer mandate to offer private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> plans {{available to all}} with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of § 73 b SGB V in 2004 <b>health</b> <b>insurances</b> are legally obligated to provide a gatekeeping-model. To participate, the insured have to enrol in a model {{for at least one}} year. The model obliges that they always consult a general practitioner first. If <b>health</b> <b>insurances</b> formulate appropriate contracts, this new way of medical care will improve patient-orientation in primary care. To find out if any improvements are evident, a survey was conducted. The results of the survey show that the respondents hardly notice any big differences between. Furthermore, gatekeeping-models are a possibility to reduce the segmentation {{of the health care system}} and promote the competition between <b>health</b> <b>insurances</b> and between <b>health</b> care providers and <b>health</b> <b>insurances.</b> Due to many regulations in § 73 b SGB V {{the implementation}} of gatekeeping-models neither a reduces the segmentation nor promotes the competition between <b>health</b> <b>insurances</b> and <b>health</b> care providers...|$|R

In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the full Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Kennedy introduced a bipartisan bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.|$|E

Hearings on national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. He also played a leading role, with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.|$|E
5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare reform bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Program (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} a two-tier medical system in the German acute care hospital sector using data from a survey of 483 German hospitals. The focus of our analysis lies on the impact of hospital concentration on the probability of discrimination of patients with different <b>health</b> <b>insurances</b> in regard to the access to medical services. Accounting for a possible endogeneity of market structure, we find that hospitals in highly concentrated markets are less likely to pursue any differentiation among prospective patients with different <b>health</b> <b>insurances.</b> We ascribe this finding to competitive pressure in less concentrated markets. Hospitals in competitive markets are more obliged to steal business from rival hospitals by privileging profitable patients than hospitals in highly concentrated markets...|$|R
