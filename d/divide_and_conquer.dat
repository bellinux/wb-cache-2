5|$|In September 1948 Rijadi was {{promoted}} and given control of four battalions {{of soldiers and}} one of student soldiers. Two months later, the Dutch launched a second attack, this time on the nearby city of Yogyakarta (then serving as the nation's capital). Although Rijadi and his troops launched attacks on Dutch forces approaching Solo through Klaten, ultimately the Dutch soldiers entered the city. Applying a <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> policy, Rijadi was able to drive the forces out in four days.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} {{might be of}} use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, he led his own {{faction of}} the sect after its various {{military}} leaders pursued their own policies towards the French and Hồ Chí Minh's Việt Minh {{in the wake of}} Sổ's death. At the time, France was in a ruinous financial state following World War II and was experiencing great difficulty in its attempts to re-establish control over its colonies. Ba Cụt had only 1,000 men in five battalions at the time, fewer than 5% of Hòa Hảo forces, whereas Trần Văn Soái had 15,000 men. The French tried to maintain their hold with a <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> strategy towards the Hòa Hảo. They coaxed Soái into joining with them and recognised him {{as the leader of the}} Hòa Hảo. In 1948, Ba Cụt rallied to the French and Soái, but broke away again soon after, relocating to Đồng Tháp Province and resuming his military activities against the French.|$|E
25|$|A <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> {{algorithm}} repeatedly reduces {{an instance}} of a problem {{to one or more}} smaller instances of the same problem (usually recursively) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> is merge sorting. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> is called a decrease and conquer algorithm, that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of decrease and conquer algorithm is the binary search algorithm.|$|E

25|$|In {{computer}} science, <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> is an algorithm design paradigm {{based on}} multi-branched recursion. A <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into {{two or more}} sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.

25|$|<b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> is a {{powerful}} tool for solving conceptually difficult problems: all it requires is a way of breaking the problem into sub-problems, of solving the trivial cases and of combining sub-problems to the original problem. Similarly, <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> only requires reducing the problem to a single smaller problem, such as the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which reduces moving a tower of height n to moving a tower of height n−1.|$|E

In addition to identified conditions during splitting step, we introduced an adapted scheduler called basic-NPS (Basic - Non Preemptive Scheduler) able to distribute in balanced way a set of active tasks on available processors. Finally we introduced an adapted merging policy designed especially for dynamic system evolving until stability.|$|R

When the government of Orlando was replaced by that of Francesco Saverio Nitti on 23 June, Sonnino was replaced by Tommaso Tittoni.

50|$|Directors of {{companies}} are held to account to the shareholders {{of companies}}, or not, by the rules found in company law statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in Delaware) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this {{was supported by the}} fact that the majority of shareholders in big public companies were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, <b>divided</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquered.</b>|$|R

25|$|When {{a problem}} shows optimal {{substructures}} – meaning the optimal {{solution to a}} problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems – and overlapping subproblems, meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called dynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, Floyd–Warshall algorithm, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and memoization go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> is that subproblems are more or less independent in <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>conquer,</b> whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.|$|E
