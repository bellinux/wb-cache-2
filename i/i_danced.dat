25|$|After he left school, {{he passed}} the {{entrance}} exam to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and, in 1909, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He then joined the 138th Battery Royal Field Artillery. He {{wanted to be a}} pilot so he paid for private lessons in the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands and gained his aviators' certificate on 12 July 1912. He met Agatha Miller when he was invited to a ball on 12 October 1912 by Lady Clifford at her grand home Ugbrooke House in Chudleigh. A description of her meeting with Christie is given by Agatha in her autobiography:Christie came my way quite soon in the dance. He was a tall, fair young man, with crisp curly hair, a rather interesting nose, turned up not down, and a great air of careless confidence about him. He was introduced to me, asked for a couple of dances, and said that his friend Griffiths had told him to look out for me. We got on together very well; he danced splendidly and <b>I</b> <b>danced</b> again several more times with him. I enjoyed the evening thoroughly.|$|E

In their stead, Mark McKinney performed the monologue titled [...] "The Modern Hero" [...] from Season 1 of the show, {{and the entire}} cast performed the sketch [...] "This Is How <b>I</b> <b>Danced</b> in Tenth Grade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1947, Hayworth was {{featured}} in a Life cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed [...] "The Love Goddess". The term was adopted and used later {{as the title of}} a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, [...] "Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. I never made nude movies. I didn't have to do that. <b>I</b> <b>danced.</b> I was provocative, I guess, in some things. But I was not completely exposed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some guys chew gum. Some chew their nails. Some abuse their team-mates. I played air guitar. I sang to the crowd. I sang {{to myself}} and <b>I</b> <b>danced.</b> I said things to the good sorts in the crowd. Can someone please tell me what's wrong with that? People say Mark Waugh was a great player. I think I {{averaged}} 41, the same as him, and he played in a team that rarely lost. I played in a side that rarely won. There's one reason why I didn't play more and the brothers [...] know the reasons why I wasn't picked, and it wasn't because my bowling average was 48. I can't say why; I'm going to write it myself.|$|E
2500|$|Jemison began {{dancing at}} the age of 11. [...] "I love dancing! I took all kinds of dance — African dancing, ballet, jazz, modern — even Japanese dancing. I wanted to become a {{professional}} dancer," [...] said Jemison. At the age of 14, she auditioned for the leading role of [...] "Maria" [...] in West Side Story. She did not get the part but Jemison's dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer. [...] "I had a problem with the singing but <b>I</b> <b>danced</b> and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me. I think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams. For me, I love the sciences and I also love the arts," [...] says Jemison. [...] "I saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so I decided to pursue this dream." [...] Later during her senior year in college, she was trying to decide whether to go to New York to medical school or become a professional dancer. Her mother told her, [...] "You can always dance if you're a doctor, but you can't doctor if you're a dancer." ...|$|E
