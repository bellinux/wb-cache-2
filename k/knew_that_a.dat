However, an opportunistic strike by Larsson on 80 minutes won the match and the tie for Celtic, meaning that Celtic would go through to the UEFA Cup Final, preventing an all-Portugal, and all-Oporto, final.|$|E

She argues that few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and the reason is that the runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> relative would not return from abroad.|$|E

5|$|By May 29, {{four days}} before the opening of the convention, trainloads upon trainloads of delegates, lobbyists, reporters, and {{campaign}} followers had arrived at the Union and Dearborn railway stations in Chicago. Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies. Pre-convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources. One, from the Albany Evening Journal, predicted Blaine with 277 votes, Grant with 317, Sherman with 106, and 49 for the other candidates. All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win. Many in Chicago <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> victor, most probably Grant, would only be determined if the unit rule, which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state's delegation, was to be in effect. If that was not the case, then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other.|$|E
5|$|WWV's 20MHz {{signal was}} used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the {{disintegration}} of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake {{a small amount of}} ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.|$|E

Another objective of the stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E
25|$|To {{accomplish}} the latter end and consolidate its bishop's authority, the new diocese needed a dedicated cathedral. There were also broader social reasons.

At the first retreat he presided over, McCloskey persuaded the assembled priests to pledge over five thousand dollars as the seed of a building fund.|$|E

25|$|Group C {{featured}} a three-way tie between Sweden, Denmark and Italy for first spot. All matches {{between the three}} sides had ended in draws and all three had beaten Bulgaria. Italy were ultimately eliminated {{on the number of}} goals scored between the three sides, after Sweden and Denmark drew 2–2 and qualified to the quarter-finals as group winners and runners-up. The Italians {{went so far as to}} accuse Sweden and Denmark of fixing their match, as both sides <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> 2–2 result would advance them both over Italy, but UEFA disregarded such an idea.|$|E
25|$|Bourguiba, {{worried about}} his country's state, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> good cause would revive the {{national}} movement, weakened by the 1926 repressions. In order to do so, {{he was the only}} one to defend M'hamed Chenik, a Tunis notable, who had been in trouble with the Residence, the French colonial administration. Bourguiba jumped at the chance to rally the bourgeoisie class to the nationalist cause. But his attempt failed and ended up dividing L'Action team. In this context, the uprising following the Tunisian naturalization issue, in early 1933, was the perfect opportunity for him. He started another successful press campaign. With his friends Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga and his brother M'hamed, they sensitized lower classes to their cause and changed the Residence policy. The popularity he acquired during the event, led to his election as a member of the executive committee of the Destour, in May 1933. However, differences with the elders caused him to resign from the party in September 1933.|$|E

25|$|Miles made a last ditch {{attempt to}} revive the project, {{submitting}} {{a proposal for a}} single near-complete M.52 prototype to be outfitted with a captured German rocket engine and automated controls, eliminating the requirement for a pilot to be on board. However, this proposal was rejected. Due to the project falling under the Official Secrets Act, the existence of the M.52 was unknown to the wider British public; thus, neither the nation nor the world <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> supersonic aircraft had nearly been built, nor of its unceremonious termination. The Ministry repeatedly refused to allow Miles to hold press conferences on the M.52 and, while conducting its own press conference on the topic of high-speed flight on 18 July 1946, the Ministry made no mention of the project at all. It wasn't until September 1946 that the Ministry allowed Miles to announce that the existence of the M.52 and of its cancellation.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{intensified}} {{clashes between}} the CPC and KMT, {{countries such as}} the US and the Soviet Union attempted to prevent a disastrous civil war. After the New Fourth Army incident, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent special envoy Lauchlin Currie to talk with Chiang Kai-shek and KMT party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties, with Currie stating that {{the only ones to}} benefit from a civil war would be the Japanese. In 1941 the Soviet Union, with its closer alliance to the CPC, also sent an imperative telegram to Mao warning that the civil war would also make the situation easier for the Japanese military. Due to the international community's efforts, there was a temporary and superficial peace. In 1943 Chiang attacked the CPC with the propaganda piece China's Destiny, which questioned the CPC's power after the war, while the CPC strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> deadly battle had begun between themselves.|$|E
25|$|The fame of the Vieux-Colombier {{seemed to}} reach its apogee in the 1922/1923 season. The house was filled for every {{performance}} and visitors to Paris complained of the impossibility of getting tickets to any of its offerings. Copeau organized a touring company to the provinces. Invitations to play in {{other countries in the}} off-season abounded. When Konstantin Stanislavski, the director of the Moscow Art Theatre, came to Paris in December 1922, he and his troupe were warmly received on the stage of the Vieux-Colombier. The influence of Copeau's principles to which he held without flinching was felt throughout Europe and the United States. Despite the fame, conflict arose. Jouvet, who understood the economics of the theatre better than Copeau, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> larger theatre and a more profitable pricing system were needed. His proposal fell on deaf ears. When he was asked to direct at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, he chose his freedom. Even Romains decided that the Right Bank theatres were more hospitable to his work after Copeau rejected one of his plays. Despite the problems at the theatre, the school continued to thrive. Copeau allowed his young charges to appear in a production of Gide's Saül as the masked demons that taunt the king played by Copeau himself. The critical reaction was quite positive. The season ended, as the previous ones had, with the Vieux-Colombier in debt.|$|E
