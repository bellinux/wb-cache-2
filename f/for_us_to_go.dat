500|$|According to Nowalk, {{the idea}} to have Lexie wear a diaper {{to get through the}} {{operation}} was inspired by an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. He added: [...] "It wasn't that big of a leap <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> diaper. Our doctors are hardcore by nature." [...] Nowalk said that this episode was primarily focused around Shepherd, which he considered an [...] "experiment". He commented that the idea of Isaac's storyline came from Dr. Robert Bray, a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles. Nowalk intended the nature of the episode to be [...] "different", attributing it to the fact that Heigl's character was absent. He also praised Wilson for directing the episode, commenting that [...] "she acts, she sings, and now she directs". The majority of the episode involved Shepherd staring at his patient's tumor, contemplating what to do. Nowalk offered his insight on this: ...|$|E
500|$|By then, the {{positions}} of the two countries had reversed from what they were in 1941. The Americans had become suspicious that the British were seeking commercial advantages after the war, and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who took over command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942, wanted to tighten security with a policy of strict compartmentalisation similar to the one that the British had imposed on radar. American officials decided that the United States no longer needed outside help. The Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, felt that since the United States was doing [...] "ninety percent of the work" [...] on the bomb, it would be [...] "better <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along for the present without sharing anything more than we could help". In December 1942, Roosevelt agreed to restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war, even if doing so slowed down the American project. In retaliation, the British stopped sending information and scientists to America, and the Americans then stopped all information sharing.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to Cliff, Clair {{is usually the}} tougher and more sensible parent, offering her children legitimate advice that they can actually apply to their everyday lives; it remains clear to audiences that Clair runs the household. AskMen's Geoffrey Lansdell agreed that the character [...] "rel on a sly maternal quality that fed off of Bill Cosby’s silly paternal playfulness". However, there are occasionally times when Clair resorts to the [...] "wait till your father gets home" [...] method of disciplining her children. Clair generally supports her children's decisions and ever-changing ambitions, specifically in regards to schooling, marriage and careers. Both Clair and Cliff value the importance of proper education in their children's lives, appearing proudest when they {{do well in school}} and delivering the most serious punishments when they underperform academically. On one occasion, Theo rebels against his parents' high expectations of him, arguing, [...] "Because of what you two have achieved, the whole world expects a lot more from us than other kids. Let’s face it, there’s nowhere else left <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> but down," [...] a statement Clair immediately reprimands him for making. When it comes to parenting, Clair usually maintains [...] "an allure of cool, calm confidence ... exhibit a strong but gentle parenting stance, one that wasn’t seen on television by a woman of color" [...] at the time, according to Global Grind's Desire Thompson. Clair practices disciplining her children without ever punishing them physically, often delivering punishments [...] "with a calm charm", and raises her four daughters to love and respect themselves. However, she is also known for ranting at her children when she loses her temper, one of her most recognizable of which is the one she gives Vanessa when she attends a concert in Baltimore against her parents' wishes. In the Season 3 episode [...] "The Shower", Denise hosts a wedding shower for a close friend who gets pregnant on purpose to blackmail her parents into letting her marry her fiancé as soon as possible. When Denise broaches the subject of how she would handle a similar situation, Clair sternly – but rather comically – insists that she will never find herself in a similar situation. Despite her seriousness and disciplinarian status, Clair seldom shies away from laughing and participating in fun activities alongside her family as opposed to simply observing them from the sidelines. The character is also fond of relaxing and taking time to herself away from her children whenever necessary.|$|E

Because by that time we'd become obsessed with change, and the great thing was that we were also able to create a pastoral side of Led Zep.

2500|$|On May 12, 2015, Verizon {{announced}} plans to buy AOL for $50 per share in a deal valued at $4.4 billion. The transaction was completed on June 23. Armstrong, who continued to lead the firm following regulatory approval, called the deal the logical next step for AOL. [...] "If you look forward five years, you're {{going to be in}} a space where there are going to be massive, global-scale networks, and there's no better partner <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward with than Verizon."

2500|$|According to Hutchence, [...] "Most of {{the songs}} on Underneath the Colours were written in a {{relatively}} short space of time. Most bands shudder at the prospect of having 20 years to write their first album and four days to write their second. For us, though, it was good. It left less room <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off on all sorts of tangents". Soon after recording sessions for Underneath the Colours – produced by Richard Clapton – had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Hutchence recorded [...] "Speed Kills", written by Don Walker of hard rockers Cold Chisel, for the Freedom (1982) film soundtrack, directed by Scott Hicks. It was Hutchence's first solo single and was released by WEA in early 1982.|$|E

2500|$|Norway's Dagbladet {{reported}} that Doncaster Belles favoured a typically English style: [...] "heavy, solid and with many long balls." [...] Although the Belles were a completely amateur outfit, the BBC {{reported that}} they would present {{a much more difficult}} challenge than Fulham had been accustomed to that season. In the 2001–02 National Division Doncaster Belles had finished as runners-up for the third season in succession. In the Premier League Cup they suffered a shock semi final defeat by Birmingham City, collapsing from 31 ahead to lose 43 to the Northern Division leaders. In April 2002 they had [...] "stunningly" [...] inflicted a 40 defeat on Arsenal, the eventual champions' first league defeat in over two and a half years. Manager Julie Chipchase accepted that Fulham were favourites but noted the strength of her own squad: [...] "It's an unusual situation <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into a match as the underdogs and I am hoping it will work in our favour. The pressure will be on Fulham but they have some excellent international class players just as we do and it will all be down to who performs on the day." ...|$|E
