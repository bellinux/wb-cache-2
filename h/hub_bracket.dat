40|$|AbstractCSIR - Structural Engineering Research Centre (CSIR-SERC), Chennai, has {{state-of-the-art}} {{facilities and}} expertise {{for carrying out}} R&D studies in the areas related to fatigue and fracture behaviour of structural components and materials. In the last 25 years, the laboratory has efficiently utilised the facilities and expertise available in serving various institutions and industries related to energy sector, automobile applications, railways, aerospace applications, construction industry etc. Fatigue and fracture studies {{have been carried out}} on steel tubular joints of offshore jacket platforms, carbon steel and stainless steel piping components used in power plants, automobile components (connecting rods, air springs, air suspension systems, industrial and automobile chains, stabiliser legs, <b>hub</b> <b>brackets,</b> sub-frames, rubber bushes, parallel link brackets etc.), tyre curing press, alumino-thermit and flash-butt welded rail joints used in Indian Railways, reinforcing bars (thermo-mechanically treated bars, corrosion resistant steel etc.), and many other components and materials. This paper describes some of the important investigations carried out in the Fatigue and Fracture Laboratory (FFL) of CSIR-SERC and presents some salient test results...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{extensive}} track use, Mini Cooper GP’s {{are notorious}} for having brake overheating problems. In the conceptual design stages of the car, BMW engineers intended to install brake ducts to prevent overheating, but due to time constraints, the cars were shipped without the ducts they were intended to have. The goal of this project was to design and manufacture a brake duct kit for the Mini Cooper GP. After a conceptual design of the system, make-buy decisions were made for each component. The components to be made were designed using computer-aided drafting, engineering, and manufacturing software. The components manufactured for this project included left and right wheel <b>hub</b> <b>brackets</b> and a pulley bracket. The system was installed and tested to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} newly designed and manufactured brake duct kit. Installation instructions were created for a car owner to expedite the installation process. If the decision to enter production is made, the potential revenue is $ 18, 000. This would, however, require an investment of roughly $ 10, 000, leaving a net profit of approximately $ 8, 000. This assumes that all engineering work is already done and not factored into the expenses...|$|R
50|$|Pashley {{launched}} the 'Pickle' children's tricycle in 1981. It was closely modelled on children's tricycles of the 1950s and featured proper Ball bearing <b>hubs,</b> headset, bottom <b>bracket</b> and pedals. This made {{it better to}} ride and more resilient than cheaper competitors. Pashley tandems made a re-appearance in the late 1970s {{with the introduction of}} the 'Tourmaster'. These were constructed along simpler lines than conventional tandems, and, like the Picador, used a lugless construction. As a result, they were inexpensive and popular.|$|R
25|$|Gear {{ranges of}} almost 700% can be {{achieved}} on derailleur setups, though this may result in some rather large steps between gears or some awkward gear changes. However, through the careful choice of chainrings and rear cogsets, e.g. 3 chainrings 48-34-20 and a 10-speed cassette 11-32, one can achieve an extremely wide range of gears that are still well spaced. This sort of setup has proven useful on a multitude of bicycles such as cargo bikes, touring bikes and tandems. Even higher gear ranges {{can be achieved}} by using a 2-speed bottom <b>bracket</b> <b>hub</b> gear in conjunction with suitable derailleurs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{outlines}} {{the use of}} a finite element model to simulate the behaviour for a standard steel bicycle frames under a range of measured load cases. These load cases include those measured both in the laboratory setting and also in the field, and include loads transmitted at key areas such as the dropouts and <b>hub,</b> the bottom <b>bracket</b> and drive, the headset and handlebars, and the seat post and saddle. The load cases analysed include static representations of dynamic bump situations which occur sporadically and also those which occur constantly or regularly such as those generated at the drive and handlebars during climbing or cruising. The resulting stresses within the bicycle are analysed in the context of frame performance relating to static and fatigue strengths and are also compared to similar load cases presented in the literature. Further research is required to understand the influence of tube profiles on frame strength, and to analyse the modes of failure for various bicycle designs and materials used under typical and extreme usage {{in order to understand the}} implications of design on safety...|$|R
5000|$|Simultaneously, in New Mexico, Ray Molina had {{commissioned}} Remolino 3.1 in rims, 3.5 in tires, and frames to fit them. He {{wanted the}} bikes for his guided tour {{business in the}} soft sands of the Mexican and Southwest arroyos and dunes. Mark Gronewald, owner of Wildfire Designs Bicycles in Palmer, Alaska met Molina at the 1999 Interbike convention in Las Vegas and rode one of Molina's prototypes at demo days. In late 1999, Gronewald and another Alaskan frame builder, John Evingson, collaborated to design and build several bikes using Molina’s rims and tires. Gronewald and Evingson then began producing their own separate lines of fat-tired bikes in 2000. Rims and tires were imported to Alaska where Wildfire and Evingson began making small, handmade production runs and custom-ordered frames built around Remolino 80 mm rims and 3.5 in tires. Gronewald coined the trademark [...] "Fat Bike" [...] in 2001 and used it as the model name for his bikes. Gronewald originally worked with Palmer Machinery for welding and later contracted frame building to Mike DeSalvo at DeSalvo Cyles of Ashland, Oregon. Gronewald continued to sell his original fatbikes until 2011. Gronewald's design featured an 18 mm offset wheel and frame built to allow full range gearing, since he was using standard <b>hubs</b> and bottom <b>brackets</b> available at the time.|$|R
