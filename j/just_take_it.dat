When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> in stride, {{and at the end of}} the day, I know that it comes with the territory." ...|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|Amar Toor from AOL Radio {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review saying, [...] "Much {{like the rest}} of the album, this new song is simply made for the dance floor. And, much like Kesha herself, the track seems to embody relentless, carefree hedonism at its best." [...] He also noted, [...] "And when Kesha talks about a 'place I know', where 'they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor' in the style of a six-grade camp ditty, it's hard for anyone to not feel the urge to <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> off." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave the single four out of five stars. He was concerned with the overall lyrical depth and over-use of auto-tune but he complimented the song for its [...] "irresistibly catchy beat and chorus" [...] with a [...] "celebratory mood of dropping inhibitions." [...] He noted that [...] "with the volume turned up and the chorus encouraging you to 'take it off,' you may just feel inspired to follow the commands. The ultimate effect by the end of the song is very cathartic as it hints strongly that there is more to [...] "take off" [...] than simply clothing." [...] Andrew Burgess from musicOMH wrote that on the song the singer [...] "oozes swagger." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix used [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of Kesha's songwriting, noting that tracks which weren't over-thought were [...] "fine". Newman wrote that [...] "thinking too much is what gets Kesha, who co-wrote the songs here, in trouble. She’s fine wading in the shallow end with bouncy tunes like the literal 'Take It Off'." ...|$|E

His first hat trick for Inter {{occurred}} in the UEFA Champions League against Werder Bremen on 29 September 2010. Inter won the game 4–0, with Eto'o saying, [...] "We will remain humble {{because we know that}} there are sides out there that are better than us, so we will <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> one match at a time and we will go as far as it takes us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "Last week, I was pretty miffed about Once Upon A Time and its {{treatment}} of Regina (Lana Parrilla). While I ultimately liked the episode, {{it felt like the}} show was continuing to use her as a punching bag to move the plot forward. Need something bad to happen to one of our characters? <b>Just</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out on Regina! Granted, it’s a formula that has served Once Upon A Time in the past, but at this point, it just felt repetitive. That’s why “Only You” and “An Untold Story” provided such a fresh change of pace for a season finale that not only sets up the next phase of the story, but also promises to put Regina in a more central role." ...|$|E
