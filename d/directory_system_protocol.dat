DAP is just one of a suite of four directory protocols provided under the X. 500 umbrella (X. 519). <b>Directory</b> <b>System</b> <b>Protocol</b> (DSP) is used to provide a distributed directory environment and is used to support DAP "chaining," in which the DSA that received the DAP request forwards the request to one or more other DSAs [X. 518]. Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP) is provided to support replication, again in the distributed directory environment. Directory Operational Binding Management Protocol (DOP) was intended for use in authentication among DSAs, but is rarely implemented in X. 500 -compliant products. A significant issue relative to X. 500 directory products results from the standard itself. Sin [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} Combine, a distributed directory {{protocol for}} shared objects, designed for large-scale distributed <b>systems.</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>protocols</b> support move requests, allowing {{to write the}} object locally, as well as lookup requests, providing a read-only copy of the object. They {{have been used in}} distributed shared memory implementations and in data-ﬂow implementations of distributed software transactional memory in large-scale <b>systems.</b> The <b>protocol</b> runs on an overlay tree, whose leaves are the nodes of the system; it ensures that the cost of serving a request is proportional to the cost of the shortest path between the requesting node and the serving node, in the overlay tree. The correctness of the protocol, including starvation freedom, is proved, despite asynchrony and concurrent requests. The protocol avoids race conditions by combining requests that overtake each other as they pass through the same node. Using an overlay tree with a good stretch factor yields an eﬃcient protocol, even when requests are concurrent...|$|R

The typical {{use of this}} <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> is in a context where pervasive ubiquitous business applica-tion services should be flexibly coordinated and pervasively provided to the mobile user by intelligent agents in dynamically changing environments. The system has been modeled, designed and implemented as a backbone <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> to be searched by an infrastructure made up by such kind of agents coordinating semantic web services. The system is modeled as a federation: directory services form its atomic units, and the federation emerges from the registration of directory services in other directory services. Directories are virtual clusters of service entries stored {{in one or more}} directory services. To create the topology, policies are defined on all possi-ble operations to be called on directories. For instance, they allow for routed registration and selective access to directories. WSDir has been applied as a backbone in the trials of an ehealth emergency application...|$|R
40|$|The OSI <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> is a {{distributed}} {{directory information}} database which incorporates distributed algorithms for name resolution and search to support {{applications such as}} electronic mail, White Pages, authentication services, etc. To improve the performance of requests for name resolution and search, {{it is necessary to}} lower the cost of name lookups for nonlocal names. The OSI <b>directory</b> <b>system</b> and other distributed naming systems use name caching to minimize such costs. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of name caching on the performance of the OSI <b>directory</b> <b>system.</b> We consider the issues of cache sizing and cache replacement policies. We find that a locality of reference property holds in name resolution requests, and hence name caching does increase performance significantly. Using trace-driven simulation, we show that small caches (smaller than 30 items) yield hit ratios up to 60 % and decrease the average name resolution time by 60 %. For small caches, the LRU (Least Recen [...] ...|$|R
