5000|$|The dithionate (or metabisulfate) anion, , is a sulfur oxoanion [...] {{derived from}} <b>dithionic</b> <b>acid,</b> H2S2O6. Its {{chemical}} formula is sometimes {{written in a}} semistructural format, as O3SSO32−.|$|E
50|$|Polythionic acid is an oxoacid {{which has}} a {{straight}} chain of sulfur atoms and has the chemical formula H2SnO6 (n > 2). Trithionic acid (H2S3O6), tetrathionic acid (H2S4O6) are simple examples. The compounds of n < 80 are expected to exist, and those of n < 20 have already been synthesized. <b>Dithionic</b> <b>acid</b> (H2S2O6) {{does not belong to}} the polythionic acids due to strongly different properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dithionic</b> <b>acid</b> is diprotic and salts called dithionates are known. No acid salts (i.e.: one proton lost) {{have been}} discovered. All dithionates are readily soluble in water. They are mild {{oxidizing}} and mild reducing agents. The {{shape of the}} dithionate ion is like ethane, but two SO3 groups adopt an almost eclipsed conformation. The S—S bond length is about 2.15 Å; the S—O bonds are rather short with a bond length of 1.43 Å.|$|E
40|$|Most of the disulfuric acids like thiosulfuric acid (H 2 S 2 O 3), {{dithionous acid}} (H 2 S 2 O 4), disulfurous acid, (H 2 S 2 O 5), <b>dithionic</b> <b>acid</b> (H 2 S 2 O 6), disulfuric acid (H 2 S 2 O 7) and peroxydisulfuric acid (H 2 S 2 O 8) {{have never been}} {{obtained}} as pure compounds, {{because they are not}} stable at ambient temperatures. Therefore no experimental evidences are known for their structures. In this thesis, the synthesis and spectroscopical characterization of the disulfuric acids H 2 S 2 Ox (x = 3, 4, 6, 8) is presented. The compounds were obtained by the reaction of dry Na 2 S 2 Ox or K 2 S 2 Ox with anhydrous HF at − 60 °C. The protonated species H 3 S 2 Oy+MF 6 − (y = 3 - 8) were synthesized and characterized using the superacidic systems HF/MF 5 (M = As, Sb). The protonation of sulfuric acid, (H 3 SO 4 +) n(GeF 5 −) n, with the new superacidic system HF/GeF 4 is presented and gives evidence for the acid strength of this system. Moreover, the first single crystal structure of protonated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), [(CH 3) 2 SOH+] 4 [Ge 3 F 16] 4 − is discussed. The protonated forms of the aminosulfonic acids NH 3 SO 3, NH 3 CH 2 SO 3, NH 3 C 2 H 4 SO 3 and methanesulfonamide (CH 3 SO 2 NH 2) are described. In this context, the first crystal structure of protonated taurine, NH 3 C 2 H 4 SO 3 H+SbF 6 − is discussed...|$|E
