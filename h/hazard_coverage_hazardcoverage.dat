40|$|Deposit {{insurance}} schemes were {{an important element}} in policy responses to the global financial crisis (GFC). There has been considerable debate about the nature and efficacy of such policy measures in alleviating the fallout from financial crises. The GFC highlighted problems associated with deposit {{insurance schemes}} including moral <b>hazard,</b> <b>coverage</b> limits, co-insurance, cross border issues and market distortions. Despite these shortcomings, deposit insurance schemes were able to ameliorate the financial panic experienced and reduce contagion. This paper evaluates the Australian and New Zealand experience with deposit insurance introduced in response to the GFC, and compares this to the OECD experience. It reflects on the performance of deposit insurance schemes considered against the attributes of good policy design, and evaluates the specific problems and strengths encountered during the GFC...|$|R

This paper explains this inconsistency in terms of individual reaction to <b>hazards,</b> media <b>coverage</b> of <b>hazards,</b> and different ability of individuals to respond to health information; political leaders' preference for high-technology science, distortion and opposition by commercial interests, bureaucratic maneuvering for power and resources; and uncertainty and asymmetry of some scientific findings. public health science policy impediments...|$|R
40|$|Java, {{the most}} densely {{populated}} island in Indonesia, {{is located on}} top of the most seismically active areas in Southeast Asia: the Sunda Megathrust. This area is frequently hit by strong earthquake. More than 3, 300 M> 5 earthquakesoccurred between 1973 - 2014. The wide range of mountainous areas and high intensity of rainfall, make several part of the island one of the most exposed regions for coseismic landslides such as Baturagung area, the Southeast mountainous area of Yogyakarta Province. An integrated method between RS and GIS was used to conduct the vulnerability assessment {{due to the lack of}} the site specific slope instability analysis and coseismic landslides data. The seismic zonation of Baturagung area was obtained based on the analysis of Kanai attenuation. The geologic information was extracted using remote sensing interpretation based on the 1 : 100, 000 geologic map of Yogyakarta and geomorphologic map of Baturagung area as well. The coseismic landslide hazard assessment has been estimated using scoring analysis in the GIS platform proposed by Mora and Vahrson (1993) with several modification. The accomplished coseismic landslide hazard map shows medium <b>hazard</b> <b>coverage</b> in the eastern areas, in the upper slope of Baturagung area, which consists of Semilir Formation. The result provides a distinct description of coseismic landslides hazard distribution in Batuaragung area. However, it should only be the preliminary assessment of the site specific investigation especially on valuable area or asset...|$|R

40|$|Large {{quantities}} {{of toxic chemicals}} are stored at industrial facilities and transported around the country via train and truck. In {{the event of an}} accidental release, many of these chemicals are released as heavier-than-air gases that stay low to the ground as they are transported by the wind. Breathing height concentrations can remain high due to reduced vertical mixing and <b>hazard</b> zone <b>coverage</b> area can be larger due to near-source gravitational slumping. A number of fast-response dense gas dispersion models have been developed and are routinely used to deal with heavier-than-air releases over unobstructed terrain. If a release were to occur in a built-up environment, however, the effects of buildings and other obstacles will significantly alter the initial spreading, the transport direction, and the amount of mixing of the dense gas cloud. We have developed a new fast-running dense gas dispersion model that is intended for handling releases in cities and at large industrial facilities. In this paper we describe the scheme employed and how the model has been integrated into the Quick Urban & Industrial Complex (QUIC) dispersion modeling system...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid measurement-based (MB) {{approaches}} for computing WCET estimates are gaining popularity due to difficulties modelling advanced microprocessor speed-up features. These approaches combine measured data of program segments by using static analysis techniques {{in order to}} reconstruct the longest path through the program. To this end, execution times of program segments are collected by first instrumenting, and then testing, the program. However, the test phase must exercise the WCET between each pair of instrumentation points in order to enable safe re-combination of these data in the calculation stage. In general, exhaustive testing is not permissible, thus coverage criteria are required which give a quantitative view {{of the quality of}} the test phase. Often, such criteria within the functional domain, e. g. branch coverage and MC/DC, are insufficient because temporal properties are not considered. This deficiency becomes an issue for advanced mircoprocessors which almost certainly include pipelines and caches, amongst others. In this paper, we introduce the notion of WCET coverage, which are criteria to be integrated into hybrid MB WCET analysis, by focusing on three metrics for programs executing on pipelined processors. Each metric utilises the instrumentation point graph (IPG) - a program model typically used in hybrid MB WCET analysis- as a measure of coverage. The most straightforward criteria, simple pipeline coverage, covers the pipeline effect on each IPG edge. This is subsumed by pairwise pipeline coverage, which attempts to cover the pipeline effect between adjacent IPG edges. A stronger criteria, pipeline <b>hazard</b> path <b>coverage,</b> utilises properties of the pipeline to identify potential sources of hazards, either structural or data, in the program and maps this information onto the IPG. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{recorded}} natural hazards has increased throughout {{the past four}} decades and recent events such as the L’Aquila, Italy earthquake and the Sichuan, China earthquake demonstrate the persistent threat posed by such events. When a natural hazard occurs, the ensuing disruption to society is more often than not captured and reported by the news media. Thus, the news media is a valuable source of natural hazard event information. However, much of the previous work utilising natural hazard news media has focused on manual collation and examination of printed news media on a country- or event-specific basis. The Internet allows for real-time communication and broadcasting of natural hazards information and provides an ever-growing archive of the temporal and spatial patterns within natural hazard event occurrence. Thus, an alternative technique of news media collation, using web-based news media sources, is presented throughout this study. Two web-based natural hazard news media databases were created and information pertaining to the temporal and spatial occurrence of earthquakes, floods and landslides over a five year period (2005 - 2009) was collated. This thesis will examine the data generated by both databases and will focus upon the understanding of the temporal and spatial variability in news media <b>coverage</b> of natural <b>hazard</b> events. Statistical analysis of temporal and spatial trends within recorded news media <b>coverage</b> of <b>hazard</b> events is presented. Analysis of long-term time series data is coupled with an in-depth short-term analysis of individual <b>hazard</b> event <b>coverage.</b> In addition to the statistical analysis of identified trends, this study will explore the characteristics of media response to natural hazards {{within the context of the}} wider socio-political climate. It is proposed that the geophysical processes involved within each hazard event type, coupled with event-specific characteristics (fatalities, location etc.), control the subsequent news media coverage of an individual event. A series of natural hazard news media models are presented to show the inherent differences within recorded <b>coverage</b> of natural <b>hazard</b> event types...|$|R
40|$|Hazard {{analysis}} for safety-critical systems require sufficient coverage and rigour to instill {{confidence that the}} majority of hazardous consequences have been identified. These requirements are commonly met through the use of exhaustive hazard analysis techniques. However, such techniques are time consuming and error-prone. As an attempt at exhaustive <b>coverage,</b> <b>hazard</b> analysts typically employ reuse mechanisms such as copy-and-paste. Unfortunately, if reuse is applied inappropriately there is a risk that the reuse is at the cost of rigour in the analysis. This potential risk to the validity of the analysis is dependent on the nature and amount of reuse applied. This paper investigates hazard analysis reuse over two case studies. Initially reuse in an existing safety argument is described. Argument structures within the hazard analysis are identified and the amount of verbatim reuse examined. A second study is concerned with how reuse changes as a result of tool support. In contrast to the first case, the defined arguments are more diverse—reuse has occurred but is less verbatim in nature. Although tool support has aided the customisation of the reused arguments, many are only trivially customised. An edit distance algorithm is utilised to identify and enumerate verbatim and trivial reuse in the arguments. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{theoretical}} model of input supply by agricultural producers who purchase crop insurance and so who may engage in moral hazard. We show, through simulations, {{that a combination}} of partial insurance coverage combined with a minimum standard for input use may reduce substantially the problems associated with moral <b>hazard.</b> Partial insurance <b>coverage</b> creates an incentive for the producer to increase his use of inputs since the cost of lower output is partially borne by the producer, an outcome which would not be present under full coverage insurance. Partial monitoring of inputs, {{in the form of a}} minimum requirement for input use, has a direct effect on the reduction of moral hazard. We show that, rather than being substitute instruments, these are in fact complementary methods of encouraging a more efficient supply of inputs. Moreover, the minimum level of input use that must be required by regulation turns over to be substantially lower than the optimal or actual input level chosen by producers. Since the supply of inputs for crop production occurs in many stages over the pre-planting, planting and growing seasons, the fact that only a minimal input requirement is needed means that the cost of implementing such a regulation can be kept much lower than would be the case for a regulation of complete monitoring of input usage.

40|$|This study {{builds a}} {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} yield-based MPCI crop insurance policy for a risk averse rice farmer in Indonesia and presents the comparative statics analysis of policy variables on yield through the coupling, wealth, and insurance effects. Moreover, Using yield data from 1979 to 2014 for the Tuban Regency, this study applies numerical optimization to the model and simulates the effects of different policies on input use, certainty equivalents, indemnity payment, and premiums. The theoretical analysis shows that no coupling effect exists for change in the coverage level, while a coupling effect exists for change in the subsidy implying that farmers can impact {{the size of their}} payments by adjusting inputs and thus yield. For wealth effect, if the price market higher than the average cost of production, the wealth effect is ambiguous. If the price market smaller than the average cost of production, the wealth effect for the coverage levels is ambiguous, while the wealth effect for subsidy levels is negative, indicating a marginal increase in the subsidy reduces input use. For insurance effect, the analysis shows a positive sign for coverage level, revealing that an increase in the coverage level triggers the farmer using more inputs. On the other hand, the insurance effect for subsidy levels generates a negative sign, where higher subsidy cause the farmer to reduce input use. The numerical analysis shows that MPCI crop insurance indicates a moral <b>hazard.</b> At <b>coverage</b> levels of 30 % and above, the farmer does not expect to receive any indemnity payment. However, for coverage levels at or above 40 %, the farmer expects indemnity payments, which triggers a reduction in input use as the farmer tries to maximize both insurance payments and market revenue simultaneously. For certainty equivalent, farmers prefer the highest coverage level. For expected indemnity and insurance payment, farmers receive the highest payment for the largest high coverage level and subsidy. Hence, the result indicates that MPCI insurance with high coverage levels and low premium subsidies is suggested to Indonesian government since such policy results improving the farmers’ wellbeing while mitigating moral hazard facing the insurance provider...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The Safe Drinking Water Act {{ensures that}} public systems provide water that meets health standards. However, no such {{protection}} exists {{for millions of}} Americans who obtain water from private wells. Concern for safety is warranted as most wells draw from underground aquifers, and studies demonstrate that groundwater is affected by a range of contaminants, most often nitrate. Oregon's Domestic Well Testing Act (DWTA) links well testing to property sales, enabling continuous data collection by the State. This research addresses a need for identifying datasets for characterizing exposure to private well contaminants by evaluating DWTA data {{for use in a}} sentinel surveillance system. Validation of DWTA data was accomplished by developing a land use regression (LUR) model based on agricultural nitrogen inputs and soil leachability to predict nitrate concentrations in well water. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to advance methods for high resolution spatial modeling of fertilizer and manure nitrogen with statewide <b>coverage.</b> <b>Hazard</b> mapping with these datasets suggests that nearly half of recently drilled wells are susceptible to nitrate contamination. Spearman's rank correlation demonstrated a significant correlation between LUR-predicted nitrate levels and levels reported in the DWTA dataset. These results suggest that DWTA data is valid for use in a sentinel surveillance system, such that evidence of nitrate contamination in a single well may indicate an area-wide health hazard. However, a low fraction of variance explained by the LUR model highlighted the need for specific improvements to datasets crucial for understanding nitrate contamination in well water, including the DWTA...|$|R
40|$|The classic {{model of}} moral hazard {{suggests}} that health insurance may reduce preventive care because the insurer {{will pay for}} part of the treatment in case of disease. However, if health insurance covers preventive care as well, the reduced cost of preventive care will encourage the insured to consume more preventive care. These two countervailing effects are referred to as ex ante and ex post moral hazards (Zweifel & Manning 2000). Most studies do not distinguish the two effects, leading to a potentially wrong characterization of moral <b>hazard.</b> Using Medicare <b>coverage</b> as an example, this thesis identifies ex ante and ex post moral hazard effects of health insurance on cancer prevention. As we know, Medicare eligibility rules increase health insurance coverage at age 65. However, some preventive screenings were not covered in Medicare until recently. The different timing of Medicare eligibility and Medicare expansion of preventive care allows me to use a difference-in-differences framework to separate ex ante and ex post moral hazards. I focus on female uptake of breast cancer screening and male uptake of prostate cancer screening, using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). In both datasets, I find evidence in support of ex ante and ex post moral hazards. No evidence shows that people try to delay screening until it has been covered by Medicare. Moreover, the level of prevention and responsiveness to insurance changes vary with demographics, with larger effects among whites and the better-educated. Then I take a second look at the moral hazard problem in the health insurance market using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Compared with MEPS or NHIS, the panel nature of HRS allows me to control for individual fixed effects and therefore provides a more stringent test. The major findings on breast cancer screening are consistent. I find strong ex ante and ex post moral hazard effects in it, and individual reactions to Medicare enrollment and Medicare's preventive care coverage vary by factors such as race and income. However, moral hazards on prostate cancer screening is not found, mainly due to data limitation...|$|R
