5|$|While {{some forms}} of birth control do not affect the menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback <b>decreases</b> <b>the</b> pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which <b>decreases</b> <b>the</b> release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
30|$|The primary {{drawback}} to our high-precision STEM technique {{is the large}} dose resulting from {{the large amount of}} images required to get the increased SNR. This makes high-precision imaging either difficult or impossible for beam-sensitive materials. Four common methods to attempt to <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose usually have adverse effects on the image precision. First, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> pixel dwell time will <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose to the sample, but it will also <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> signal collected at each pixel and <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> SNR, possibly compromising the image precision. Second, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> probe current will <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose to the sample, but it will also have a similar effect as decreased dwell time. Third, increasing the pixel size by sampling the same area of the specimen with a coarser grid will <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose to the sample, but it will also <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> number of pixels per atomic column, possibly reducing the ability to locate the atomic column positions and compromising the image precision. Fourth, increasing the pixel size by <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> microscope’s image magnification while keeping the same number of pixels in <b>the</b> image will <b>decrease</b> <b>the</b> dose to the sample, but it could have a similar effect as using fewer pixels. Here, we show that <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> electron dose by acquiring course-sampled HAADF STEM images can preserve high precision in locating atomic columns.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> skip zone is by <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> {{frequency}} of <b>the</b> radio waves. <b>Decreasing</b> <b>the</b> frequency {{is akin to}} increasing the ionospheric width. A point is eventually reached when <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> frequency results in a zero distance skip zone. In other words, a frequency exists for which vertically incident radio waves will always be refracted back to the Earth. This frequency {{is equivalent to the}} ionospheric plasma frequency and is also known as the ionospheric critical frequency, or foF2.|$|R

5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower flammable limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited.

When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E
5|$|Each {{radioactive}} isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that {{is determined by}} the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily <b>decreases</b> <b>the</b> proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency <b>decreases</b> <b>the</b> average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E

5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure <b>decreases</b> <b>the</b> activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E
5|$|Monthly {{rainfall}} {{is greater}} downwind of cities, partially {{due to the}} UHI. Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of growing seasons, and <b>decreases</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of weak tornadoes.

5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into {{more and more}} threads, those threads spend an {{ever-increasing}} portion of their time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent solving the problem, and further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than <b>decreases</b> <b>the</b> amount of time required to finish. This is known as parallel slowdown.|$|E

40|$|Casinos {{could help}} inhibit the {{development}} of pathological gambling by limiting the contributions they make to {{the development of}} pathology among gamblers. Reasonable strategies for limiting pathology might include limiting the size of jackpots, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> length of play, limiting access, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> rate of play, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> arousal of patrons, <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> variability of games, and <b>decreasing</b> <b>the</b> inducements to play. These strategies could be employed in the domains of accessibility, environment, game structure, promotion|marketing, education and treatment. The author argues that the implementation of these strategies would not only inhibit the development of pathological gambling, but might also benefit the casinos and society. The suggested changes in casinos offers a focal point for further research and further dialogues between clinicians and casino operators. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
