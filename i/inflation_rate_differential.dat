40|$|Developing an {{understanding}} of exchange rate movements {{has long been an}} extremely important task because an ability to produce accurate forecasts of exchange rates has practical as well as theoretical value. The practical value lies in the ability of good forecasts to provide useful information for investors in asset allocation, business firms in risk hedging, and governments in policy making. On the theoretical side, whether a currency price is predictable or not has important implications for the efficient market hypothesis in the foreign exchange market and for theoretical modelling in international finance. Owing to the importance of the movements of exchange rates in our real life, such as financial hedges and investment abroad, this research investigates the possibility of an accurate pattern of the exchange rate movement. The purpose of this research is to carry out an empirical investigation into the extent to which nonlinear econometric models can improve upon the predictability of foreign exchange rates compared to a standard regression model. We will use the artificial neural network approach and employ macroeconomic fundamental variables, including relative money supply, relative income, interest rate differential and <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differential</b> to examine whether or not the artificial neural network model could significantly improve the accuracy of describing the movement of exchange rates and the predictability of exchange rates, especially out-of-sample.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} inflation rate differentials between seven Central and Eastern Countries (CEECs) and the Eurozone. We focus explicitly upon {{a group of}} CEECs given that although they are already member states, they are currently {{not part of the}} Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and must fulfil the Maastricht convergence criteria before being able to adopt the euro. However, this group of countries does not have an opt-out clause and so must eventually adopt the single currency. Hence, considering divergence in inflation rates between each country and the Eurozone is important in that evidence of persistent differences may increase the chance of asymmetric inflationary shocks. Furthermore, once a country joins the Eurozone the operation of a country specific monetary policy is no longer an option. We explicitly test for convergence in the inflation rate differentials, incorporating non-linearities in the autoregressive parameters, fractional integration with endogenous structural changes, and also consider club convergence analysis for the CEECs over the period 1997 to 2011 based on monthly data. Our empirical findings suggest that the majority of countries experience non-linearities in the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differential,</b> however there is only evidence of a persistent difference in three out of the seven countries.

In a well-known study, Rogers (2007) works with data of cities from Europe and the USA (1990 – 2004). He highlights {{that there is a}} striking decline in dispersion for traded goods prices in Europe, most of which took place prior to the launch of the euro. Still, this process has not yet significantly affected the cross-city ordering of price levels. That dispersion in the euro area would be now quite close to that of the USA. Several potential factors responsible for the decline in dispersion in Europe are the harmonization of tax rates, convergence of income and labor costs, liberalization of trade and factor markets, and increased coherence of monetary policy. This study also concludes that the Balassa–Samuelson effect does not explain much of the observed <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> across European cities. Rogers (2001, 2007) point out that despite an on-going process of convergence, deviations from the “law of one price” are still large.

Inflation and real interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> have to substantial degree the ability to measure the divergence among the member countries of a monetary union. A number of empirical studies measuring the differentials in the Euro area were conducted {{since the start of}} the financial crisis in 2008. These studies show growing inflation and real interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> among the countries of the Euro area, argue that the European Monetary Union is becoming less stable and often question its future. This paper conducts similar empirical analysis; however, it differs from the above mentioned works of other authors by the larger time gap between the start of financial crisis and the time of conducting the analysis as it uses data until the year of 2013. This paper also contributes to current literature by the methodology it uses.

40|$|Abstract The {{purchasing}} power parity puzzle, exchange rate disconnection to macroeconomic fundamentals and pricing to market are central issues of international macroeconomics. Recent research {{has suggested that}} these issues can be presented by nonlinear behaviour. In this dissertation, we examine and explain the nonlinearities in the form of regime switching behaviour in real exchange rate series, exchange rate and macroeconomic fundamentals relation and exchange rate pass-through into consumer and import prices. Overall, we find evidence that nonlinearities are important in analysing empirical exchange rate models. The dissertation consists of four self-contained empirical studies. In chapter 2 we examine whether the Markov switching models and exponential smooth transition autoregressive models can give any additional insights into real exchange rate behaviour for several OECD countries. The results show that there are long swings in the real exchange rate series, which can be characterize as a depreciation and an appreciation regime. These regimes are very persistent, although the processes are eventually mean reverting. We estimate a multivariate smooth transition autoregressive model for the euro/dollar exchange rate in chapter 3. The significant point of our analysis is the possibility that a nonlinear specification for the exchange rate series might reveal aspects of the exchange rate dynamics that cannot be picked up by linear models. We find that the euro/dollar exchange rate may display random walk or near random walk behaviour within a certain range but the ability of the exchange rate to wander without any bound is limited by long-term government bond interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials.</b> In chapter 4 we examine nonlinear relationships between macroeconomic fundamentals and exchange rate for G- 7 countries. We estimate a smooth transition error correction model that allows for parameter variation in the error correction form and interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials.</b> The nonlinearity is determined by the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> between countries. We find significant error correction terms in monetary models. Our findings suggest the importance of nonlinear dynamics for examining deviations from the long-run equilibrium. We examine whether the degree of exchange rate pass-through is dependent on importing country <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> in chapter 5. Our model shows that import prices respond differently to exchange rate changes when we are in a high inflation regime compared to a low inflation regime. We also present empirical evidence by estimating pass-through elasticises for several OECD countries. We find that consumer prices are not very sensitive to exchange rate changes. For aggregate import prices, we find partial or full exchange rate pass-throughs. The tested nonlinear regime specific models proved appropriate for testing exchange rate dynamics for several currency pairs. Furthermore, we were able to present that macroeconomic fundamentals are important predictors of exchange rates...|$|R

However, interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> appear to add nothing to this long-run relationship. Estimated error correction models suggest that there is a substantial two-way relationship between nominal exchange rate changes and changes in the terms of trade. This {{evidence indicates}} that the small, open-economy assumption of exogenously given terms of trade may be inappropriate when modelling movements in the US$/A$ exchange rate. Changes in a long-run interest <b>rate</b> <b>differential,</b> possibly reflecting differences in expected <b>inflation</b> <b>rates,</b> contribute significantly to an explanation of short-run changes in the nominal exchange rate.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we empirically test {{the effects of}} fiscal and {{monetary}} policies on real exchange rates for Turkey for the period 1990 - 2003. The analyzed period is characterized by large budget deficits, high and variable <b>inflation</b> <b>rates.</b> To assess the effects of fiscal and monetary polices on exchange rate we estimate a 5 -variable VAR model for budget deficits, money supply, exchange rates, output, and interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials.</b> The results suggest that expansionary fiscal policy appreciates real exchange rate whereas the effect of monetary shock is statistically insignificant. Innovations in interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> and output also cause to appreciation of Turkish Lira. The results of variance decomposition suggest {{that the effects of}} fiscal policy on real exchange rates are more pronounced than the effects of monetary policy. Our results are consistent with fiscal theory of exchange rates. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} stochastic convergence of the original Euro Area countries for <b>inflation</b> <b>rates,</b> nominal interest rates, and real interest rates. We test for convergence relative to Germany, taken as the benchmark for core EU standards, using monthly data over the period January 2001 to September 2010. We examine, in a time-series framework, three different profiles of the convergence process: linear convergence, nonlinear convergence, and linear segmented convergence. Our findings both contradict and support convergence. Stochastic convergence implies the rejection of a unit root in the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate,</b> nominal interest rate, and real interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials.</b> We find that the differentials are consistent with a unit-root hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is I(0) with a linear trend. But we frequently, but not always, reject the unit-root hypothesis when the alternative is I(0) with a broken trend. We also note that the current financial crisis {{plays a significant role}} in dating the breaks. Stochastic convergence, Nonlinearity, Unit-root tests, Structural breaks. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of convergence of the ASEAN 5 plus the big three for nominal interest <b>rates,</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>rates,</b> and real interest rates. We test for convergence relative to the U. S and Japan, using monthly data over the period January 1990 - December 2010, using non-linear unit root tests. The results show strong evidence of stationary inflation and real interest <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> in all but China’s inflation differential relative to the U. S., and stationary nominal interest differentials {{in most of the}} cases. We interpret these results as convergence in <b>inflation</b> <b>rates</b> and real interest rates in all cases, and as nominal interest convergence in most of the cases. Moreover, examining the impact of the Asian crisis shows less number of convergences before the crisis and more convergences after the crisis. This suggests that convergence has increased after the 1997 / 98 Asian crisis, and that the crisis has pulled the economies together. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the Phillips curve in Italy, using the wage <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> as a dependent variable, based on annual data from the period 1961 - 2012, using the Johansen Method, allows us to conclude two things. Firstly, in the long term, there are two long-term relationships: the wage <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> relates positively to the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate,</b> negatively to the unemployment rate and positively to the average labour productivity growth index, as was expected; the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> relates positively to the wage <b>inflation</b> <b>rate,</b> negatively to the unemployment rate and positively to the average labour productivity growth index, as was expected. Secondly, in the short term, the variation of the wage <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> relates positively and significantly to the error correction mechanism of the first long-term relationship; therefore, {{there is a significant}} response to the equilibrium error between the wage <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> and its determinants (<b>inflation</b> <b>rate,</b> unemployment rate, labour productivity growth index). Besides this adjustment, the variation of wage <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> responds significantly and negatively to the variation in unemployment rate and significantly and positively to the average labour productivity growth...|$|R
