No atomizer has been developed able to produce uniform (monodisperse) droplets, but rotary (spinning disc and cage) atomizers usually produce a more uniform <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrum</b> than conventional hydraulic nozzles (see: CDA & ULV application equipment).

While not a new technique, hygroscopic seeding for enhancement of rainfall in warm clouds is enjoying a revival, based on some positive indications from research in South Africa, Mexico, and elsewhere. The hygroscopic material most commonly used is table salt. It is postulated that hygroscopic seeding causes the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrum</b> in clouds to become more maritime (bigger drops) and less continental, stimulating rainfall through coalescence. From March 1967 until July 1972, the US military's Operation Popeye cloud-seeded silver iodide to extend the monsoon season over North Vietnam, specifically the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

40|$|AbstractWe study condensational {{growth of}} {{droplets}} {{in the presence}} of turbulent mixing, which is relevant during entrainment of dry air into clouds. The aim here is to understand the role of the initial shape of the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> on the final droplet spectra, at the end of turbulent mixing of the air parcel. Using numerical computations, we model the growth of droplets by resolving each <b>droplet,</b> evolving their <b>size</b> (radius) and temperature. The ambient atmosphere can be modeled as being either well-mixed (homogeneous) or inhomogeneous. In the well-mixed model, all droplets interact with the same ambient temperature field and vapor density. In the inhomogeneous model, the droplets interact with the local values of temperature and vapor density. To simulate cloud entrainment, we initially partion the domain into a dry and a wet region. The wet region contains droplets, along with supersaturated vapor. The dry region contains only subsaturated vapor. A 2 D synthetic turbulence field has been imposed on the droplet, vapor and temperature field. We observe that if the initial <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> contains significant number of large droplets, then there is little difference between the final droplet spectra predicted by the well-mixed and inhomogeneous models. This occurs because the large droplets release vapor relatively quickly in subsaturated conditions, and immediately saturate the dry air into which they gets mixed, thus “freezing” the rest of the <b>size</b> <b>spectra.</b> Our theoretical analysis predicts that, for a given turbulence eddy turnover rate, a family of <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> exists whose evolution will be well predicted by the “well-mixed” models.

This study included the characterization of the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrum,</b> via laser diffraction instrument, generated by three blades angles, of 45, 60 and 75 degrees. The spray solution was composed of Picoxystrobin+ Cyproconazole fungicide (SC), at 20 mL c. p. L&# 8722; 1, and at a flow rate of 6 L min&# 8722; 1. As the angle decreased from 75 to 45 degrees, the rotational speed of the atomizers increased and the volume median diameter (VMD) decreased. However, increasing the rotational speed also increased the percentage of droplets smaller than 100 µm (% < 100 µm). At the blade angles of 45 and 60 degrees the atomizers showed that % < 100 µm was higher than 20 % and VMD was smaller than 198 µm. The disc type atomizer resulted in the lower values of relative span (RS). The use of 75 degrees blade angle produced the highest values of VMD and the lowest values of % < 100 µm; these parameters were also affected by atomizer model and brand...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we present a series of LES {{simulations}} employing the Super-Droplet Method (SDM) for representing aerosol, cloud and rain microphysics. SDM is a particle-based and probabilistic approach in which a Monte-Carlo type algorithm is used for solving the particle collisions and coalescence process. The model does not differentiate between aerosol particles, cloud droplets, drizzle or rain drops. Consequently, it covers representation of such cloud-microphysical processes as: CCN activation, drizzle formation by autoconversion, accretion of cloud droplets, self-collection of raindrops and precipitation including aerosol wet deposition. Among the salient features of the SDM, there are: (i) the robustness of the model formulation (i. e. employment of basic principles rather than parametrisations) and (ii) the ease of comparison of the model results with experimental data obtained with particle-counting instruments. The model set-up {{used in the study}} is based on observations from the Rain In Cumulus over Ocean (RICO) field project (the GEWEX Cloud System Study Boundary Layer Cloud Working Group RICO case). Cloud and rain <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrum</b> features obtained in the simulations are compared with previously published aircraft observations carried out during the RICO field project.

In this paper we present the results of a {{dermal exposure}} assessment for the potato farming system in the highlands of Colombia, where farmers apply pesticides with hand pressure sprayers without any personal protective equipment.

We assessed the three activities involved in pesticide management: preparation, application, and cleaning; analyzed three types of nozzles: one with a standard discharge and two modified by farmers to increase the discharge; and derived the protection factor given by work clothing.

The <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> were measured in a wind tunnel for an Accu-Flo nozzle (with 16 size 0. 085 [2. 16 mm] orifices), under appropriate simulated aircraft speeds (up to 333 km/h), using a laser diffraction instrument covering a dynamic <b>size</b> range for <b>droplets</b> of 0. 5 to 3, 500 m. The spray drift potential of the glyphosate was modeled using the AGDISP spray application and drift model, using input parameters representative of those occurring in Colombia for typical aerial application operations. The <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> for tank mixes containing glyphosate and Cosmo-Flux were considerably finer than water and became finer with higher aircraft speeds. The tank mix with 44 % glyphosate had a Dv 0. 5 of 128 m, while the value at the 4. 9 % glyphosate rate was 140 m. These are classified as very fine to fine sprays. Despite being relatively fine, modeling showed that the droplets would not evaporate as rapidly as most similarly sized agricultural sprays because the nonvolatile proportion of the tank mix (active and inert adjuvant ingredients) was large. Thus, longer range drift is small and most drift that does occur will deposit relatively close to the application area. Drift will only occur downwind and, with winds of velocity less than the modeled maximum of 9 km/h, the drift distance would be substantially reduced. Spray drift potential might be additionally reduced through various practices such as the selection of nozzles, tank mix adjuvants, aircraft speeds, and spray pressures that would produce coarser sprays. Species sensitivity distributions to glyphosate were constructed for plants and amphibians. Based on modeled drift and 5 th centile concentrations, appropriate no-spray buffer zones (distance {{from the end of the}} spray boom as recorded electronically 5 %) for protection of sensitive plants were 50 - 120 m for coca spray scenarios and considerably lower for poppy spray scenarios.

The <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> were measured for these 15 spray mixtures using a Malvern Particle Sizer and characterised by the Volume Median Diameter (VMD) {{and the percentage of}} liquid contained in droplets less than 100 m (% < 100 m). Horizontal ground drift was measured in a wind tunnel, on glass fibre collectors using a fluorescent tracer dye technique. The relative drift of each spray mixture was characterised by the Drifted Part (DP) which is the part of the sprayed volume drifted between 2 and 6 metres. Although the nozzle type was the predominating parameter regarding to the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> and the DP, differences were observed due to the liquids characteristics. The EC formulation produced a smaller <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> and a greater DP than the SC formulation whatever the tank mix adjuvant used.

Activation and regeneration of aerosols are treated explicitly in {{the calculation of}} condensation/evaporation. The model includes a 2 -D spectrum that encompasses wet aerosol particles (i. e., haze droplets), cloud droplets, and drizzle droplets in a continuous and consistent manner and allows for the explicit tracking of aerosol size within cloud droplets due to collision-coalescence. The system of differential equations describing condensation/evaporation (i. e., mass conservation and energy conservation) is solved simultaneously within each grid cell. The model is demonstrated by simulating a marine stratocumulus deck for two different aerosol loadings (100 and 500 cm − 3), and comparison with the more traditional microphysics modeling approaches (both 1 -D bin and bulk schemes) is evaluated. The simulations suggest that in a 1 -D bin microphysics scheme, without regeneration, too few particles are produced and hence the mode of the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrum</b> occurs at a larger size relative to the 2 -D bin model results.

We showed that Mie scattering led to spikes in the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distributions using the default sizing procedure, while the new stochastic approach reproduced the ambient size distribution adequately. A detailed analysis of the FM- 100 sampling efficiency revealed that particle losses were typically below 10 % for droplet diameters up to 10 μm.

Comparisons of the FM- 100 to other reference instruments revealed that the total liquid water content (LWC) measured by the FM- 100 was more sensitive to particle losses than to re-sizing based on Mie scattering, while the total number concentration was only marginally influenced by particle losses. Consequently, for further LWC measurements with the FM- 100 we strongly recommend to consider (1) the error arising due to Mie scattering, and (2) the particle losses, especially for larger droplets depending on the set-up and wind conditions...|$|R

Two spray nozzles (a D 6 - 46 nozzle and a D 2 straight stream nozzle) were evaluated in a high-speed wind tunnel at airspeeds of 45 and 58 m/sec.

The King probe responds to drops larger than cloud <b>droplet</b> <b>size,</b> so its reading can be larger than the cloud LWC present. Published studies involving cloud LWC in convective storms based on readings of the T- 28 J-W probe have overestimated the effects of entrainment and precipitation scavenging on updraft liquid water, particularly in those areas characterized by clouds with broad cloud <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra,</b> due to underestimates of liquid water concentration by the J-W probe. ...|$|R
40|$|Characterising {{agricultural}} sprays is {{a critical}} factor when investigating and predicting the spray drift, deposition on plants, spray coverage and biological efficacy. Hence to underpin a research project to predict spray drift, a measuring protocol to enable consistent characterisation of spray from nozzles used in agriculture using a Phase Doppler Particle Analyser (PDPA) was developed. The set-up measures <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> and velocities based on light-scattering principles. It comprises a controlled climate room, a spray unit, a three-dimensional automated positioning system, and an Aerometrics PDPA 1 D system. This paper presents {{a detailed description of}} the measuring set-up along with some experimental results. In total, 32 nozzle-pressure combinations were tested and spray quality categorized based on the British Crop Protection Council (BCPC) classification scheme using the measured <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra.</b> The results confirmed the importance of nozzle type and flow rate on <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> and their velocity The measurements will be used as an input for a Computational Fluid Dynamics drift-prediction model and to categorize nozzles based on their relative driftability...|$|R
40|$|A machine vision-based {{instrument}} to measure a <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrum</b> of a spray nozzle {{was developed and}} tested to evaluate its accuracy on measuring spray droplet sizes and classifying nozzle sizes. The instrument consisted of a machine vision, light emitting diode (LED) illumination and a desktop computer. The illumination and machine vision were controlled by the computer through a C++ program. The program controlled the machine vision to capture droplet images under controlled illumination, and processed the droplet images to characterize the droplet size distribution of a spray nozzle. An image processing algorithm was developed to improve {{the accuracy of the}} system by eliminating random noise and out-of-focus droplets in droplet images while measuring droplet sizes. The instrument measured sizes of the three different balls (254. 0, 497. 8 and 793. 8 µm) and the measurement ranges were 241. 2 - 273. 6 µm, 492. 9 - 529. 6 µm and 800. 8 - 824. 1 µm for 254. 0 -, 497. 84 - and 793. 75 - µm balls, respectively. Error of the measured droplet mean was less than 3. 0 %. Droplet statistics, DV 0. 1, DV 0. 5 and DV 0. 9, of a reference nozzle set were measured, and droplet size spectra of five spray nozzles covering from very fine to extremely coarse were measured to classify spray nozzle sizes. Ninety percent of the classification results of the instrument agreed with manufacturer’s classification. A comparison study was carried out between developed and commercial instruments, and measurement results of the developed instrument were within 20 % of commercial instrument results...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{processes}} in the chemical industry and in combustion science involve the evaporation of atomised liquids in a turbulent environment. To allow an optimisation of such processes and to provide data for the validation of numerical calculations, the spray evaporation in a heated turbulent air stream was studied experimentally. The flow configuration was a pipe expansion with an expansion ratio of 3, where heated air entered through an annulus with the hollow cone spray nozzle being mounted in the centre. In the experiments isopropyl alcohol {{was used as a}} liquid because of its high evaporation rate. Measurements were taken for different flow conditions, such as air flow I ate. air temperature, and liquid flow rate in order to provide a set of reliable data. Phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA) was applied to obtain the spatial change of the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrum</b> in the flow field and to measure droplet size-velocity correlations. From these local measurements profiles of droplet mean velocities, velocity fluctuations and droplet mean diameters were obtained by averaging over all droplet size classes. Moreover. recent extensions of the PDA signal processing allowed for accurate determination of the droplet mass Bur. from which also the global evaporation rates could also be determined. The data for the different flow conditions also include the inlet conditions for air flow and spray (i. e., for all three velocity components), inlet temperature, and wall temperature profiles. The latter were measured using a thermocouple with a special wall sensor. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Droplet size, {{which is}} {{affected}} by nozzle type, nozzle setups and operation, and spray solution, {{is one of the}} most critical factors influencing spray performance, environment pollution, food safety, and must be considered as part of any application scenario. Characterizing spray nozzles can be a timely and expensive proposition if the entire operational space (all combinations of spray pressure and orifice size, what influence flow rate) is to be evaluated. This research proposes a structured, experimental design that allows for the development of computational models for droplet size based on any combination of a nozzle’s potential operational settings. The developed droplet size determination model can be used as Decision Support System (DSS) for precise selection of sprayer working parameters to adapt to local field scenarios. Five nozzle types (designs) were evaluated across their complete range of orifice size (flow rate*) and spray pressures using a response surface experimental design. Several of the models showed high level fits of the modeled to the measured data while several did not as a result of the lack of significant effect from either orifice size (flow rate*) or spray pressure. The computational models were integrated into a spreadsheet based user interface for ease of use. The proposed experimental design provides for efficient nozzle evaluations and development of computational models that allow for the determination of <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrum</b> and spraying classification for any combination of a given nozzle’s operating settings. The proposed DSS will allow for the ready assessment and modification of a sprayers performance based on the operational settings, to ensure the application is made following recommendations in plant protection products (PPP) labels...|$|E
40|$|The {{modeling}} of convective storm scavenging processes is going forward on two distinct fronts. The {{first of these}} relates to the microphysical processes, particularly {{to the study of}} their response to micro-dynamical components of the convective circulation. It is found that the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> generated are responsive to variations of vertical velocity due to turbulence within the cloud and to humidity variations due to entrainment processes. Both sets of variations give responses that differ for different amplitudes and frequencies, i. e., rapid, small-amplitude eddies appear to enhance small-droplet development, whereas slow, large-amplitude oscillations tend to enhance large-droplet development. An allied study of the assumptions used in the microphysical equations is also being made. The second modeling effort is addressed to the problem of three-dimensional representation of convective dynamics. Equations are presented, and some of the problems under attack are discussed.

40|$|Attempts {{are being}} made to improve the methods used to {{characterize}} the drifting spray cloud used in mosquito control. Much work done in this field has relied on equipment inherited yet again from agricultural drift assessments. We however are concerned with smaller <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectrums.</b> Much work in agriculture is dealing with much larger volumes of chemical and {{a large proportion of}} the drift is significantly larger. Agriculture considers anything under 100 µm to be a drift threat we consider anything above 50 µm to be a deposition threat. At the time of application the meteorology is often not ideal for production of an effective adulticidal cloud, nor good collection efficiency due to low wind speeds. We have had to spend a great deal of time over the last two years working on improving our methodologies. I will introduce some of the most important changes made so far...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiments}} {{series is}} the first application of a low-gravity experimental technique {{to the study of}} cloud microphysics. The low-gravity environment is provided by the parabolic maneuver of NASA's KC- 135 aircraft. The primary objective is to compare experimental observations of cloud droplet growth and evaporation in a convection free environment with a numerical model of the process. Beyond that, the work also involves the development and testing of low-gravity research techniques. In particular, passive methods of thermal control have been devised and used effectively. The study to date has shown that the method is particularly suitable for looking at interactions between adjoining portions of the cloud drop field and interactions of the drop field with a solid interface. After final analysis of the data, it is expected the results will shed light on the development of cloud <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> <b>spectra</b> in natural clouds as well as the performance of certain types of cloud physics instrumentation, particularly continuous flow diffusion chambers and loud condensation nuclei counters...|$|R
