May it be thine: [...] Thy office, thy ambition, be henceforth [...] To feed remorse, to welcome every sting [...] Of penitential anguish, yea with tears. [...] When seas and continents shall lie between us-- [...] The wider space the better--we may find [...] In such a course fit links of sympathy, [...] An incommunicable rivalship [...] Maintained, for peaceful ends beyond our view. [...] [Confused voices--several of the Band enter--rush upon OSWALD and [...] seize him.] ...|$|E
