40|$|Summary. Results {{are given}} of wind-tunnel tests of a nacelle-shaped body fitted with two lifting fans in tandem. Lift, drag and {{pitching}} moment were measured {{both with the}} fans installed with axes vertical and also in a modified arrangement with 15 deg rearward tilt. In the latter case, the effects of simple inlet and exit cascades were also examined. The effects of aerodynamic interaction between efflux and mainstream were almost as serious for this slab-sided nacelle as when the same fan was installed in a large wing. The adverse effect on lift was slightly reduced by rearward movement of the fan when only one fan was in use and the other duct sealed, but a greater improvement was obtained when the front fan was used and allowed to induce additional downflow through the open rear duct thus reducing {{the magnitude of the}} lower surface suctions. Five-tube yawmeter traverses in the two vertical fan ducts just above the fans showed much less flow maldistribution at forward speeds compared with the <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> <b>wing</b> because of the 1 -diameter length of duct between surface and traverse station. The decay of the cross flow with depth and the effect of variation of one fan rotational speed upon the flow in the other duct were also examined...|$|E

50|$|The Vanguard C2 and C2D Omniplane had two fans side by side, {{with one}} <b>in</b> each <b>wing.</b> It {{underwent}} tethered trials between 1959 and 1962 but never flew untethered. In the late 1960s NASA conducted wind tunnel experiments {{on a series}} of larger aircraft designs using different numbers of <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> the <b>wings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The XV-5 was {{powered by}} two 2,658 lbf kN thrust General Electric J85-GE-5 turbojets. General Electric X353-5 Lift-fans <b>in</b> the <b>wings</b> {{and a smaller}} <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> the nose, powered by engine exhaust gas, were used for Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL). The 62.5 <b>in</b> {{diameter}} lift <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> each <b>wing</b> had a hinged cover on the upper wing surface which was opened for VTOL. The 36 <b>in</b> nose <b>fan</b> provided adequate pitch control but produced adverse handling characteristics. The fans provided vertical lift of approximately 16,000 lbf kN, nearly three times {{the thrust of the}} engines as turbojets.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{projects}} were announced in 2010 and 2011. The Ray passenger aircraft had four <b>fans</b> arranged approximately <b>in</b> a square, similarly to a quadrotor, {{with a small}} <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> front of a larger one behind it <b>in</b> each <b>wing.</b> [...] The Lockheed Martin VARIOUS was a multi-role military UAV with twin fans side by side, one <b>in</b> each <b>wing.</b> The Northrop MUVR ship-to-shore resupply aircraft similarly had a <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> each <b>wing.</b> Unlike these the Anglo-Italian AgustaWestland Project Zero hybrid tiltrotor/lift-fan unmanned technology demonstrator was actually built and flew successfully in 2011. It has side by side twin fans which can rotate into a vertical plane to act as propellers in forward flight, while still located within the wing structure.|$|R
40|$|A {{configuration}} with outboard pod mounted front {{fans and}} rear <b>fans</b> located <b>in</b> the <b>wing</b> trailing-edge and fuselage juncture might have superior induced lift and variation of moment with airspeed. A large scale investigation {{of this type}} of configuration was conducted in 40 - by 80 -foot wind tunnel. The model used was a low wing transport representative of currently operating aircraft. Two lift <b>fans</b> were placed <b>in</b> pods forward of and below the wing with the fan centerline near mid semi-span. Two rear fans were mounted at the wing trailing-edge close to the fuselage with the <b>fan</b> rotor <b>in</b> the <b>wing</b> chord plane. Fan performance was measured statically and with forward speed, and longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics were obtained with the fans operating at various tip-speed ratios...|$|R

5000|$|The Avro Canada Avrocar, {{commissioned}} by the USA, {{was intended to be}} a technology demonstrator for a supersonic VTOL aircraft. It featured a single central <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> a circular flying wing, with engine thrust directed rearwards for forward flight. It underwent trials between 1958 and 1961 but, due to its unstable [...] "flying saucer" [...] aerodynamics and lower than expected thrust, never flew out of ground effect. The Verticraft verticar of 1961 was a similar single-fan, directed-thrust, all-wing (or lifting body) aircraft, of conventional but very low-aspect-ratio wing planform. It failed to fly. A tandem-fan version was proposed but never built. By contrast the Ryan XV-5 Vertifan of 1964 was an otherwise conventional delta-wing jet. It had a large <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> each <b>wing</b> and a third, smaller <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> the nose to provide balance in pitch. It was more successful, with one of the two prototypes flying until 1971.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} principal results obtained from crossflow tests of a model 15 -in. -diam lift <b>fan</b> installed <b>in</b> a <b>wing</b> <b>in</b> the NASA Lewis Research Center, 9 by 15 ft V/STOL Propulsion Wind Tunnel. Tests were run with and without exit louvers over a range of tunnel air speeds, fan speeds, and wing angle of attack. <b>Fan</b> thrust <b>in</b> crossflow was influenced by two principal factors: the effects of inflow distortion on blade-row performance, and changes <b>in</b> <b>fan</b> stage operating point brought about by changes in back pressure ratio. <b>In</b> this particular <b>fan,</b> flow separation on the inlet bellmouth {{did not appear to}} be a serious problem for crossflow operation...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} for a wind tunnel investigation of three single VTOL lift fan stages {{designed for the}} same overall total pressure ratio at different rotor tip speeds. The stages were tested in a model lift <b>fan</b> installed <b>in</b> a <b>wing</b> pod. The three stages had essentially the same aerodynamic performance along the operating line. However, differences in stage thrust characteristics were obtained when a variation in back pressure was imposed on the stages by cross-flow effects and thrust-vectoring louvers...|$|R
5000|$|The {{next project}} was the XV-5 Vertifan, jointly {{developed}} by Ryan and General Electric, and first flown by Everett. [...] The Vertifan employed the lift fan concept to achieve vertical flight, diverting jet thrust to spin louvered <b>fans</b> <b>in</b> the <b>wings</b> and nose. On April 27, 1965, the two Vertifan prototypes made their public debut during a press demonstration at Edwards. One was to fly horizontally {{in front of}} the grandstand, while the other would convert from horizontal to vertical flight and descend. Everett was in the plane scheduled to descend. Flying at 180 kn and an altitude of 800 ft, he prepared to transition from conventional to fan mode, but the Vertifan unexpectedly pitched nose down. Everett ejected, but the ejection seat failed and his parachute caught on the plane’s high tail. He went down with the plane and was killed.|$|R
40|$|The {{low-speed}} aerodynamics of {{a large-scale}} triangular wing model, with a reduced thickness, tip-turbine driven lift <b>fan</b> <b>in</b> each <b>wing</b> were investigated <b>in</b> the Ames 40 -by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel.

The modification included removing the discharge stator and reducing the fan inlet length and radius. To control airflow separation resulting from small inlet radii, blowing boundary-layer control was applied through a nozzle in the inlet.

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of ancient Indian Knowledge of Vimanas, the Mini Rukma Vimana Unmanned Air Vehicle designs make a several advantages for many purposes as mentioned. The MRV UAV concept is proposed mainly to create VTOL, the lift fans configuration similar to Rukma vimana, {{hence the name}} Mini Rukma vimana Unmanned Air Vehicle. Lift fans are {{the main part of}} the MRV UAV. They can be used to go through mountainous regions. And fans are preferred other than wings for Vertical takeoff. The lift fans configuration is similar to Rukma vimana Mentioned in Vimanika shasthra. Based on Analysis for VTOL, UAVs are having lift <b>fans</b> embedded <b>in</b> <b>Wings.</b> But MRV UAV has simpler configuration, enabling the UAV to lift off with fans provided at the top of the UAV directly connected to the base of UAV with the help of Ducts. The Direction control can be achieved by operating the maneuvering fans acting as propellers, the UAV can move 360 degrees in at mid air in single position. Using the MRV UAV, the missions become much more simpler and easier to be carried out...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} for a reverberant-field noise investigation of three fan stages designed for the same overall total pressure ratio of 1. 21 at different rotor tip speeds (750, 900, and 1050 fps). The stages were tested statically in a 15 -in. -dia model lift <b>fan</b> installed <b>in</b> a <b>wing</b> pod located <b>in</b> the test section of a wind tunnel. Although the fan stages produced essentially the same design pressure ratio, marked differences were observed in the variation of fan noise with fan operating speed. At design speed, the forward-radiated sound power level was approximately {{the same for the}} 750 and 900 fps stages. For the 1050 fps stage, the design-speed forward-radiated power level was about 7 dB higher due to the generation of multiple pure tone noise...|$|R
40|$|FanWing is an {{aircraft}} configuration {{that uses a}} simple cross-flow <b>fan</b> mounted <b>in</b> the <b>wing</b> to provide both distributed propulsion and augmented wing lift at very low flying speeds. One of the current flight-test vehicles has been modified to accept both a novel OHS twin-tail arrangement and a new wing section and this has shown both increased flight stability and reduced drag, leading to significantly higher cruise speeds. The good slow flight capability, inherent safety and relatively quiet propulsion of the FanWing rotorcraft could fit well with cargo operations close to urban areas. A comparison with aircraft and helicopters showed that the recent developments of the FanWing concept could now uniquely offer short-field performance close to that of helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft, but with operating economies close to that of conventional aircraft...|$|R
