5|$|On April 2, 2011, Kinsler {{became the}} first player in major league history to hit a lead-off {{home run in the}} first two games of a season (giving him a total of 15 lead-off homers in his career). In his next game against the Red Sox, he hit another home run in the third inning. Kinsler and Nelson Cruz also {{became the first}} two {{teammates}} to <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> each of the first three games in a season. The two also joined Dean Palmer (1992) as the only Texas ballplayers to ever <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> the first three games of the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} 9 DVD {{release of the}} episode, The Simpsons animators use a telestrator to show {{similarities}} between Krusty and <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> the episode. This episode contains the last showing of character Lionel Hutz. He is seen standing {{at the bus stop}} with Lisa, but does not speak. Due to Phil Hartman's death, the recurring characters of Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure were retired.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 2007, Ramirez was {{the first}} of four Red Sox batters to <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> {{consecutive}} at bats in a game against the New York Yankees pitcher Chase Wright, tying a league record when J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek followed Ramirez with longballs of their own. On April 29, Ramirez became the fifth player to hit 50 career home runs against the Yankees.|$|E
5000|$|After {{slipping}} to [...]277/~.372/.516 with 24 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> 1987, Pierce retired. As of 2000, his 294 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> the Liga were 8th {{in league}} history, the best by a U.S. native. Pierce had hit [...]300 and slugged [...]553 in his 11 years in Mexico.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Whitaker set {{a record}} for Detroit second basemen with 21 home runs and, in 1986, {{was a member of}} a Tigers infield in which every member hit at least twenty home runs. He hit a career-best 28 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> 1989, one of four times he reached the 20-HR plateau, upping his record for the most <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> a season by a Tiger second baseman. Whitaker now shares the season record with Ian Kinsler, who hit 28 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> 2016 as the Tigers regular second baseman.|$|R
5000|$|His 40 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> 1997 and 1999 are the third-most by a catcher. Todd Hundley is second, with 41 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> 1996, Javy López is first, with 42 in 2003, and Johnny Bench had 45 in 1970, {{although}} only 38 home runs were hit while catching.|$|R
5|$|With {{the score}} tied and bases loaded {{with two outs}} {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning, Mr. Burns elects to field a {{right-handed}} hitter against a left-handed pitcher and pinch hits Homer for Strawberry. Distracted by Mr. Burns, the first pitch hits <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> the head, rendering him unconscious, but forcing in the winning run. The team wins the title and Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero.|$|E
5|$|In the 2014 postseason, Hosmer {{helped lead}} the Royals to a record-setting run, winning three {{consecutive}} extra-inning games. After getting on base five times in the wildcard game against the Oakland A's, Hosmer also slammed a game-winning, two-run <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> Game 2 of the ALDS against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In doing so, the first baseman became the first player in MLB history to hit both a triple and a home run during extra innings in one year's postseason.|$|E
5|$|Playing as the Rays' primary catcher, on April 4 he went 2-5 with {{a three-run}} <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> {{a win over}} the Texas Rangers. Two weeks later he hit two home runs with six RBIs in a 16-1 win over the New York Yankees. In May, Hanigan, plagued for nearly two weeks by a {{strained}} hamstring, was finally placed on the 15-day DL on May 28. On June 17 he had a home run and a walk against the Baltimore Orioles, but he then missed several more games due to neck stiffness and later with soreness in his left side.|$|E
50|$|Gonzalez hit three {{home runs}} and Tulowitzki went 5-for-5 with two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> the Rockies win over the Cincinnati Reds on June 5. It's {{the first time in}} Major League history that one player had a three-homer game while a {{teammate}} had at least five hits including two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> the same game.|$|R
5000|$|Seager <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> {{the first}} inning of game one of the 2016 National League Division Series against the Washington Nationals, {{becoming}} the youngest Dodgers player in history to hit a post-season home run.

5|$|The two men go to Smithers, who {{suggests}} {{they leave the}} country. Burns takes Smithers and <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> his old plane, setting off to find an island and start a new country. Over the Caribbean, Burns finds an island, Cuba. Going before Fidel Castro, Burns fails to buy the island when Fidel asks to see the trillion-dollar bill. He refuses to give it back. Later, Burns, Smithers, and Homer are on a makeshift raft. Burns says he will bribe the jury when he, Smithers and Homer are put on trial.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was ordained}} in 1525 and {{probably}} received his Doctor of Divinity around that time. The chapter-general of the Congregation elected {{him to the}} office of public preacher in 1526. His first series of sermons was in Brescia later that year. He then preached for three years, travelling around northern and central Italy. Unlike the practice of other preaching orders which usually only preached at Lent and Advent, the Augustinians preached year-round. He also gave lectures on the Bible as well as <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> Lateran Congregation houses.|$|E
5|$|Hartnett was an {{all-around}} player, performing well both offensively and defensively. Known for {{his strong}} and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the National League's catchers in caught stealing percentage {{and was the}} first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season. During the course of his career, he took part {{of some of the most}} memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; Babe Ruth's Called Shot during the 1932 World Series, Carl Hubbell's strike-out performance in the 1934 All-Star Game and Dizzy Dean's career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star Game. But the greatest moment of Hartnett's career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to put the Cubs in first place. The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto Wrigley Field, became immortalized as the <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> the Gloamin'.|$|E

50|$|On August 25, 2013, Danks was {{the winning}} pitcher during a 5-2 {{victory over the}} Texas Rangers. During that game his brother, Jordan Danks, hit a go-ahead home run. According to Elias Sports Bureau, {{it was the first}} time since June 5, 1955, that a player <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> support of his brother pitching, when Kansas City catcher Billy Shantz <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> support of his brother Bobby Shantz.|$|R
50|$|A wild {{ninth inning}} ended with Joe Page the winning pitcher, {{even though he}} gave up two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> the inning. The game had stood 1-1 until the ninth, when Johnny Mize {{delivered}} a two-run pinch single. Brooklyn starter Ralph Branca was then replaced by Jack Banta, who gave up an RBI hit to Jerry Coleman that made it 4-1. It seemed safe until Luis Olmo and Roy Campanella both <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> {{the bottom of the}} ninth, but Page hung on for the win after 5.2 innings of relief.|$|R
5|$|Homer {{realizes he}} needs to make amends with Lisa, but she is too hurt to even talk with him. Homer briefly cheers her up, but shows that he still only wants to win a bet. She agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves <b>Homer,</b> <b>in</b> which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2012, Ross {{finalized}} {{a one-year}} contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was supposed to provide depth off the bench, but injuries, particularly to Carl Crawford, led to him holding a starting role for the entire season. He started almost every day for Boston in all three outfield positions, but mainly right field. On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13–5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> {{the bottom of the}} second inning off Matt Moore in a 6–4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He was placed on the disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|On September 28, 1938, the {{two teams}} met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett {{experienced}} the highlight of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless Wrigley Field and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that the ninth inning {{would be the last}} to be played. The entire game would have to be replayed the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett came to bat with two out {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning. With a count of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center field bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases. Hartnett's walk-off home run became immortalized as the <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> the Gloamin'.|$|E

50|$|On August 22, 2007, Vazquez {{had seven}} RBI with two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> a record-setting 30-3 {{win over the}} Baltimore Orioles.|$|R
50|$|Jim Rice {{broke in}} {{as a regular}} with two <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> a 6-3 win at Milwaukee, in which Wise had a no-hitter through 8 innings but lost it when George Scott <b>homered</b> <b>in</b> the ninth. The Red Sox {{completed}} a sweep of the Minnesota Twins in Minnesota and did the same to the Texas Rangers in Texas, and by the All-Star break they held a 4.5 game lead over the Yankees and Brewers.|$|R
5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, {{and may be}} more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Homer only {{bought the}} ball {{so that he}} could use it himself, she is {{determined}} to learn how to bowl to spite him and heads to Barney's Bowl-a-Rama. Marge has difficulty until she meets a French bowling instructor named Jacques, who offers to give her lessons. Jacques proves to be a patient and charming instructor - the opposite of <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> every way. When he asks about the name inscribed on her ball, she tells him that Homer is actually the ball's name, neglecting to mention that she is married. Homer is faintly aware that something is wrong, but is unsure what is happening. After passing several bowling lessons, Jacques and Marge agree to meet each other for brunch.|$|E
5|$|The opening segment {{had many}} parodies and {{references}} to films. When the segment opens, the Simpson family is {{dressed up for}} Halloween. Here Maggie pops out of Bart's astronaut suit, dressed as a baby alien, which is {{a reference to the}} 1979 film Alien. Homer is dressed as Doctor Manhattan from the 2009 superhero film Watchmen. During the middle, there is a spoof of the 1960 film Psycho, as the same music and similar scenes are used (E.G: Reverend Lovejoy eyeing <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> his car. In the end of the segment, it turns into a spoof of the 2010 film 127 Hours, in which Ralston loses his arm after being trapped under a rock. Ralston voiced the 911 dispatcher Homer calls when he is trapped.|$|E
50|$|During {{her first}} two {{professional}} baseball seasons, Briggs hit only two home runs, but she increased her output to a league-leading nine in 1953. She ranked second with 25 <b>homers</b> <b>in</b> 1954, in the AAGPBL's last ever season.|$|R

5|$|Frank Lucchesi {{continued}} {{to manage the}} Sounds in 1989, leading the team to a third-place finish with a 74–72record. Pitcher Hugh Kemp set the career franchise records for games started (73) and walks (207) while playing for the team from 1987 to 1989. The Sounds returned in 1990 to experience their most successful season in the American Association, when they compiled an 86–61 record under manager Pete Mackanin. Ending the regular season in a tie with the Buffalo Bisons, the Sounds won the Eastern Division championship in a one-game playoff. The extra-inning affair was ended by Chris Jones' two-run <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> {{the top of the}} eighteenth inning. The Sounds advanced to their first American Association championship series, where they lost to the Omaha Royals, three games to two. Left-hander Chris Hammond won the league's Most Valuable Pitcher Award for 1990, having led the league with 15wins and 149strikeouts. That year, Nashville set their all-time attendance record when a total of 605,122fans came out to Greer Stadium. Skeeter Barnes, who played with Nashville in 1979 and from 1988 to 1990, holds three career franchise records: games played (514), at bats (1,848), and hits (517).|$|E
5|$|Plants {{including}} {{trees are}} important in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may {{be more or less}} magical.

Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by <b>Homer</b> <b>in</b> the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Phillies claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and {{designated}} O'Sullivan for assignment, Williams {{started in the}} opener of a two-game series with the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels won 7–2. The Phillies also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's inconsistency continued. The second (and final) series of the road trip pitted the Phillies against the San Francisco Giants. Hamels started game one, allowing a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>in</b> the fourth inning to give the Giants a 3–0 lead. The Phillies rallied, with a Marlon Byrd {{home run in the}} fifth inning and a two-run homer by Cody Asche to tie the game in the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save. In the second game, the Phillies jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5. The Phillies also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford.|$|E
