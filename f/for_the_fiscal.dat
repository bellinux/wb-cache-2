Arizona was authorized on 4 March 1913, but to avoid a lengthy delay between the two, the ship was ordered much more quickly, on 24 June, by giving the contract to a navy-owned shipyard.|$|E

5|$|Before Romney took over, {{the event}} was $379million short of its revenue goals. Officials had made plans to scale back the Games to {{compensate}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiscal</b> crisis, and there were fears it might be moved away entirely. In addition, {{the image of the}} Games had been damaged by allegations of bribery against top officials including prior committee president and CEO Frank Joklik. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee forced Joklik and committee vice president Dave Johnson to resign. Utah power brokers, including Governor Mike Leavitt, searched for someone with a scandal-free reputation to take charge of the Olympics. They chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state. The appointment faced some initial criticism from both non-Mormons and Mormons that it represented cronyism and made the Games seem too Mormon-dominated.|$|E

5|$|In May 2012, Capcom {{announced}} they expected {{the game to}} sell 7 million copies {{by the end of}} the 2012 fiscal year, however the company lowered their expectations to 6 million due to the game's mixed reception. Upon release, Capcom announced that it had shipped 4.5 million copies worldwide, setting a new record for the company. In October 2012, the game sold 806,000 copies in the United States. According to Capcom, sales weakened following the strong start, with the company admitting that the game would not meet their goals, and consequently lowered their financial projections <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiscal</b> year as a result. The game had sold 4.9 million copies by April 2013, and, by October the same year, had sold 5.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of Capcom's best-selling video games.|$|E
5|$|Political {{opposition}} in Congress {{also made it}} difficult to build the Pennsylvania-class. The House of Representatives refused to fund any new battleships <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiscal</b> year 1913, though the Senate would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become Pennsylvania was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; bids were opened on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, Newport News, on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).|$|E
5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fiscal</b> year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E
