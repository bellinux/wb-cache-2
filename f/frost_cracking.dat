Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to improve the knowledge regarding both the impact of <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> on European beech wood quality and the <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> characteristics which affect wood quality. In order to do this, nineteen European beech trunks with <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> have been studied. Each trunk has been cross-cut every 1 meter and the characteristics of <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> and <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> star-shaped heart have been measured in each cross-cut section. The defects which accompany <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> have also been identified in each cross-cut section. Moreover, the possibility of determining these defects using the IML RESIF 500 – S Resistograph has been tested. The research has emphasized the existence of statistical correlations between <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> star-shaped heart expansion, <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> rib prominence and <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> length. These correlations are expressed by multiple linear regressions. The presence of defects which affect wood structure leading to a decrease in penetration resistance can be determined accurately with the resistograph. Decay (in <b>frost</b> <b>cracks</b> older than 8 years) and ring shake have been identified as the most frequent defects which accompany <b>frost</b> <b>crack.</b> The measurements made on the <b>frost</b> <b>cracks</b> studied have been gathered in a graph which shows <b>frost</b> <b>crack</b> impact on European beech wood quality. The results obtained lead to the improvement of the criteria of European beech wood quality assessment by expanding the already existent knowledge and by identifying new aspects which may complete standing wood quality determination and sorting methods...|$|R

40|$|Rivers cut {{vertically}} and laterally into bedrock. However, {{control on}} the width of bedrock rivers is an unsolved problem. In alpine settings, <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> {{is one of the}} mechanisms that break down bedrock. Segregation ice drives growth of ice lenses within rock masses. When the temperature of the rock is within the "frost cracking window" of - 3 to - 8 ??C, ice lenses can attract liquid water. Expanding ice lenses can exert sufficient pressure to fracture the rock. We hypothesize that alpine rivers may promote segregation ice growth at the river margin by supplying water, but also may inhibit <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> by supplying heat. We find support for this hypothesis in data collected along the Tuolumne and Mokelumne rivers in the Sierra Nevada, California. A ID heat flow model predicts that <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> should occur above 2325 masl in this area. To test for a river effect, I measured fracture density along the Tuolumne River at 2600 masl, finding that density at the river margin is significantly greater than on adjacent hillslopes in the Cathedral Peak granodiorite. We then deployed data loggers on the Mokelumne River (at 2490 masl) over the winter of 2013 / 2014 to record water, surface and subsurface rock temperatures at varying depths and distances from the river. Temperatures within the <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> window were only recorded at a distance of 5 m from the river, suggesting an insulating effect from the river and snow cover. Rock temperature 1 m deep equilibrated at 2 ??C. This result requires subsurface heat flow into the model space. Ongoing work includes terrestrial LiDAR scans to detect erosion of the river bank at the Mokelumne site, and further development of a 2 D heat flow model to predict subsurface rock temperatures for varying surface boundary conditions and channel morphology. We expect that further analysis will reveal systematic relationships between the surface boundary conditions and rock temperature at depth, enabling predictive modeling of <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> intensity at the river margin...|$|E
40|$|In the Southern Alps, New Zealand, large {{gradients}} in precipitation (< 1 to 12 m year− 1) {{and rock}} uplift (< 1 to 10 mm year− 1) produce distinct post-glacial geomorphic domains in which landslide-driven sediment production dominates in the wet, rapid-uplift western region, and rockfall controls erosion in the drier, low-uplift eastern region. Because the western region accounts for < 25 % {{of the active}} orogen, the dynamics of erosion in the extensive eastern region are of equal importance in estimating the relative balance of uplift and erosion across the Southern Alps. Here, we assess the efficacy of <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> as the primary rockfall mechanism in the eastern Southern Alps using air photo and topographic analysis of scree slopes, cosmogenic radionuclide dating of headwalls, paleo-climate data, and a numerical model of headwall temperature. Currently, active scree slopes occur at a relatively uniform mean elevation (1450 m) and their distribution is independent of hillslope aspect and rock type, consistent {{with the notion that}} <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> (which is maximized between − 3 and − 8 °C) may control rockfall erosion. Headwall erosion rates of 0. 3 to 0. 9 mm year− 1, measured using in-situ 10 Be and 26 Al in the Cragieburn Range, confirm that rockfall erosion is active in the late Holocene at rates that roughly balance rock uplift. Models of the predicted depth of frost activity are consistent with the scale of fractures and scree blocks in our field sites. Also, vegetated, paleo-scree slopes are ubiquitous at elevations lower than active scree slopes, consistent with the notion that lower temperatures during the last glacial advance induced pervasive rockfall erosion due to <b>frost</b> <b>cracking.</b> Our modeling suggests temporally-averaged peak <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> intensity occurs at 2300 m a. s. l., the approximate elevation of the highest peaks in the central Southern Alps, suggesting that the height of these peaks may be limited by a “frost buzzsaw. ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Frost</b> <b>cracks</b> are {{frequently}} {{the result of}} some sort of weakness in the bark which occurred to the tree earlier. In late winter and early spring, water in the phloem, known as the inner bark and in the xylem, known as the wood, expands and contracts under often significantly fluctuating temperatures. Wood that is in some way damaged does not contract to the same degree as healthy wood. Rapid expansion and contraction of water within the wood and bark, particularly under rapidly falling night temperatures, can result in a <b>frost</b> <b>crack,</b> often accompanied by a loud explosive report.|$|R

40|$|Ice-free bedrock headwalls are {{widespread}} landforms of many glacial landscapes, {{but their}} formation and evolution {{are not well}} understood. Here, I present observations from the Khumbu Himalaya, eastern Nepal, of a distinct elevation zone that aligns the base of many steep headwalls with the highest predicted frost-cracking intensity (FCI). Below this zone, median ice-free hillslope angles are ≤ 40 ° and {{similar to those of}} other areas in the Himalaya, where threshold hillslopes that are close to the critical angle of stability have been inferred. At higher elevations, ice-free hillslopes of different rock types have median slope angles of ∼ 50 °– 55 °, suggesting threshold hillslopes with higher rock mass strength, possibly related to the presence of deep-reaching permafrost. High-altitude meteorological data combined with FCI models support <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> as a mechanism for headwall retreat by undercutting of threshold headwalls, while glacial transport inhibits the accumulation of scree deposits at their base. This mechanism could account for continued headwall retreat as long as climatic conditions enable <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> near the base of headwalls that are high enough to sustain glaciers at their base, even if subglacial erosion is minor...|$|E

40|$|With {{accelerating}} climate cooling in {{the late}} Cenozoic, glacial and periglacial erosion became more widespread {{on the surface of}} the Earth. The resultant shift in erosion patterns significantly changed the large-scale morphology of many mountain ranges worldwide. Whereas the glacial fingerprint is easily distinguished by its characteristic fjords and U-shaped valleys, the periglacial fingerprint is more subtle but potentially prevails in some mid- to high-latitude landscapes. Previous models have advocated a frost-driven control on debris production at steep headwalls and glacial valley sides. Here we investigate the important role that periglacial processes also play in less steep parts of mountain landscapes. Understanding the influences of frost-driven processes in low-relief areas requires a focus on the consequences of an accreting soil mantle, which characterises such surfaces. We present a new model that quantifies two key physical processes: <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> and frost creep, as a function of both temperature and sediment thickness. Our results yield new insights into how climate and sediment transport properties combine to scale the intensity of periglacial processes. The thickness of the soil mantle strongly modulates the relation between climate and the intensity of mechanical weathering and sediment flux. Our results also point to an offset between the conditions that promote <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> and those that promote frost creep, indicating that a stable climate can provide optimal conditions for only one of those processes at a time. Finally, quantifying these relations also opens up the possibility of including periglacial processes in large-scale, long-term landscape evolution models, as demonstrated in a companion paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of past temperatures with ground ice, especially with ice wedges is possible, but {{reduced by the}} missing correlation of ice veins to the exact year of their formation. Therefore, we performed recent cryogenesis tracer experiments on Samoylov Island, Northern Siberia, to calibrate a stable isotope thermometer for ice wedges. In 2002, a low centre polygon (20 m in diameter) was selected showing clearly visible (several mm wide) frost cracks and a well-developed relief between polygon wall and centre. Here, coloured Lycopodium spores, (each year a different colour) have been applied in autumn to a polygon with recent ice-wedge growth (between 2002 and 2009) to trace ground ice formed in the considered years. The spores should to be transported with snow/snowmelt into the open frost crack in spring. In 2010, 13 permafrost cores {{were taken from the}} ice-wedge polygon. In the cold laboratory, these ground-ice cores have been processed and individual ice veins have been sampled for spore identification and stable isotope analyses. Single ice veins were melted and examined under the light microscope for spores. All spores colours could be recovered, with red spores (2002) being most abundant followed by green (2003) and violet (2004). An overall decrease in spore abundance is probably related to changing hydrological conditions and polygon degradation. Additionally, <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> experiments (breaking cables) were installed to the polygon, intended to break when a sudden rupture (i. e. a <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> event) takes place. Data loggers detected the precise moments of cracking on Samoylov Island generally occurring between November, 8 and February, 10 (N= 12). The stable isotope composition of every single melted ice vein has been analysed with a Picarro L 2120 i water isotope analyser and, if spores were present, attributed to the respective year of formation. However, attribution to the year of formation is complicated by eventual occurrence of more than one colour in a sample, which has been assessed by statistical methods. The isotope composition of single ice veins could be measured {{for the first time in}} high resolution with a Picarro laser-optical spectrometer and showed no significant isotope fractionation during freezing. The combination with meteorological data allows correlating the local temperature with the δ 18 O of ice-wedge ice formed in a discrete year. The δ 18 O and δD values of recent ice veins correspond roughly to the LMWL in Tiksi (δD= 7. 57 δ 18 O– 6. 8), indicative for meteoric precipitation stored in ice wedges. However, the broad scatter of the data shows large inter-annual and seasonal variability of the <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> process. A first comparison with meteorological data indicates that December temperatures may best explain the variability in recent ice wedge isotope composition. ...|$|E

The measurement of the resonant frequency enables the assessing of the cracking state of a rock. It is a nondestructive method based on the processing of a unit pulse excitation. Since karsts which are near the ground surface undergo climate variations, measurements have been carried out on sedimentary rocks subjected to <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> and also on marble samples subjected to heat cracking.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of bacteria preserved within an ice wedge from the Fox permafrost tunnel was undertaken by cultivation and molecular techniques.

Ice wedges are wedge-shaped ancient ice (Fig. 1 A) and are among the most common features in permafrost regions, in-cluding northern and central Alaska (7). They grow as a result of repeated cycles of <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> followed by the infiltration of snow, meltwater, soil, and other material into open frost cracks (17). Material incorporated into the ice wedge quickly becomes frozen, and the ice and the ice in soil and organic particles are thus preserved in a frozen state.

40|$|Ice wedges {{are common}} {{features}} of the subsurface in permafrost regions. They develop by repeated <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> and ice vein growth over hundreds to thousands of years. Ice-wedge formation causes the archetypal polygonal patterns seen in tundra across the Arctic landscape. Here we use field and remote sensing observations to document polygon succession due to ice-wedge degradation and trough development in ten Arctic localities over sub-decadal timescales. Initial thaw drains polygon centres and forms disconnected troughs that hold isolated ponds. Continued ice-wedge melting leads to increased trough connectivity and an overall draining of the landscape. We find that melting at the tops of ice wedges over recent decades and subsequent decimetre-scale ground subsidence is a widespread Arctic phenomenon. Although permafrost temperatures have been increasing gradually, we find that ice-wedge degradation is occurring on sub-decadal timescales. Our hydrological model simulations show that advanced ice-wedge degradation can significantly alter the water balance of lowland tundra by reducing inundation and increasing runoff, in particular due to changes in snow distribution as troughs form. We predict that ice-wedge degradation and the hydrological changes associated with the resulting differential ground subsidence will expand and amplify in rapidly warming permafrost regions...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} of strong periglacial control on bedrock erosion in mountain landscapes, including {{the shaping of}} low-relief surfaces at high elevations (summit flats). But, as yet, the hypothesis that frost action was crucial to the assumed Late Cenozoic rise in erosion rates remains compelling and untested. Here we present a landscape evolution model incorporating two key periglacial processes – regolith production via <b>frost</b> <b>cracking</b> and sediment transport via frost creep – which together are harnessed to variations in temperature and the evolving thickness of sediment cover. Our computational experiments time-integrate the contribution of frost action to shaping mountain topography over million-year timescales, with the primary and highly reproducible outcome being the development of flattish or gently convex summit flats. A simple scaling of temperature to marine δ 18 O records spanning the past 14 Myr indicates that the highest summit flats in mid- to high-latitude mountains may have formed via frost action prior to the Quaternary. We suggest that deep cooling in the Quaternary accelerated mechanical weathering globally by significantly expanding the area subject to frost. Further, the inclusion of subglacial erosion alongside periglacial processes in our computational experiments points to alpine glaciers increasing the long-term efficiency of frost-driven erosion by steepening hillslopes...|$|E
30|$|The {{moisture}} {{retention capacity}} of phosphates could improve the weight and volume of CSB significantly, while the hardness of steamed bread was reduced as the water absorption increased [55]. Besides, the leaven function was enhanced due to the sequestration of minerals and enhanced protein–starch interactions caused {{by the addition of}} phosphates [56]. It has been reported that the phosphate also contributed to the whiteness of steamed bread, which mainly due to a more intense and uniform crumb was formed after the addition of phosphate [57]. Phosphates are commonly used in the quality improvement of quick frozen foods. Quick frozen dumplings accounts for 33 % of the total quick frozen foods in China [58], however, the common problems, such as <b>frost</b> <b>cracking,</b> outflow of stuffing juice, sticky texture, poor elasticity, browning and cooking loss, appeared in the practical production retarded its industrialization [59]. Therefore, phosphates were used as additives to alleviate the above-mentioned challenges in production. Phosphates added in frozen dumplings gave cracking resistance and good appearance for frozen dumplings due to their water-holding capacity, in which STPP showed the best performance in all the applied phosphates [59]. For the browning inhibiting, the function of phosphates can be explained in two ways. First, the enzymatic browning was delayed by the sequestering of metal ions [60]. Second, the water-holding rate was increased by the phosphates, which prevented the browning reaction caused by the outflow of stuffing [61].|$|E
