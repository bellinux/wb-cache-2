5|$|Elephants {{are large}} mammals {{of the family}} <b>Elephantidae</b> and the order Proboscidea. Three species are {{currently}} recognized: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. <b>Elephantidae</b> is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known proboscideans, the clade {{that contains}} the elephants, existed about 55 million years ago around the Tethys Sea area. The closest relatives of the Proboscidea are the sirenians and the hyraxes. The family <b>Elephantidae</b> {{is known to have}} existed six million years ago in Africa, and includes the living elephants and the mammoths. Among many now extinct clades, the mastodon is only a distant relative of the mammoths, and part of the separate Mammutidae family, which diverged 25 million years before the mammoths evolved.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a late Oligocene {{proboscidean}} species from Eritrea, dated to 26. 8 ± 1. 5 Mya. This “missing link” between early elephantiformes and Elephantimorpha is the oldest known nongomphothere proboscidean to probably display horizontal tooth displacement, typical of elephants [Elephantimorpha consists of Mammutida (mastodons) and <b>Elephantida,</b> and <b>Elephantida</b> includes gomphotheres, stegodons, and elephants].

25|$|A mammoth is any {{species of}} the extinct genus Mammuthus, {{proboscideans}} commonly equipped with long, curved tusks and, in northern species, a covering of long hair. They lived from the Pliocene epoch (from around 5million years ago) into the Holocene at about 4,500 years ago in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. They {{were members of the}} family <b>Elephantidae,</b> which also contains the two genera of modern elephants and their ancestors. Mammoths stem from an ancestral species called M. africanavus, the African mammoth. These mammoths lived in northern Africa and disappeared about 3 or 4 million years ago. Descendants of these mammoths moved north and eventually covered most of Eurasia. These were M. meridionalis, the 'southern mammoths'.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{members of}} Proboscidea, the clade which contains modern elephants, existed about 55 {{million years ago}} around the Tethys Sea.

500|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} was {{probably}} the most specialised member of the family <b>Elephantidae.</b> They had lipopexia (fat storage) in their neck and withers, for times when food availability was insufficient during winter, and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants. The expansion identified on the trunk of [...] "Yuka" [...] and other specimens was suggested to function as a [...] "fur mitten"; the trunk tip was not covered in fur, but was used for foraging during winter, and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion. It was also suggested that the expansion could be used to melt snow if there was shortage of water to drink, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal. As in reindeer and musk oxen, the haemoglobin of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold, with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing. This feature may have helped the mammoths to live in high latitudes.|$|E
500|$|In Part II, Varner {{adopts a}} higher-order thought theory of {{consciousness}} and reviews evidence for animal consciousness. He argues that, according to contemporary science, vertebrates are conscious (i.e., sentient, {{able to feel}} pain), but few invertebrates are; cephalopods are an exception. He goes on to argue that most animals lack a biographical sense of self, something possessed by paradigmatic humans. A good life for human persons, consequently, [...] "consists in living a good story", meaning that persons can be harmed in ways that non-persons cannot. Varner denies that nonhuman animals lack the psychological sophistication necessary for personhood, but argues that some, nonetheless, may be [...] "near-persons"; this means that they lack a biographical sense of self, but possess autonoetic consciousness. Possible candidates include nonhuman primates, as well as Corvidae, Cetacea and <b>Elephantidae,</b> and rats and parrots. Varner frames the lives of near-persons as of less significance than the lives of persons, but of greater significance than the lives of other animals who are nonetheless sentient. The distinctions drawn in Part II are logically independent of any commitment to utilitarianism, Harean or otherwise.|$|E
500|$|Elephants {{belong to}} the family <b>Elephantidae,</b> the sole {{remaining}} family within the order Proboscidea which belongs to the superorder Afrotheria. Their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria. Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade Tethytheria. Three species of elephants are recognised; the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) and forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) of sub-Saharan Africa, and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) of South and Southeast Asia. African elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two finger-like extensions {{at the tip of}} the trunk. Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or level back, smoother skin, a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension {{at the tip of the}} trunk. The looped ridges on the molars are narrower in the Asian elephant while those of the African are more diamond-shaped. The Asian elephant also has [...] bumps on its head and some patches of depigmentation on its skin. In general, African elephants are larger than their Asian cousins.|$|E

50|$|In the past, stegodonts were {{believed}} to be the ancestors of the true elephants and mammoths, but it is currently believed that they have no modern descendants. Stegodon may be derived from Stegolophodon, an extinct genus known from the Miocene of Asia. Stegodon {{is considered to be a}} sister group of the mammoth, as well as the elephants. Some taxonomists consider the stegodonts a subfamily of <b>Elephantidae.</b> Both Stegolophodon and primitive elephants were derived from the Gomphotheriidae. The most important difference between Stegodon and (other) <b>Elephantidae</b> can be observed in the molars. Stegodont molars consist of a series of low, roof-shaped ridges, whereas in elephants each ridge has become a high-crowned plate. Furthermore, stegodont skeletons are more robust and compact than those of elephants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elephantidae</b> is {{a family}} of large, herbivorous mammals collectively called {{elephants}} and mammoths.

All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature.
