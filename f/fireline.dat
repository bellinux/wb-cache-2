Some other fires were too remote or in too steep terrain for the safe operation of heavy equipment, and bulldozers were prohibited from many areas because of the impact they have on surface features. Additionally, the thin, unstable ground near the park's geothermal features could not be trusted to support the weight of heavy equipment. Bulldozers are rarely used on fires in U.S. National Parks.|$|E
500|$|The fires {{spread to}} forested {{sections}} near to, but generally away from major structures, but 19 small structures were destroyed {{and there was}} also extensive damage to an old dormitory. The fire was so intense that vehicles left near the fire had their wheels melted, windshields shattered and paint scorched. Though most of the Old Faithful complex had been spared, the park service decided that for the first time, the entire park would be closed to non-emergency personnel on September 8. The night of the 9th and the morning of the 10th of September, the North Fork fire jumped a <b>fireline</b> along its northeastern flank and approached Mammoth Hot Springs where a large concentration of historical structures as well as the Park Headquarters is located. Rain and snow arrived in time to slow the fires before they threatened the complex. By the time the North Fork fire finally died down, it was responsible for 60% of the burned area within the park; more than [...]|$|E

50|$|Preparatory {{suppression}} tactics used {{a distance}} {{away from the}} oncoming fire are considered indirect. <b>Firelines</b> may be built in this manner as well. Fuel reduction, indirect <b>firelines,</b> contingency <b>firelines,</b> backburning and wetting unburnt fuels are examples. This method may allow for more effective planning. It may allow for more ideally placed <b>firelines</b> in lighter fuels using natural barriers to fire and for safer firefighter working conditions in less smoke filled and cooler areas. However, it may also allow for more burned acreage, larger hotter fires, {{and the possibility of}} wasted time constructing unused <b>firelines.</b>|$|R

50|$|Heavy equipment's primary {{function}} of wildfire suppression {{is through the}} application of heavy construction style equipment to move large amounts or earth or remove vegetation. Fuel breaks, safety zones, <b>firelines</b> and access to areas that maybe previously were inaccessible may be made. Bulldozers and tractor plows are examples.|$|R
50|$|Constructed <b>firelines,</b> breaks, safety {{zones and}} other items may damage soil systems, {{encouraging}} erosion from surface run-off and gully formation. The loss of plant life from the fire also contributes to erosion. Construction of waterbars, the addition of plants and debris to exposed soils and other measures help to reduce this.|$|R

50|$|Before a {{firefighter}} can begin {{training for the}} test, they must fill out a Health Screening Questionnaire (HSQ). This must be done prior to conditioning for, or taking, any level of the Work Capacity Tests (WCT). The HSQ is reviewed by a Human Resource Office and they will determine whether a person is cleared to start conditioning. This is very important because heart attacks due to stressful physical activity are {{a leading cause of}} firefighter deaths on the <b>firelines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Depending on the size, location, and {{assessed}} {{potential of the}} wildfire, the [...] "air attack" [...] or ATGS person may be charged with initial attack (the first response of firefighting assets on fire suppression), or with extended attack, the ongoing response to and management of a major wildfire requiring additional resources including engines, ground crews, and other aviation personnel and aircraft needed to control the fire and establish control lines or <b>firelines</b> ahead of the wildfire.|$|R
50|$|Wildfire {{suppression}} is a {{range of}} firefighting tactics used to suppress wildfires. Firefighting efforts in wild land areas require different techniques, equipment, and training from the more familiar structure fire fighting found in populated areas. Working in conjunction with specially designed aerial firefighting aircraft, these wildfire-trained crews suppress flames, construct <b>firelines,</b> and extinguish flames and areas of heat to protect resources and natural wilderness. Wildfire suppression also addresses {{the issues of the}} wildland-urban interface, where populated areas border with wild land areas.|$|R

5000|$|The work {{capacity}} test ("pack test") is also usually given during the course. Passing S-130/190 and the pack test are both required to fight wildfires.

5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of <b>firelines,</b> helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings.

2500|$|For {{problems}} with coherent features, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, <b>firelines,</b> squall lines, and rain fronts, {{there is a}} need to adjust the numerical model state by deforming the state in space (its grid) as well as by [...] correcting the state amplitudes additively. In Data Assimilation by Field Alignment, Ravela et al. introduce the joint position-amplitude adjustment model using ensembles, and systematically derive a sequential approximation which can be applied to both EnKF and other formulations. Their method does not make the assumption that amplitudes and position errors are independent or jointly Gaussian, as others do. The morphing EnKF employs intermediate states, obtained by techniques borrowed from image registration and morphing, instead of linear combinations of states.|$|R

30|$|A {{programmatic}} {{environmental analysis}} of standard firefighting actions is long overdue, and provides another critical area for fire ecologists to conduct field research. Taking {{a hard look}} at the adverse impacts of suppression operations may actually help build the case in the eyes of the public for proactive fuels treatments. Indeed, the public may be more supportive of carefully planned, well-designed fuelbreaks as a means of preventing poorly planned and ill-designed <b>firelines</b> constructed during emergency suppression operations. Ecological research on the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of suppression methods would give land managers the ability to analyze the ecological and environmental tradeoffs underlying fuelbreak construction and utilization. Research results would also provide an incentive for experimenting with new techniques, tactics and strategies to help mitigate environmental damage from suppression operations.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, firefighters did {{not have}} {{portable}} radios for rapid on-scene communication or helicopters to bring supplies and provide water drops. Firefighters had some access to gas-powered portable water pumps (two were {{set up on the}} Blackwater fire), but most used backpack pumps that were manually operated and held limited water. <b>Firelines</b> were dug by handcrews using shovels, axes and pulaskis (a tool that could be used as either an axe or a hoe). Most firefighters wore cotton and wool clothing, which provided poor protection from flames. Additionally, they {{did not have}} fire shelters, which first became available in the 1960s but were not mandatory until 1977. Later researchers believe the use of shelters might have saved lives depending on where the firefighters were when the firestorm occurred.|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, any method {{can fail}} {{in the face}} of erratic or high-intensity winds and {{changing}} weather. Changing winds may cause fires to change direction and miss control lines. High-intensity winds may cause jumping or spotting as burning embers are carried through the air over a <b>fireline.</b> Burning trees may fall and burning materials may roll across the line, effectively negating the barrier.|$|E

[...] The Dome School opened in 1975 {{as an alternative to}} public education. It educates about 35 preschool through fifth-grade children each year, and runs a federally funded summer program for at risk children. The Illinois Valley Fire District's Takilma station was organized in the late 1970s and worked the <b>firelines</b> during the 1987 Longwood fire.

50|$|Handcrews are diverse {{teams of}} career and {{temporary}} wildland firefighters. The crews typically consist of 18 - 20 {{men and women}} but can also contain 4 to 6 and 8 to 10. These crews have the responsibilities of constructing <b>firelines</b> - strips of land cleared of flammable materials and dug down to mineral soil. These lines are generally constructed around wildfires to control them. Another type of line handcrews create is saw line. This is line where all trees limbs are removed up to shoulder height and all small trees and brush is cut down. All the limbs and trees are then carried outside the line and scattered. These are also called ladder fuels that allow the fire to climb up into the canopies which makes controlling a fire much more difficult. Sawyers do the cutting and swampers do the moving of the debris. Depending {{on the size of}} the crew there can be between 1 and 5 swampers per sawyer. Other jobs include, burn outs, gridding for spot fires, and mop up after the fire is controlled.|$|R
500|$|Almost 250 {{different}} fires {{started in}} Yellowstone {{and the surrounding}} National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed [...] "Black Saturday", more than [...] were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted {{as far away as}} Billings, Montana, [...] to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and <b>firelines,</b> and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over [...] high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of [...] a day, and there were even occasions when more than [...] in one hour were recorded.|$|R
