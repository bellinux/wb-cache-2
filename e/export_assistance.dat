The domestic economy is in a dilemma during a financial crisis because, on the one hand, it must rescue the economy, but on the other, it must not hurt the other exporters. In view of this polemic, this paper points out that the current law is inadequate in that it fails to take into account important and highly relevant economic issues pertaining to the current global financial crisis...|$|R

Marketing assistance was found to be a highly effective policy tool when targeted towards SMEs already active in export markets and/or involved in product innovation.

In direct offsets {{contracts}} {{there are}} legitimate [...] "clauses of confidentiality", that {{in several countries}} may even assume value of official classification, up to secret of state. In European Union States, however, extending state secret classifications to indirect offsets - {{that have nothing to}} do with military or state security - is considered an abuse. For instance, classifying an offset not-related to state security or military preparedness - such as indirect and civilian offsets in pharmaceutical research, environmental technologies or <b>export</b> <b>assistance</b> of any non-military/security products - leads not only to major market distortions but also to possibly unpunished corruption protected by baseless secrecy.Pre-offset activities are allowed and welcomed by several countries; they are like offsets without certainties to obtain “credit value”. These activities are straight marketing activities, similar to lobbying, to promote specific defense purchases. These pre-offset activities must be registered as such with national authorities. Often pre-offset activities will receive certificates, after a sale. Defense companies include them in the marketing budget, but after the sale, these offsets go into their offset budgets, and count toward offset fulfillment. These kinds of pre-offset activities are sales arguments to convince the buying state of the strength and reliability of the aerospace & defense company as potential supplier and partner. The pre-offsets arena is also the delicate and problematic field of sale-facilitators and, precisely because the client is a state, this must be monitored with additional care, since this field is prone to abuse and outright corruption.|$|E
5000|$|... : A Royal Decree (6/2/1997, and modified-6/12/2001) is {{the legal}} {{foundation}} of the Belgian Industrial Benefits Program. The program is directed by Ministry of Economic Affairs (Industrial Benefits in the Field of Defense Procurement http://economie.fgov.be/en/binaries/industrial_compensations_en_tcm327-58443.pdf). The threshold value is usually 11 million euro, but it is lower {{if it is not}} a public and open tender. The minimum required offset is 100%. Multipliers are not specified. The focus is on high technology and new or additional business flow. The Belgian offset guidelines are very sophisticated. One of the most important and explicit points is the so-called “newness aspect:” offsets, such <b>export</b> <b>assistance,</b> “must create unambiguously a new or additional business flow in export” for Belgian companies. Belgium distinguishes three forms of offsets: direct, semi-direct, and indirect. Belgium has a specific problem with the Industrial Benefit Programme, related to the de facto split of the country into Wallonia and Flanders. Belgian offset program is more meticulous than other European countries, but Belgian citizenry is aware that paying for offsets, instead of getting weapons at off-the-shelf price, implies not-so-transparent transfers of taxpayers money to designated Belgian companies through political decisions. One can rightly consider such offset-transfer as confidential state subsidy. Flemish parties claim that subsidies to Wallonia cost proportionally more than the price West Germany paid for East Germany. The subsidies/offset issue was particularly acute in the repartition of direct and indirect industrial benefits for one of the recent acquisition with offsets: 242 Mowag Piranha for the Belgian Army from General Dynamics, over 700 M Euro. One of the controversial offsets connected with the Piranha III is a direct offset for the Piranha III co-production, and the disputed choice of a 90mm gun (produced by a Wallonian company) instead of 105mm NATO standard cannon.|$|E

A survey of 2732 businesses by the Australian Bureau of Statistics was analysed employing logistic regression.
