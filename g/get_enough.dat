5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|Cook County Commissioner Forrest Claypool filed nominating {{petitions}} {{to run as}} {{an independent}} candidate for assessor. Berrios dropped a challenge to Claypool's nominating petitions after Berrios' lawyers examined Claypool's 90,000 signatures, 65,000 more than required. Berrios prevailed in the November 2010 general election with 46 {{percent of the vote}} in a field that also included Republican Sharon Strobeck-Eckersall. Claypool attributed his defeat to his failure to <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> suburban support to offset Berrios' organization in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{had wanted}} to {{organize}} the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> southern support to accomplish this. Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts' Charles Sumner, who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, {{and the influence of}} slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.|$|E

5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} {{einsteinium}} target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material. The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.|$|E
25|$|Like people, fancy mice {{can become}} obese if they overeat {{and do not}} <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> {{physical}} activity. This can lead to them developing life-threatening cardiovascular disorders and diabetes as well as arthritis. Activity aids such as tubes and wheels are great for ensuring mice <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> exercise, as well as mental stimulation. Mice also love to climb, and a wire cage with horizontal bars is perfect for this. A mouse set loose for exercise should be carefully observed, as they tend to scurry into a hiding spot and {{can be difficult to}} retrieve.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Renaissance Trains {{proposed}} a twice-daily service from Lime Street to Glasgow Central, with weekend trains running instead from Blackpool to Glasgow. The proposal did not <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> investment backing, but was revived in 2014.|$|E

25|$|New field {{drainage}} work on {{farms in the}} 18th and 19th centuries had dramatic effects on water courses, most often recorded through complaints by millers that {{they could no longer}} <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> water to turn their mills waterwheels.|$|E

25|$|Navratilova is a vegetarian. In an April 2006 interview, however, {{she said}} she had {{recently}} begun eating fish again because she found it hard to <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> protein while on the road; which would make her a pescetarian rather than a vegetarian; nevertheless in 2008 she described herself as vegetarian.|$|E
25|$|There are {{not many}} foods that {{naturally}} have vitamin D. Examples are cod liver oil and oily fish. If people cannot get sunlight, then they will need 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day to stay healthy. A person would have to eat oily fish {{three or four times}} per week in order to <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> vitamin D from that food source alone.|$|E

The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on 1 fruit or on 2 some tubers, such as sweet potatoes or cassava, or on 3 junk food (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively {{few people in the}} world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories. In all other diets, if people are <b>getting</b> <b>enough</b> calories, they are virtually certain of <b>getting</b> <b>enough</b> protein." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1986, Roy Rosselló was {{replaced}} by Sergio Blass; no farewell concerts were held. The group released several albums that year, starting with their only Italian album, Viva! Bravo!, which they showcased in Italy in the San Remo Music Festival. The Spanish album Refrescante, the English album Can't <b>Get</b> <b>Enough,</b> and the Portuguese album Menudo followed respectively, then came tours of the U.S., Latin America (including Brazil), and the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 {{season was}} very much a replay of 1984, with the Outlaws {{struggling}} after a quick start. The team jumped out to a 4-2 start, including a 31-13 pounding of the Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie-led New Jersey Generals. However, they proceeded to drop six in a row, and seven out of eight. They rebounded to win three straight, but did not <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> help to make the playoffs, and finished 8-10.|$|E
25|$|In 1932 he was {{defeated}} for re-election to the House by James J.

25|$|On 24 September 2017, an Italian Air Force {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the sea during an airshow in Terracina, Lazio, Italy. The pilot Capt.

The body of the pilot was recovered soon after. An investigation was opened into the cause.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with opening}} the door for many R performers, Laine played a {{significant}} role in the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s. When Nat King Cole's television show was unable to get a sponsor, Laine crossed the color line, becoming the first white artist to appear as a guest (forgoing his usual salary of $10,000.00 as Cole's show only paid scale). Many other top white singers followed suit, including Tony Bennett and Rosemary Clooney, but Cole's show still could not <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> sponsors to continue.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic Ocean has {{relatively}} little plant life except for phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are {{a crucial part}} of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic, where they feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. During summer, the sun is out day and night, thus enabling the phytoplankton to photosynthesize {{for long periods of time}} and reproduce quickly. However, the reverse is true in winter when they struggle to <b>get</b> <b>enough</b> light to survive.|$|E
