To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed.

40|$|Aim When {{analysing}} {{the reliability}} of ratio-scaled variables, such as walking <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> variability of the error term often increases with increasing mean values. This phenomenon is called heteroscedasticity, and it makes the analysis of reliability more complicated. This study presents an examination of heteroscedasticity for walking <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> before analysing the reliability. Method Walking <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> was collected from 33 children with cerebral palsy (CP), with varying Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels (19 males; 14 females; mean age: 7 y 6 mo [SD 2 y 6 mo]; GMFCS levels I [n= 16], II [n= 7], and III [n= 10]). It was assessed by measuring oxygen uptake during 10 minutes of resting and 5 minutes of walking at comfortable speed. Measurements were performed twice, within 4 to 6 weeks. Primary outcomes included gross <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> gross non-dimensional <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> net <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> net non-dimensional <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> speed, and non-dimensional speed. Heteroscedasticity was analysed with Bland-Altman plots and Kendall's tau. Results Visual inspection of the Bland-Altman plots showed heteroscedasticity for gross <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> gross non-energy <b>cost,</b> and net <b>energy</b> <b>cost.</b> This was confirmed by Kendall's tau coefficients. Accordingly, data were logarithmically transformed, and reliability was assessed with ratio statistics. For speed, heteroscedasticity was not observed. Interpretation Variability of gross <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> gross non-energy <b>cost,</b> and net <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> assessed across different GMFCS levels in children with CP, was proportional to the mean, indicating the presence of heteroscedasticity. This finding {{emphasizes the importance of}} always performing a heteroscedasticity examination in reliability studies on <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> and reporting the reliability statistics accordingly. © The Authors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To measure <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> and gait {{analysis}} in persons with stroke {{with and without}} a newly developed orthosis. DESIGN: Immediate and long-term (3 wk) intervention (before-after trial). SETTING: University medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 27 persons with long-term (range, 0. 6 - 19 y) hemiparetic stroke. INTERVENTION: Three-week familiarization to the new walking aid. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Energy</b> <b>cost</b> (per distance walked), preferred walking speed (PWS), and step length. <b>Energy</b> <b>cost</b> was examined in all subjects while walking on a treadmill at 3 different velocities (PWS, PWS+ 30 %, PWS- 30 %) during 3 different situations (without orthosis, with orthosis, after 3 -wk orthosis familiarization). Spatiotemporal aspects of the gait pattern were examined using a 6 -m instrumented walkway system. RESULTS: Using the orthosis immediately decreased <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> in persons with stroke during walking at the PWS (P<. 001) and significantly increased walking speed (P<. 005) and step length (P<. 001). After 3 weeks of familiarization to the orthosis, <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> at the PWS and at PWS+ 30 % showed further improvement in <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> (P<. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed orthosis immediately decreases <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> and improves walking speed and step length in persons with long-term stroke. After only 3 weeks of orthosis familiarization, <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> shows additional improvement...|$|R

During the hot season, fruit, flowers, and young leaves are more abundant, whereas the cold, wet season offers more young leaves and flowers. Despite this, the diet changes little between seasons, except that females will consume more high-protein, low-fiber items, such as young leaves and flowers, during pregnancy and lactation in order to offset the <b>energy</b> <b>costs</b> of reproduction.

5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment.

These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high <b>energy</b> <b>costs</b> of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether {{impaired}} balance control is partly responsible for the increased <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> of walking in persons with a lower limb amputation (LLA). Previous studies used external lateral stabilization to evaluate the <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> for balance control; this caused a decrease in <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> with concomitant decreases in mean and variability of step width. Using a similar set-up, we expected larger decreases for LLA than able-bodied controls. Fifteen transtibial amputees (TT), 12 transfemoral amputees (TF), and 15 able-bodied controls (CO) walked with and without external lateral stabilization provided via spring like cords attached to the waist. Effects of this manipulation on <b>energy</b> <b>cost,</b> step parameters, and pelvic motion were evaluated between groups. TT (- 5 %) and CO (- 3 %) showed on average a small reduction in <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> when walking with stabilization, whereas TF exhibited an increase in <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> (+ 6. 5 %) The difference in the effect of stabilization was only significant between TT and TF. Step width, step width variability, and medio-lateral pelvic displacement decreased significantly with stabilization in all groups, especially in TT. Contrary to expectations, external lateral stabilization did not result in a larger decrease in the <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> of walking for LLA compared to able-bodied controls, suggesting that balance control is not a major factor in the increased cost of walking in LLA. Alternatively, the increased <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> with stabilization for TF suggests that restraining (medio-lateral) pelvic motion impeded necessary movement adaptations in LLA, and thus negated the postulated beneficial effects of stabilization on the <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> of walking.

Recently, {{efficient}} leader election algorithms for ad hoc radio networks {{with low}} time complexity and <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> {{have been designed}} even for the no-collision detection, (no-CD), model. However, these algorithms are fragile {{in the sense that}} an adversary may disturb communication at low <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> so that more than one station may regard itself as a leader. This is a severe fault since the leader election is intended to be a fundamental subroutine used to avoid collisions and to make it reliable. It is impossible to make the leader election algorithm totally resistant – if an adversary is causing collisions all the time no message comes through. So we consider the case that an adversary has limited energy resources, as any other participant. We present an approach that yields a randomized leader election algorithm for a single-hop no-CD radio network. The algorithm has time complexity O(log 3 N) and <b>energy</b> <b>cost</b> O (√ logN).
