On {{the other side of the}} thorns, Maleficent (who is heavily implied to have found the Book of Prophecies) congratulates herself with what she has accomplished whilst wondering where Pete is. Confident that Sora and company cannot meddle in this world, she contemplates on conquering this iteration of her home world that she has entered in.|$|E
25|$|Now {{remember}} that the velocity function is simply the derivative of the position function. So what we <b>have</b> <b>really</b> shown is that integrating the velocity simply recovers the original position function. This is the basic idea of the theorem: that integration and differentiation are closely related operations, each essentially being the inverse of the other.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} multiplied as directors' {{personal involvement}} and commitments were disclosed, but the creditors {{were interested in}} retrieving something from the mess, and after considerable negotiation an agreement was reached, ratified as the Neath & Brecon Amalgamation and Arrangement Act of 26 July 1869. This authorised the conversion of debts into 6% debentures and extinguished nearly all other claims against the company. The 1867 Act granting additional capital was repealed, and the authorised capital was now £1,280,000. The line was said to <b>have</b> <b>really</b> cost £300,000 in cash.|$|E

25|$|Ehrman {{examines}} the historicity of Jesus and includes some criticism of Christ mythicists. As {{he does in}} other works such as Forged and Jesus, Interrupted, he disregards an apologetics-based or otherwise religiously-charged approach to aim at looking at the New Testament using historical-critical methodology. He argues that a specific historical Jesus is likely to <b>have</b> <b>really</b> existed in the 1st century AD. Even as accounts about that figure later on brought in additional misinformation and legendary stories, Ehrman states, multiple reasons still remain to see things as framed around a flesh-and-blood actual person, at least at first.|$|E
25|$|Some learned {{men have}} thought they {{discovered}} some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; {{but all that}} they say of it does not come near what is related of the vampires. The lamiæ, the strigæ, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand {{by the name of}} vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiæ and strigæ <b>have</b> <b>really</b> existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.|$|E
25|$|Janis {{remained}} at Woodstock {{for the remainder}} of the festival. She is said to <b>have</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed Sly and The Family Stone's performance immediately after hers. Starting at approximately 3:00a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind Crosby, Stills & Nash during their performance, which was the first time anyone at Woodstock ever had heard the group perform with Neil Young. This information was published by David Crosby in 1988. Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in Joe Cocker's van and witnessed Hendrix's close-of-show performance, according to Baez's memoir And a Voice to Sing With (1989).|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his body}} being {{identified}} by police and a priest before being burnt, {{there have also}} been stories that both Dan and Steve survived the fire. There is little evidence to support these claims. One man, James Ryan, said he was Dan Kelly. In 1934 he went on stage at the Brisbane Exhibition and told stories about the Kelly Gang. He died on 29 July 1948, after being struck by a train. The Ipswich City Council have put a memorial on his grave. In 2001, scientists took a small piece of bone from the grave of Charles Devine Tindall at Toowoomba, Queensland, {{to see if they could}} find DNA to prove he was Dan Kelly. Devine, who had burn scars on his body, told his family he was really Dan. He said he had hidden under the floor of the Glenrowan hotel and escaped after the fire. An archaeological dig at the site of the hotel by Adam Ford in 2008 found that there was no cellar or other hiding place under the floors. In October 1902, a Melbourne newspaper printed a story that Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were living in South Africa. The men had fought in the Boer War. Another man, Jim Davis from Darra (a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland), said in 1938 that he was Dan Kelly. He claimed that he, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne had escaped from the hotel. He also said he was born at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, which makes him too old to <b>have</b> <b>really</b> been Dan.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 Ford Mustang GT from Shelby was {{previously}} only offered {{in a white}} exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running {{the length of the}} vehicle, but 2012 will see two new colors in Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes. These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible will offer a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit includes a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced. The 2012 Shelby GT350 will deliver the same performance numbers as the 2011 model with a 5.0L V8 delivering 430 hp normally aspirated, 525 hp supercharged, or 624 hp supercharged version. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system <b>have</b> <b>really</b> allowed this V8 to take {{on a life of its}} own. An automatic transmission is optional with the normally aspirated engine, but some will go towards the short throw shifter manual transmission because they actually enjoy to drive. Keeping the powerful engine under control will be an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes.|$|E
