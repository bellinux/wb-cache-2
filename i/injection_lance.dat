40|$|Increasing {{interfacial}} area through gas injection {{is one of}} the main methods for accelerating reaction between slag, metals, and gases in modem pyrometallurgical reactors. In slag-metal reactors, the generation of a large number of metal droplets into the slag phase through high gas velocity has a much larger effect on the overall kinetics compared to the enhanced mass transfer through mixing, Top blowing technology generates large {{interfacial area}}s (> 300 m 2 /tonne) through high impingement gas velocity at short distances between the exit of the <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> and the metal-slag interface.

40|$|One way {{to further}} utilize {{produced}} gases {{in an integrated}} metallurgical plant is to replace oil or coal with gas as a reducing agent in a blast furnace. Therefore, it is {{of great interest to}} study the injection of reducing gas into the blast furnace. A fundamental three-dimensional mathematical model has been developed where the injection of the gas by lances into the tuyere is simulated. The model includes the coupled solution of the flow field and the combustion reactions of the gases inside the tuyere. The combustion reactions are modeled using a simple reaction scheme with three possible reactions that can occur. Two different types of fuel gas have been modeled, namely coke oven gas (COG) and basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF). The influence of the following parameters on the predicted velocities, temperatures and composition of the gas at the tuyere outlet are examined in this study: i) comparison between the two types of gases using one <b>injection</b> <b>lance,</b> ii) injection amount of coke oven gas, iii) the use of one or two injection lances, and iv) the influence of the injection angles when using two injection lances. The modeling technique is presented and discussed as well as the implied results. The results show that the coke oven gas is combusted more completely than the BOF gas, which leads to higher flame temperature of the blast. Furthermore, the combustion conditions are better when using two injection lances compared to when using one <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> and the predicted results are not affected to a large degree when the injection angles are changed. The modeling of the raceway is so far not included in the model, hence the influence of the outlet boundary condition at the tuyere is not reflected in the presented results...|$|E
40|$|In this research, coal {{combustion}} behavior across {{the regions of}} blowpipe, tuyere, and raceway of blast furnace are numerically examined. Three different lance configurations, including a single lance, a double air-cooled coaxial lance, and an oxy-coal lance with different oxygen enrichment patterns, are taken into consideration. The {{coal combustion}} efficiency by the double <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> is 5. 1 % higher than that by single <b>lance</b> <b>injection.</b> From the calculated temperature by the oxy-coal lance, coal ignition is retarded due to the cooling effect of enriched oxygen flowing through the lance annulus, resulting in the moderation of pressure loss within the raceway. Most importantly, the enriched oxygen becomes the combustion enhancer in the downstream of coal plume after ignition is triggered. Consequently, the coal burnout under the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> is comparative to that under the double air-cooled <b>lance</b> <b>injection.</b> The performance of blast furnace may be improved with the advantages provided by the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> <b>injection.</b> Compared with the single <b>lance</b> <b>injection,</b> coal trajectories under the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> are closer to the tuyere exit due to the higher inertia force of coal particles against hot blast. This {{should be taken into}} account for the designs of the oxy-coal lance...|$|R

The lower level of submergence caused a rapid spread of the gas jet at the top section of the bath and the higher submergence levels improved the agitation and flowfields in the bath.

40|$|The dynamic free lance, {{discovered}} accidentally in 2005, is a {{new type}} of <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> with its top-end connected with a flexible joint so that the lance tip could move during the gas injection. Without mechanical driving apparatus, the free lance is capable of injection of reagent into wide space of the bath. The investigation of the free lance indicated that the lance movement caused forceful interaction of the injection gas with the liquid phase, and jet trajectory was changed due to the drag force from the liquid phase. A lance with weight of 15 kg and length of 2 m has been used as the free lance for modeling study, indicating that the heavy free lance for the industry could achieve certain extent of movement for dispersion injection, and this prediction has been proved in 2012 by industrial application of the 9 meters free lance used for the injection modification of end-slag from BOF converter.

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of advancing prices for blast furnace coke and primary energy carriers based on fossil fuels the ironmaking industry tries to utilize secondary raw materials to the maximum feasible extent. In Germany among others plastic granulate material produced from recycled sales packaging that arises from the “Green Dot” system, {{is used as a}} substitute reducing agent and energy source. Up to particle sizes of 10 mm the material can be injected into the blast furnace via the tuyères by using a pneumatic conveying system and by means of several <b>injection</b> <b>lances.</b> Although the physical and chemical parameters of the applied recycling products are specified in principle there can be deviations resulting from inefficient material processing. Particularly with regard to particle size individual lots can contain a higher amount of fine and fibrous particles that build up fluff agglomerates when being agitated as it is the case during pneumatic conveying and injection, in consequence of which the pipes and filters of the system are choked. The occurrence of fluff therefore requires additional treatment of the material. At the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering & Solids Processing of the Technical University of Berlin the dry separation of the fluff material fraction has been systematically investigated in the framework of a cooperation project with ironmaking industry. The paper presents results from bench scale tests using a laboratory zigzag sifter. The analysis of separation efficiency with respect to finding the optimal process parameters in terms of volumetric air flow rate and solids throughput comprised the evaluation of material recovery and grade efficiency curves. Based on the results a process for industrial application can be designed. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{pneumatic}} {{method of}} introduction of various powders into ladle or metallurgical furnaces is use {{because of its}} many advantages. There are no problems with use of injection lances in electric arc furnaces but in inductive furnaces or ladles, especially big ones the problem of metal flowing out of it may appear. This {{is the reason why}} the authors have maiden some experiments which results are presented in the article. Design/methodology/approach: The new lance with a flange was invented and used in powdered material injections experiments. The experimental plan was prepared that contain the most important parameters of pneumatic process. A statistical analysis was made to connect the results of the injection process with its parameters. Findings: The main conclusion is the influence of carrier gas pressure, lance inside diameter and mass concentration of diphase stream on the obtained results. The next one is that changing of the lance geometry could effectively improve the technological parameters of the process and that the new design of the <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> is prepared properly. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of the results is that the experiments were only the “cold model” ones, without presence of molten metal. The only liquid medium used was water for experiments with stream distance measurement. The nest experiments are planned with injection of powder into laboratory induction furnaces for checking the obtained results. Practical implications: According to the authors, the new lance can be used for introducing a small quantity of the powdered material like modifiers or something like that. Originality/value: The approach to the problem of diphase stream forces and distance of stream in liquid is according to authors’ knowledge a new one. The lance with flange proposed for those usage is not present in literature and is an originality too.

40|$|Purpose: The {{pneumatic}} powder injection into liquid alloys {{is known}} since many years. It is use in many metallurgical processes (recarburization, alloy additions introduction, desulphurization etc.). The problem {{in some cases}} is to prevent the carrier gas introduction into liquid bath. Design/methodology/approach: The objectives were achieved by researches with laboratory injection stand. The main research method was measurement of stream parameters and computation of pneumatic injection indexes. Findings: The new <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> was invented and analyzed {{and this is one}} of the main subjects of this paper. The lance has a construction, that makes possible even complete elimination of carrier gas introduction into liquid metal with proper particles stream range. The paper shows the results of the tests of lances with various geometrical parameters and model experiments with diphase stream force measurement. Research limitations/implications: The future research should be made with various type of powdered materials to find the question what are the limits of changing the most important parameters (grain size, stream concentration etc.). The limitation is number of values being analyzed (in powder injection processes there are many) in experimental plan. Practical implications: The lance can be used for powders pneumatic injection but only for small its quantities (e. g. microalloying) because non-immersed lance should be used with low stream concentration. The usage of that lance can decrease liquid alloy heat losses (not introducing carrier gas into liquid) and lance consumption (non-immersed in liquid bath). Originality/value: The original value of the paper is taking into account the parameter called by authors “diphase stream force” on liquid metal surface being “attacked” by particles (or carrier gas stream). Nobody (in author’s opinion) was analyzed that problem with connection in powder injection processes. The paper can be helpful for everybody who is studying pneumatic injection processes...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} investigations {{were carried}} out on the fluid flow behaviour within cylindrical liquid baths agitated by a top submerged gas <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> system. The effects of key hydrodynamic parameters, such as the swirl and non-swirl gas injection, the gas injection flow rate, the level of submergence and the depth and size of liquid bath, on the flow structure and the mixing process within the bath were investigated. Experimental and numerical results from the current study enabled to gain more knowledge and physical understanding of such system, and to determine the optimum operating conditions for the industrial systems. The Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurement technique was employed to determine the mean and turbulent flow structure in laboratory models of top submerged gas injection into liquid baths. Two cylindrical air-water models were constructed according to the geometric similarity criteria related to the real industrial smelting furnaces. The experimental operating conditions were then decided based on the Froude number dynamic similarity criterion. The three-dimensional flowfield structures of the liquid phase including the time mean velocity components and turbulence parameters were obtained {{with the aid of}} LDA under forty-two combinations of the operating conditions for both laboratory models. A digital video recording technique was also employed to study the plume characteristics due to the LDA limitation in obtaining the velocities in the plume region. Numerical simulations of the fluid flow structure within a liquid bath that is agitated by a top submerged gas injection system {{were carried out}} using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package CFX 4. A two-dimension gas-liquid transient numerical model was developed by using the Eulerian-Eulerian approach.

40|$|The work {{discussed}} in this thesis is aimed at examining the formation of freeze layers and refractory wear on water-cooling elements within direct smelting processes {{through the use of}} computational modelling techniques. The motivation of performing this work is to examine the cooling of regions of the Smelt Reduction Vessel of the HIsmelt process closer to the molten bath material. HIsmelt is a novel process for the production of pig iron which has been under development by Rio Tinto and is now being ommercialised. The previous work performed in this are has been reviewed with particular focus on the refractory wear mechanisms as the solidification algorithms have been thoroughly implemented within the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework PHYSCIA used within this work. The governing equations along with the Finite Volume discretisations of these equations are set out within this thesis. Some comment is made about the solution methods used, and how boundary conditions are implemented. The Free-surface flow and Solidification governing relationships are also described as these are important for investigating the formation of freeze layers. The implementation of the refractory wear mechanisms are {{discussed in}} some detail. The three mechanisms implemented are for the penetration of slag into the refractory, the corrosion of the refractory by this penetrated slag; and the erosion of the refractory by the bulk flow of slag within the furnace. To be able to reasonably predict refractory wear, it is necessary to make the properties of the materials within the system temperature dependent. During the pilot plant trials at the HIsmelt® Research and Development facility, located in Kwinana Western Australia, accretions formed {{on the end of the}} solids <b>injection</b> <b>lances.</b> These accretions have been termed Elephant's Trunks. With the imminent construction of the Development Plant which injects the iron bearing feeds at an elevated temperature rather than at ambient temperatures used on the pilot plant, the formation of these pipe-like accretions under both the cold and hot injection conditions have been examined. This work provides confidence that the freeze layers predicted from the model will reflect those formed within the furnace. To evaluate the effectiveness of the refractory wear mechanisms, data from experimental and the HIsmelt pilot plant have been modelled. Sections of refractory samples from an induction furnace test and a rotary slag test have been modelled. The results are in agreement with the profile and affected regions of the sectioned refractory test pieces. A part of the HIsmelt pilot plant Smelt Reduction Vessel (SRV) has been modelled for the period of campaign 8 - 1 & 8 - 2 (just over 20 days). The predicted wear is in agreement with the measurements taken after the vessel had been cooled. To bring together freeze layer formation with the refractory wear mechanisms, a water-cooled element was modelled for the sloping slag section. The results show the growth of a small freeze layer that is consistent with the small freeze layer seen on the upper cooling panels of the pilot plant SRV. This model is an ideal tool to evaluate different water-cooling strategies for HIsmelt and other similar direct smelting processes. This work has developed models that predict the formation of freeze layers and refractory wear within direct smelting processes. The models have focused on slag-refractory interactions and further work would be needed to extend the refractory wear models to account for metal-refractory interactions. To examine spalling, stress calculations could be performed to determine when this may occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} (BF) {{chemically}} reduces and physically converts the iron ore into a liquid called hot metal. Pulverized coal injection (PCI) was {{implemented in the}} industry {{in the middle of}} the 1980 ´s. PCI improves the BF-process economically and provides possible heat level control but may introduce operational disturbance. Due to the harsh environment inside the BF experimental data is hard to obtain. Therefore computational fluid dynamics (CFD) often is used to understand and further optimize the process. The process can be improved by increasing the coal combustion inside the BF. One way of doing this is by increase the dispersion of the coal particle plume from the PCI. To be able to validate a CFD-model experiments for particle dispersion have been conducted at room temperature for two different lance types. The results from the experiment were in the form of images and some collected fluid data (boundary conditions). The objective of this study has been to create a CFD-model for particle injection through an <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> and develop a methodology to validate the particle dispersion model against the experimental images. The result from this work consists of two CFD-models, where main errors corresponding to numerical methods have been investigated and discussed. Further, this work has generated a model validation method based on analyzing the luminosity dispersion in images. The main conclusions from this work are:• The coaxial model generated an estimated model error of 10 - 15 % depending on the investigated boundary conditions. The value of the model error for the coaxial model is of high credibility based on the estimated magnitude of the iteration and discretization errors that were made• The swirl model generated an estimated model error of 6 - 19 % depending on the investigated boundary conditions.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{economic}} benefits of pulverised coal injection (PCI) into blast furnace include {{a reduction in the}} cost of hot metal, resulting primarily from decreased coke consumption and an increase in hot metal production. Since coal is consumed directly, without going through the cokemaking plant, PCI is also thought to be environmentally friendly. Therefore, PCI has become a standard practice in many blast furnaces worldwide. To improve the performance of PCI operation, a comprehensive understanding of pulverised coal combustion behaviours are required. The goal of this thesis was to study the coal burning characteristics in the regions of blowpipe, tuyere and raceway through both numerical and experimental methodology. From the validation of model, the calculation region and the application of calculated results in practice, the PCI combustion model was developed through 4 phases in this work: (1) validation of the coal combustion model by comparing its predictions with experimental data; (2) investigation into the influence of operation conditions to coal burnout in the regions of blowpipe and tuyere; (3) performance evaluation of coal blend injection in terms of pressure loss caused by combustion within a simplified raceway space; and (4) examination of combustion characteristics of oxy-coal injection technology in the regions of blowpipe, tuyere and raceway, which is a porous space featured by Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid approach. In the first phase, the performance of coal devolatilisation models and kinetic parameters were validated by comparing predicted gas temperature profiles with the experimental results of Burgess et al. (1983). It is found that the kinetic parameters proposed by Ubhayakar et al (1976) for the two competing devolatilisation model permit a reasonable simulation of the measured results for blast furnace conditions. The coal combustion in the regions of blowpipe and tuyere was modelled under the conditions of CSC’s N⁰ 3 blast furnace in the second phase. The influence of operation conditions to coal burnout was comprehensively studied. It is found early ignition can be achieved with higher coal burnout when the double lance is employed instead of the single one. Accordingly, the <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> used at CSC was changed from the single to the double air-cooled coaxial lance arrangement in 2002. In the third phase, the calculation was extended to the raceway with simplified configuration. The performance of coal blend injection was examined. As indicated in the calculation results, a decrease in coal burnout is found with decreasing the coal volatile content, while the pressure loss within the raceway can be abated due to less volatile released to gas and moderate gas expansion in the combustion region. With improved permeability, more hot blast air can be introduced into the blast furnace for higher productivity. Consequently, the high volatile coal injection was replaced by the coal blend (mixtures of high and low volatile coals) injection at CSC in 2003. In the last phase, the Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid model was employed for the prediction of raceway configuration with consideration of coke combustion in all coke operation. Validation work against measured raceway shape and gas composition distribution by Nogami et al. (2005) indicates that the model is acceptable for the simulation. The calculation results show the oxy-coal lance injection enables to fulfil two contradictory conditions at the same time: (1) to retard the coal combustion for moderating the pressure loss in the upstream of coal plume; and (2) to enhance coal combustion and reduce unburnt char generation in the downstream of coal plume. Taking these advantages from the oxy-coal lance injection, blast furnaces can be operated with more blast for higher productivity, or with higher PCI rate for lower fuel cost, thereby achieving the goal of hot metal production with energy saving. In this work, a drop tube furnace has been established and used to provide fundamental insights on PCI coal combustion behaviours. The experiments were carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the volatile release and the generation of char particle and tiny aerosols in the region of coal plume were studied. Only the tested low volatile coal (HGI= 85) with larger size (100 - 200 mesh) exhibits fragmentation during heating. This may encourage the use of low volatile coals in granular coal injection. Significant char agglomeration is found for both tested high and low volatile coals with smaller size (200 - 325 mesh). It implies that excessive grinding may be avoided in PCI operation. Considering the generation of tiny aerosols composed of soot particles and tar droplets, it is mainly determined by the content of volatile matter and elemental oxygen. In the second stage, a technology has been developed and employed at CSC to evaluate the combustion efficiency of PCI coals. It is found that the coal burnout increases with decreasing the fuel ratio (FC/VM), except for certain coals departing from the general trend. It {{can be explained by the}} effect of maceral content to coal combustion. When the coal size is smaller than 200 mesh, the burnout can not be improved further, resulting from the agglomeration of fine particles. In the PCI operation at CSC, the coal quantity passing through 200 mesh has been reduced from 80 to 60 %. The experiments for the last stage aim to gain a fundamental insight into the combustion characteristics of pulverised biofuels under conditions pertinent to the raceway of blast furnace. From the van Krevelen diagram, it is found that the rate of hydrogen release from biomass fuels is faster than that of oxygen during the pre-treatment. An increase in pretreating temperature almost linearly decreases the burnout of biofuels. As revealed in the experimental results, the fuel properties, such as fuel ratio, burnout, and ignition temperature, of biomass torrefied at 300 °C or pyrolysed between 400 and 500 °C, are between a high-volatile bituminous coal and a low-volatile one. Therefore, the pretreated biomass can partially replace the coals consumed for PCI and blends with coals to keep reasonable burnout in raceways. It is emphasised that, due to the objectives of this thesis, some results or countermeasures obtained from the comprehensive experimental and numerical studies have been taken into PCI operation at CSC. This seems as a limitation of this study, but it may have a wide range of applications for the improvement of PCI operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the flow}} of swirl and non-swirl gas injections into a liquid bath was investigated experimentally, using water as modelling fluid to gain an understanding of the mixing process of the Sirosmelt top submerged gas injection system. The effects of swirl intensity, gas <b>injection</b> rates and <b>lance</b> submergence levels on the gas-liquid interaction were determined by measuring the velocity fields and the generation of turbulence in the bath. The results indicate that the swirl gas injection promoted high liquid velocities and high turbulent kinetic energy and hence better mixing in the tank.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work conducted from September 16, 2005 through December 31, 2008 {{on the project}} entitled Ã¢ÂÂBrominated Sorbents for Small Cold-Side ESPs, Hot-Side ESPs and Fly Ash Use in ConcreteÃ¢ÂÂ. The project covers testing at three host sites: Progress Energy H. F. Lee Station and the Midwest Generation Crawford and Will County Stations. At Progress Energy Lee 1, parametric tests were performed both with and without SO{sub 3 } injection {{in order to determine}} the impact on the mercury sorbent performance. In addition, tests were performed on the hot-side of the air preheater, before the SO{sub 3 } is injected, with H-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ sorbents designed for use at elevated temperatures. The BPACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ injection provided the expected mercury removal when the SO{sub 3 } injection was off. A mercury removal rate due to sorbent of more than 80 % was achieved at an injection rate of 8 lb/MMacf. The operation with SO{sub 3 } injection greatly reduced the mercury sorbent performance. An important learning came from the injection of H-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ on the hot-side of the air preheater before the SO{sub 3 } injection location. The H-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ injected in this manner appeared to be independent of the SO{sub 3 } injection and provided better mercury removal than with injecting on the cold-side with SO{sub 3 } injection. Consequently, one solution for plants like Lee, with SO{sub 3 } injection, or plants with SO{sub 3 } generated by the SCR catalyst, is to inject H-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ on the hot-side before the SO{sub 3 } is in the flue gas. Even better performance is possible by injecting on the cold-side without the SO{sub 3 }, however. During the parametric testing, it was discovered that the injection of B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ (or H-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢) was having a positive impact upon ESP performance. It was decided to perform a 3 -day continuous injection run with B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ in order to determine whether Lee 1 could operate without SO{sub 3 } injection. If the test proved positive, the continuous injection would continue as part of the long-term test. The injection of B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ did allow for the operation of Lee 1 without SO{sub 3 } injection and the long-term test was conducted from March 8 through April 7, 2006. The total mercury removal for the 30 -day long-term test, excluding the first day when SO{sub 3 } was injected and the last day when a plain PAC was used, averaged 85 %. The achievement of 85 % Hg removal over the 30 days longterm test is another milestone in the history of achievement of the Albemarle Environmental f/k/a Sorbent Technologies Corporation B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ sorbent. A clear indication of the impact of B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ on opacity came at the end of the long-term test. It was hoped that Lee 1 could be operated for several days after the end of the long-term test. It took less than a day before the opacity began to increase. The discovery that B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ can improve ESP performance while capturing a large amount of mercury is another milestone for the B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ mercury sorbent. The parametric testing at the Midwest Generation Crawford Station was divided into two phases; the first using C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢, the concrete friendly sorbent, and the other using nonconcrete friendly materials. The first phase of the parametric tests was conducted before the long-term test. The second phase of the parametric testing was performed after the long-term test in order to avoid contaminating the fly ash containing the concrete friendly sorbents. The parametric test began with an injection rate of 1 lb/MMacf and, after a period to allow the mercury concentration to stabilize, the rate was increased to 3 lb/MMacf. The Hg removal for this test was about 60 % due to sorbent and 69 % total at the injection rate of 1 lb/MMacf and 80 % due to sorbent and 84 % total for the 3 lb/MMacf injection rate. The average total vapor phase mercury removal for the first 21 days of the long-term test was 82 % at an injection rate of 4. 6 lb/MMacf. The last nine days of the long-term test was used for testing different sorbents. A series of tests with different B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ sorbents followed the long-term test. All of the B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢, sorbents had similar mercury performance, achieving about 70 %, 80 % and 90 % mercury removal due to sorbent at injection rates of 2, 4 and 6 lb/MMacf, respectively. It took 50 % more of the Norit Hg LH sorbent to achieve 80 % mercury removal than with the B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢, sorbents. The impact of C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ on the properties of concrete was investigated by Lafarge (the fly ash seller at Crawford), by Albemarle Environmental f/k/a Sorbent Technologies, and by Headwaters Resources, a project partner. The properties evaluated include the concrete air content, air stability, air distribution, setting time, and strength. C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ does not appear to deleteriously affect any of the important properties of concrete. It may even improve some properties. The finding that C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ does provide high levels of mercury removal without impacting the fly ash cement properties is a milestone in this project. At Crawford 7, the opacity would increase 3 % to 5 % over a period of hours from the time that the boiler first reached high load until the boiler load was reduced at night. For the parametric test, the opacity dropped when the C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ was turned on or when the injection rate was increased. As the long-term test progressed, the opacity for each successive period when at full load was lower than the previous one, so that at the end of the test the opacity at full load was averaging about 8 % below that before the injection began. The finding that a gas-phase brominated mercury sorbent such as B-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ or C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ can positively impact ESP performance is another milestone for this project. Midwest Generation Will County Unit 3 is equipped with a hot-side ESP and, thus, the injection temperature was about 700 {degree}F. The high temperature version of C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ was used in the trial since it was desired to maintain the fly ash for sale for cement use. The duration of the testing at the Will County Station was reduced from that originally planned, due to a reduction in DOE funding. The biggest changes were the shortening of the baseline period and the switch from a long-term 30 -day test to a short continuous injection run. The first phase of the parametric injection tests used only one sorbent (the high temperature version of C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢) but different <b>injection</b> <b>lances.</b> Regular lances were used in the first day of this phase of testing and the X-a-Lances on the second day. The injection of the high temperature version of C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ with regular <b>injection</b> <b>lances</b> provided mercury removal rates of about 30 % and 45 % due to sorbent at the injection rates of 3 and 5 lb/MMacf, respectively, based upon cold-side flow rates. This is very good performance considering that the injection temperature is about 700 {degree]F at full load. However, the same sorbent at the same injection rates provided mercury removal rates of about 50 % and 67 % when the X-a-Lances were utilized. This is an improvement of about 50 % relatively. As a result of these findings, the X-a-Lances were used for the rest of the test program. The standard H-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ sorbent performed in the same manner as did the C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢. The performance of the Norit Hg LH sorbent was poor in this application. C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ did increase the foam index of the fly ash slightly, as was observed in the testing at the Midwest Generation Crawford Station, but the increase was small and predictable enough to allow for the use of the fly ash in cement. The impact of C-PACÃ¢ÂÂ¢ on the properties of concrete was not investigated due to the limitation of funds. However, based upon past experience, it is highly likely that the concrete properties including the concrete air content, air stability, air distribution, setting time, and strength would have shown no impact based upon the minimal impact upon foam index...|$|R

A number of complex phenomena take place during the injection process which require {{an investigation of the}} kinetics, thermodynamics, transport processes and overall process dynamics of both the molten iron and the top-slag layer to predict the dynamic removal of sulphur from hot metal. A one dimensional model in terms of <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> depth is presented, which is dynamically updated {{for the duration of the}} blow. The model takes into account the kinetics, thermodynamics and transport processes to predict the sulphur levels in the hot metal throughout a blow. A sensitivity analysis is performed to aid in the optimal selection of operating parameters. The model was implemented in MATLAB® and calibrated with data from the Mittal Steel plant in Saldanha, South Africa. The modelling results are significant in that it allows the selection of operating conditions to minimize the processing time for desulphurisation, and the minimization of the heat loss (that has to be regained in the subsequent steelmaking operations). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Tamarisk (Tamarix sp.), {{commonly}} known as salt cedar, is an exotic (nonnative) shrub or tree that grows in dense stands along rivers and streams across the West. Tamarisk reached the Grand Canyon area during the late 1920 s and early 1930 s, becoming a dominant riparian zone species along the Colorado River in 1963 following completion of Glen Canyon Dam. These prolific nonnative shrubs displace native vegetation and animals, alter soil salinity, affect water quality and increase fire frequency. Once established in an area, it typically spreads and persists. Preliminary surveys conducted in 157 Grand Canyon National Park side canyons indicate that tamarisk is {{in the early stages}} of invading tributaries from the main river corridor. Arresting the tamarisk spread from the river into side canyons is desirable while control is still feasible. No action was considered as one alternative. One action alternative was considered. Alternative B includes the use of mechanical removal, <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> of Garlon, hack and squirt method, cut stump method and basal bark application of Garlon herbicide. The environmental consequences of each of these alternatives were evaluated.

40|$|A pilot-scale field {{demonstration}} of waste isolation using viscous- liquid containment barriers has been {{planned for the}} 281 - 3 H retention basin at the Savannah River Site, Aiken, SC. The 281 - 3 H basin is a shallow retention/seepage basin contaminated mainly by radionuclides. The viscous-liquid containment barrier utilizes the permeation of liquid grout to either entomb the contaminants within a monolithic grout structure or to isolate the waste by drastically reducing the permeability, of the soils around the plume. A {{clear understanding of the}} hydrogeologic setting of the retention basin is necessary for proper design of the viscous liquid barrier. To aid in the understanding of the hydrogeology of the 281 - 3 H retention basin, and to obtain critical parameters necessary for grout injection design, a series of tests were undertaken in a region immediately adjacent to the basin. The objectives of the LWIT were: 1. To evaluate the general performance of the <b>Lance</b> <b>Injection</b> Technique for grout emplacement at the site, including the range and upper limits of injection pressures, the flow rates applicable for site conditions, as well as the mechanical forces needed for lance penetration. 2.

40|$|Gas liquid {{reactors}} are extensively {{used in many}} metallurgical processes {{involving the}} refining of liquid metals. In these processes, reactions leading to the oxidation of various solutes in liquid metal often compete with each other, which ultimately determine the liquid metal composition. In the present paper, a model has been proposed to simulate the evolution of solute contents in a metallic melt considering mass transfer of solutes in the melt {{in the vicinity of}} the bubble, equilibrium at the gas-metal interface and gas composition evolution in the bubble during its ascent through the melt. The composition of solutes at the metal-gas interface in principle can be altered by changing the injected gas composition. The model was applied to the case of oxygen <b>injection</b> through a <b>lance</b> into liquid steel-containing C and Cr, aiming sufficient decarburization without much oxidation of Cr to the slag. The Cr loss to the slag by oxidation is generally much more than that expected based on equilibrium thermodynamics applied to the bulk metal and gas. The actual Cr loss, as shown by the present model, is determined by the composition of solutes at the metal-gas interface rather than in the bulk. The effect of change of the partial pressure of oxygen in the bubble by replacing oxygen by carbon dioxide in the injected gas and the corresponding evolution of C and Cr contents in the melt was simulated. Some preliminary experiments were conducted to validate the model predictions. The frame work of the model is generic and can be extended to many gas-liquid metal reactors in liquid metal processing...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{description}} of the design study for a pilot-scale field demonstration of the Viscous Liquid Barrier (VLB) technology, a new subsurface containment technology for waste isolation using a new generation of barrier liquids. The demonstration site was Retention Basin 281 - 3 H, a shallow catchment basin at the Savannah River Site, which is contaminated mainly by radionuclides ({sup 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr, and {sup 238 }Pu). The goals of the field demonstration were (a) to demonstrate the ability to create a continuous subsurface barrier in order to isolate the contaminants, and (b) to demonstrate the continuity, performance, and integrity of the barrier. The site was characterized, and preliminary hydraulic conductivity data were obtained from core samples. Based on the site characteristics and the functional requirements, a conceptual model was developed, the barrier specifications were defined, and <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> was selected as the emplacement method. The injection strategy for the subsurface conditions at the site was determined using numerical simulations. An appropriate variant of Colloidal Silica (CS) was selected as the barrier liquid based on its relative insensitivity to interactions with the site soils, and the formulation for optimum site performance was determined. A barrier verification strategy, including hydraulic, pneumatic, tracer, and geophysical methods, was developed.

40|$|Purpose: The {{method of}} {{pneumatic}} injection of powdered reagents into liquid alloys in some moment ofmelting process is known since many years.

This {{is the reason for}} making investigations in thefield of powders <b>injection</b> with non-submerged <b>lance.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The main experimental method was measurement and recording of timechangingdiphase stream force value with use of dedicated laboratory stand. The recorded data made possible toshow character of force in form of graphs and calculation of stream parameters. The last step was formulatingof statistical equations joining all important parameters of the process. Findings: In the course of the work was found a diphase stream force character (especially interesting are startand end point of injection). The influence of main pneumatic parameters on the force value was analyzed too. Research limitations/implications: The future experiments will be conducted with use of Fluent 6. 2 programfor checking the results in computer simulations. The limitation is number of values being analyzed inexperimental plan. Practical implications: The invented lance can be used for powders pneumatic injection but only for smallits quantities (e. g. microalloying) because non-immersed lance should be used with low stream concentration. The usage of that lance can decrease liquid alloy heat losses (not introducing carrier gas into liquid) and lanceconsumption (non-immersed in liquid bath). Originality/value: The problem of stream force in powder injection process is in Poland only analyzed byDepartment of Foundry and nobody (in author’s opinion) was analyzed it with connection in powder injection.

40|$|Mining of lignite in Lusatia has a {{long history}} of over 100 years. The {{extracted}} brown coal is utilized to generate electricity in three large power plants: Jänschwalde, Boxberg, and Schwarze Pumpe. With an annual carbon dioxide (CO 2) output of approximately 50 million tons, these power plants are among Germany’s large-scale CO 2 emitters. The environmental impact from open-pit mining is of a considerable degree and currently poses a challenging problem. The groundwater deficit in 1990 was 7 billion m 3 over a surface area of approximately 2100 km 2 (Luckner, 2006 a) and was bisected in value until today. Due to the decline of mining activity and the termination of mine drainage at most open pits in the Lusatian region, the groundwater table has recovered forming 28 pit lakes (Zschiedrich, 2011). The majority of the post mining lakes do not meet the quality standards for pH, iron or sulfate parameters; because of pyrite oxidation that produces acid mine drainage (Luckner, 2006 b, Klapper and Schultze, 1995, Schultze et al., 2010). The post mining lakes in Lusatia have low pH values (3 – 4), high sulfate contents (up to 2800 ppm) as well as high iron concentrations (100 – 150 ppm). Lakes are flooded by groundwater and using surface water from Spree and Neisse River to achieve fast filling and dilution; however, due to the limited availability of surface water, further rehabilitation strategies for the region had to be investigated. Between 1970 and 1990, approximately 26 million m 3 of suspended fly ash were deposited in the lake Burghammer and settled as an ash body at its base; where it may be used for rehabilitation. In a first experiment conducted in 2001 material from the ash body was picked up and redistributed throughout the lake. By this treatment the pH of the lake was raised temporarily; however, a sustainable remediation was not achieved. Based on these experiments it was investigated whether the ash reacts more sufficiently through additional CO 2 injection or not. Aim was to combine the rehabilitation of acid mine lakes with the utilization of atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. The CO 2 sequestration is achieved through the generation and accumulation of carbonates in the lake. The following equations describe the precipitation of carbonate by using CO 2 and alkaline earth cations M: CO 2 + MO → MCO 3 (s) CO 2 + M(OH) 2 → MCO 3 (s) + H 2 O Therefore, neutral pH conditions are necessary for the long-term accumulation of carbonates in the lakes. In laboratory investigations it was shown, that the 20 to 30 years old fly ash deposits of lake Burghammer can be used for carbonate sequestration and lake water treatment. Bivalent ions (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) are eluable and available for carbonate precipitation; on average we assumed 1 wt. -% of reactive calcium to be contained in the settled ash sediments. Settled fly ash sediments are less reactive than fresh fly ash from a power plant (e. g. Schwarze Pumpe). During batch experiments, we increased the buffering capacity to maximum values of 7 mmol/L. Beforehand no buffering capacity exists due to the low pH of 2. 9 in the lake. Batch investigations provided a sequestration potential of 17 g CO 2 /kg ash sediment; in comparison fresh fly ash results in a sequestration potential of 33 g CO 2 /kg ash (Schipek and Merkel, 2008 b, Schipek and Merkel, 2008 a, Schipek, 2009). Based on the laboratory results a field experiment was conducted. In this field experiment gas <b>injection</b> <b>lances</b> were installed to a sediment depth of 12 m. Gaseous CO 2 was applied with a pressure of 2. 2 bar and 2. 2 m³/h for 3 months and lake water was monitored during injection. Variations in total inorganic carbon due to diffusion processes of CO 2 saturated pore waters could be observed. As the pilot experiment comprised only a small area of lake Burghammer no initial neutralisition (e. g. by a suction excavator) was possible. Thus, no further changes in water chemistry were observed. Drilling cores in the vicinity of the injection area provided mineralogical and geochemical conditions before and after CO 2 treatment. No trace metal mobilization was found during CO 2 injection. Most elements showed decreasing trends or didn’t change significantly. Calculated saturation indices for calcite indicated equilibrium conditions or slightly oversaturated conditions (SICalcite,average + 0. 12; SICalcite,median + 0. 31). Geochemical and mineralogical investigations proved that CO 2 sequestration is possible with an average precipitation rate of 0. 5 wt. -% (2. 2 g CO 2 /kg). The maximum rate for carbonate precipitation was determined with 7. 4 wt. -% Calcite, according to 32. 6 g CO 2 per kilogram treated ash. Besides the use of the settled fly ash as neutralizing agent in acidic mining lakes, laboratory and field investigations were conducted in order to improve in-lake liming. In batch and columns experiments, different liming agents (synthetic marble powder and industrial products) were tested and investigated. Significant differences in reactivity were obvious at pCO 2 > 3. 8 • 10 - 4 atm. Ions typical for acid mine drainage (e. g. Mn 2 +, Cd 2 +, SO 42 -) do have different effects on the kinetic of carbonate dissolution. Manganese concentrations typical for acidic mining lakes inhibit calcite dissolution. Cadmium has as well a significant influence on dissolution and kinetics. Only circa 50 % of the calcium concentration was reached with cadmium as inhibitor compared to the dissolution in pure water. Increased CO 2 partial pressure might be used to compensate inhibtion by material impurities and/or water constituents. Column experiments showed that a multi-stage application of liming agent increases the efficiency of a lake treatment. The combination of a first application of calcite (up to pH 4. 5) and further application of Ca(OH) 2 seemed to be the most promising method. This treatment sheme was successfully applied in lake Burghammer from March 2009 – December 2010 (initial neutralisation and 6 follow-up treatments). Finally, it can be concluded, that in lignite mining districts in-lake treatment of acidic mining lakes is a seminal method to handle water quality problems. Using gaseous CO 2 in combination with industrial by-products can be accounted as sustainable method for CO 2 sequestration and for treatment of AMD. The advantage for mining areas lays in the prevention during treatment of acid mine lakes. Nevertheless, this method presents only a niche solution due to the dependence on alkaline materials, e. g. fly ash. The development of further strategies and optimization during lake water treatment by in-lake liming might improve the effectiveness of the method. Using calcite instead of NaOH or CaO as liming agent will provide advantages in being more economic and ecological (CO 2 bilance). In order to enhance efficiency the use of calcite in combination with CO 2 can be a worth considering suggesting. If meteorological parameters (wind) and lake specific characteristics (morphology, currents, etc.) will be considered efforts and costs for in-lake liming will be minimized. Der Abbau von Braunkohle im Lausitzer Bergbaurevier hat seit über 100 Jahren Tradition. Die abgebaute Braunkohle wird dabei hauptsächliche zur Energieerzeugung in den drei großen Kraftwerken Jänschwalde, Boxberg und Schwarze Pumpe genutzt. Mit einem jährlichen Kohlenstoffdioxid (CO 2) – Ausstoß von circa 50 Millionen Tonnen gehören diese Kraftwerke zu Deutschlands größten CO 2 -Emittenten. Der Einfluss auf die Umwelt durch Tagebau-Betrieb ist von beträchtlichem Ausmaß und bringt große Probleme mit sich. Im Jahr 1990 betrug das Grundwasser-Defizit im Lausitzer Bergbaurevier 7 Milliarden m³ auf einer Fläche von circa 2100 km² (Luckner, 2006 a). Dieses Defizit hat sich bis zum heutigen Zeitpunkt halbiert. Durch den Rückgang der Bergbauaktivitäten und die Beendigung der Wasserhaltungsmaßnahmen in den meisten Tagebauen, hat der ansteigende Grundwasserspiegel 28 Tagebaufolgeseen geschaffen (Zschiedrich, 2011). Der überwiegende Teil der Tagebaufolgeseen ist aufgrund der Pyritoxidation, welche AMD (acid mine drainage) produziert, hinsichtlich der Wasserqualitätsparameter stark beeinflusst (Luckner, 2006 b, Klapper and Schultze, 1995, Schultze et al., 2010). Die Tagebaufolgeseen im Lausitzer Bergbaurevier sind durch niedrige pH-Werte (3 – 4), hoche Sulfat-Konzentrationen (bis zu 2800 ppm) und hohe Eisengehalte (100 – 150 ppm) gekennzeichnet. Die entstehenden Seen sind hauptsächlich durch aufsteigendes Grundwasser und Oberflächenwasser aus den Flüssen Spree und Neisse geflutet. Aufgrund der geringen Verfügbarkeit von Oberflächenwasser mussten weitere Sanierungsmaßnahmen für die Region untersucht werden. Zwischen 1970 und 1990 wurden im Tagebaufolgesee Burghammer circa 26 Millionen m³ Flugasche-Suspension als Aschekörper abgelagert, wobei eine Nutzung zu Sanierungszwecken angedacht war. Im Rahmen einer Aschesedimentumlagerung im Jahr 2001 wurde der pH-Wert des Seewassers kurzzeitig angehoben, eine nachhaltige Sanierung fand jedoch nicht statt. Auf Grundlage dieser Ergebnisse wurde im Rahmen dieser Dissertation untersucht, ob die abgelagerten Aschesedimente nachhaltiger durch Einsatz von CO 2 reagieren. Ziel war es die Sanierung von Tagebaufolgeseen mit der Reduktion von CO 2 -Emissionen aus Kohlekraftwerken zu kombinieren. Diese CO 2 -Sequestrierung sollte durch die Bildung und Ablagerung von Carbonaten im Seesediment erfolgen. Die Gleichungen (1) und (2) beschreiben dabei die Fällungsreaktion von Carbonaten aus CO 2 mit dem Alkalimetall M (aus Oxiden bzw. Hydroxiden) : CO 2 + MO → MCO 3 (s) CO 2 + M(OH) 2 → MCO 3 (s) + H 2 O Zur Carbonatfällung und nachhaltigen Ablagerung sind neutrale pH-Bedingungen notwendig. In Laboruntersuchungen konnte gezeigt werden, dass die 20 bis 30 Jahre alten Flugaschesedimente zur CO 2 -Sequestrierung in Kombination mit Seewasserbehandlung genutzt werden können.|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Bath type furnaces have become an established technology for the intensive smelting, converting and refining of primary and secondary raw materials. Since these furnaces normally have large inventories, long time constants and complex metallurgies, a dynamic model-based prediction strategy is the only feasible approach to operator decision support and process control. This dissertation presents a semi-empirical approach to the stochastic modelling of bath-type pyrometallurgical reactors, which leads to a generic model type called the Equilib-ARMAX model. The modelling approach is applied to three case studies: • A nickel-copper matte converting operation using a submerged <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> reactor • A chromite smelting operation to produce high carbon ferrochrome using a direct current (DC) plasma smelting furnace • An ilmenite smelting operation to produce high titania slag and pig iron, using a direct current (DC) plasma smelting furnace. In each case, the industrial operations were analysed with regard to the practical and technological constraints which influence the type and quality of the process data. The fundamental process phenomena associated with each operation have been analysed to ascertain which fundamental variables should be included within the overall semi-empirical approach, without sacrificing model transparency, simplicity, accuracy and calculation time. It was considered that an overly complex model would be inappropriate given that data from industrial smelting operations show significant random variance. The thermochemistry and phase equilibria associated with each operation are discussed in detail, as they become the fundamental backbone of the semi-empirical models. The equilibria have been modelled with software that uses non-ideal solutions models and Gibbs free energy minimisation to predict the phase and chemical equilibria that could be expected for a given feed recipe and operating temperature. As the thermodynamic modelling software is not stable within an industrial environment, an artificial intelligent mapping technique has been developed to map process inputs to equilibrium outputs. A multi-layer perceptron neural network has been used as the convenient mapping method to represent equilibrium. The neural networks were trained using tens of thousands of feed recipes, where the feed component ratios were varied based on a 3 N factorial design. The amounts and chemistries of all equilibrium phases could be calculated with high accuracies (R 2 > 0. 95) in all cases. Further stochastic analysis and modelling require additional information about the property distributions associated with each measurement. The homogeneities of the furnace products (slag, alloy and flue dust) critically influence the level of confidence that one can associate with plant measurements. The homogeneities were characterised for the DC plasma arc furnaces and they were benchmarked against a submerged arc furnace. It was found that the homogeneity varied per element, with silicon and sulphur tending to show highest variations in the alloy melts. The observation that the variation in these two elements are both high can partially be attributed to the fact that SiS evaporates from the bath surface, especially in regions close to the arc attachment zone. A significant negative correlation was found between the relative standard deviation per tap (using silicon) and the degree of superheat / subcooling of the alloy, indicating that the homogeneity can be strongly influenced by the changes in rheology due to subcooling below the liquidus (which leads to the precipitation of solid phases and increases the observed melt viscosity). Mixedness or homogeneity and data uncertainty are therefore inseparably linked. The relative standard deviations associated with the homogeneity characterisation, as well as known sampling and assaying variances were used to develop reconciled material balances based on measured plant data. Material balance closure was therefore obtained within the inherent uncertainties of the plant data. Biases in the plant data were identified simultaneously with data reconciliation. Moreover, it was shown using Fast Fourier Power Spectra and statespace analysis that the data reconciliation was a good low-pass filter, as it extracted the major process trends components in the noisy data and it also improved the overall dynamic behaviour characteristics of the data. Finally systems identification techniques were used to develop dynamic transfer function models that were linear in the parameters to be estimated. These systems models were based on the reconciled plant data and equilibrium predictions. The final systems models are therefore equilibrium-autoregressive-moving-average models with exogenous variables (Equilib-ARMAX). The model parameters can be estimated recursively using a simple least squares method. The final models could dynamically predict the metallurgy of the subsequent tap 4 - 6 hours in advance, based on a given suite of set-points, within the inherent accuracy of the data. These models may be used to suggest the optimal operating conditions through an operator guidance system, or more simply, the models are simple enough to be used in a spreadsheet on a manager's desk. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Bad-tipe oonde is reeds 'n gevestigde tegnologie wat algemeen gebruik word vir die intensiewe smelting, omsetting en raffinering van primere en sekondere roumateriale. Aangesien hierdie oonde normaalweg groot inventarisse, lang tydkonstantes en komplekse metallurgiee het, is dinamiese, modelgebaseerde voorspelling die enigste uitvoerbare benadering tot operateur besluitnemingsteunstelsels en prosesbeheer. Hierdie proefskrif stel 'n nuwe generiese, semi-empiriese benadering voor om die bad-tipe oonde stogasties te modelleer en lei tot die sogenaamde Equilib-ARMAX model. Die modelleringsbenadering word geevalueer deur drie gevallestudies: • 'n Nikkel-koper swawelsteen omsettingsproses in 'n dompel-Ians inspuit reaktor • 'n Chromiet smeltingsproses om hoe-koolstof ferrochroom te produseer in 'n gelykstroom (GS) plasmaboogoond • 'n Ilmeniet smeltingsproses om hoe titania slak en ruyster te produseer in 'n gelykstroom (GS) plasmaboogoond. In elke geval is die industriele prosesse ontleed met betrekking tot die praktiese en tegnologiese beperkings wat die tipe en die gehalte van die prosesdata beinvloed. Die fundamentele prosesgedrag van elke proses is ontleed om te bepaal welke fundamentele veranderlikes ingesluit moet word in die semi-empiriese benadering, sonder om model deursigtigheid, eenvoud, akkuraatheid en berekeningstyd in te boet. Die ontwikkeling van oor-komplekse modelle is beskou as ongepas, gegewe dat die data van industriele smeltingsprosesse beduidende onsekerhede toon. Die termochemiese en fase-ewewigte geassosieer met elke proses word breedvoerig bespreek, aangesien dit die fundamente 1 e grondslag van die semi-empiriese modelle verskaf. Die ewewigte is gemodelleer met rekenaar simulasie-programmatuur wat nie-ideale oplossingsmodelle en Gibbs vrye-energie minimering gebruik om die fase en chemiese ewewigte, wat verwag kan word vir 'n gegewe toevoerresep en bedryfstemperatuur, te voorspel. Aangesien termodinamiese modelleringsprogrammatuur normaalweg nie stabiele gedrag toon in 'n intydse industriele omgewing nie, word kunsmatig intelligente projeksietegnieke gebruik om prosesinsette te projekteer na die ekwavilente ewewigsvoorspellings. 'n Multilaag perseptron neurale netwerk is gebruik as 'n eenvoudige metode om hierdie ewewigsprojeksies voor te stel. Die neurale netwerke is afgerig deur van tienduisende toevoer resepte gebruik te maak. Die verhoudings van die komponente in die voer is gewissel gebaseer op 'n 3 N faktoriaalontwerp. Die hoeveelhede en samestelling van al die ewewigsfases kon in alle gevalle bereken word met hoe akkuraatheid (R 2 > 0. 95). Verdere stogastiese analise en modellering is slegs moontlik met kennis oor die eienskapsverspreidings geassosieer met elke komponent. Die homogeniteite van die oondprodukte (slak, legering en vlieg-as) bepaal, tot 'n groot mate, die betroubaarheidsvlak van die aanlegmetings. Homogeniteite is gekarakteriseer vir die GS-plasmaboogoonde en is vergelyk met die homogeniteite wat in dompelboogoonde gevind word. Die homogeniteite het gevarieer per komponent. Silikon en swawel neig om die grootste ruimtelike variasies te toon in die legerings wat bestudeer is. 'n Beduidende negatiewe korrelasie is gevind tussen die relatiewe standaardafwyking per tap (gebaseer op silikon) en die graad van superverhitting / onderverkoeling van die legering. Dit dui aan dat die homogeniteit sterk beinvloed word deur veranderinge in die smelt reologie. Vermenging, reologie, homogeniteit en data onsekerheid (integriteit) is daarom ten nouste gekoppel. Die relatiewe standaardafwykings geassosieer met die homogeniteitsbepaling, asook die monsternemings- en ontledingsvariansies, is gebruik om die aanlegdata te rekonsilieer onderhewig aan die behoud van die komponent en totale stroom massabalanse. Die massabalanse is dus gesluit deur aanpassings aan die metings te maak binne die inherente onsekerhede in die data. Sistematiese foute in die data is gelyktydig met die rekonsiliasie geidentifiseer. Verder is deur diskrete Fourier energiespektra en toestand-ruimte analises getoon dat massabalans-rekonsiliasie dien as 'n goeie seinfilter om hoe-frekwensie geraas te verminder en tergelykertyd die dinamiese gedragseienskappe van die data te verbeter. Stelsel-identifikasietegnieke is gebruik om dinamiese oordragsfunksiemodelle te ontwikkel wat linieer is met betrekking tot die modelparameters. Hierdie stelselmodelle is gebaseer op gerekonsilieerde data, eksogene prosesdata en ewewigsberekeninge, en word vervolgens ewewigs-autoregressiewe-lopende-gemiddelde modelle met eksogene veranderlikes (Equilib ARMAX) genoem. Die modelparameters kan deur gewone kleinste-kwadrate metodes beraam word. Die finale modelle kan die metallurgie van toekomstige tappe 4 - 6 uur voortydig voorspel, gebaseer op beskikbare stelpunte en binne die inherente presisie van die data. Hierdie modelle kan gebruik word om optimale bedryfskondisies vir prosesbeheer te identifiseer, en is eenvoudig genoeg om in sigbladformaat op 'n aanlegbetuurder se rekenaar gebruik te kan word...|$|R
