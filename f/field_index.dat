Here I generalize the calculation to an arbitrary <b>field</b> <b>index</b> n> 0.

Comment: 57 pages, 4 figures. v 2 : I solved the model also for off-energy dispersion orbits. The dispersion orbits are circles and I calculated the spin decoherence rate exactly. v 3 : I solved the model also for vertical motion, for n= 0 (logarithmic potential).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{two sets}} of formulas related to a Spin Coherence Time (SCT) case with only vertical oscillations in a purely electric ring, the first derived by the author for the <b>field</b> <b>index</b> m > 0 and the second by Ivan Koop for the <b>field</b> <b>index</b> m = 0. I argue that a continuous transition can exist from one set to the other (contrary to appearances), and assume that {{a necessary condition for}} the transition is that both sets of formulas follow from the same equation. I demonstrate that they do follow when one takes into account that the first set of formulas holds only for times much larger than the period of the vertical oscillations. This demonstration confirms the correctness of the formulas and the equation. Comment: 6 pages, originally a Storage Ring EDM Collaboration Note (17 February 2013...|$|E

Optical functions are identical over the large momentum range as well. We have designed a straight beam transport line (BTL) using a scaling FFAG type magnet which has a field profile of y^{k}, where y is the horizontal coordinate and k is the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>index.</b> This FFAG-BTL has very large momentum acceptance and optical functions that, practically speaking, do not depend on momentum.

An obvious application of this design is the BTL after an FFAG accelerator to a patient in a hadron therapy facility or to a target in general.

40|$|Background: Glaucoma is {{a common}} cause of visual {{impairment}} and blindness. The Heidelberg Retinal Tomogram (HRT) evaluates the structural details of the optic disc and has been widely investigated as a research tool in imaging of the ONH. The correlation between the perimetry and HRT data in Caucasian eyes has been reported previously. Objective: To correlate the HRT parameters and visual <b>field</b> <b>indices</b> in Indian eyes including established glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. Methods: Eighty-three eyes of 50 patients having primary open angle glaucoma underwent automated Humphrey perimetry (30 - 2) and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT II). The global visual <b>field</b> <b>indices</b> and the HRT II parameters were correlated. Results: The average MD of the study group was – 3. 70  3. 99 dB (range 1. 11 to – 19. 54). The correlations between global parameters by HRT and global visual <b>field</b> <b>indices</b> {{were found to be}} significant for rim area, rim volume, height variation contour, mean RNFL thickness and found RNFL cross sectional area. The strongest correlation was between rim area and PSD (r = 0. 32, p = 0. 0029). Conclusion: There was a good correlation between global visual <b>field</b> <b>indices</b> and HRT II parameters with highest correlation coefficient of 0. 32. Since we had several parameters correlating well, we can say that in early glaucomatous damage HRT II is as sensitive as perimetry and HRT II could be a useful tool in evaluation and diagnosis of glaucoma...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} clinical measurements and glaucoma-specific {{quality of life in}} Chinese glaucoma patients. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: An academic hospital in Hong Kong. Patients: A Chinese translation of the Glaucoma Quality of Life– 15 questionnaire was completed by 51 consecutive patients with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma. The binocular means of several clinical measurements were correlated with Glaucoma Quality of Life– 15 findings using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and linear regression. The measurements were the visual <b>field</b> <b>index</b> and pattern standard deviation from the Humphrey Field Analyzer, Snellen best-corrected visual acuity, presenting intra-ocular pressure, current intra-ocular pressure, average retinal nerve fibre layer thickness via optical coherence tomography, and the number of topical anti-glaucoma medications being used. Results: In these patients, there was a significant correlation and linear relationship between a poorer Glaucoma Quality of Life– 15 score and a lower visual <b>field</b> <b>index</b> (r= 0. 3, r 2 = 0. 1, P= 0. 01) and visual acuity (r= 0. 3, r 2 = 0. 1, P= 0. 03). A thinner retinal nerve fibre layer also correlated with a poorer Glaucoma Quality of Life– 15 score, but did not attain statistical significance (r= 0. 3, P= 0. 07). There were no statistically significant correlations for the other clinical parameters with the Glaucoma Quality of Life– 15 scores (all P values being > 0. 7). The three most problematic activities affecting quality of life were “adjusting to bright lights”, “going from a light to a dark room or vice versa”, and “seeing at night”. Conclusion: For Chinese primary open-angle glaucoma patients, binocular visual <b>field</b> <b>index</b> and visual acuity correlated linearly with glaucoma- specific quality of life, and activities involving dark adaptation were the most problematic. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

A prospective case-control study was performed and included 173 recently diagnosed glaucoma patients and 63 unaffected individuals from the Macular Ganglion Cell Imaging Study. Regression analysis of receiver operating characteristic were conducted to {{evaluate the}} influence of age, spherical equivalent, axial length, optic disc size, and visual <b>field</b> <b>index</b> on the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurements.

Diagnostic performance of the Cirrus HD-OCT may be more accurate in the advanced stages of glaucoma than at earlier stages. A smaller optic disc size was significantly associated with improved the diagnostic ability of average RNFL thickness measurements; however, GCIPL thickness may be less affected by age and optic disc size...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} silent reading performance and visual field defects in patients with glaucoma using an eye tracking system.

All participants in Group G had early to advanced glaucomatous visual field defects but better than 20 / 20 visual acuity in both eyes. Participants silently read Japanese articles written horizontally while the eye tracking system monitored and calculated reading duration per 100 characters, number of fixations per 100 characters, and mean fixation duration, which were compared with mean deviation and visual <b>field</b> <b>index</b> values from Humphrey visual field testing (24 - 2 and 10 - 2 Swedish interactive threshold algorithm standard) of the right versus left eye and the better versus worse eye. There was a statistically significant difference between Groups G and N in mean fixation duration (G, 233. 4 msec; N, 215. 7 msec; P = 0. 010). Within Group G, significant correlations were observed between reading duration and 24 - 2 right mean deviation (rs = - 0. 280, P = 0. 049), 24 - 2 right visual <b>field</b> <b>index</b> (rs = - 0. 306, P = 0. 030), 24 - 2 worse visual <b>field</b> <b>index</b> (rs = - 0. 304, P = 0. 032), and 10 - 2 worse mean deviation (rs = - 0. 326, P = 0. 025).
