5000|$|An {{otoscope}} or auriscope is {{a medical}} device {{which is used to}} look into the ears. Health care providers use otoscopes to screen for illness during regular check-ups and also to investigate ear symptoms. An otoscope potentially gives a view of the ear canal and tympanic membrane or eardrum. Because the eardrum is the border separating the external ear canal from the middle ear, its characteristics can be indicative of various diseases of the middle ear space. The presence of cerumen (ear wax), shed skin, pus, canal skin edema, foreign body, and various ear diseases can obscure any view of the eardrum and thus severely compromise the value of otoscopy done with a common otoscope. [...] The most commonly used otoscopes consist of a handle and a head. The head contains a light source and a simple low-power magnifying lens, typically around 8 diopters (3.00x Mag). The distal (front) end of the otoscope has an attachment for disposable plastic ear specula. The examiner first straightens the ear canal by pulling on the pinna and then inserts the <b>ear</b> <b>speculum</b> side of the otoscope into the external ear. It is important to brace the hand holding the otoscope against the patient's head to avoid injury to the ear canal by placing the index finger or little finger against the head. The examiner can then look through a lens on the rear of the instrument and see inside the ear canal. In many models, the lens can be removed, which allows the examiner to insert instruments through the otoscope into the ear canal, such as for removing earwax (cerumen). Most models also have an insertion point for a bulb capable of pushing air through the speculum which is called pneumatic otoscope. This puff of air allows an examiner to test the mobility of the tympanic membrane.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used otoscopes—those used in emergency rooms, pediatric offices, general practice, and by internists- are monocular devices. They provide only a two-dimensional view of the ear canal, its contents, and usually at least {{a portion of the}} eardrum, depending on what is within the ear canal and its status. Another method of performing otoscopy (visualization of the ear) is use of a binocular microscope, in conjunction with a larger metal <b>ear</b> <b>speculum,</b> with the patient supine and the head tilted, which provides a much larger field of view and the added advantages of a stable head, far superior lighting, and most importantly, depth perception. A binocular (two-eyed) view is required in order to judge depth. If wax or another material obstructs the canal and/or a view of the entire eardrum, it can easily and confidently be removed with specialized suction tips and other microscopic ear instruments, whereas the absence of depth perception with the one-eyed view of a common otoscope makes removal of anything more laborious and hazardous. Another major advantage of the binocular microscope is that both of the examiner's hands are free, since the microscope is suspended from a stand. The microscope has up to 40x power magnification, which allows much more detailed viewing of the entire ear canal, and of the entire eardrum unless edema of the canal skin prevents it. Subtle changes in the anatomy are much more easily detected and interpreted than with a monocular view otoscope. Traditionally only ENT specialists (otolaryngologists) and otologists (subspecialty ear doctors) acquire binocular microscopes and the necessary skills and training to use them, and incorporate their routine use in evaluating patient's ear complaints. Studies have shown that reliance on a monocular otoscope to diagnose ear disease results in a more than 50% chance of misdiagnosis, as compared to binocular microscopic otoscopy. The expense of acquiring a binocular microscope is only one obstacle to its being more widely adapted to general medicine. The low level of familiarity with binocular otoscopy among pediatric and general medicine professors in physician training programs is probably a more difficult obstacle to overcome. Thus, the standard of general otologic diagnosis and ear care remains, for the most part, the largely antiquated monocular otoscope.|$|E

30|$|Musculoskeletal tumors and tumor-like lesions of the calcaneus {{are rare}} but {{have to be}} taken into {{consideration}} for chronic heel pain. Once a lytic bone lesion is recognized on plain radiography, calcaneal lipoma of bone and unicameral bone cyst represent one of several entities that must be further investigated by MRI (Pogoda et al. 2004). To avoid pathologic fractures, large lesions are recommended for prophylactic surgical therapy, even if the patient is free of symptoms (Pogoda et al. 2004). Traditionally, symptomatic cases of IOL or UBC were treated with open curettage and bone grafting. Compared to open curettage with a longitudinal incision parallel to the planta pedis or a classic L-shaped incision, minimally-invasive ossoscopy can diminish the risk of impaired wound healing and speed-up superficial wound healing (Yildirim et al. 2011). Several studies demonstrated that minimally-invasive ossoscopy can offer a safe alternative to open surgical procedures (Futani et al. 2007; Innami et al. 2011; Mainard and Galois 2006; Yildirim et al. 2011). Compared to endoscopic resection and filling with an injectable bone substitute, allogenic bone grafting is both less expensive (Kurien et al. 2013) and might prove biologically superior. As a modification of previously reported procedures, the use of an <b>ear</b> <b>speculum,</b> as described in our technique, can facilitate the process of grafting with cancellous bone chips.|$|E
30|$|The type of {{intervention}} for unicameral bone cysts remains controversial (Levy et al. 2015). General treatment options for UBC include curettage {{in combination with}} autologous or allogenic grafting, the use of bone substitutes, autologous bone-marrow injection and various methods of cyst decompression including cannulated screws or a cannulated hydroxyapatite pin (Chang et al. 2002; Levy et al. 2015; Pogoda et al. 2004; Shirai et al. 2015; Yildirim et al. 2011). Nowadays most of these techniques can be performed percutaneously or minimally-invasive. For the weight bearing lower extremity, especially for calcaneal localizations, special considerations {{have to be taken}} into account, though. In 2015 Levy et al. conducted the first systematic review on the treatment of unicameral bone cysts of the calcaneus. His results clearly demonstrated that all patients who underwent operative curettage with bone substitute—whether autograft or allograft—enjoyed a statistically significant improvement in heel pain and demonstrated the best outcomes in his review regarding osteointegration and rate of recurrence (Levy et al. 2015). Curettage with bone augmentation demonstrated significant improvements over curettage with cannulated-screw placement. No information was available on endoscopic procedures with minimally-invasive curettage and bone grafting. Moreover, curettage with bone graft substitutes showed generally better outcomes than steroid injections (Cho et al. 2007; Glaser et al. 1999; Levy et al. 2015; Mainard and Galois 2006). Standard surgical procedures such as open curettage and autologous bone grafting can entail non-negligible risks and complications, though. Potential donor site morbidity is a major disadvantage of autologous bone grafting (Calori et al. 2014; Schaaf et al. 2010). Conventional open curettage and plombage of a benign lytic calcaneal bone lesion are usually performed through a lateral surgical approach with a longitudinal or L-shaped skin incision and a fenestration of the lateral cortical wall of the calcaneus. Prolonged wound healing and iatrogenic damage of the sural nerve are well-known complications for this localization (Ding et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015). Furthermore, a large fenestration can weaken the cortical structures of the calcaneus additionally. Advantages of MIS (minimally-invasive surgery) include less pain, less scarring and better aesthetical results as only a small incision and limited dissection is necessary (Mainard and Galois 2006; Yildirim et al. 2011). Our hypothesis for this procedure is that endoscopic resection and allografting for benign osteolytic lesions of the calcaneus minimizes risks associated with conventional open surgery and autologous grafting whilst offering all the benefits of a minimally-invasive technique and of the traditional treatment with open curettage and grafting in terms of good osteointegration and low rates of recurrence. Endoscopic curettage of solitary calcaneal cysts with different forms of grafting has been reported before with good results (Innami et al. 2011; Yildirim et al. 2011). To the best of our knowledge, endoscopic treatment for intraosseous lipoma (IOL) of the calcaneus has only been reported as a case report so far (Futani et al. 2007; Muramatsu et al. 2014). Compared to autografts allogenic bone is easily available and almost unlimited in supply. Compared to injectable bone substitute, percutaneous grafting with allogenic cancellous bone chips can be exhausting and time-consuming, though. Costs and osteointegration might still favour the use of allografts. We present our modification to previously described techniques of endoscopic curettage with particular focus on IOL and allogenic cancellous bone grafting. The key point of the procedure is the use of a funnel-shaped <b>ear</b> <b>speculum</b> facilitating the filling of the bone cavity with allogenic cancellous bone chips. The objective {{of this study is to}} present a simple, safe and cost-effective surgical technique for ossoscopic treatment of benign osteolytic lesions of the calcaneus.|$|E
