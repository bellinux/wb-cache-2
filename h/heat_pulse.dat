25|$|Three of {{the four}} probes have tiny heating {{elements}} and temperature sensors inside them. One probe uses internal heating elements to send out a pulse of heat, recording the time the pulse is sent and monitoring {{the rate at which}} the heat is dissipated away from the probe. Adjacent needles sense when the <b>heat</b> <b>pulse</b> arrives. The speed that the heat travels away from the probe as well as the speed that it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and thermal diffusivity (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{model of}} the transmission line was probably described by Georg Ohm (1827) who established that resistance in a wire is proportional to its length.*John C. Shedd, Mayo D. Hershey, [...] "The history of Ohm's law", The Popular Science Monthly, pp.599-614, December 1913 ISSN 0161-7370. The Ohm model thus included only resistance. Latimer Clark noted that signals were delayed and elongated along a cable, an undesirable form of distortion now called dispersion but then called retardation, and Michael Faraday (1853) established that {{this was due to}} the capacitance present in the transmission line. Lord Kelvin (1854) found the correct mathematical description needed in his work on early transatlantic cables; he arrived at an equation identical to the conduction of a <b>heat</b> <b>pulse</b> along a metal bar. This model incorporates only resistance and capacitance, but that is all that was needed in undersea cables dominated by capacitance effects. Kelvin's model predicts a limit on the telegraph signalling speed of a cable but Kelvin still did not use the concept of bandwidth, the limit was entirely explained in terms of the dispersion of the telegraph symbols. The mathematical {{model of the}} transmission line reached its fullest development with Oliver Heaviside. Heaviside (1881) introduced series inductance and shunt conductance into the model making four distributed elements in all. This model is now known as the telegrapher's equation and the distributed elements are called the primary line constants.Heaviside, O, Electrical Papers, vol 1, pp.139-140, Boston, 1925 ...|$|E

From the characteristic time constants, the thermal diffusivities were calculated and compared with those obtained through the known values of thermal constants of the homogeneous liquids. From the course of decay of the thermal lenses, their focal lengths {{at the beginning of the}} decay process were determined. Generally, the characteristic decay time constants were found to be smaller, the focal lengths longer, and the thermal diffusivities greater with polarized than with non-polarized <b>heating</b> <b>pulses.</b> The difference is interpreted in terms of the unidirectional alignment of induced dipoles by the linearly polarized <b>heating</b> <b>pulse...</b>|$|R

We observe a strong dependence of the laser pump-gain medium coupling on the laser pump parameters. The most efficient coupling of laser pump energy into the gain region occurs with the formation of lower density gradients in the pre-formed plasma and when the duration of the main <b>heating</b> <b>pulse</b> is comparable to the gain lifetime ({approx} 10 ps for mid-Z Ni-like schemes).

50|$|After further {{research}} the dual-probe heat-pulse technique was developed. It {{consists of two}} parallel needle probes separated by a distance (r). One probe contains a heater {{and the other a}} temperature sensor. The dual probe device is inserted into the soil and a <b>heat</b> <b>pulse</b> is applied and the temperature sensor records the response as a function of time. That is, a <b>heat</b> <b>pulse</b> is sent from the probe across the soil (r) to the sensor. The great benefit of this device is that it measures both thermal diffusivity and volumetric heat capacity. From this, thermal conductivity can be calculated meaning the dual probe can determine all the main soil thermal properties. Potential drawbacks of the heat-pulse technique have been noted. This includes the small measuring volume of soil as well as measurements being sensitive to probe-to-soil contact and sensor-to-heater spacing.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the time {{presentation}} of a given external heat load was examined on five subjects exercising at a constant work load (50 W). The subjects, dressed in briefs, were exposed to cyclic variations for 120 min in air temperatures between 51 degrees C and 23 degrees C, under three different schedules involving <b>heat</b> <b>pulses</b> of 10 -min, 20 -min and 30 -min duration, respectively. The strain induced by each of these conditions was compared {{in terms of both}} physiological and perceptual criteria. Results showed that between conditions, there were significant differences in skin temperature levels but not in core temperature levels, body heat storage, or body weight loss. Perception of effort and thermal sensation ratings both exhibited similar changes in all three conditions. Due to the time constant of the sweating response, sweating rates and skin wettednesses {{at the end of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>pulses</b> were lower for 10 -min <b>heat</b> <b>pulses</b> than for those of 20 - and 30 -min duration, and these differences were perceived by the subjects.

It is concluded that under the conditions of this study, perceptual criteria associated with physiological criteria represent a useful means of discriminating slight differences in strain.

50|$|Electrical {{switching}} in chalcogenide semiconductors {{emerged in}} the 1960s, when the amorphous chalcogenide Te48As30Si12Ge10 was found to exhibit sharp, reversible transitions in electrical resistance above a threshold voltage. If current is allowed to persist in the non-crystalline material, it heats up and changes to crystalline form. This is equivalent to information being written on it. A crystalline region may be melted by exposure to a brief, intense pulse of heat. Subsequent rapid cooling then sends the melted region back through the glass transition. Conversely, a lower-intensity <b>heat</b> <b>pulse</b> of longer duration will crystallize an amorphous region. Attempts to induce the glassy-crystal transformation of chalcogenides by electrical means {{form the basis of}} phase-change random-access memory (PC-RAM). This technology has been developed to near commercial use by ECD Ovonics. For write operations, an electric current supplies the <b>heat</b> <b>pulse.</b> The read process is performed at sub-threshold voltages by utilizing the relatively large difference in electrical resistance between the glassy and crystalline states.
