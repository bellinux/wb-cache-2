40|$|To {{investigate}} how {{the characteristics of}} <b>interbeds</b> affect hydraulic fracture propagation in the continental shale formation, a series of 300 mm × 300 mm × 300 mm concrete blocks with varying <b>interbeds,</b> based on outcrop observation and core measurement of Chang 7 - 2 shale formation, were prepared to conduct the hydraulic fracturing experiments. The results reveal that the breakdown pressure increases {{with the rise of}} thickness and strength of <b>interbeds</b> under the same in-situ field stress and injection rate. In addition, for the model blocks with thick and high strength <b>interbeds,</b> the hydraulic fracture has difficulty crossing the <b>interbeds</b> and is prone to divert along the bedding faces, and the fracturing effectiveness is not good. However, for the model blocks with thin and low strength <b>interbeds,</b> more long branches are generated along the main fracture, which is beneficial to the formation of the fracture network. What is more, combining the macroscopic descriptions with microscopic observations, the blocks with thinner and lower strength <b>interbeds</b> tend to generate more micro-fractures, and the width of the fractures is relatively larger on the main fracture planes. Based on the experiments, it is indicated that the propagation of hydraulic fractures is strongly influenced by the characteristics of <b>interbeds,</b> and the results are instructive to the understanding and evaluation of the fracability in the continental shale formation...|$|R

5000|$|The Delaware Basin is a 600 meter thick salt formation, formed {{during the}} Permian Period {{approximately}} 250 million years ago.

40|$|<b>Interbed</b> {{multiple}} reflections contain valuable informa-tion about the subsurface reflectivity distribution that can complement information obtained from primary re-flections and free-surface multiples. In this report two methods are developed {{and used to}} migrate <b>interbed</b> mul-tiples.

The first method is more computationally efficient, while the second method utilizes the full Fresnel zone along the <b>interbed</b> multiple generating interface. Numerical tests with synthetic VSP data and field data show that <b>interbed</b> multiples can illuminate areas below salt and can image salt boundaries.

30|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} influencing factors {{on the distribution of}} incremental oil displaced by a polymer flood (extra-displaced oil) using numerical reservoir simulation. These factors include the location, area and permeability of a thin low-permeability <b>interbed,</b> and the perforation location relative to the <b>interbed.</b> Simulation results show the locations from where the incremental oil was displaced by the polymer solution. The <b>interbed</b> position from the oil formation top affects the location of extra-displaced oil. The <b>interbed</b> area has a slight influence on the whole shape of extra-displaced oil. Larger <b>interbed</b> area leads to higher partition extent of extra-displaced oil. Higher vertical permeability of interbeds contributes to worse partition extent of extra-displaced oil and the partition effect disappears if the ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability is more than 0.05. The perforation location relative to the <b>interbed</b> affects polymer displacement efficiency, and also has a significant effect on the distribution of extra-displaced oil in polymer flooding.|$|E

40|$|A {{long-term}} {{assessment of}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) repository performance must consider the impact of gas generation resulting from the corrosion and microbial degradation of the emplaced waste. A multiphase fluid flow code, TOUGH 2 /EOS 8, was adapted to model the processes of gas generation, disposal room creep closure, and multiphase (brine and gas) fluid flow, {{as well as the}} coupling between the three processes. System response to gas generation was simulated with a single, isolated disposal room surrounded by homogeneous halite containing two anhydrite interbeds, one above and one below the room. The interbeds were assumed to have flow connections to the room through high-permeability, excavation-induced fractures. System behavior was evaluated by tracking four performance measures: (1) peak room pressure; (2) maximum brine volume in the room; (3) total mass of gas expelled from the room; and (4) the maximum gas migration distance in an <b>interbed.</b> Baseline simulations used current best estimates of system parameters, selected through an evaluation of available data, to predict system response to gas generation under best-estimate conditions. Sensitivity simulations quantified the effects of parameter uncertainty by evaluating the change in the performance measures in response to parameter variations. In the sensitivity simulations, a single parameter value was varied to its minimum and maximum values, representative of the extreme expected values, with all other parameters held at best-estimate values. Sensitivity simulations identified the following parameters as important to gas expulsion and migration away from a disposal room: <b>interbed</b> porosity; <b>interbed</b> permeability; gas-generation potential; halite permeability; and <b>interbed</b> threshold pressure.

This supports the higher objective of building confidence {{in the use of}} the dual-permeability approach for modeling flow and transport in unsaturated fractured rock systems. In particular, the objective of this work is to be able to understand transport of radionuclides at INEEL and subsequently at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. A 3 -D dual-permeability mesh representing the geological conditions at the LPIT was constructed as shown by the cross-section on Figure 1 a.

40|$|The {{migration}} of radionuclides and volatile chemicals through a thick sequence of unsaturated basalts and sedimentary interbeds has been documented in the Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA) at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The three mechanisms by which this migration may have occurred are seasonal infiltration from the ground surface within the SDA; flood events in 1962, 1969, and 1982; and the lateral movement {{of water from the}} spreading areas located nearby. It is currently thought that the contaminants migrated through the unsaturated sediments and basalt flows during the three flood events. Transducers were used to monitor water level changes in seven wells: Two completed in a perched zone associated with an <b>interbed</b> at 110 feet (34 meters), and five completed in a perched zone associated with an <b>interbed</b> at 240 feet (73 meters). The data suggest that one of the wells completed in the perched zone associated with the <b>interbed</b> at 110 feet receives recharge from seasonal infiltration at the ground surface. This recharge occurs primarily from February to May. Snowmelt is the major source of water for infiltration. One water sample was taken from this well, one water sample was taken from snowmelt at the surface within the SDA, and one water sample was taken from the Big Lost River, which is the source of water diverted into the spreading areas. The three water samples were analyzed for major ions, minor ions, and trace constituents. The water sample from the well was more similar chemically to the water sample from the snowmelt than to the water sample from the Big Lost River. The chemical data support the conclusion that the snowmelt is the source of recharge to the perched zone associated with the <b>interbed</b> at 110 feet. The transducer data from the five wells completed in the perched zone associated with the <b>interbed</b> at 240 feet indicate that one well is dry, and one well has standing water that showed virtually no change in water level. Two of the remaining wells showed seasonal recharge, probably from precipitation. These two wells, and the remaining well, showed rapid water-level rises, and declines, shortly after 157 acre-feet (194, 000 m 3) of water were diverted into the spreading areas. The perched water body associated with the <b>interbed</b> at 240 feet probably receives recharge from both precipitation and from water diverted into the spreading areas...|$|E
