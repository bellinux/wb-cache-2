30|$|The <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> size {{has a major}} {{influence}} on the surface roughness and the surface finish, the improvement by using a smaller <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive</b> is significant. During grinding, only a small top region of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> is efficient for metal removal, the remaining part is sliding and rubbing the workpiece material (Sin et al. 1979). The coarser <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives</b> have bigger abrasive particles, causing larger areas of rubbing during grinding; meanwhile, the size and distribution of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> grains are more uneven in coarser grit size abrasives; thus, more defects and a worse surface finish have been induced by using coarser <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives.</b>|$|R
30|$|Corresponding to {{the surface}} {{topography}} observations, a high amount of large smearing areas or adhesive chips (Fig.  11 a 1) was observed in the cross section from grinding by using 60 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive.</b> In addition, cold welded chips with formation of microcracks (Fig.  11 a 2) were also visible. Both the amount and size of such defects decreased when finer (180 # and 400 #) <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives</b> were used. Images in Fig.  11 show that the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> size has major influence on both the degree of deformation and the deformation depth. Grinding with a 60 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive</b> induced a heavily deformed surface layer of 3 – 4  μm in thickness with a clear fragmented grain structure. The thickness of the heavily deformed layer was reduced to nearly the half when using 180 #, and around one third by 400 #. Meanwhile, coarse <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> (60 #) induced a deformed sub-surface layer of over 20  μm in thickness. The thickness of the deformation-affected layer reduced between 15 and 10  μm when using 180 # and 400 # <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> sizes, respectively. Both the density of slip bands {{and the number of}} deformation slip systems was reduced by using <b>finer</b> <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives,</b> which again indicated smaller deformation.|$|R

40|$|The {{currently}} dominant {{method in}} the production of wafers is to use slurry wire-saw slicing. This paper reports a new wire-saw slicing technology, namely, semifixed abrasive wire-saw slicing. The traditional smooth wire is replaced by a patterned wire with a textured surface that can help the wire carrying the abrasives. It aims to improve the number of transient fixed abrasives in the machining process. Transient fixed abrasives can produce “scratch-indenting” processes that are similar to fixed-abrasive wire slicing thereby improving the efficiency of the wire-saw cutting. This study focuses on the behavioral mechanics of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> in the slurry during the slicing process. The dynamic images of the movement of <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> in the slicing process are obtained by a high-speed camera.

40|$|Conference Name: 5 th International Symposium on Advanced Optical Manufacturing and Testing Technologies - Advanced Optical Manufacturing Technologies. Conference Address: Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:APR 26 - 29, 2010. The {{ultrasonic}} vibration-assisted machining (UVAM) {{technology is}} increasingly attractive for the ultraprecision machining of brittle materials. But the machining mechanism for UVAM is still unknown, {{especially for the}} grinding process. In this paper, the kinematical characteristics of two-dimensional vertical ultrasonic vibration-assisted grinding (UVAG) technology are investigated. A consistent physical modeling of the grinding process with ultrasonic vibration assistance is established firstly, {{which is based on}} the interaction of individual grinding grains with the workpiece. Then the kinematical equation is deduced, and so does the velocity and acceleration of a single <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> relative to the workpiece in UVAG. The kinematics of a single <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> during 2 D UVAG is simulated for the perpendicular vibration mode. The results show that the relation motion of an <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> is altered significantly with the assistance of ultrasonic vibration, and the grinding path is elongated, which will increase the material removal rate per <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit.</b> The most interesting result is that the relative velocity of an <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> in UVAG is changed slightly when compared to that without ultrasonication. While the relative acceleration in UVAG is increasing tremendously, especially for high frequency ratio (a ratio between the vibration frequency to the rotation frequency) condition. This result means that the ultrasonic vibration assistance can introduce a huge acceleration impact on the material in the machining deformation zone by the grinding grit, and may change the material removal mechanism of grinding. Thus it can do a favor to the precision machining of brittle materials. The UVAG experiment of polysilicon shows that the surface roughness is improved and the normal and tangential grinding forces decrease with the increasing of applied voltage, while the axial grinding force increases. The results indicate that the assistance of ultrasonic vibration can result the change of the grinding mechanism of brittle material...|$|R

40|$|Grinding {{process is}} one of the most common methods to {{manufacture}} parts that require precision ground surfaces, either to a critical size or for the surface finish. In abrasive machining, abrasive tool consists of randomly oriented, positioned and shaped <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> which act as cutting edges and remove material from the workpiece individually to produce the final workpiece surface. Hence it is almost impossible to achieve optimum process parameters and a repeatable process by experience or practical knowledge. In order to overcome these issues and predict the outcomes of the operation beforehand, modeling of the process is crucial. The main aim of this thesis is to develop semi-analytical or analytical models in order to represent the true mechanics and thermal behavior of metals during abrasive machining processes, especially grinding operations. Abrasive wheel surface topography identification, surface roughness, thermomechanical and semi-analytical force models and two dimensional moving heat source temperature model are proposed. These models are used to simulate the grinding process accurately. The proposed models are more sophisticated than previous ones as they require less calibration experiments and cover wider range of possible cutting conditions. Once the wheel topography and <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> properties are identified, uncut chip thickness per grain and final workpiece surface profile can be predicted. A novel thermo-mechanical model at primary shear zone with sticking and sliding contact zones on the rake face of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> was established to predict cutting forces by assuming each of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> similar to a micro milling tool tooth. Knowing the force and total process energy, by using two dimensional moving heat source theory, process temperatures are predicted. Moreover, an initial approach and experimental results are proposed in order to investigate and model dynamics and stability dynamics of the grinding process. All proposed models are verified by experiments and overall good agreement is observed...|$|R

40|$|Past {{decontamination}} and {{solvent recovery}} {{activities at the}} Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) {{have resulted in the}} accumulation of 1. 5 million gallons of radioactively contaminated sodium-bearing liquid waste. Future decontamination activities at the ICPP could result in the production of 5 million gallons or more of sodium-bearing waste using the current decontamination techniques of chemical/water flushes and steam jet cleaning. With the curtailment of reprocessing at the ICPP, the focus of decontamination is shifting from maintenance for continued operation of the facilities to decommissioning. As decommissioning plans are developed, new decontamination methods must be used which result in higher decontamination factors and generate lower amounts of sodium-bearing secondary waste. The primary initiative of the WINCO Decontamination Development Program is the development of methods to eliminate/minimize the use of sodium-bearing decontamination chemicals.

30|$|As shown from Fig.  4 a, both 60 # and 180 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives</b> {{have good}} metal removal ability. 28  μm of metal was ground away {{by using a}} 60 # grit size abrasive; and 20  μm more in {{thickness}} was removed by adding one more step of the grinding process using the 180 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive.</b> However, the 280 # and 400 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives</b> have relatively lower metal removal ability, they are used for the surface finish process; only 8  μm in thickness of metal was ground away by using a 280 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive</b> for 5  min plus another 5  min grinding by a 400 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive.</b> The machine power also has a large influence on the metal removal behavior. As illustrated in Fig.  4 b, when using same <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives</b> and same grinding procedures, a maximum metal removal rate was seen with the intermediate power (60 %). A lower machine power (30 %) gave 25  μm of metal removal compared to 48  μm at 60 %, at 90 % power the metal removal dropped to 34  μm. Higher machine power introduced higher grinding force. When grinding with a lower machine power (grinding force), the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> slide and rub over the material surface instead of effective cutting and ploughing. Using a higher machine power (grinding force) increased friction between the abrasive and the workpiece surface as well as wear of <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits.</b> Figure  4 c shows the significant improvement of metal removal ability by using grinding lubrication; the removed thickness was more than doubled (from 48  μm increased to 102  μm) by using lubricant. This {{can be explained by}} the fact that grinding lubrication can help reducing friction at the contact surfaces, diffusing away heat, retaining sharpness of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits,</b> thus induces a favorable metal removal mode (Manimaran et al. 2014; Fredj et al. 2006).|$|R
