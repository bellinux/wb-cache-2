40|$|Sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> {{particles}} {{are an integral}} part of the Earth's radiation budget. To date, the inorganic composition of nascent sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> particles has widely been assumed to be equivalent to the inorganic composition of seawater.

We observe significant enrichment of calcium in submicrometer (< 1  μm in diameter) sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> particles when {{particles are}} generated from both seawater sources in the laboratory as well as in the ambient aerosols samples.

The model simulates such processes as particle production at the sea surface, mixing of particles through the boundary layer by turbulent diffusion, gravitational settling, and dry deposition. The model is initialized at the shoreline with continental and/or surf aerosol. An empirical source function was developed which better accounts {{for the production of}} submicron particles than current formulations. Continental and sea spray particles are treated separately to account for effects of processes depending on chemical composition. CAT has been tested by comparison with independent data sets as regards the prediction of particle size distributions, the wind speed dependence of sea-salt aerosol mass concentrations, and the evolution of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> plumes generated over the surf zone. The model was applied to study effects of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> produced in the surf zone on sea spray concentrations, the composition of continental/sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> mixture, the uptake of nitric acid by sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol,</b> and the effect of the latter process on nitric acid profiles.

40|$|Sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> are an {{important}} part of the climate system through their direct and indirect effects. Due to the diminishing sea ice, the Arctic Ocean is one of the most rapidly changing sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> source areas. However, the influence of these changes on primary particle production is not known. In laboratory experiments we examined the influence of Arctic Ocean water temperature, salinity and oxygen saturation on primary particle concentration characteristics. Sea water temperature was identified as the most important of these parameters. A strong decrease in sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> production with increasing water temperature was observed for water temperatures between &minus; 1 &deg;C and 9 &deg;C. Aerosol number concentrations decreased from at least 1400 cm&minus; 3 to 350 cm&minus; 3 . In general, the aerosol number size distribution exhibited a robust shape with one mode close to Dp 0. 2 &mu;m with approximately 45 % of particles at smaller sizes. Changes in sea water temperature did not result in pronounced change of the shape of the aerosol size distribution, only in the magnitude of the concentrations. Our experiments indicate that changes in aerosol emissions are most likely linked to changes of the physical properties of sea water at low temperatures. The observed strong dependence of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> concentrations on sea water temperature, with a large fraction of the emitted particles in the typical cloud condensation nuclei size range, provide strong arguments for a more careful consideration of this effect in climate models...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there exists}} {{a great deal of}} {{uncertainty}} regarding atmospheric aerosols and the role that they play within the Earth’s atmosphere. It is known that atmospheric aerosols can {{play a role in the}} Earth’s climate by scattering and absorbing solar radiation or acting as a cloud condensation nuclei. The purpose of this work is to obtain an improved understanding of the chemistry of atmospheric aerosols to better determine their impacts the environment, air quality, and climate. This work revolves around one specific type of atmospheric aerosol, i. e. sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> is generated via breaking waves, through wind-driven mechanisms. Ocean water covers roughly 71 % of the Earth’s surface, and from this over 1300 Tg of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> is emitted into the atmosphere every year. However, until recently, the study of sea spray was very challenging and often inconclusive due to the inability to filter background particles out. In this work, the understanding of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> is progressed by taking a two-pronged approach. First, this work focuses on the study of model systems of simple ocean surfactants and NaCl and the change in chemistry that occurs when the two are in the presence of each other. Second, sea spray samples generated during a biological bloom are isolated and analyzed. Using this two pronged approach, it is shown that model systems can provide supporting evidence for hypotheses created from trends discovered in more complex samples. Finally, common aerosol generation, storage, and analysis techniques are studied in order to improve our understanding of their effects on aerosol particles...|$|R

40|$|A new {{sea spray}} source {{function}} (SSSF), termed Oceanflux Sea <b>Spray</b> <b>Aerosol</b> or OSSA, was derived based on in-situ sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> measurements along with meteorological/physical parameters. Submicron sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> fluxes derived from {{particle number concentration}} measurements at the Mace Head coastal station, {{on the west coast}} of Ireland, were used together with open-ocean eddy correlation flux measurements from the Eastern Atlantic Sea Spray, Gas Flux, and Whitecap (SEASAW) project cruise. In the overlapping size range, the data for Mace Head and SEASAW were found to be in a good agreement, which allowed deriving the new SSSF from the combined dataset spanning the dry diameter range from 15 nm to 6 μm. The OSSA source function has been parameterized in terms of five lognormal modes and the Reynolds number instead of the more commonly used wind speed, thereby encapsulating important influences of wave height, wind history, friction velocity, and viscosity. This formulation accounts for the different flux relationships associated with rising and waning wind speeds since these are included in the Reynolds number. Furthermore, the Reynolds number incorporates the kinematic viscosity of water, thus the SSSF inherently includes dependences on sea surface temperature and salinity. The temperature dependence of the resulting SSSF {{is similar to that of}} other in-situ derived source functions and results in lower production fluxes for cold waters and enhanced fluxes from warm waters as compared with SSSF formulations that do not include temperature effects. ©Author(s) 2014...|$|R
40|$|The aerosol in {{the coastal}} {{environment}} consists of a complicated mixture of anthropogenic and rural aerosol generated over land, and sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Also, particles are generate dover sea by physical and chemical processes and the chemical composition may change due to condensation/evaporation of gaseous materials. The actual composition {{is a function of}} air mass history and fetch. At the land-sea transition the continental sources cease to exist, and thus the concentrations of land-based particles and gases will gradually decrease. At the same time, sea spray is generated due to the interaction between wind and waves in a developing wave field. A very intense source for sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> is the surf zone. Consequently, the aerosol transported over sea in off-shore winds will abruptly charge at the land-sea transition and then gradually loose its continental character, while also the contribution of the surf-generated aerosol will decrease. The latter will be compensated, at least in part, by the production of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol.</b> A Coastal Aerosol Transport model is being developed describing the evolution of the aerosol size distribution in an air column advected from the coast line over sea in off-shore winds. Both removal and production are taken into account. The result are applied to estimate the effect of the changing size distribution on the extinction coefficients. In this contribution, preliminary results are presented from a study {{of the effects of the}} surf-generated aerosol and the surface production...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} an inorganic sea spray source function that is based upon state-of-the-art measurements of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> production using a temperature-controlled plunging jet sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> chamber. The size-resolved particle production was measured between 0. 01 and 10 μm dry diameter. Particle production decreased non-linearly with increasing seawater temperature (between − 1 and 30 °C) similar to previous findings. In addition, we observed that the particle effective radius, {{as well as the}} particle surface, particle volume and particle mass, increased with increasing seawater temperature due to increased production of particles with dry diameters greater than 1 μm. By combining these measurements with the volume of air entrained by the plunging jet we have determined the size-resolved particle flux as a function of air entrainment. Through the use of existing parameterisations of air entrainment as a function of wind speed, we were subsequently able to scale our laboratory measurements of particle production to wind speed. By scaling in this way we avoid some of the difficulties associated with defining the "white area" of the laboratory whitecap – a contentious issue when relating laboratory measurements of particle production to oceanic whitecaps using the more frequently applied whitecap method. The here-derived inorganic sea spray source function was implemented in a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (FLEXPART – FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model). An estimated annual global flux of inorganic sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> of 5. 9 ± 0. 2 Pg yr − 1 was derived that is close to the median of estimates from the same model using a wide range of existing sea spray source functions. When using the source function derived here, the model also showed good skill in predicting measurements of Na + concentration at a number of field sites further underlining the validity of our source function. In a final step, the sensitivity of a large-scale model (NorESM – the Norwegian Earth System Model) to our new source function was tested. Compared to the previously implemented parameterisation, a clear decrease of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> number flux and increase in aerosol residence time was observed, especially over the Southern Ocean. At the same time an increase in aerosol optical depth due to {{an increase in the number}} of particles with optically relevant sizes was found.

This paper evaluates a new method to calculate lidar ratio of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> using two independent sources: the AOD from Synergized Optical Depth of Aerosols (SODA) and the integrated attenuated backscatter from CALIOP. The method applied in this study allows particulate lidar ratio to be calculated for individual CALIOP retrievals of single aerosol layer columns over the ocean. Analyses are carried out using CALIOP level 2, 5 km sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> layer products and collocated SODA nighttime data from December 2007 to December 2009. The global mean lidar ratio for sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> was found to be 26 sr, roughly 30 higher than the one prescribed by CALIOP. Data analysis also showed considerable spatiotemporal variability in calculated lidar ratio over different parts of the remote oceans. The calculated aerosol lidar ratios are shown to be inversely related to the mean ocean surface wind speed: increase in ocean surface wind speed (U 10) from 0 to 15 ms- 1 reduces the mean lidar ratios for sea spray particles from 32 sr (for 0 U 10 4 ms- 1) to 22 sr (for U 10 15 ms- 1). Such changes in the lidar ratio are expected to have a corresponding effect on sea spray AOD.
