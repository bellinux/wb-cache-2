5000|$|The period pm of moiré {{lines is}} the {{distance}} from one point where the lines of both layers overlap (at {{the bottom of the}} figure) to the next such point (at the top). Let us count the layer lines, starting from the bottom point. At the count 0 the lines of both layers overlap. Since in our case pr<pb, for the same number of counted lines, the base layer lines with a long period advance faster than the <b>revealing</b> layer <b>lines</b> with a short period. At the halfway of the distance pm, the base layer lines are ahead the <b>revealing</b> layer <b>lines</b> by a half a period (pr/2) of the <b>revealing</b> layer <b>lines,</b> due to which the lines are interleaving, forming a dark moiré band. At the full distance pm, the base layer lines are ahead of the <b>revealing</b> layer <b>lines</b> by a full period pr, so the lines of the layers again overlap. The base layer lines gain the distance pm with as many lines (pm/pb) as the number of the <b>revealing</b> layer <b>lines</b> (pm/pr) for the same distance minus one: pm/pr = pm/pb + 1. From here we obtain the well known formula for the period pm of the superposition image: ...|$|R

50|$|Figure 8 {{helps to}} compute the {{inclination}} degree of moiré optical lines {{as a function of}} the inclination of the revealing and the base layer lines. We draw the layer lines schematically without showing their true thicknesses. The bold lines of the diagram inclined by αb degrees are the base layer lines. The bold lines inclined by αr degrees are the <b>revealing</b> layer <b>lines.</b> The base layer lines are vertically spaced by a distance equal to pb, and the <b>revealing</b> layer <b>lines</b> are vertically spaced by a distance equal to pr. The distances Tb and Tr represent the true space between the base layer and <b>revealing</b> layer <b>lines,</b> correspondingly. The intersections of the lines of the base and the revealing layers (marked in the figure by two arrows) lie on a central axis of a light moiré band. The dashed line of Figure 8 corresponds to the axis of the light moiré band. The inclination degree of moiré lines is therefore the inclination αm of the dashed line.|$|R

40|$|For {{heteroepitaxy}} of InN on GaN(0001) by molecular-beam epitaxy, the {{lattice misfit}} strain is relieved by misfit dislocations (MDs) formed at {{the interface between}} InN and GaN.
