Usually the Plebeian Tribune {{presided over}} the assembly, {{although}} the Plebeian Aedile sometimes did as well. Originally, statutes passed by the Plebeian Council ("Plebiscites") only applied to Plebeians. However, in 449 BC, a statute of an Assembly was passed which gave Plebiscites {{the full force of}} law over all Romans (Plebeians and Patricians). It was not until 287 BC, however, that the last mechanism which allowed the Roman Senate to veto acts of the Plebeian Council was revoked.

40|$|In this article, I {{examine the}} {{rationales}} {{that have been}} given for extending <b>domestic</b> violence <b>legislation</b> to associated persons. I argue that the empirical and principled rationales are unfounded and that the ideological rationale is reactionary. With regard to the empirical rationale, the extent of violence that the aggregate of associated persons suffers is not high enough to justify privileging associated persons over other citizens with regard to protection from violence. In relation to the principled rationale, the impetus for <b>domestic</b> violence <b>legislation</b> was based on isolation and inequality, which are not experienced in particular by the category of associated persons when taken as a whole. With regard to the ideological rationale, it is worrying that intimacy and equality are emerging as the touchstones of a newer rationale for <b>domestic</b> violence <b>legislation,</b> which rightly {{has more to do}} with isolation and inequality than intimacy and equality...|$|R

In addition, the effect of any applicable double tax agreement ('DTA') to such disposals was considered. In certain countries - such as Angola and Nigeria - in terms of their <b>domestic</b> tax <b>legislation,</b> a non-resident will not be subject to capital gains tax in the respective country where the property is situated regardless {{of the value of the}} shares that is attributable to immovable property.
