5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a <b>desaturation</b> reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the <b>desaturation</b> of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Each tissue {{compartment}} {{is assumed}} to fully saturate/desaturate in 6 half-times. This means <b>desaturation</b> of the slowest (120 min) compartment takes 12 hours – hence the 12-hour surface interval before a dive is not considered repetitive with these tables.|$|E
25|$|While P. aeruginosa {{undergoes}} primarily anaerobic <b>desaturation,</b> it also undergoes two aerobic pathways. One pathway utilizes a Δ9-desaturase (DesA) that catalyzes {{a double}} bond formation in membrane lipids. Another pathway uses two proteins, DesC and DesB, together {{to act as}} a Δ9-desaturase, which inserts a double bond into a saturated fatty acid-CoA molecule. This second pathway is regulated by repressor protein DesT. DesT is also a repressor of fabAB expression for anaerobic <b>desaturation</b> when in presence of exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. This functions to coordinate the expression of the two pathways within the organism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Apnoea, <b>desaturations</b> and bradycardias {{are common}} {{problems}} in preterm infants {{which can be}} treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). It is unclear whether synchronised NIPPV (SNIPPV) would be even more effective. Objective To assess the effects of flow-SNIPPV, NIPPV and NCPAP on the rate of <b>desaturations</b> and bradycardias in preterm infants and, secondarily, to evaluate their influence on pattern of breathing and gas exchange. Patients and methods Nineteen infants (mean gestational age at study 30  weeks, 9 boys) with apnoeic spells were enrolled in a randomised controlled trial with a cross-over design. They received flow-SNIPPV, NIPPV and NCPAP for 4  h each. All modes were provided by a nasal conventional ventilator able to provide synchronisation by a pneumotachograph.

40|$|Background and purpose: Hypoxemia can {{adversely}} affect ischemic brain tissue in laboratory animals. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the Value of early continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry in detecting arterial oxygen <b>desaturations</b> in patients with acute hemiparetic stroke, and the effects of oxygen administration. Methods: Over a period of 6 months 49 consecutive patients with acute hemiparetic stroke of less than or equal to 12 h duration were monitored for the first 48 h with pulse oximetry. Patients in whom arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) fell beneath 96 % for a period longer than 5 min were treated with oxygen administered via nasal prongs or oxygen mask. Results: Thirty-one patients (63. 3 %) developed arterial oxygen <b>desaturations.</b> Of these patients 28 could effectively be treated with oxygen up to a flow-rate of 5 l/min. Only 3 patients required higher oxygen concentrations from 6 to 10 l/min. No acute adverse effects of oxygen treatment were observed. All patients with a history of cardiac and pulmonary disease developed drops in SaO(2). The occurrence of arterial oxygen <b>desaturations</b> was related to stroke severity (P= 0. 024), the presence of dysphagia (P= 0. 047), and older age (P= 0. 037). Conclusion: Patients with acute hemiparetic stroke frequently develop arterial oxygen <b>desaturations.</b> Continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry in this group of patients is a simple and useful method to detect drops in SaO(2) and to titrate oxygen administration.

25|$|Aerobic <b>desaturation</b> is {{the most}} {{widespread}} pathway for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. It is utilized in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. This pathway utilizes desaturases to synthesize unsaturated fatty acids from full-length saturated fatty acid substrates. All desaturases require oxygen and ultimately consume NADH even though <b>desaturation</b> is an oxidative process. Desaturases are specific for the double bond they induce in the substrate. In Bacillus subtilis, the desaturase, Δ5-Des, is specific for inducing a cis-double bond at the Δ5 position. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains one desaturase, Ole1p, which induces the cis-double bond at Δ9.|$|E
25|$|Most {{bacteria}} that undergo anaerobic <b>desaturation</b> contain homologues of FabA and FabB. Clostridia {{are the main}} exception; they have a novel enzyme, yet to be identified, that catalyzes {{the formation of the}} cis double bond.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relationship}} of diurnal <b>desaturations</b> (oximetry-measured blood oxygen sat-uration [SpO 2] 30 % {{of the time}} with SpO 2 < 90 %. Patients engaged in their usual activities of daily living. We correlated these <b>desaturations</b> with the following variables, measured immediately before the 24 hours of oximetry: body mass index, dyspnea (measured with the mod-ified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale), gas exchange, pulmonary function, quality of life (measured with the Saint George’s respiratory questionnaire), and comorbidity (measured with the Charlson index). RESULTS: Thirty-three (38 %) of the patients were desaturators: 50 % nocturnal and 22 % diurnal. We also measured daytime arterial blood gas values from arterial blood samples {{and found that the}} desaturators had higher PaCO 2 (p 0. 001) and lower PaO 2 (p 0. 007) than the nondesaturators. There were no differences in the other variables. The correlation between noc-turnal and diurnal time with SpO 2 < 90 % was r 2 0. 67, and the concordance was low (Cohen’s kappa 0. 43, p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stable COPD and moderate hypoxemia have frequent and potentially important <b>desaturations</b> during activities of daily living and at night.

25|$|The {{conversion}} rate of omega-6 DGLA to AA largely determines {{the production of}} the prostaglandins PGE1 and PGE2. Omega-3 EPA prevents AA from being released from membranes, thereby skewing prostaglandin balance away from pro-inflammatory PGE2 (made from AA) toward anti-inflammatory PGE1 (made from DGLA). Moreover, the conversion (<b>desaturation)</b> of DGLA to AA is controlled by the enzyme delta-5-desaturase, which in turn is controlled by hormones such as insulin (up-regulation) and glucagon (down-regulation). The amount and type of carbohydrates consumed, along with some types of amino acid, can influence processes involving insulin, glucagon, and other hormones; therefore, the ratio of omega-3 versus omega-6 has wide effects on general health, and specific effects on immune function and inflammation, and mitosis (i.e., cell division).|$|E
25|$|Gas remains {{dissolved}} in the tissues until the partial pressure of that {{gas in the}} lungs is reduced sufficiently to cause a concentration gradient with the blood at a lower concentration than the relevant tissues. As the concentration in the blood drops below the concentration in the adjacent tissue, the gas will diffuse out of the tissue into the blood, and will then be transported back to the lungs where it will diffuse into the lung gas and then be eliminated by exhalation. If the ambient pressure reduction is limited, this <b>desaturation</b> {{will take place in}} the dissolved phase, but if the ambient pressure is lowered sufficiently, bubbles may form and grow, both in blood and other supersaturated tissues. When the partial pressure of all gas {{dissolved in}} a tissue exceeds the total ambient pressure on the tissue it is supersaturated, and there is a possibility of bubble formation.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Nocturnal {{breathing}} {{disorders in}} the form of periodic breathing (PB) are very common in heart failure (HF) patients. There is an increasing interest in simple and affordable tools to screen patients and monitor these disorders at home on a long-term basis. We aimed to assess the pathophysiological and clinical relevance of a simplified method for monitoring of PB suitable to be self-managed by the patient at home. METHODS AND RESULTS: A night-time respiratory recording was performed in 397 optimally treated HF patients (age 60 +/- 11 years, NYHA class 2. 4 +/- 0. 6, left ventricular ejection fraction 29 +/- 7 %) and the duration of PB (PB(Dur)) automatically computed. Patients were followed-up for 1 year and the prognostic value of PB(Dur) evaluated. In 45 patients, we assessed the association between PB(Dur) and severity of oxygen <b>desaturations</b> (number of <b>desaturations</b> > 3 %). Twenty six of the 397 patients died of cardiac causes. A PB(Dur) > or = 2 h was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiac death after adjustment for major clinical predictors [hazard ratio (95 % CI) : 3. 5 (1. 6 - 7. 9), P = 0. 002]. The correlation between PB(Dur) and severity of <b>desaturations</b> was 0. 94 (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Relevant pathophysiological and clinical information can be obtained from simplified monitoring of breathing disorders managed by the patient.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The fresh-water green alga Parietochloris incisa is {{the richest}} plant {{source of the}} {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acid (PUFA) arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6, AA). To elucidate the biosynthesis of AA in this alga we labeled cultures of P. incisa with radioactive precursors.

25|$|Gas remains {{dissolved}} in the tissues until the partial pressure of that {{gas in the}} lungs is reduced sufficiently to cause a concentration gradient with the blood at a lower concentration than the relevant tissues.

A similar situation occurs between the blood and each tissue. As the concentration in the blood drops below the concentration in the adjacent tissue, the gas will diffuse out of the tissue into the blood, and will then be transported back to the lungs where it will diffuse into the lung gas and then be eliminated by exhalation.

40|$|Aim—To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} low dose fentanyl infusion analgesia on behavioural and neuroendocrine stress response and short term outcome in premature infants ventilated for hyaline membrane disease.  METHODS—Twenty seven ventilated preterm infants {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a mean fentanyl infusion of 1. 1 (0. 08 SE) µg/kg/h for 75 (5) hours, and 28 untreated infants were considered a control group. A behavioural sedation score was used to assess the infants' behaviour. Urinary metanephrine and the normetanephrine:creatinine molar ratio were determined at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Outcome data and ventilatory indexes were recorded for each infant.  RESULTS—The fentanyl group showed significantly lower behavioural stress scores and O 2 <b>desaturations</b> than controls and lower urinary concentrations of metanephrine and normetanephrine at 24, 48, 72 hours.

40|$|Summary. This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} performing a robust association between the apneas and hypopneas recorded on a polysomnogram and the <b>desaturations</b> they cause.

2500|$|In mammals the aerobic <b>desaturation</b> is catalyzed by {{a complex}} of three membrane-bound enzymes (NADH-{{cytochrome}} b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, and a desaturase). These enzymes allow molecular oxygen, O2, {{to interact with the}} saturated fatty acyl-CoA chain, forming a double bond and two molecules of water, H2O. Two electrons come from NADH + H+ and two from the single bond in the fatty acid chain. These mammalian enzymes are, however, incapable of introducing double bonds at carbon atoms beyond C-9 in the fatty acid chain.(For the numbering of the carbon atoms in a fatty acid see Foot Note [...]) Hence mammals cannot synthesize linoleate or linolenate (which have double bonds at the C-12 (= Δ12), or the C-12 and C-15 (= Δ12 and Δ15) positions, respectively, {{as well as at the}} Δ9 position), nor the polyunsaturated, 20-carbon arachidonic acid that is derived from linoleate.

2500|$|The {{mainstream}} {{applications of}} 2H-SNIF-NMR {{have been in}} source attribution, forensics and biosynthetic pathway studies. (See also Gray's section [...] "Source attribution and Forensics") When measuring sugar compounds, a timesaving strategy is to convert them into ethanol through fermentation because 2H-SNIF NMR for ethanol is well established. Several studies have proved that hydrogen isotopes on the methyl and methylene position of the resulting ethanol is not affected by either fermentation rate or media. Another example {{is the study of}} monoterpenes. since the 1980s SNIF-NMR study of α-pinene has found large variations in D/H ratios among its sites. Particularly ex-C2 position has a strong depletion (~-750‰), which was in disagreement with accepted biosynthetic mechanism (mevalonate mechanism) at that time, and lead to new development in pathways. More recently, Ina Ehlers published their work on the D6S/D6R ratios of glucose molecules. The stereochemical diteterium distribution was found to correlate to photorespiration/photosynthesis ratios. Photorespiration/photosynthesis ratios are driven by CO2 fertilization, thus this might lead to new proxies in reconstructing paleo-CO2 concentration. Work has also been done for long-chain fatty acids and found that even-numbered sites, which are thought to be derived from C2 position of the acetyl group, are more enriched in deuterium than odd-numbered hydrogen that come from C1 position of the acetyl group.
