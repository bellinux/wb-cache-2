50|$|Two {{groups of}} {{invertebrates}} have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others) and modern cephalopods (octopuses, squid, cuttlefish) and other molluscs. The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend {{through the body}} of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large optic lobes behind each eye for visual processing. The brains of the modern cephalopods in particular are highly developed, comparable in complexity to the brains of some vertebrates (See also: Invertebrate brains). Emerging results suggest that a convergent evolutionary process has led to the selection of vertebrate-like neural organization and activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in these invertebrates. Cephalopods stand out by having a central nervous system that shares prime electrophysiological and neuroanatomical features with vertebrates like no other <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Removal of dams is {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} restore fragmented rivers and streams. The incentive is often to give migrating fish access to upstream spawning habitats, but dam removal may also bring other benefits, such as recovery of riparian vegetation and a more heterogeneous environment for aquatic invertebrates. Dam removal may also act as a disturbance on the system, releasing trapped sediments to downstream reaches. Depending {{on the amount of}} sediments in the former reservoir this disturbance may be transient or act over a longer time period. Whether dam removal is beneficial or not to the ecosystem may therefore depend on the type of organism. We have studied the effect of dam removal on riparian vegetation and benthic invertebrates in two Swedish streams over a period of 3 and 5 years respectively, and found that riparian vegetation generally benefitted from removal. Species richness increased, and species composition became more similar to a reference situation within a three year period. In contrast, benthic invertebrates seemed to be negatively affected by dam removal. While we saw no effects on community composition of benthic <b>invertebrates,</b> <b>taxon</b> richness decreased continuously over a five year period and total densities decreased initially but showed weak signs of recovery over the five year period. Our results also indicate that the response varies between invertebrate taxa...|$|R

The lakes spanned a range in (137) Cs contamination from 100 to 15500 kBq m(- 2) and estimated external dose rates ranged from 0. 13 to 30. 7 mu Gy h(- 1). General linear models {{were used to assess}} whether abundance of individuals, taxon richness, Berger-Parker dominance and Shannon-Wiener diversity varied across the lakes. Step-wise multiple regressions were used to relate variation in total abundance, taxon richness, Berger-Parker dominance, Shannon-Wiener diversity, taxon richness within major groups of macroinvertebrates and abundance of the more common individual taxa to the measured environmental characteristics (conductivity, pH, total hardness and phosphate; lake area, lake maximum depth and total external dose) of the lakes. No evidence was found in this study that the ecological status of lake communities has been influenced by radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl accident. Indeed, the most contaminated lake, Glubokoye, contained the highest richness of aquatic <b>invertebrates.</b> <b>Taxon</b> richness in the eight study lakes varied from 22 (Svyatskoe # 7) to 42 (Glubokoye) which spans a range typical for uncontaminated lakes in the region. Since (90) Sr is readily-absorbed by Mollusca, estimated dose rates to this group exceeded those for other invertebrate groups in two lakes (Perstok and Glubokoye). However this study found no association between mollusc diversity or abundance of individual snail species and variation between lakes in the external radiation dose. Indeed Glubokoye, the lake most contaminated by (90) Sr, had the highest richness of freshwater snails per sample (an average of 8. 9 taxa per sample). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Forty-one sites {{located on}} 14 New Caledonian streams were {{surveyed}} four times between October 1996 and October 1997 {{in order to}} examine the spatial and temporal changes {{in the structure of the}} benthic macroinvertebrate communities. About 250 000 invertebrates representing 167 taxa were collected in the streams. Seventy-five percent of identified taxa and 67 % of individuals were insects. Major spatial and temporal changes in the composition of the fauna were detected by multivariate analyses (ordination and classification). Overall, the number of individuals was significantly higher in the dry season (October) than in the wetter seasons (January and June). However, a low temporal variability was detected in the structure of benthic communities during the sampling period. A cluster analysis based on taxonomic composition separated five groups of sites in relation with rock type, land use, and geographic characteristics. Several metrics (total <b>invertebrate</b> density, <b>taxon</b> richness, relative abundance of major invertebrate groups, diversity indices) were used to characterize each group of sites. Forested streams, where the highest specific diversity occurred, represented the most speciose habitat for benthic fauna. A less rich and abundant fauna occurred in streams draining ultramafic rocks probably because of their low content in food resources and organic matter...|$|R

Specimens were collected by beating during a single summer/autumn sampling event from 30 O. bullata plants. The influence of the surrounding environment was also examined by assessing canopy connectivity between O. bullata shrubs and their nearest neighbours (O. bullata and other shrub species). Linear regression analyses suggested a positive association between <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness and shrub volume, a relationship that was also apparent at the Order level for Coleoptera, Diptera, and Psocoptera.

50|$|Despite this, {{the concept}} of <b>invertebrates</b> as a <b>taxon</b> of animals has persisted {{for over a century}} among the laity, and within the zoological {{community}} and in its literature it remains in use as a term of convenience for animals that are not members of the Vertebrata. The following text reflects earlier scientific understanding of the term and of those animals which have constituted it. According to this understanding, invertebrates do not possess a skeleton of bone, either internal or external. They include hugely varied body plans. Many have fluid-filled, hydrostatic skeletons, like jellyfish or worms. Others have hard exoskeletons, outer shells like those of insects and crustaceans. The most familiar invertebrates include the Protozoa, Porifera, Coelenterata, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Echinodermata, Mollusca and Arthropoda. Arthropoda include insects, crustaceans and arachnids.|$|R
40|$|Butterflies (Lepidoptera) have {{attracted}} more attention {{as indicators of}} terrestrial ecosystems than other <b>invertebrates.</b> This <b>taxon</b> is widely used as tools or subjects for biodiversity conservation planning in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The study determined butterfly species turnover at a-priori selected habitat patches in a protected area (Nduli Nature Reserve) and non-formally protected areas (outside Nduli Nature Reserve) of the KSD Local Municipality and their response to measured environmental variables. Using transect survey methods, 516 butterfly individuals belonging to 22 species were caught from 16 sampling units. Species dominance curves showed more butterfly species evenness outside reserve sites than inside. Hierarchical clustering using Bray-Curtis similarity matrices and Correspondence analysis (CA) grouped sampling units according to butterfly species sampled. Site habitat patches outside the reserve were richer in butterfly and overall abundance than inside the reserve. The Canonical Correspondence analysis (CCA) results revealed that certain site variables such as percentage herb cover, area of patch size, average grass height, grazing intensity, distance to the city centre and average flower density accounted for species distribution patterns at various sampling units. The conservation implications of the study suggest that patch level management of micro-habitats with sufficient flowering herbs, structural vegetation, and patch size with minimal disturbance within and outside reserve areas can encourage rare and common butterfly species richness and diversity...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a surface-associated activity trap (SAT) for sampling aquatic invertebrates in wetlands. We compared performance of this trap {{with that of}} a conventional activity trap (AT) based on nondetection rates and relative abundance estimates for 13 taxa of common wetland <b>invertebrates</b> and for <b>taxon</b> richness using data from experiments in constructed wetlands. Taxon-specific non-detection rates for ATs generally exceeded those of SATs, and largest improvements using SATs were for Chironomidae and Gastropoda. SATs were efficient at capturing cladocera, Chironomidae, Gastropoda, total Crustacea, and multiple taxa (taxon richness) but were only slightly better than ATs at capturing Dytiscidae. Temporal differences in capture rates were observed only for cladocera, Chironomidae, Dytiscidae, and total Crustacea, with capture efficiencies of SATs usually decreasing from mid-June through mid-July for these taxa. We believe that SATs may be useful for characterizing wetland invertebrate communities and for developing improved measures of prey available to foraging waterfowl and other aquatic birds...|$|R

We stratify the risk of bias into low, medium, and high for the decisions and processes undertaken by forensic entomologists, and propose that knowledge of the time the deceased was last seen alive is the most potentially biasing piece of information for forensic entomologists.

40|$|By definition, a macro{{invertebrate}} is any invertebrate that {{is large}} enough to be retained on a 500 -ÃÂµm mesh sieve. Although macroinvertebrates (hereafter invertebrates) are important in food webs and sensitive to environmental conditions, they are often omitted from wetland condition monitoring programs because use of this fine-mesh sieve makes sample collection and processing time consuming and expensive. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify a more cost-effective approach for obtaining invertebrate-based data that can be used to evaluate wetland condition. In 2014 and 2015, invertebrates and associated particulate matter (PM; living and dead plants, sediment) were collected from 27 wetlands in the Iowa Prairie Pothole Region using a stovepipe sampler. Sample material retained on a 500 -ÃÂµm mesh sieve was preserved. In the laboratory, samples were washed through a series of sieves that separated invertebrates and particulate matter into four size fractions. The 6 -mm fraction included material retained on the 6 -mm sieve, the 4 -mm fraction included material retained on both 4 - and 6 -mm sieves, the 2 -mm size fraction included material retained on 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -mm sieves, and the 500 -ÃÂµm fraction was the sum total of material retained on 2 -, 4 -, 6 -, and 500 -ÃÂµm sieves (i. e., the entire sample). Volume of each sample size fraction and time required to separate invertebrates from PM were recorded. Invertebrates were identified to family (mollusks, insects, isopods), order (amphipods, decapods), or class (annelids), and numbers of individuals were recorded. Subsequently, invertebrates were again washed through the sieve column in the absence of PM, and organisms in each size fraction were identified and counted. Values for invertebrate numerical density and taxon richness variables were quantified for each of the four invertebrate size fractions and when PM was present (+ PM) and absent (- PM). Invertebrate assemblage variables were related to environmental variables indicative of wetland condition (e. g., turbidity, chloride concentration, fish biomass, tiger salamander abundance, plant cover). Relationship strengths were affected by sieve mesh size, invertebrate variable measured, and presence or absence of PM in samples. Across the entire gradient of sieve mesh sizes and PM abundance, <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness variables were more consistently and strongly related to environmental variables than invertebrate density variables. Regardless of sieve mesh size and PM presence, <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness exclusive of four taxa recorded in every wetland (planorbid snails, oligochaetes, leeches, chironomid midges; TTR-PEOC) was positively correlated with plant cover and negatively correlated with turbidity and fish biomass. Use of a 2 -mm, 4 -mm, or 6 -mm mesh sieve reduced sample volume by 19 - 35 % and time required to separate invertebrates from PM by 36 - 54 %, relative to use of a 500 -ÃÂµm mesh sieve. Results presented here indicate that use of an <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness metric in which ubiquitous taxa are eliminated from analysis, and using a sieve mesh size of 6 mm, will generate cost savings in wetland monitoring while still producing data that accurately reflect wetland condition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Despite {{the global}} {{importance}} of New Zealand’s invertebrates, relatively {{little is known}} about them and their relationships with plants and plant communities in native habitats. Invertebrate diversity was examined by beating randomly chosen shrubs of the species Olearia bullata (Asteraceae) and Coprosma propinqua (Rubiaceae). <b>Invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness was assessed initially using morphospecies, which were identified subsequently by expert taxonomists. Though the taxon richness of invertebrates recorded from O. bullata was not significantly higher than that on C. propinqua (except for the orders Diptera and Hemiptera), there was a clear indication that O. bullata hosts a higher diversity of invertebrates. Mean number of taxa per shrub for O. bullata was higher in all cases (except Coleoptera), and so was the maximum number of taxa per shrub. Overall, O. bullata yielded 115 invertebrate taxa compared with 93 for C. propinqua. Moreover, 50 invertebrate taxa were restricted to O. bullata compared with 28 for C. propinqua. Since at least ten species of Olearia are threatened or uncommon, this could be cause for concern with respect to the maintenance of invertebrate diversity. Therefore, sites where Olearia species are still present are likely to be of significance for invertebrate conservation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{leaves and}} wood from {{vegetation}} surrounding headwater streams constitute a major food source for aquatic invertebrates, providing they are retained upon the streambed and not transported downstream. This {{study investigated the}} response of aquatic invertebrates to artificially increased detritus retention, {{in an effort to}} reproduce the naturally occurring build up of dead organic matter associated with streams in old-growth forest. The background detrital standing stock in streams in Kielder Forest (Northumberland, UK) was low, approximately 32 gm - 2. Two streams flowing through dense conifer plantation and one in open broadleaved woodland were manipulated by the addition of logs over a 10 m stream reach. After several months, log addition significantly enhanced detrital standing stocks in both conifer and broadleaved streams. Total <b>invertebrate</b> abundance, <b>taxon</b> richness and the numbers of certain numerically dominant families were significantly higher in experimental than reference reaches in both conifer and broadleaved streams. This response was most marked for detritivores, whilst non-detritivore groups often showed no response to the manipulation. Whilst in the short term the responses to enhanced retention may reflect a redistribution of the local fauna, it is argued that over a longer time-scale, a genuine increase in invertebrate density and diversity could occur. Allowing old-growth forest to develop in planted valley bottoms may be a viable management option for conservation. If established alongside streams, it would ensure continuous input of woody material and the fauna may benefit from the resulting increase in detritus retention.

40|$|Dynamics of {{flooding}} and drying resulting in fragmentation of lotic habitats are a yearly phenomenon in subtropical floodplain rivers but their ecological significance {{is not known}} for invertebrate communities. We studied the response of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities in 48 dry-season river pools in the Save-Runde river system (Lowveld, Zimbabwe). Patterns and ecological processes influencing <b>invertebrate</b> communities, <b>taxon</b> richness and macroinvertebrate functional richness were investigated with focus {{on the role of}} regional (connectivity) and local processes (habitat characteristics). Local factors accounted for 15 % of the variability in the zooplankton community but only 3. 4 % for the macroinvertebrate community. Important factors affecting zooplankton densities in the pools were depth, vegetation cover and presence of fish (planktivorous and omnivorous). The presence of fish in pools can infer predation risk. Macroinvertebrate abundances were affected by the presence of fish only. Zooplankton densities increased in pools with fish while macroinvertebrate densities declined in the presence of fish. Macroinvertebrates could exert top-down pressure on zooplankton either by competition for resources or predation in pools. Regional factors significantly explained zooplankton but not macroinvertebrate community variability. Connectivity had no significant effect on local pool habitat characteristics. There {{were no significant differences in}} water quality variables between flowing river sites and the pools. Zooplankton and macroinvertebrate alpha- and gamma-diversity in dry-season pools was higher than in the flowing river. Species additions rather than species replacements by processes that include dispersal and possibly dormancy may explain increased zooplankton and macroinvertebrate taxon diversity in pools. Functional feeding group (FFG) analysis showed that the proportion of macroinvertebrate predator taxa increased significantly in pools compared to the flowing river. Pools create a more suitable and diverse habitat for these widely dispersing taxa. The other FFG were comparable between the river and pools. The pools are strongly heterotrophic.

40|$|Global transformations {{extend beyond}} local habitats; therefore, larger-scale {{approaches}} {{are needed to}} assess community-level responses and resilience to unfolding environmental changes. Using long-term data (1996 - 2011), we evaluated spatial patterns and functional redundancies in the littoral invertebrate communities of 85 Swedish lakes, {{with the objective of}} assessing their potential resilience to environmental change at regional scales (that is, spatial resilience). Multivariate spatial modeling was used to differentiate groups of invertebrate species exhibiting spatial patterns in composition and abundance (that is, deterministic species) from those lacking spatial patterns (that is, stochastic species). We then determined the functional feeding attributes of the deterministic and stochastic invertebrate species, to infer resilience. Between one and three distinct spatial patterns in invertebrate composition and abundance were identified in approximately one-third of the species; the remainder were stochastic. We observed substantial differences in metrics between deterministic and stochastic species. Functional richness and diversity decreased over time in the deterministic group, suggesting a loss of resilience in regional <b>invertebrate</b> communities. However, <b>taxon</b> richness and redundancy increased monotonically in the stochastic group, indicating the capacity of regional invertebrate communities to adapt to change. Our results suggest that a refined picture of spatial resilience emerges if patterns of both the deterministic and stochastic species are accounted for. Spatially extensive monitoring may help increase our mechanistic understanding of community-level responses and resilience to regional environmental change, insights that are critical for developing management and conservation agendas in this current period of rapid environmental transformation...|$|R

This is particularly evident in the case of soft tissue studies that are technically demanding, time-consuming, and often prone to produce artefacts. These problems can partly be overcome by employing non-invasive, destruction-free imaging techniques, in particular micro-computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Results Here, we employed high-field magnetic resonance imaging techniques to gather numerous data from members of a major marine <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon,</b> the sea urchins (Echinoidea). For this model study, 13 of the 14 currently recognized high-ranking subtaxa (orders) of this group of animals were analyzed. Based on the acquired datasets, interactive three-dimensional models were assembled. Our analyses reveal that selected soft tissue characters can even be used for phylogenetic inferences in sea urchins, as exemplified by differences in {{the size and shape of}} the gastric caecum found in the Irregularia. Conclusion The main focus of our investigation was to explore the possibility to systematically visualize the internal anatomy of echinoids obtained from various museum collections.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on Banks Peninsula of several invertebrate species shows that populations {{in different parts}} of the peninsula are genetically distinct from one another. This suggests vicariance, a continued evolutionary divergence, may be the driving process and offers a model system to test ideas regarding the origins of new species and their phylogeography. In this research, <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> composition was used to investigate a differentiation of multiple co-distributed ground-dwelling invertebrates between east and west locations on Banks Peninsula. Genetic analysis was also used to investigate invertebrate biodiversity, with particular interest in answering questions regarding an east-west phylogeographic split among taxa (interspecific) and within tax (intraspecific) on Banks Peninsula. Results showed that a phylogeographic split across the east-west split was observed at both among- and within-species levels. More detailed intraspecific analyses of two spider species, N. janus and P. antipodiana, revealed highly divergent, genealogically exclusive clusters between east and west regions suggestive of cryptic species complexes. The findings of this research ultimately provide better understanding and crucial insight into the origins, maintenance and changes of invertebrate biodiversity on Banks Peninsula.

In this context, a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene has been proposed as standard DNA barcoding marker for the {{identification of}} organisms. Limitations of the COI barcoding approach can arise from its single-locus identification system, the effect of introgression events, incomplete lineage sorting, numts, heteroplasmy and maternal inheritance of intracellular endosymbionts.

40|$|The eastern Australian rainforests have {{experienced}} several cycles of range contraction and expansion {{since the late}} Miocene that are closely correlated with global glaciation events. Together with ongoing aridification of the continent, this has resulted in current distributions of native closed forest that are highly fragmented along the east coast. Several closed forest endemic taxa exhibit patterns of population genetic structure that are congruent with historical isolation of populations in discrete refugia and reflect evolutionary histories dramatically affected by vicariance. Currently, limited data are available regarding {{the impact of these}} past climatic fluctuations on freshwater invertebrate taxa. The non-biting midge species Echinocladius martini Cranston is distributed along the east coast and inhabits predominantly montane streams in closed forest habitat. Phylogeographic structure in E. martini was resolved here at a continental scale by incorporating data from a previous pilot study and expanding the sampling design to encompass populations in the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Queensland, south-east Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Patterns of phylogeographic structure revealed several deeply divergent mitochondrial lineages from central and south-eastern Australia that were previously unrecognised and were geographically endemic to closed forest refugia. Estimated divergence times were congruent with late Miocene onset of rainforest contractions across the east coast of Australia. This suggested that dispersal and gene flow among E. martini populations isolated in refugia has been highly restricted historically.

Ecological features and consortium relations of flycatchers and their specific feeding behavior were analyzed. Materials were collected in May – July 2009 – 2014 on the transformed territories of North-Eastern Ukraine. Functioning of trophic structure of biogeocenosis with the participation of flycatcher as a heterotrophic core of big autotrophic group was studied. Spatial and trophic relations of flycatcher with the woody vegetation and insect-phytophages (leaf beetles, leafhoppers, and barbels) have been described. In the feed ration of flycatcher nestlings the prevalence is given to representatives of Hexapoda (83 %), including Lepidoptera (16  families, 24 %), Hymenoptera (12 families, 23 %) and Coleoptera (40 families, 15 %). We characterize trophic groups of arthropods in the consortium of flycatchers: phytophages (33 %), zoophages (45 %), parasites, bloodsuckers, saprophages (16 %), necrophages (4 %), coprophages, keratophages. Fauna of arthropods of collared flycatcher nests was analyzed.

Further, recruitment of invertebrates from relic egg banks in the sediments and dispersal of eggs into wetlands {{is believed to be}} important for reestablishment of invertebrates in recently restored wetlands. Although tens-of thousands of wetlands have been restored in the prairie pothole region of the United States, studies have not been conducted to evaluate the recovery of invertebrate egg banks in restored wetlands. We used taxon richness and abundance as indicators of potential egg bank recovery and compared these parameters in restored wetlands to those of non-drained and drained wetlands with a history of cultivation and also to reference wetlands with no history of cultivation. We found few significant differences among wetland categories within three physiographic regions (Glaciated Plains, Missouri Coteau, and Prairie Coteau). Most statistical comparisons indicated that restored wetlands had invertebrate egg banks similar to reference, nondrained, and drained wetlands. The one exception was drained seasonal wetlands in the Glaciated Plains, which had significantly lower <b>taxon</b> richness and <b>invertebrate</b> abundance than the other wetland categories. Trends did suggest that <b>invertebrate</b> egg bank <b>taxon</b> richness and abundance are increasing in restored seasonal wetlands relative to their drained analogues, whereas a similar trend was not observed for restored semi-permanent wetlands. Although recovery was not related to years since restoration, comparisons of restored wetlands with reference wetlands suggest that recovery potential may be inversely related to the extent of wetland drainage and intensive agriculture that varies spatially in the prairie pothole region. Our research suggests that periodic drawdowns of semi-permanent restored wetlands may be needed to promote production and development of invertebrate egg banks. Inoculation of restored wetlands may also be needed in areas where extensive wetland drainage has resulted in fewer wetland habitats to provide sources of passively dispersed eggs to newly restored wetlands...|$|R

Here we investigate that assumption by documenting biogeographical patterns in an important <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon,</b> the parasitoid wasp family Ichneumonidae, in a recently reforested Hawaiian landscape. Specifically, we test the influence of (1) planting configurations (corridors versus patches), (2) vegetation age, (3) distance from mature native forest, (4) surrounding tree cover, and (5) plant community composition on ichneumonid richness, abundance, and composition. We sampled over 7, 000 wasps, 96. 5 % of which were not native to Hawai'i. We found greater relative richness and abundance of ichneumonids, and substantially different communities, in restored areas compared to mature forest and abandoned pasturelands. Non-native ichneumonids drive these differences; restored areas and native forest did not differ in native ichneumonid abundance. Among restored areas, ichneumonid communities did not differ by planting age or configuration. As tree cover increased within 120 m of a sampling point, ichneumonid community composition increasingly resembled that found in native forest. Similarly, native ichneumonid abundance increased with proximity to native forest. Our results suggest that restoration plantings, if situated near target forest ecosystems and in areas with higher local tree cover, can facilitate restoration of native fauna even in a highly invaded system...|$|E

Fish communities were associated significantly with lake morphological characteristics, but were ksncorrelated with water chemistry.

Limitations of the COI barcoding approach can arise from its single-locus identification system, the effect of introgression events, incomplete lineage sorting, numts, heteroplasmy and maternal inheritance of intracellular endosymbionts. Consequently, the analysis of a supplementary nuclear marker system could be advantageous. Results We tested the effectiveness of the COI barcoding region and of three nuclear ribosomal expansion segments in discriminating ground beetles of Central Europe, a diverse and well-studied <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon.</b> As nuclear markers we determined the 18 S rDNA: V 4, 18 S rDNA: V 7 and 28 S rDNA: D 3 expansion segments for 344 specimens of 75 species. Seventy-three species (97 %) of the analysed species could be accurately identified using COI, while the combined approach of all three nuclear markers provided resolution among 71 (95 %) of the studied Carabidae. Conclusion Our results confirm that the analysed nuclear ribosomal expansion segments in combination constitute a valuable and efficient supplement for classical DNA barcoding to avoid potential pitfalls when only mitochondrial data are being used. We also demonstrate the high potential of COI barcodes for the identification of even closely related carabid species. </p...|$|E

Introduction [...] The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) [...] Notopala sublineata [...] Survey of invertebrate fauna associated with artificial structures and river {{systems of the}} MDB [...] Invertebrate conservation [...] Recovery planning {{for the conservation of}} Notopala sublineata sublineata and Notopala sublineata hanleyi [...] General discussion. The introduction of flow regulation to the river systems of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in southeastern Australia has caused significant alterations to the native aquatic invertebrate communities. There has been an almost complete disappearance of the freshwater molluscan diversity, particularly the viviparid snail Notopala sublineata. The subspecies Notopala sublineata sublineata is assumed to be extinct in the wild and Notopala sublineata hanleyi is surviving solely in an irrigation pipeline off the lower Murray River in South Australia. This thesis examines the macroinvertebrate communities of the littoral zone from river sections along the Murray, the Murrumbidgee, the Namoi, the Upper Barwon-Darling and the Lower Darling rivers. The goal of these surveys was to detail the macroinvertebrate assemblages, specifically the molluscan diversity, surviving within the rivers and irrigation structures and ultimately to determine the current distribution and conservation status of Notopala sublineata sublineata and Notopala sublineata hanleyi. The macroinvertebrates collected during these surveys indicate a shift in the aquatic <b>invertebrate</b> community from <b>taxon</b> found in lotic systems to invertebrates that show a preference to lentic systems. The results also support reports {{that there has been a}} severe decline in the molluscan diversity, with a total of only eight species collected, of which only three species occurred within the river channels. The results also indicate a complete loss of both Notopala sublineata subspecies from the rivers of the MDB, increasing the possibility that Notopala sublineata sublineata is extinct. A living population of Notopala sublineata hanleyi was discovered, however, in the Western Murray Irrigation pipeline off the Murray River in NSW. This surviving population now provides an opportunity for breeding and rehabilitation projects in NSW. Although individual attention needs to be paid towards Notopala sublineata the listing of Endangered Ecological Communities and the establishment of subsequent recovery programs for those communities is the best option for the conservation of the aquatic macroinvertebrates of the MDB.

40|$|Butterflies {{for the new}} millennium: mapping {{butterfly}} distributions in Britain (Lepidoptera) Butterflies for the New Millennium is {{the largest}} and most comprehensive survey of butterfly distribution ever undertaken in Britain and Ireland. The number of contributing recorders, the coverage achieved and the number and quality of distribution records generated far exceed those available for any other <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon.</b> The data thus provide a unique insight into the effects of habitat degradation and climate change on a high profile insect group. The results of {{the first five years of}} the survey (1995 - 1999) have been analysed to assess broad-scale distribution changes over the past two decades and the past two centuries. In both time periods, the British distributions of most butterfly species have shown substantial change. The trends affecting habitat specialist and habitat generalist (wider countryside) species differ significantly. The distributions of half of the habitat generalists have increased (consistent with an expected positive response to observed climate change), whereas most habitat specialists declined (consistent with habitat degradation). The opposing forces of climate change and habitat degradation are thought to be the main driving forces. The decline of specialist species indicates a reduction in overall biodiversity, whilst mobile and widespread generalists increasingly dominate biological communities. These patterns of change are thought to be representative of many other invertebrate groups in Britain and demonstrate the use of butterflies as indicators of environmental change...|$|E
40|$|Gap Analysis takes a {{proactive}} landscape-level approach to conserving native species by identifying nodes of high biological diversity. It uses vertebrate species richness as {{an index of}} overall biological diversity. However, it remains unknownwhether or not the spatial distribution of vertebrate diversity correspondswith the diversity of other taxa. We tested whether landscape-level diversity patterns corresponded between a vertebrate and an <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon,</b> mammals and ants, across the southern half of the Florida peninsula, USA. Composite digital maps with a 30 -m spatial resolution were produced for each taxon. Spatial correspondence between the taxa was determined by normalizing and then subtracting the composite maps. There were large areas of spatial correspondence – indicating that richness between mammals and ants was similar over much of southern Florida. However, spatial correspondence occurred where the richness of both taxa was low or moderate, and areas with the highest species richness (highest 20 %) for each taxon, the explicit focus of Gap Analyses, corresponded over only 8752 ha. Gap Analysis provides a much needed assessment of landscape-level diversity patterns and proactive reserve design, {{but it must be}} explicit that the results are applicable for vertebrate diversity, which does not necessarily correspond with diversity patterns of other taxa. The two taxa investigated differ by orders of magnitude in the scale that they perceive their environment, and it is likely that diversity hotspots vary as the scale of investigation – and the taxa mapped – vary...|$|E
40|$|Droughts are {{unpredictable}} disturbances characterized {{in streams}} by declining flow, reduced habitat availability, and deteriorating abiotic conditions. Such events typically reduce benthic <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness and modify assemblage composition, but {{little is known}} about how hyporheic invertebrate assemblages respond to drought or how these responses relate to changes in benthic assemblages. We hypothesized that taxon richness (diversity) and variability (as within-site diversity) in benthic assemblage composition would decline as drought proceeded, whereas concurrent changes in hyporheic assemblages would be lower in this more stable environment. We predicted that benthic assemblage composition between sites would converge as epigean taxa were selectively eliminated, whereas between-site hyporheic diversity would change little. We sampled benthic and hyporheic invertebrates concurrently from 4 sites along a groundwater-fed stream during the final stages of a severe supraseasonal drought punctuated by a record heat wave. Abiotic conditions in benthic habitats deteriorated as flow declined, but changes were less pronounced in the hyporheic zone. Benthic diversity declined during drought, whereas hyporheic diversity changed little. However, benthic within-site diversity increased as the drought progressed because of localized variation in the abundance of common taxa. Temporal trends in hyporheic diversity were less consistent. Benthic assemblages at individual sites became more similar, especially during the heat wave, reflecting low diversity and abundance. Hyporheic assemblages changed markedly because of temporary increases in abundances of epigean and hypogean amphipods. These contrasting responses of benthic and hyporheic assemblages to drought should be recognized when developing management strategies for drought-impacted streams...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Because of their functions in substrate stabilization, nutrient uptake, and wildlife habitat, submerged aquatic macrophytes are essential for successful wetland restoration and creation. However, techniques for establishment of submergents have been slow to develop. Southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis (Spreng.) Magnus), coontail (Ceratophyllwn demerswn L.), and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) were planted and compared to borrowed-wetland soil during 1992 and 1993 growing seasons at three water depths (20, 50, and 80 cm) within an experimental wetland on Texas Utilities' Big Brown Mine in eastern Texas. Percent cover was determined during both seasons, and above-ground biomass (AGB) and associated macroinvertebrates were sampled at all water depths in 1993. The borrowed-soil treatment generally had significantly (P< 0. 05) higher total submergent AGB, percent cover, species richness, and <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness than single-species treatments. Locally collected southern naiad and coontail produced greater percent cover than nursery stock. Success in submergent establishment and macroinvertebrate abundance generally increased with water depth, while emergent macrophytes established from borrowed soil were most successful at 20 cm. Results indicated borrowed soil may be utilized alone, or in conjunction with plantings of locally abundant species to successfully establish submergent macrophytes and associated invertebrates in wetland reclamation efforts...|$|E
40|$|In {{many species}} of group-living invertebrates, in {{particular}} arthropods, collective decisions can emerge from the combined actions of individuals and the direct or indirect interactions between individuals. These decisions allow groups of individuals to respond quickly and accurately to changes that occur in their environment. Examples of such decisions are found {{in a variety of}} invertebrate taxa and in many different contexts, e. g. exploring a new territory, foraging for food, finding a suitable location where to aggregate or to establish a nest, defending oneself against predators, etc. In this paper we will review the collective decisions that have been documented in different invertebrate taxa where individuals are known to live temporarily or permanently in social or gregarious groups. We first present some simple examples of collective decisions involving the choice between two alternatives. We then define the fundamental rules required for these collective decisions to emerge throughout the <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon,</b> from simple organisms such as caterpillars, to animals endowed with highly developed perceptive and cognitive capacities such as ants and bees. The presentation of these rules gives us the opportunity to illustrate one of the pitfalls of the study of collective choice in animals by showing through computer simulations how a choice between two alternatives can be misinterpreted {{as the result of the}} action of self-organized mechanisms. In the second part, we discuss the peculiarities of collective decisions in invertebrates, their properties and characteristics. We conclude by discussing the issue of individual complexity in collective decision-making process...|$|E
30|$|Observational data, by definition, are {{collected}} without a random sampling mechanism {{with respect to}} the effect of the variable of interest. When observational data are used without properly addressing potential problems induced by the non-random nature of the data collection process (e.g., imbalance of factors other than the variable of interest, i.e., confounding factors), results can be biased (Qian and Harmel 2016). However, rare studies in the ecological literature have addressed this problem of confounding factors, which can lead to divergent results of the same problem. For example, Clenaghan et al. (1998) reported a positive association between nutrients and benthic macroinvertebrates in one catchment in Ireland; Heino et al. (2003) reported the same positive association in a river in Finland; Bergfur et al. (2007) found a negative correlation in streams of central Sweden; Wang et al. (2007) demonstrated a negative association in some wadeable streams in Wisconsin; and Harding et al. (1999) and Niyogi et al. (2007) showed no clear link between macroinvertebrates and nutrient concentrations in one river and in a suite of 21 streams of southern New Zealand, respectively. These divergent results are expected, as these studies focused on local streams and each stream may have different confounding factors (e.g., watershed land use patterns, habitat quality, and flow conditions). Because nutrient criteria are usually developed for a large geographic region and not for individual streams or at a local level, understanding the regional (average) effects of nutrient enrichment is necessary. In this study, we aim to evaluate the regional average effects of nutrients on stream <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness in the Western United States and its individual ecoregions from observational data.|$|E
40|$|International audienceLong-term {{data are}} needed to assess spatial and {{temporal}} variability of communities and their resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, particularly in climatic regions marked by high interannual variability (e. g. mediterranean- climate). A long-term study at four sites on two streams in mediterranean-climate California (annual sampling over 20 yr) allowed us to quantify {{the influence of a}} 5 -yr prolonged drought on stream invertebrate and fish communities. Invertebrate community composition did not show recovery following drought. The primary environmental factors influencing community composition, identified through principle components and multiple correspondence analyses were precipitation and flow permanence. <b>Invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> richness and abundance exhibited few responses (some site specific) and recovered quickly. Native fish abundance was lowest during the drought period and highest during the wet years that occurred {{at the end of the}} study period. Importantly, the prolonged drought facilitated the establishment and success of the invasive green sunfish (Centrarchidae: Lepomis cyanellus) that was then resilient to subsequent large flow events. There was high spatial synchrony in the temporal changes among all four sites, and three distinct periods were identified: early drought, late drought, and post-drought years. However, we still found differences among sites along the flow permanence gradient from temporary to perennial in the response to drought of both invertebrate and fish assemblages likely as a result of changes in substrate, vegetation, and other habitat characteristics. The observed lack of resilience and negative impacts to biodiversity due to prolonged drought associated with long-term habitat changes is important because hydroclimatic extremes are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude with global climate change...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive imaging technique that today constitutes {{one of the}} main pillars of preclinical and clinical imaging. MRI’s capacity to depict soft tissue in whole specimens ex vivo as well as in vivo, achievable voxel resolutions well below (100 μm) 3, and the absence of ionizing radiation have resulted in the broad application of this technique both in human diagnostics and studies involving small animal model organisms. Unfortunately, MRI systems are expensive devices and have so far only sporadically been used to resolve questions in zoology and in particular in zoomorphology. However, the results from two recent studies involving systematic scanning of representative species from a vertebrate group (fishes) as well as an <b>invertebrate</b> <b>taxon</b> (sea urchins) suggest that MRI could in fact be used more widely in zoology. Using novel image data derived from representative species of numerous higher metazoan clades in combination with a comprehensive literature survey, we review and evaluate the potential of MRI for systematic taxon scanning. According to our results, numerous animal groups are suitable for systematic MRI scanning, among them various cnidarian and arthropod taxa, brachiopods, various molluscan taxa, echinoderms, as well as all vertebrate clades. However, various phyla in their entirety cannot be considered suitable for this approach mainly due to their small size (e. g., Kinorhyncha) or their unfavorable shape (e. g., Nematomorpha), while other taxa are prone to produce artifacts associated either with their biology (e. g., Echiura) or their anatomy (e. g., Polyplacophora). In order to initiate further uses of MRI in zoology, we outline the principles underlying various applications of this technique {{such as the use of}} contrast agents, in vivo MRI, functional MRI, as well as magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we discuss how future technical developments might shape the use of MRI for the study of zoological specimens...|$|E
