40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster shavenbaby (svb) -ovo gene {{region is}} a complex locus, {{containing}} two distinct but comutable <b>genetic</b> <b>functions.</b> ovo is required for survival and differentiation of female germ line cells and {{plays a role in}} germ line sex determination. In contrast, svb is required in both male and female embryos for the production of epidermal locomotor and sensory structures. Sequences required for the two <b>genetic</b> <b>functions</b> are partially overlapping. ovo corresponds to a previously described germ line-dependent 5. 0 -kb poly(A) + mRNA that first appears in the germarium and accumulates in nurse cells during oogenesis. The 5. 0 -kb mRNA is stored in the egg, but it is rapidly lost in the embryos except for its continued presence in the germ line precursor pole cells. The ovo mRNA predicts a 1, 028 -amino-acid 110. 6 -kDa protein homologous with transcription factors. We have identified an embryonic mRNA, 7. 1 kb in length, that contains exons partially overlapping those of the 5. 0 -kb poly(A) + mRNA. The spatial distribution of this newly discovered transcript during midembryogenesis suggests that it corresponds to the svb function. The arrangement of exons common to the 5. 0 - and 7. 1 -kb mRNAs suggests that the Ovo and Svb proteins share DNA-binding specificity conferred by four Cys 2 -His 2 zinc finger motifs but differ functionally in their capacity to interact with other components of the transcription machinery.

50|$|The {{most common}} genetic {{mutation}} (found in 80-90% of epithelioid sarcomas) is the inactivation of the SMARCB1 gene, or {{the loss of}} INI-1 function, which {{is thought to be}} a major contributor to disease progression. Epithelioid sarcoma typically contains chromosome 22q11.2 mutations or deletions and 8q gains, particularly i(8) (>q10). Aberrations of 18q and 8q, as well as recurrent gains at 11q13, have also been observed. The SMARCB1 gene (also termed BAF47, INI1, or hSNF5) is located on chromosome 22q11.2 and codes for a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Loss of SMARCB1 function is the most common genetic mutation observed in epithelioid sarcoma, and this dysfunction is likely a major driver of disease progression. SMARCB1 is a core protein subunit of the 15 subunit SWI/SNF (or BAF) complex involved in regulating the nucleosome architecture of our genome and {{has been shown to be}} a potent tumor suppressor gene, meaning that its primary role is to control cell division and to even halt division under appropriate circumstances (i.e. signals to over-replicate). As this tumor suppressor is commonly inactivated in epithelioid sarcoma, cell division can fail to appropriately halt, resulting in unregulated cellular growth and the formation of cancer tumors. Several research teams are currently developing techniques to reverse this loss of <b>genetic</b> <b>function</b> characteristic of epithelioid sarcoma.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} {{to some of}} the criticisms, other scientists argued that the wide spread transcription and splicing that is observed in the human genome directly by biochemical testing is a more accurate indicator of <b>genetic</b> <b>function</b> than genomic conservation estimates because conservation estimates are all relative and difficult to align due to incredible variations in genome sizes of even closely related species, it is partially tautological, and these estimates are not based on direct testing for functionality on the genome. Conservation estimates may be used to provide clues to identify possible functional elements in the genome, but it does not limit or cap the total amount of functional elements that could possibly exist in the genome. Furthermore, much of the genome that is being disputed by critics seems to be involved in epigenetic regulation such as gene expression and appears to be necessary for the development of complex organisms. The ENCODE results were not necessarily unexpected since increases in attributions of functionality were foreshadowed by previous decades of research. Additionally, others have noted that the ENCODE project from the very beginning had a scope that was based on seeking biomedically relevant functional elements in the genome not evolutionary functional elements, which are not necessarily the same thing since evolutionary selection is neither sufficient nor necessary to establish a function. It is a very useful proxy to relevant functions, but an imperfect one and not the only one.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMetamorphosis in {{holometabolous}} insects is an ecdysone-dependent {{process by}} which the larval form is replaced by a reproductive, adult form. At the onset of metamorphosis ecdysone induces a set of early genes which coordinate tissue-specific responses to hormone. TheBroad-Complex(BR-C) early gene, which acts as a global regulator of tissue-specific responses to ecdysone, encodes a family of zinc-finger DNA binding proteins known as Z 1, Z 2, Z 3, and Z 4. Genetically theBR-Cencodes three complementing functions,br, rbp,and 2 Bc,and a class ofnpr 1 alleles that fail to complement any of the other <b>genetic</b> <b>functions.</b> The effects ofBR-Cmutations on metamorphic development are highly pleiotropic, yet {{little is known about the}} roles of individualBR-Cproteins in directing the required responses to ecdysone. Because theBR-Cis a vital regulator of metamorphosis it is essential to establish the relationships betweenBR-Cgenetic functions and protein products. We present here the first general and definitive study of these relationships. Using heat-inducible transgenes we have rescued lethality associated with each of the complementing <b>genetic</b> <b>functions</b> and have restored transcriptional activity of tissue-specificBR-C+-dependent target genes. Our data lead us to conclude thatbr+function is only provided by the Z 2 isoform. We find that Z 1 transgenes provide fullrbp+function, while Z 4 provides partial function. Likewise, while Z 3 provides full 2 Bc+function, Z 2 also provides partial function. These results indicate possible functional redundancy or regulatory dependence (via autoregulation) associated with therbp+and 2 Bc+functions. The establishment of these relationships betweenBR-Cgenetic functions and protein isoforms is an important step toward understanding the roles ofBR-Cproteins in directing metamorphic responses to ecdysone...|$|R

40|$|The {{steroid hormone}} {{ecdysone}} causes {{dramatic changes in}} the genetic programs leading to the pupariation of Drosophila melanogaster, and the Broad-Complex (BR-C) gene is known to {{play a key role in}} this process. Previously we showed that BR-C regulates developmental changes in transcription and chromatin structure of the 67 B heat shock gene cluster, which contains four small hsp genes. Importantly, the downregulation of the hsp 23 gene in the BR-C mutants correlates with the absence of a DNase I-hypersensitive site (DHS) at position - 1400. To study the functional importance of the DHS- 1400, we have introduced genomic fragments containing a modified hsp 23 gene into the Drosophila germ line. Our analysis shows that the ecdysone response element is necessary but not sufficient for full developmental expression of hsp 23 in the late third instar and that there is, indeed, another regulatory element, in the vicinity of DHS- 1400. We also show that hsp 23 developmental expression is not tissue specific. A construct lacking the ecdysone response element is unable to direct normal hsp 23 expression in all tissues except the brain. Similarly, brain-specific expression is BR-C independent, although in the other tissues we find different requirements for BR-C <b>genetic</b> <b>functions.</b> The effect of the br mutations is restricted to wing imaginal discs and midgut tissue, while that of 2 Bc is restricted to the fat body and Malpighian tubules, and mutations in the rbp group have no effect in any of the tissues studied.
