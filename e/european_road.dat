Boreal Transport {{operates}} an airport coach service from Kirkenes {{to the airport}} in connection with all arrivals and departures. The company also serves the airport with coach services from Kirkenes {{to other parts of}} Finnmark. Parking, taxis and car rental is available at the airport.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is also a}} {{frequent}} host to national events, such as the annual beach handball tournament. Alanya is the traditional finish site of the seven-day Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, though organizers reversed the route in 2012, and started the event in Alanya instead. Other cycling events include the Alanya International Mountain Bike Race. Additionally, the European Cycling Union had its 2010 <b>European</b> <b>road</b> cycling championship and 2010 ordinary congress meeting in Alanya.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca is an {{important}} node in the <b>European</b> <b>road</b> network, being on three different European routes (E60, E81 and E576). At a national level, Cluj-Napoca is located on three different main national roads: DN1, DN1C and DN1F. The Romanian Motorway A3, also known as Transylvania Motorway (Autostrada Transilvania), currently under construction, will link the city with Bucharest and Romania's western border. The 2B section between Câmpia Turzii and Cluj Vest (Gilău) opened in late 2010. The Cluj-Napoca Coach Station (Autogara) is used by several private transport companies to provide coach connections from Cluj-Napoca to {{a large number of}} locations from all over the country.|$|E

5|$|Since his {{participation}} in an FIA <b>European</b> <b>road</b> safety campaign, {{as part of his}} punishment after the collision at the 1997 European Grand Prix, Schumacher continued to support other campaigns, such as Make Roads Safe, which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on G8 countries and the UN to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue. In 2008, Schumacher was the figurehead of an advertising campaign by Bacardi to raise awareness about responsible drinking, with a focus on communicating an international message 'drinking and driving don't mix'. He featured in an advertising campaign for television, cinema and online media, supported by consumer engagements, public relations and digital media across the World.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed, but {{features}} ticket machines, a waiting room, kisok and taxicab stand. There is parking nearby {{in a parking}} house. The bus station features two sections, one for local buses and one for regional buses. Between them they have six stops. However, because of the design of <b>European</b> <b>Road</b> E18, the station can only serve buses on the E18 which runs westwards—eastbound buses are served by a bus stop {{on the other side}} of the freeway. Ownership and operation of the bus terminal is carried out by Akershus Kollektivterminaler.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war there}} was limited {{resources}} for new rolling stocks and upgrades to the line. Multiple units gradually took over passenger trains, and by 1957, no passenger trains to Storlien were hauled by locomotives. That year Stavne–Leangen Line opened, allowing trains to bypass Trondheim Central Station. The new Di 3 diesel locomotives {{were put into}} service in 1961. The last steam engine {{was taken out of}} service in 1971. The introduction of the Di 3 forced an upgrade to the line to allow for an axle load of 18 tonnes. The opening of <b>European</b> <b>Road</b> E14 in the 1950s caused a reduction in shorter-haul passenger and freight. NSB subsequently cut passenger services to a single daily train, with a Di 3 hauling Swedish carriages through Meråker. Trains continuing along the Nordland Line continued to increase.|$|E

50|$|Front-wheel-drive in an {{era when}} most {{manufacturers}} were still years away from making the switch, the Zastava YUGO offered excellent space utilization.

25|$|The {{city is a}} vital traffic hub {{because all}} major <b>European</b> <b>roads</b> and <b>European</b> railway lines lead to Budapest.

25|$|On warning signs, {{an exclamation}} mark {{is often used}} to draw {{attention}} to a warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. A common type of this warning is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark, but a white triangle with a red border is common on <b>European</b> <b>road</b> warning signs.|$|E
25|$|Pontiac {{also began}} to focus on technology. In 1984, a Special Touring Edition (STE) was added to the 6000 line as a {{competitor}} to <b>European</b> <b>road</b> cars such as the Mercedes 190. The STE sported digital instruments and other electronics as well as a more powerful V-6 and retuned suspension. Later iterations would see some of the first introductions on Pontiacs of anti-lock brakes, steering wheel mounted radio controls and other advanced features.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposal}} for the Halden Terminal arose shortly after 1980, while Halden Municipality was searching for new industrial lots. The concept was that an intermodal terminal would be built near Halden, in the area between Sørli and <b>European</b> <b>Road</b> E6 known as Sørlifeltet. Trucks would arrive from various locations in Sweden and have their cargo transshipped to trains. These would then run directly to other locations in Norway, bypassing Alnabru Freight Terminal in Oslo. At {{the same time the}} site would be used as the center of a new industrial park.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands always signposts <b>European</b> <b>road</b> numbers where {{applicable}} (i.e., on the advance directional signs, the interchange direction signs {{and on the}} reassurance signs). Dutch national road numbers are placed on a rectangle, with motorways being signposted in white on a red rectangle (as an Axx) and primary roads in black on a yellow rectangle (as Nxx). When a motorway changes to a primary road, its number remains the same, but the A is replaced by the N. So {{at a certain point}} the A2 becomes N2, and when it changes to a motorway again, it becomes A2 again.|$|E
