The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> also turns the escape wheel pinion. Many clocks don't need this wheel, because of their slower moving escapements, and in these the third wheel drives the escape wheel directly.|$|R
50|$|Recumbent four-wheel cycles {{have the}} same general {{advantages}} of tricycles. For quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle. More wheels introduce more weight and more complexity. The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> is only of the most benefit to the single-seat rider when going off-road. When two and sometimes four riders want to ride together in a sociable configuration the four-wheel recumbent cycle is a viable option.|$|R

50|$|After {{these and}} other delays, in 1847 the legislatures of Virginia and Ohio jointly issued a new <b>Wheeling</b> <b>bridge</b> charter. Charles Ellet and John A. Roebling were invited to submit designs and {{estimates}} for a bridge over the east channel of the river to Wheeling Island. Ellett was the chief engineer of the Virginia Central Railroad and in 1853 would built a railroad over the Blue Ridge at Rock Fish Gap. The new <b>Wheeling</b> <b>bridge</b> would be of a suspension design, since Ellet and Roebling were the foremost authorities. It would also be ninety feet above low water, which would impede the largest steamboats with high stacks. Ellet received the contract award in 1847 with at bid of $120,000 (Roebling's for a shorter double-span bridge was $130,000), began the same year, and the bridge was completed in 1849 for about $250,000.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method for the signature analysis of mechanical watch movements. Contrary {{to the existing}} method, it analyzes the time-frequency features of mechanical watch movement {{through a combination of}} reassigned scalogram and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). By mapping the signal into a 2 D domain of time and frequency, the reassigned scalogram reveals the frequency components of the shocks at different time. On the other hand, FEA gives the modal frequencies of the movements. By comparing the frequency components at different shocks to the modal frequencies of the movement, possible malfunctions of the movement can then be detected. A number of demonstration examples are included.

50|$|Wheel train: A {{gear train}} that transmits {{the force of}} the power source to the escapement. Large gears known as wheels mesh with small gears known as pinions. The wheels in a typical going train are the centre wheel, third <b>wheel,</b> and <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel.</b> A {{separate}} set of wheels, the motion work, divides the motion of the minute hand by 12 to move the hour hand and in watches another set, the keyless work, allows the hands to be set.|$|R
50|$|Ellet {{would go}} on to design the 1,010 ft <b>Wheeling</b> Suspension <b>Bridge</b> (1847-49); and the first Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge (1847-48), which was {{abandoned}} before completion.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 Zenith {{introduced}} a watch with a redesigned gear train where the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was at the}} center of the movement, and so could drive a center seconds hand directly. The minute wheel, which had previously been at the center of the movement, was moved off center and drove the minute wheel indirectly. Any fluttering due the indirect gearing is concealed by the relatively slow movement of the minute hand. This redesign brought all the train gearing between the plates and allowed a thinner movement.|$|R

50|$|Fox then {{entered into}} {{partnership}} with the contractor Francis Braham to form the company Braham, Fox and Co., which when Braham retired became Fox, Henderson and Co., of London, Smethwick, and Renfrew. The company specialised in railway equipment, including <b>wheels,</b> <b>bridges,</b> roofs, cranes, tanks and permanent way materials. It also experimented with components for suspension and girder bridges, with Fox reading a paper before the Royal Society in 1865. The company was responsible for many important station roofs including Liverpool Tithebarn Street, (1849-50), Bradford Exchange (1850), Paddington and Birmingham New Street.|$|R
50|$|Pennsylvania legislators opposed federal {{legislation}} {{to authorize the}} <b>Wheeling</b> <b>bridge.</b> In 1836, Federal engineers proposed a suspension bridge with a removable section to enable clearance of steamboat smokestacks, but Congress tabled it. The U.S. postmaster's report urging a similar bridge in 1840 got lost. Another proposal requiring hinges on high steamboat smokestacks also initially failed. In 1844, a steamboat packet line began connecting Pittsburgh and Cincinnati (nearly bypassing Wheeling since the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad track would only be completed in 1853, the same year a packet line connected Wheeling and Louisville).|$|R
5000|$|Then they {{considered}} burlesque. Burlesque acts were cheaper, and circuits (called [...] "wheels") supplied {{a new show}} every week, complete with cast, costumes, and scenery. There was the Columbia Wheel, the American Wheel, and the Mutual Wheel. Burlesque during this period was [...] "clean"; a <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the Independent, actually went bankrupt in 1916 after refusing to clean up its act. The Minskys briefly considered signing with a wheel but decided to stage their own shows because it was cheaper and Billy longed {{to be the next}} Florenz Ziegfeld.|$|R
2500|$|Oral {{arguments}} for the Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont began on February 25, 1850, {{which was also}} when Stanton was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court. Wheeling and Belmont argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matters concerning the case; the justices disagreed. The case proceeded, allowing Stanton to exhibit a dramatic stunt, which was widely reported on and demonstrated how the bridge was a hindrance—he had the steamer Hibernia ram its [...] smokestack into the bridge, which destroyed it {{and a piece of}} the ship itself. May 1850 saw the case handed over to Reuben H. Walworth, the former Chancellor of New York, who returned a vivid opinion in February 1851 stating that the <b>Wheeling</b> <b>Bridge</b> was [...] "an unwarranted and unlawful obstruction to navigation, and that it must be either removed or raised so as to permit the free and usual passage of boats." [...] The Supreme Court concurred; in May 1852, the court ordered in a 7–2 ruling that the bridge's height be increased to [...] Wheeling and Belmont were unsatisfied with the ruling and asked Congress to act. To Stanton's horror, a bill declaring the <b>Wheeling</b> <b>bridge</b> permissible became law on August 31, effectively overriding the Supreme Court's ruling and authority. Stanton was disgruntled {{that the purpose of the}} court—to peacefully decide and remedy disputes between states—had been diminished by Congress.|$|R

50|$|Breguet {{realised}} {{that this}} problem (more serious {{at the time}} because of the rather poorer oils then available) could be removed {{and many of the}} advantages of the detent escapement retained if an impulse were given in both directions of the balance. In order to do this he geared two escape wheels together, one escape wheel driven by the <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> of the wheel train, which in turn was geared to and drives a second escape wheel. A pivoted detent swings freely between them and locks each escape wheel in turn on a coaxial set of locking teeth.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the Great Wheel {{was also}} {{designed}} by Hewes. The {{challenge was to}} increase the head of water acting on the wheel while using the same volume of water. It was achieved by sinking the wheel pit to {{below the level of}} the river and taking the tail race through a tunnel a kilometre downstream to rejoin the Bollin at Giant's Castle. This gave a head of 32 ft acting on the 32 ft diameter suspension wheel- which is 21 ft wide. The Great Wheel operated from 1818 to 1871 when the mill pool had silted up, and then to 1904.|$|R

50|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>wheel</b> also {{drives the}} escape {{wheel of the}} lever escapement. The escape wheel teeth {{alternately}} catch on two fingers called pallets on {{the arms of the}} pallet lever, which rocks back and forth. The other end of the lever has a fork which engages with an upright impulse pin on the balance wheel shaft. Each time the balance wheel swings through its center position, it unlocks the lever, which releases one tooth of the escape wheel, allowing the watch's wheels to advance by a fixed amount, moving the hands forward. As the escape wheel turns, its tooth pushes against the lever, which gives the balance wheel a brief push, keeping it swinging back and forth.|$|R
