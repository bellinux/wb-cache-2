5|$|Congress {{established}} the Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD) on June 4, 1976. MTPD police officers <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and arrest powers for crimes that occur throughout the 1,500 square mile (3,900km2) Transit Zone that includes Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. In December 2010, MTPD began conducting random searches of carry-on bags for explosive and weapons at checkpoints located at randomly designated Metrorail stations.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that absent {{explicit}} congressional direction to the contrary, it must be presumed that a State does not <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to tax tribal members who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.|$|E
5|$|United Nations Security {{officers}} are generally responsible for security within the UN Headquarters. They {{are equipped with}} weapons and handcuffs and may be mistaken for NYPD officers, due to similarity in uniforms. The NYPD's 17th Precinct patrols the area around and near the complex, but does not <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> inside the UN headquarters themselves since the headquarters are considered international property.|$|E

5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement from the Chinese or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the Walled City became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 handgun ban {{violated}} {{the right to}} keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court heard six {{original}} habeas {{cases of}} a criminal nature. All of the cases involved detention in the District of Columbia and prior proceedings in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. Because the D.C. circuit court did not utilize the practice of riding circuit, certificates of division {{could not have been}} granted in these cases. In the first two cases, the Court held that it had jurisdiction to issue the writ in pre-conviction situations. In the next two cases, the Court held that it did not <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to issue the writ in post-conviction cases.|$|E
50|$|In {{criminal}} matters a district court <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over all offences except treason, murder and rape, and a regional court <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over all offences except treason. A district court can impose {{a fine of}} not more than R120,000 or a prison sentence of not more than three years, while a regional court can impose a fine of not more than R600,000 or a prison sentence of not more than 15 years, except that for certain offences a regional court can also impose a life sentence. In civil matters a district court <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> where {{the value of the}} claim is R200,000 or less, while a regional court <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> where the value of the claim is between R200,000 and R400,000. A regional court also <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over divorce and related family law matters.|$|R
25|$|The Ninth Circuit also <b>had</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over certain American {{interests}} in China, {{in that it}} <b>had</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over appeals from the United States Court for China during the existence of that court from 1906 through 1943.|$|R

5|$|On December 7, 1969, Kinne was {{not present}} for a routine 5 p.m. {{roll-call}} at the Ixtapalapan prison where she was serving her sentence, but her absence was not officially noted until she also {{failed to show up}} at a second roll-call later that evening. The news of her disappearance was not reported to Mexico City police until 2 a.m. the following morning. A manhunt was then arranged, initially focusing on the northern Mexican states due to authorities' belief that Kinne may have been heading for the last known whereabouts of a former inmate to whom she had grown close while they were in prison together, but also encompassing country-wide transport hubs and eventually circling back to the Mexico City area. American authorities, including the FBI, were also alerted of Mexican authorities' belief that Kinne may have been attempting to work her way back into her native country, but the FBI noted that it was unlikely to <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in the case.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, {{pursuing}} {{a claim that}} Canterbury was the primatial see, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined {{to make such a}} written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before. King William wanted clear lines of authority in the church to match the lines of authority in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury. Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, {{it was the beginning of}} the long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the claims of Canterbury to <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over York.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} created the plenary power doctrine, holding {{that the federal}} court did not <b>have</b> <b>{{jurisdiction}}</b> because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away {{the rights of the}} tribe. Crow Dog was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation; the next major case, United States v. Kagama, (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress to enact any law that it wanted to pass, over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. The use of this power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.|$|E
50|$|The Court <b>has</b> {{exclusive}} original <b>jurisdiction</b> {{in first}} degree murder cases and original jurisdiction for all other crimes.

5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not <b>have</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar {{case in which the}} court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted {{authorities}} who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

It <b>had</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> to hear and to decide upon the defenses offered by him. The matter now presented {{was one of those}} defenses. Whether it was a sufficient defense was a matter of law on which that court must pass so far as it was purely a question of law, and on which the jury under the instructions of the court must pass if we can suppose any of the facts were such as required submission to the jury.|$|R
50|$|The {{role of the}} Committee on Finance is {{very similar}} to that of the House Committee on Ways and Means. The one {{exception}} in area of jurisdiction is that the Committee on Finance <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over both Medicare and Medicaid, while the House Ways and Means Committee only <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over Medicare. (The House Energy and Commerce Committee <b>has</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over Medicaid.) The other difference in terms of power is that all revenue raising measures must originate in the House giving the Ways and Means Committee a slight edge in setting tax policy. In addition to <b>having</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over legislation the Committee has extensive oversight powers. It has authority to investigate, review and evaluate existing laws, and the agencies that implement them.|$|R
