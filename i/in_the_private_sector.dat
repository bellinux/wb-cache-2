5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that the mandate created a perverse incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million. In the public sector full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much more than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> A 2016 study found only limited evidence that ACA had increased part-time employment.|$|E

5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> This goal acknowledges the glass ceiling that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> and the rest split between state, region and municipality.

Aarhus is a centre for retail in the Nordic and Baltic countries with expansive shopping centres, the busiest commercial street in the country and a dense urban core with many speciality shops.|$|E
