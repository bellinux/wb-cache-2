5|$|Soldiers of the ROK 1st Division {{captured}} a North Korean near Ka-san on September 4 {{who said that}} about 800 North Korean soldiers were on Ka-san with three more battalions following them from the north. The engineer company had succeeded only in establishing a perimeter briefly within the North Korean-held area. By evening of September 5, Ka-san was securely in North Korean hands with an estimated five battalions, totaling about 1,500 soldiers, on the mountain and its <b>forward</b> <b>slope.</b> A North Korean oxtrain carrying 82-mm. mortar shells and rice reportedly {{reached the top of}} Ka-san during the day. The ROK 1st Division captured this oxtrain a few days later south of Ka-san. By September 10, 400-500 North Koreans were on the ridge of Ka-San, as observed by a T-6 Mosquito spotter plane.|$|E
5|$|Prince Eugene was {{expected}} to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow. Lord Cutts' column – who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the Nebel – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the <b>forward</b> <b>slope,</b> were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even start. Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, Colonel Cadogan reported that Eugene's Prussian and Danish infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of the Canadian Corps, diversionary {{activities}} by X Corps involved formations from the British 5th and 7th Divisions. The 7th Division commander only refrained from protesting against the attack, because it was intended to pin German reserves and stop them moving north against the main attack. The 7th Division attacked Gheluvelt with the 20th and 91st Brigades, while the 5th Division attacked Polderhoek and the Scherriabeek valley immediately to the north with the 13th Brigade. On the 91st Brigade's front, the battalion on the right advanced rapidly, protected by a rise which hid them from most of the German machine-gunners nearer to the Menin road. They attacked their objective, a fortified mound near Hamp Farm, and overwhelmed the garrison stationed there after hand-to-hand fighting. The other two battalions of the brigade suffered far worse, having to advance along the <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> of the spur running south-east from Tower Hamlets ridge. The area was dominated by a group of pillboxes at Lewis House which held several machine-guns. The centre battalion could not keep pace with the barrage and its advance was stopped well short of Lewis House. Troops began to converge on the area near Lewis House, which caused crowding and gaps in the line. An attempt to outflank the pillboxes failed and the brigade fell back to its assembly positions.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the effect of a <b>forward</b> <b>sloping</b> seat on posture and muscular activity of the trunk and lower limbs. To this aim, twelve asymptomatic participants were tested in six conditions varying seat slope (0 °, 15 ° forward) and height (high, medium, low). Angular position of head, trunk and pelvis was assessed with an inertial orientation system, and muscular activity of 11 superficial postural muscles located in the trunk and lower limbs was estimated using normalized EMG. Results showed that a <b>forward</b> <b>sloping</b> seat, compared to a flat seat, induced a greater activity of the soleus (p< 0. 01), vastus later-alis (p< 0. 05) and vastus medialis (p< 0. 05), as well a lower hip flexion (p< 0. 01). In contrast, no significant variation of head, trunk and pelvis angular position was observed according to seat slope. It was concluded that <b>forward</b> <b>sloping</b> seats increase the load sustained by the lower limbs, without a systematic improvement of body posture...|$|R

25|$|The enemy battery {{was located}} on the <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> of a small coconut grove several {{thousand}} yards from the Piva River. Counterbattery fire from the 155mm howitzer battery of the U.S. Army's 37th Division began to explode around the grove. Fire was adjusted quickly by direct observation, and shortly afterwards the Japanese battery was knocked out of action. While the artillery duel was underway, the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment and 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment began forming into attack formation behind the line of departure. The preparatory fires ceased at 09:00 {{and at that time}} the two attack battalions advanced through the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment's lines.|$|E

25|$|At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Proctor led 12 guns in William Alexander, Lord Stirling's wing {{which was}} in Washington's main body. After Charles Lee's advance guard was driven back at mid-day, the {{advancing}} British encountered the American main body. There were five infantry brigades in line with two detachments covering the left and another infantry brigade screening the right. Under the direction of Knox, the 12 guns were massed in a large battery on the <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> of Perrine's Ridge about 1:00–1:30 pm. The American 6-pounders and 4-pounders engaged in an inconclusive 2-hour artillery duel with a British concentration that included two 12-pounders, six 6-pounders and two 5½-inch howitzers. When four American cannons under Thomas-Antoine de Mauduit du Plessis took the British gun line in enfilade from Comb's Hill about 3:00 pm, British army commander Henry Clinton ordered a withdrawal.|$|E

Digging and wiring of a new third line began in May, civilians were moved away and stocks of ammunition and hand-grenades were increased in the front-line. By mid-June Below and Rupprecht expected {{an attack on the}} 2nd Army which held the front from Noyon to beyond Gommecourt, although Falkenhayn was more concerned about an offensive in Alsace-Lorraine and then a possible attack on the 6th Army, which held the front from near Gommecourt to St. Eloi close to Ypres. In April, Falkenhayn had suggested a spoiling attack by the 6th Army but lack of troops and artillery engaged in the offensive at Verdun, made it impractical. Some labour battalions and captured Russian heavy artillery were sent to the 2nd Army, Below proposed a preventive attack in May and a reduced operation from Ovillers to St. Pierre Divion in June but got only one extra artillery regiment. On 6 June, Below reported that air reconnaissance indicated an offensive at Fricourt and Gommecourt.|$|E

500|$|The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade adopted tight {{security}} that evening {{due to the}} threat of North Korean infiltration. For added protection while in reserve the 3 RAR headquarters had been sited on the reverse slope of a hill overlooking the Talchon River, with the rifle companies occupying the <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> of the ridgeline to the west and a spur line which thrust towards the river bank. Around dusk at 18:10 on 30 October, six high-velocity shells, likely from a North Korean self-propelled gun or tank, hit the area. Five of the shells landed on the <b>forward</b> <b>slope,</b> while the sixth cleared the crest and detonated {{to the rear of the}} C Company position after hitting a tree. In his tent on a stretcher after 36 hours without sleep, Green was severely wounded in the stomach by a fragment from the wayward round. He was evacuated to a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) at Anju, however he succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November, and was subsequently interred at Pusan. Forty other men who had been in the vicinity when the shell landed were unhurt. A popular and respected commanding officer, Green's loss was keenly felt by the Australians. Meanwhile, Coad received congratulations from Gay for the brigade's victory at Chongju after marching [...] in twelve hours.|$|E
500|$|Gellibrand then {{ordered the}} 48th Battalion, and the 47th Battalion on its right, to {{immediately}} take up {{positions on the}} <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> of the high ground and push posts forward to the railway embankment below.

The 47th moved forward immediately, came under heavy German shelling, and suffered casualties in moving as far as an old half-completed trench some [...] short of the railway line by 17:00. Leane took the view that Gellibrand did not know the full situation on the ground, and that he had the discretion to follow a course of action that would achieve the objective without unnecessary casualties. He decided not to move his troops forward until dark. Bean remarks on Leane again disobeying orders, but notes that the dangers of such action are mitigated when such subordinates, like Leane, have [...] "outstanding qualities of courage and judgement". He concludes, [...] "ut Leane was Leane, and Gellibrand had the sense to know it". Deayton criticises Leane's decision, describing his failure to advise the 47th Battalion of his intentions as [...] "inexcusable", and stating that the serious risk created by Leane's decision could have resulted in a disaster had there been a German attack that afternoon. Deayton also reflects that this was only the latest in a series of clashes between Leane and Gellibrand since the latter had taken over the brigade in November of the previous year.|$|E

Attempting to maintain communications, Baker ventured out on four occasions during the engagement, each time subject to the heavy artillery barrage from the German forces, and repaired the telephone line in thirty separate places. As a consequence, the 16th Battery was able to align its artillery barrage and destroy the Germans' forward trench. Commended for his [...] "great gallantry" [...] as well as [...] "good service and... great devotion to duty", Baker was awarded the Military Medal.

5|$|In the US 7th Marine Regiment's sector, heavy shelling, {{small arms}} fire and hand-to-hand {{fighting}} continued around Boulder City {{into the early}} morning on 25 July. Chinese infantry had succeeded in breaking through and occupying {{a large part of}} the trench-line on the <b>forward</b> <b>slopes,</b> and for a while even temporarily occupied the crest. At 01:30 Companies G and I, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines launched a rapid counter-attack and by 03:30 the American perimeter had been re-established, and was subsequently reinforced. By 05:30 Hill 119 was secured by the US Marines, although scattered groups of Chinese remained on the <b>forward</b> <b>slopes,</b> while others attempted to reinforce the left flank. Sporadic fighting and heavy shelling also continued on Hill 111 in the early morning hours, and at 04:00 another fight developed; by 05:30 the position was also controlled by the Americans. Four M46 Patton tanks on Boulder City dispersed the Chinese concentrations with high explosive and machine-gun fire, while Marine infantry assault teams with flamethrowers and 3.5-inch rocket launchers subsequently cleared the remaining Chinese from their former bunkers. In total, more the 3,000 Chinese troops had assaulted the front held by the US 1st Marine Division during the night of 24/25 July.|$|R

In April, Field Marshal Crown Prince Rupprecht and his chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Hermann von Kuhl, favoured withdrawal to the Warneton (third) line, before a British attack. The local divisional commanders objected, due to their belief that counter-mining had neutralised the British underground threat and the inadequacy of the Warneton line. The convex eastern slope limited artillery observation and the [...] canal and the river Lys restricted the space below the ridge where infantry could manoeuvre for counter-attacks.

Air superiority allowed the British artillery observation aircraft to cruise over the German defences, despite the defensive efforts of Jagdgeschwader 1 (the Richthofen Circus). On 26 May, the German front garrisons were ordered to move forward [...] into shell-holes in no-man's-land at dawn and return to their shelters at night. When the shelters were destroyed, shell-hole positions were made permanent, as were those of the companies further back. Troops in the [...] (second) line were withdrawn behind the ridge and by the end of May, the front battalions changing every two days instead of every five, due to the effect of the British bombardment. Some German troops on the ridge were convinced of the mine danger and their morale was depressed further by the statement of a prisoner taken on 6 June, that the attack would be synchronised with mine explosions. On 1 June, the British bombardment became more intense and nearly every German defensive position on the <b>forward</b> <b>slope</b> was obliterated.
