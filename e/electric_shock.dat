5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or {{stonefish}} (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously injure or kill humans. Some, like the electric eel and the electric catfish, {{can give a}} severe <b>electric</b> <b>shock.</b> Others, such as the piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and have sometimes attacked human bathers. Reports indicate {{that some of the}} catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.|$|E
5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E

5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E

5|$|Inhabiting shallow, sandy areas near rocky reefs, the Japanese sleeper ray is a bottom-dwelling {{predator}} of invertebrates. Like {{other members}} of its family, it can produce a strong <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> from its electric organs for defensive purposes. Females give live birth to litters of up to five pups. The gestating young are sustained at first by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Vulnerable, due to its susceptibility to trawl fisheries that operate intensively throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E

5|$|Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a great {{burden on}} the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone from the {{mountains}} into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is rendered alive by an <b>electric</b> <b>shock.</b> In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before it hits him in the backside.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Pacific {{electric}} ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity {{for the purposes}} of subduing prey or self-defense. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are initially nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of 17–20 pups, probably once every other year. Care should be exercised around the Pacific {{electric ray}}, as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> can potentially incapacitate a diver. It and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is not fished in any significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, such as sharks, {{are able}} to detect and respond to changes in {{electric}} fields, an ability known as electroreception, while others, termed electrogenic, {{are able to}} generate voltages themselves {{to serve as a}} predatory or defensive weapon. The order Gymnotiformes, of which the best known example is the electric eel, detect or stun their prey via high voltages generated from modified muscle cells called electrocytes. All animals transmit information along their cell membranes with voltage pulses called action potentials, whose functions include communication by the nervous system between neurons and muscles. An <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> stimulates this system, and causes muscles to contract. Action potentials are also responsible for coordinating activities in certain plants.|$|E

5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} is {{a fairly}} inactive species that spends {{long periods of time}} buried motionless in sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (particularly those of the family Maldanidae) and crustaceans (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans. Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian numbfish can defend itself with a modest <b>electric</b> <b>shock.</b> Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> {{delivered}} by a {{marbled electric ray}} can be severe but is not directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled electric ray as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common electric ray and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E
5|$|The {{sluggish}} and nocturnal coffin ray frequents sandy or muddy habitats, {{where it}} can bury itself during daytime. It can produce a powerful <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> reaching 200 volts for attack and defense. This species is a voracious predator that feeds mainly on benthic bony fishes, often tackling fish approaching or exceeding itself in size. On occasion, it may also consume invertebrates and even small penguins and rats. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). The female gives birth to 4–8 pups during summer. The coffin ray can deliver a severe, albeit non-fatal, shock to a human. Not valued commercially, it is very hardy and can usually survive being captured and discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as its population does not seem threatened by human activity.|$|E
