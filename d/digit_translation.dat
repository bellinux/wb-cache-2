50|$|Markers {{were mostly}} {{associated}} with crossbar switches, but many non Bell System crossbar exchanges {{did not use}} them. Where those exchanges had markers, for example in the British TXK or the Ericsson ARM, they were simpler, the <b>digit</b> <b>translation</b> jobs that were added to Bell System markers being handled by other equipment.|$|E
50|$|During {{the middle}} 20th Century markers in Bell System exchanges, being complex common control {{circuits}} with short holding time, acquired other functions {{that were only}} needed once or twice per telephone call, including outgoing <b>digit</b> <b>translation</b> and enforcement of different policies upon different classes of service {{in the provision of}} features to customers. This practice evolved into Customer Groups, allowing the addition of Centrex features to 5XB switch. These were the most complex markers made, and were abandoned in the 1970s and 1980s when Stored Program Control became mature.|$|E
50|$|The {{card sorter}} of the 4A/CTS (Number 4A Crossbar / Card Translator System) allowed six <b>digit</b> <b>translation</b> {{of the central}} office code number dialed by the customer. This {{determined}} the proper trunk circuits to use, where separate circuit groups were used for different cities {{in the same area}} code, {{as in the case of}} Oakland and San Francisco. The new device used metal cards similar in principle to computer punched cards, and they were rapidly scanned as they fell past a light beam. On busy days, it sounded like a machine gun firing. CTS machines were called 4A (Advanced) if the translator was included in the original installation, and 4M (Modified) if it was added later. A 1970s version of 4XB, the 4A/ETS, used a computer to translate. For international dialing, Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) provided the extra computer power.|$|E

40|$|Convolutional neural {{networks}} (CNNs) are inherently equivariant to translation. Efforts to embed {{other forms of}} equivariance have concentrated solely on rotation. We expand the notion of equivariance in CNNs through the Polar Transformer Network (PTN). PTN combines ideas from the Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and canonical coordinate representations. The result is a network invariant to translation and equivariant to both rotation and scale. PTN is trained end-to-end and composed of three distinct stages: a polar origin predictor, the newly introduced polar transformer module and a classifier. PTN achieves state-of-the-art on rotated MNIST and the newly introduced SIM 2 MNIST dataset, an MNIST variation obtained by adding clutter and perturbing <b>digits</b> with <b>translation,</b> rotation and scaling. The ideas of PTN are extensible to 3 D which we demonstrate through the Cylindrical Transformer Networ...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} a formal foundation for stable permutations {{in the domain}} of a parallel model of computation applicable to a customized set of complexity metrics. By means of vector spaces, we develop an algebrao [...] geometric representation that is expressive, flexible and simple to use, and present a taxonomy categorizing stable permutations into classes of index [...] <b>digit,</b> linear, <b>translation,</b> affine and polynomial permutations. For each class, we demonstrate its general behavioral properties and then analyze particular examples in each class, where we derive results about its inverse, fixed instances, number of instances local and nonlocal to a processor, as well as its compositional relationships to other permutations. Such examples are bit-reversal, radix-Q exchange, radix-Q shuffle and unshuffle within the index-digit class, radix-Q butterfly and 1 's complement within the translation class, binary-to-Gray and Gray-to-binary within the linear class, and arithmetic add 1, arithm [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with speech-to-speech translation that is sensitive to paralinguistic information. From the many different possible paralinguistic features to handle, {{in this paper we}} chose duration and power as a first step, proposing a method that can translate these features from input speech to the output speech in continuous space. This is done in a simple and language-independent fashion by training a regression model that maps source language duration and power information into the target language. We evaluate the proposed method on a <b>digit</b> <b>translation</b> task and show that paralinguistic information in input speech appears in output speech, and that this information can be used by target language speakers to detect emphasis. 1...|$|E
50|$|While a Director {{area had}} {{a maximum of}} 648 {{exchange}} names (8 x 9 x 9), in practice some numbers {{do not have a}} usable name equivalent; unusable ABC digits would be 688 (MUTt or MUVver?) or 555 (?). London was running out of usable names with 350 exchanges by 1965; this was one reason for the change to all-figure dialling in 1966. This problem was sidestepped to some degree by using otherwise unusable codes to give access to the fringe non-Director exchanges from the Director area. For example, in London callers to South Mimms were told to dial SM6 followed by the four-digit South Mimms number; callers to Uxbridge numbers were told to dial UX followed by the five-digit Uxbridge number. In this latter case the first digit of the Uxbridge number rotated the BC switch of the director and was absorbed in specifying the translation; the last <b>digit</b> of the <b>translation</b> then regenerated the first digit of the Uxbridge number.|$|R
40|$|This book {{documents}} {{the history of}} pi from the dawn of mathematical time to the present. One of the beauties {{of the literature on}} pi is that it allows for the inclusion of very modern, yet accessible, mathematics. The articles on pi collected herein include selections from the mathematical and computational literature over four millennia, a variety of historical studies on the cultural significance of the number, and an assortment of anecdotal, fanciful, and simply amusing pieces. For this new edition, the authors have updated the original material while adding new material of historical and cultural interest. There is a substantial exposition of the recent history of the computation of digits of pi, a discussion of the normality of the distribution of the <b>digits,</b> new <b>translations</b> of works by Viete and Huygen, as well as Kaplansky's never-before-published "Song of Pi. " From the reviews of earlier editions: "Few mathematics books serve a wider potential readership than does a source book and this particular one is admirably designed to cater for a broad spectrum of tastes: professional mathematicians with research interest in related subjects, historians of mathematics, teachers at all levels searching out material for individual talks and student projects, and amateurs who will find much to amuse and inform them in this leafy tome. The authors are to be congratulated on their good taste in preparing such a rich and varied banquet with which to celebrate pi. " - Roger Webster for the Bulletin of the LMS "The judicious representative selection makes this a useful addition to one's library as a reference book, an enjoyable survey of developments and a source of elegant and deep mathematics of different eras. " - Ed Barbeau for MathSciNet "Full of useful formulas and ideas, it is a vast source of inspiration to any mathematician, A level and upwards-a necessity in any maths library. " - New Scientis...|$|R
50|$|To make a call, the subscriber's uni{{selector}} seizes a free 1st code selector, {{which in}} turn seizes an A-digit selector via an A-digit hunter uniselector. The A-digit selector returns dial tone, steps to the first dialled digit and searches for a free director from that group. The director includes a two-motion selector - the BC switch - which steps vertically and then horizontally according to the two BC digits. This selector has 6 banks to permit up to 6 pulse trains to be generated by the director to step the code selectors; the bank contacts are strapped via a translation field to indicate the digit required (or to a DCO lead to indicate that all <b>translation</b> <b>digits</b> have been sent). The pulse train output begins after the C-digit is received from the subscriber's telephone. This is generated {{under the control of}} the send switch uniselector as it searches for the marks provided by the translation field straps for the exchange code received. Meanwhile, the subscriber has continued to dial and the four digits of the numerical portion of the number are stored on four more uniselectors. These set up four more marks, and after completing the output of the code translation the send switch uniselector searches for them in turn in order to forward the numerical digits unchanged to step the numerical selectors at the terminating exchange.|$|R
