40|$|Abstract—CFlow is a <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> software, it {{contains}} facilities to draw and evaluate a <b>flow</b> <b>chart.</b> A <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> evaluation applies a simulation method to enable presentation of work flow in a <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> solution. <b>Flow</b> <b>chart</b> simulation of CFlow is executed by manipulating the CFlow data file which is saved in a graphical vector format. These text-based data are organised {{by using a}} data classification technic based on a Library classification-scheme. This paper describes the file format for <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> simulation software of CFlow. F Keywords—CFlow, <b>flow</b> <b>chart,</b> file format...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This report {{presents}} the work carried {{out for the}} <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> recognition task {{in the course of}} the CLEF-IP 2012 competition. The goal is to obtain structural information of <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> based on the vi-sual content of the images. To this end, for each <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> a list of its nodes and their interconnections, i. e. its edges, is extracted and the type of the nodes and edges and attached text is recognized. The au-tomatic recognition task is done in three stages: (1) <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> image pre-processing using connected component analysis, morphological fil-ters and line segmentation, (2) identification of nodes, junction points, end points and edges and (3) recognition of text, geometric node types and edge directions. Examples demonstrate good recognition results obtained for 100 tested <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> images...|$|R
40|$|In any {{business}} process reengineering (BPR) project, {{a thorough understanding of}} various tasks and activities of the organization is required. Very often this idea is captured using a simple <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> or static representation diagram. The weakness here is that the process design complexity is not adequately represented by the use of <b>flow</b> <b>charts,</b> and this allows for limited human-computer interaction during the process design and analysis. In this paper, we propose an enhanced <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> approach; the concept of activity-section <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> to support BPR, which is a combination of the existing activity <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> and section <b>flow</b> <b>chart.</b> Using this approach, a human-computer interactive model for BPR is devoped. This model can identify the unreasonable activity loops and excessive business rounds between sections by the adjacent and reachable matrices. Via the human-computer interaction, the process can be revised by human experience. This approach provides an efficient tool for BPR of large-scale systems. It has been applied to the material supply management system of an iron and steel works, and satisfactory results have been achieved. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} investigation {{is made to}} form work <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> about activities that are carried out in Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine (CUFM) by collecting meta-information that might be needed. According to the data from literature {{it is noteworthy that}} many of the faculties in Turkey have work <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> but there is not any optimization study about work flow organisation scheme. Due to this, a project, consisting of four stages, which are information gathering, forming work <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> according to the gathered information and control of these charts by relevant experts, forming of simulation models by putting the problems forward, and lastly using optimization modelling method, is prepared. In this study, which covers first and second stages, difficulties that are encountered, advantages and disadvantages of work <b>flow</b> <b>charts</b> are presented.
