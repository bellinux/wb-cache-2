The robust pole assignment problem is then formulated as an optimization task in which the <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the closed-loop poles are minimized. The case of "multi-perturbations" can be considered naturally in our problem formulation. The gradient of the objective function to be minimized is then derived which permits the minimization to be proceeded effectively.

40|$|Actively growing {{strains of}} Vibrio fetus venerealis and V. fetus intestinalis, {{none of which}} {{produced}} penicillinase, were treated with inhibitory levels of penicillin or glycine, primarily to gain insight into the <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the two varieties to both of these compounds. Treatments induced the accumulation of uridine nucleotide glycopeptide precursors which contained amino sugars and amino acids in various molar ratios. Penicillin-induced nucleotides all contained muramic acid and sometimes glucosamine; they generally contained alanine, glutamic acid, diaminopimelic acid, and glycine. Approximately equimolar ratios of these components were observed in some compounds, but ratios varied considerably in others. Glycine-induced nucleotides contained muramic acid and, in some instances, glucosamine. Amino acids were detected only infrequently and usually in low molar ratios. The data suggest that penicillinase production, differences in the chemical composition of glycopeptide, and variations in modes of action of penicillin and glycine cannot individually account for the <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of venereal and intestinal strains of V. fetus to these substances...|$|R

Toward this end, we previously developed a collagen gel-supported culture system for growth of human tumors. This three-dimensional culture system is general and grows tumors at high frequency directly from surgery or biopsy that maintain important in vivo properties in vitro, including tissue architecture. We report here that with autoradiographic techniques measuring cellular DNA synthesis the drug responses of individual cells within the tissue structure of in vitro-grown tumors can be determined. Twenty tumor classes, including all the major ones, have been measured in toto at greater than 50 % frequency. Quantitative and qualitative results show increasing cell kill with rising cytotoxic drug concentration, <b>differential</b> drug <b>sensitivities</b> of multiple cell types within individual cultured tumors, <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivities</b> {{of a series of}} tumors of the same histopathological classification to a single drug, <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of individual tumors to a series of drugs, and sensitivity patterns of various tumor types similar to the sensitivities found in vivo.

50|$|It {{has been}} shown by Fulda et al. that the {{naturally}} occurring compound resveratrol (a polyphenol found in grapes and red wine) {{can be used as}} a sensitizer for anticancer drug-induced apoptosis by the action of causing cell cycle arrest. This cell cycle arrest causes a dramatic decline in survivin levels in the cells, as it is known from the literature that survivin expression is highly linked with the cell cycle phase state. Thus, the decrease in survivin, which is a contributing factor to chemotherapy resistance and apoptosis induction therapies, would render the cancer cells more prone to such cancer treatments. Fulda et al. have demonstrated the benefits of resveratrol through a series of experiments. First, the authors of the paper tested the intrinsic cytotoxic effects of resveratrol. They found that it induced moderate apoptosis levels only in SHEP neuroblastoma cells. After, they tested resveratrol in combination with several different known anticancer agents. They found a consistent increase in the level of apoptosis induced by the drugs when resveratrol was also present. Moreover, they varied the order with which either the drugs or resveratrol was introduced to the cancer cells to determine whether the sequence of treatment had any important effect. It was found that the highest levels of apoptosis induction were observed when resveratrol was added prior to anticancer drug treatment. Next, the authors tested for any <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to apoptosis linked to the phase of the cell cycle the cells were in. Analysis by flow cytometry revealed an accumulation of cells in S phase upon treatment with resveratrol. The cells were also halted in different phases of the cell cycle using special compounds and then treated with the anticancer drugs. They found that cells halted in S phase were significantly more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the drugs.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolution}} of a moth’s auditory system has helped them escape a bat’s echolocation. Physically a moth has two ears {{on each side of}} the thorax where they receive ultrasonic indicators to hear the distinct vocalizations that then vibrate the membranes of the moths ears at one of two auditory receptors: A1 or A2. These are attached to the tympanum in the ear. Intense sound pressure waves sweep over the moth’s body causing the tympanum to vibrate and deforming these receptor cells. This opens stretch-sensitive channels in the cell membrane and provides the effective stimuli for a moth auditory receptor. These receptors work in the same ways that most neurons do, by responding to the energy contained in selected stimuli and changing the permeability of their cell membranes to positively charged ions. Even though the A1 and A2 receptors work in a similar fashion, there are significant differences between them. The A1 receptor is the main bat detector, and as the rate of firing increases the moth turns away from the bat to reduce sonar echo. In other words, the A1 receptor is sensitive to low frequencies. To determine the relative position of the bat the differential firing rates of the A1 cells will fire on either side of the moth's head and if the bat is farther away cells receive a weaker signal and will fire at a slower rate. The A2 receptor is the emergency back-up system by initiating erratic flight movements as a last-ditch effort to evade capture. This <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the A1 and A2 sensory neurons leads to stimulus filtering of the bat vocalizations. Long-distance evasion tactics are engaged when the bat is far away and therefore the A1 sensory neurons fire. When the bat is in extremely close range, short-distance evasion tactics are engaged with the use of A2 sensory neurons. The adaptive value of the physiological mechanisms of two distinct receptors aids in the evasion of capture from bats.|$|E

They also obtained an explicit expression of the contingent derivative for a class of set-valued maps, and some optimality conditions for (VVI) and weak (VVI) by virtue of the gap functions. Later, by the definition of the gap function for Minty vector variational inequalities, some <b>differential</b> and <b>sensitivity</b> results for Minty vector variational inequalities were also obtained in [10].

30|$|Temperature is {{a crucial}} factor {{affecting}} {{the composition of the}} phytoplankton community, and greater numbers of cells usually observe in warmer seasons [14]. Furthermore, temperature is the most important factor controlling which phytoplankton taxa is present in freshwater lakes [75, 76]. Results of the current study are consistent with results of previous studies [77 – 80], and showing that cyanobacteria-dominated phytoplankton communities in warmer seasons. Once critical concentrations of nutrients were exceeded, temperature was the principal factor driving blooms of Microcystis [81, 82]. Compared with Bacillariophyta, Cyanophyta have a competitive advantage under conditions of greater temperature, especially when temperature of water exceeds 25  °C [13, 83]. In addition, Gala and Giesy [84] demonstrated that UV light can penetrate into water, especially in shallow lakes, and that phytoplankton exhibited <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Hence, there can be seasonal changes in relative densities due to these <b>differential</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and cyanobacteria are the least sensitive class of taxa. Even though arsenic (As) can isomorphically substitute for phosphorus (P), it was not conducive to growth of algae. In the present study, significantly negative correlations between concentrations of As and concentrations of Chl a and total numbers of phytoplankton were observed (Table  4). Phytoplankton can be involved in geochemical cycling of As in aquatic ecosystems [85, 86]. In fact, there are some phytoplankton, especially cyanobacteria, that are resistant to adverse effects of As [87, 88], because they contain a class of proteins similar to metallothioneins [89] and could accumulate and transform As. Concentrations of phosphorus cannot rescue other species from the toxic effects of As.|$|R
