The genetic approach is thought to be an appropriate choice since it is computationally simple, provide powerful search capability, and has the ability to move around in the solution space without a dependence upon structure or locality. The performance of the genetic algorithm is compared to Dijkstra algorithm, which is widely used in most network protocols.

Furthermore, it offers a tool-assistant approach for the protocol designers and analysts towards the verification of their products under varying parameters. Finally, this analysis can be also utilized towards reliably addressing cost-related issues of certain communication protocols and deciding on their cost-dependent viability, taking into account limitations that are introduced by hardware specifications of mobile devices and noisy mobile environments...|$|E

40|$|Electronic mail is {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} most successful computer applications in the Information Technology industry. International standards, such as the X. 400 Message Handling Systems, have been developed to enable the continual expansion of <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services</b> to a wide range of users. The X. 400 standards have comprehensively detailed the functional level of message handling systems but, as with all CCITT standards, has stopped short of defining any requirements for the user interface and a phase approach to the integration of X. 400 mail systems for distributed networks. This thesis presents a functional model, requirements for a contemporary X. 400 Mail system for distributed networks, discussion of mail systems, and an integrated phase approach. The functional model was developed from the X. 400 recommendations. The functional model, requirements, and the implemented target system was the result of a comprehensive study and experiments. The X. 400 issues focused upon in the functional model, Interim and Target systems include the complexity of specifying message recipient addresses and message options. One of the most promising international standards is the X. SOO Directory Services at this writing. X. SOO provides a global distributed database of information on people and an extensible range of objects. The directory enables users to store their complex X. 400 addresses and provide a more consistent and reliable method to access this information. The functional model, Interim and Target system also describes the requirements for the integration of X. SOO Directory Services with X. 400 Message Handling Systems. This tightly coupled integration is considered to be a powerful enabling technology for electronic mail users. The functional model, requirements and Interim and Target system with the integrated phase approach provides the computing science discipline with a proven and functional methodology for X. 400 message systems with X.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services</b> {{have become}} an {{important}} source of communication for millions of people all over the world. Due to this tremendous growth, there has been a significant increase in spam traffic. Spam messes up user's inbox, consumes network resources and spread worms and viruses. In this paper we study the characteristics of spam and the technology used by spammers. In order to counter anti spam technology, spammers change their mode of operation, therefore continues evaluation of the characteristics of spam and spammers technology has become mandatory. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing anti spam technology and thereby help us to combat spam effectively. In order to characterize spam, we collected four hundred thousand spam mails from a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months from January 2006 to February 2007. For analysis we classified spam based on attachment and contents. We observed that spammers use software tools to send spam with attachment. The main features of this software are hiding sender's identity, randomly selecting text messages, identifying open relay machines, mass mailing capability and defining spamming duration. Spammers do not use spam software to send spam without attachment. From our study we observed that, four years old heavy users email accounts attract more spam than four years old light users mail accounts. Relatively new email accounts which are 14 months old do not receive spam. But in some special cases like DDoS attacks, we found that new email accounts receive spam and 14 months old heavy users email accounts have attracted more spam than 14 months old light users. We believe that this analysis could be useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques. Comment: 14 pages, 8 Figures, 5 tables, IJSA Vol 2, No 2, 200...|$|E
40|$|Various {{kinds of}} {{computer-based}} communications systems are being implemented on the campuses of land grant universities {{to assist in}} the task of communicating with external audiences. Systems within the information and publications office primarily involve computerized news transmission, typesetting, office management functions, and text processing and editing. Another type of system is the 2 ̆ 2 information utility, 2 ̆ 2 which provides a variety of services such as problem-solving and educational programs, general news information, <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>services,</b> and computational assistance to end users, such as farmers or agri-businessmen. Twelve computer-based communications systems operating at eight land grant universities are analyzed in terms of five general areas of concern: standards and quality, technological limitations, man-machine interface, financial and economic considerations, and information proprietorship considerations;The findings reveal no serious problems in any of the areas but do point out some cautions that should be carefully monitored as these systems develop and operate. No great cost savings can be accrued with computerized news systems although they do save some keystroke operations within the communications office. These systems are justified more on the basis that they increase the likelihood of news release use by newspapers. In the cases examined, newspapers sought more news from the information office because electronic processing saved the newspaper considerable time compared to processing the traditional printed news release forms. A surprising discovery was that only in one instance was there capability in the information office to process text and edit electronically from the initial writing to the final product, thereby completely eliminating pencil and hard copy. Yet, this type of integrated operation is where considerable time and cost efficiencies could be achieved;With regard to the information utilities, there is concern {{about the quality of the}} software (programs) that are produced for such systems.
