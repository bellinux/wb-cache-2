60|$|MR. BARLOW. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> been a {{turbulent}} family, {{and we have}} had our share of sorrow, even more, perhaps, than of joys. And sorrow makes one indifferent to the conventionalities of life.|$|E

As regards her, we are bound by close ties not to speak ill of her--or even to think ill, unless we cannot avoid it.

6000|$|... "Why {{should we}} be taken beyond all things? If seems {{scarcely}} reasonable. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not much to go on, but did not the Christ speak of drinking {{the fruit of the}} vine 'new with you in my Father's kingdom'? Therefore surely there must be a growing plant that produces the fruit and a process directed by intelligence that turns it into wine. There must be husbandmen or farmers. There must be mansions or abiding places, also, for they are spoken of, and flowers and all things that are beautiful and useful; a new earth indeed, but not one so different to the old as to be utterly unfamiliar." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{supplied}} much of {{this with}} Enthusiasm and conceited Revelation; but the People of this World convince us, {{that it may be}} all Natural, by obtaining it in a Mechanick way, viz. by forming something suitable to the sublime Nature, which working by Art, shall only rectify the more vigorous Particles of the Soul, and work it up to a suitable Elevation. This Engine is wholly applied to the Head, and Works by Injection; the chief Influence being on what we call Fancy, or Imagination, which by the heat of strong Ideas, is fermented to a strange heighth, and is thus brought to see backward and forward every way, beyond it self: By this a Man fancies himself in the Moon, and realizes things there as distinctly, as if he was actually talking to my Old Phylosopher.|$|E
6000|$|The way {{in which}} the spring made itself felt upon the lagoon was full of curious delight. It was not so early in the season that we should know the spring by the first raw warmth in the air, and there was as yet no {{assurance}} of her presence in the growth--later so luxuriant--of the coarse grasses of the shallows. But somehow the spring was there, giving us new life with every breath. There were fewer gulls than usual, and those we saw sailed far overhead, debating departure. There was deeper languor in the laziness of the soldiers of finance, as they lounged and slept upon their floating custom houses in every channel of the lagoons; and the hollow voices of the boatmen, yelling to each other as their wont is, had an uncommon tendency to diffuse themselves in echo. Over all, the heavens had put on their summer blue, in promise of that delicious weather which in the lagoons lasts half the year, and which makes every other climate seem niggard of sunshine and azure skies. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> beautiful days at home--days of which the sumptuous splendor used to take my memory with unspeakable longing and regret even in Italy;--but we do not have, week after week, month after month, that ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs. Carnegie, the mother, {{from the}} head of the table, [...] "you've no idea how curiously their two lives have always resembled one other. When they were babies, they were so much alike that we had to tie red and blue ribbons round their necks to {{distinguish}} them. Ernest was red and Harold blue--no, Ernest was blue and Harold red: at least, I'm not quite certain which way it was, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a note of it in the family Bible, for Mr. Carnegie made it at the time for fear we should get confused between them when we were bathing them. So we put the ribbons on the moment they were christened, and never took them both off together for a second, even to bathe them, so as to prevent accidents. Well, do you know, dear, from the time they were babies, they were always alike in everything; but Ernest was always a fortnight before Harold. He said [...] "Mamma" [...] one day, and just a fortnight later Harold said the very same word. Then Ernest said [...] "sugar," [...] and so did Harold in another fortnight. Ernest began to toddle a fortnight the earliest. They took the whooping cough and the measles in the same order; and they cut all their teeth so, too, the same teeth first on each side, and just at a fortnight's distance from one another. It's really quite an extraordinary coincidence." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hurt dated Marlee Matlin for one year, {{and they}} cohabited for two years. In her 2009 {{autobiography}} I'll Scream Later, Matlin claimed that their relationship involved considerable {{drug abuse and}} physical abuse by Hurt. In response to the accusations aired on CNN on April 13, 2009, Hurt's agent declined to respond, but Hurt issued a statement the following day, which said: [...] "My own recollection is that we both apologized and both did {{a great deal to}} heal our lives. Of course, I did and do apologize for any pain I caused. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> both grown. I wish Marlee and her family nothing but good." ...|$|E

[...] That year, he set a record with 5 touchdowns in the game against Carson-Newman. He {{was inducted into the}} Chattanooga Hall of Fame in 1987. Before a game with his alma mater Washington & Jefferson, Chattanooga coach Johnny Spiegel said [...] "I have the greatest fullback playing football today.

I was too concerned for the producers. And I didn't follow my instincts... I'm very proud of {{many aspects of the}} movie. The people were great. But when you sense that there's no governing thought, or that the governing thought is kind of 'Gee, I'm not sure where to go,' you can sense it... My instincts were saying, 'Don't do a big movie'. I had a very strong viewpoint to do the movie, but I didn't expect such huge stars. When the stars came, everything kind of ballooned up... I should have brought it all down and said, 'I'm sorry, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> all these huge stars but I don't care, I want to do something intimate.'

5000|$|However, {{many fans}} have {{stood up for}} Tingle, as well his {{respective}} game series. Criticism of the character primarily comes from Western gamers, but in Japan, Tingle has garnered a cult following, {{which resulted in the}} development of several spin-off games featuring Tingle as their star. In a 2013 interview with VentureBeat, Kensuke Tanabe had expressed interest in making another Tingle game, having stated: “I know that people cannot stand Tingle. But to me that challenge is: Could I take this character that is so reviled in the West and just do a complete turnaround and make him a beloved, fun character? The idea of that really just gets me going. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> made a Tingle game in the past, but maybe at some point down the road. ...” He later joked that “it’s like romance: You meet someone and you’re like, ‘Oh god, I can’t stand that person.’ And then three weeks later, you’re madly in love — it’s that turn, that quick whip, that motivates me a little bit.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 111. Truex {{worked under}} Busch in turn 2 to retake {{the lead on}} lap 130. Jamie McMurray was running 10th when he reported engine issues and started falling back on lap 167. The third caution of the race flew on lap 182 for Larson suffering a right-front tire blowout and slamming the wall in turn 1. He said afterwards that there wasn't much he [...] "could do. I cut the right-front tire down and got in the wall and still had good speed in the race car after that but it just didn’t work out.

5000|$|Forty-four {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}; however, only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Kenseth clinched the fifth pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 28.589 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Ambrose. Edwards qualified third, Biffle took fourth, and Kyle Busch started fifth. Joey Logano, Allmendinger, Newman, Martin Truex, Jr. and Martin rounded out the top ten. The only driver that failed to qualify for the race was Brian Keselowski. Once the qualifying session completed, Kenseth commented, [...] "Qualifying is not my strong suit, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a really fast car today when we did our last qualifying run practice. Honestly, this is the most nervous I've been before qualifying in probably five years at least, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a shot at the pole, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> last week <b>we</b> really messed up.

5000|$|In December 2011 Dr. Albright {{became the}} 11th Director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu welcomed Albright's appointment, saying, [...] "As we work to {{accomplish}} the Department’s unique national security missions and make the critical investments required {{for the future of}} American innovation. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an outstanding partner in Dr. Albright. [...] ". [...] Under Dr. Albright's leadership a number of internal reforms were implemented. Many of these were associated with improved lab-wide planning, budgeting, and communications. Of particular significance were the changes that Dr. Albright implemented at the National Ignition Facility in its governance, and in broadening the scientific approaches and talent applied to achieving the goal of ignition {{after the end of the}} National Ignition Campaign. He also initiated the planning for conducting experiments at NIF with Plutonium. He was instrumental in formulating and then implementing a strategy for the National Ignition Facility that re-emphasized its role in stockpile stewardship. These changes at NIF resulted in much improved relationships with the Department of Energy, the NIF user community,and also resulted in significant advances in ignition science. While at LLNL, Albright argued for science investments in support of stockpile stewardship, and as an advocate for an expanded role in national security for the NNSA Laboratories, Dr. Albright worked with the senior leadership in DoD, DHS, and the Intelligence Community (IC) to successfully bring the Laboratory’s capabilities to important national security missions. He was the first Director of a National Laboratory to visit and meet with the leadership of the IAEA, as well as the combatant commanders at PACOM, SOCOM, SOUTHCOM, CENTCOM, and NORTHCOM.|$|E

What is even more concerning is the downward trend of URL Officers who are attending.
