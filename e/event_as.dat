5|$|In {{his first}} major outing on the world stage, Chambers {{attained}} a new personal best at the 1999 World Championships in Seville, registering a time of 9.97s for third place in the 100m final. This made the 21-year-old the youngest ever World Championships 100m medallist. North Americans dominated the <b>event</b> <b>as</b> Maurice Greene and Bruny Surin took first and second place respectively, with record runs of 9.80s and 9.84s, respectively. The British sprint team Chambers, Gardener, Campbell and Marlon Devonish performed well in the 4×100metres relay <b>event</b> <b>as</b> runners-up {{in a time of}} 37.73s behind the US team led by Greene. World record holder Maurice Greene was hitting his peak, winning three gold medals in Seville. However, at 21 years old, Chambers had achieved more than Greene had at that age: Greene's best was 10.08s in 1996 and he had never reached a major final.|$|E
