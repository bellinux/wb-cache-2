For m 6 = 1, {{this class of}} codes is a subclass of nonlinear <b>codes.</b> Among <b>F</b> q -linear <b>codes,</b> we consider only cyclic codes and call them F q -linear cyclic <b>codes</b> (<b>F</b> q LC <b>codes)</b> over <b>F</b> q m. The class of <b>F</b> q LC <b>codes</b> includes as special cases (i) group cyclic codes over elementary abelian groups (q = p, a prime), (ii) subspace subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes (n = q 1) studied by Hattori, McEliece and Solomon (iii) linear cyclic <b>codes</b> over <b>F</b> q (m= 1) and (iv) twisted BCH codes.

In this correspondence, we obtain transform domain characterization of <b>F</b> q LC <b>codes,</b> using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) over an extension eld of F q m. The characterization is in terms of any decomposition of the code into certain subcodes and linearized polynomials over F q m.

Methods: This study used the claims data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service.

The dependent variable was the occurrence of downward mobility, which was defined as a health insurance status change from National Health Insurance to Medical Aid. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with downward drift of first-episode psychiatric patients. Results: About 10 % of the study population who were National Health Insurance beneficiaries in 2005 became Medical Aid recipients in 2007. The logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, primary diagnosis, type of hospital at first admission, regular use of outpatient clinic, and long-term hospitalization are significant predictors in determining downward drift in newly diagnosed psychiatric patients. Conclusions: This research showed that the downward mobility of psychiatric patients is affected by long-term hospitalization and medical care utilization.

In the present study, we investigated the degree of coherence between these two viewpoints. METHODS: During an 8 -month recruitment period, all consecutive patients admitted to two Italian residential facilities were screened for inclusion. The 24 -item version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded Version (BPRS-E) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were administered within the first 3 days since admission and immediately before discharge. RESULTS: During the study period, 71 patients with psychosis (<b>code</b> <b>F</b> 20 -F 29) and 80 patients without psychosis (<b>code</b> <b>F</b> 30 -F 39 and <b>code</b> <b>F</b> 60 -F 69) were included. In patients with psychosis, no correlation was observed between the BPRS-E total score and the General Severity Index (GSI) score at admission and before discharge. However, statistically significant correlations {{were found between the}} BPRS depression and anxiety subscale and the BSI subscales investigating affective and neurotic dimensions. In patients without psychosis, no correlation was observed between the BPRS-E total score and the GSI score at admission; conversely, at discharge, a statistically significant correlation was found between the BPRS-E total score and the GSI score, and between the BPRS-E depression and anxiety subscale and the BSI subscales investigating affective and neurotic dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported and observer-reported ratings hold different meanings and cannot be considered equivalent. In terms of symptom dimensions, data showed that individuals tend to preserve the ability of measuring/assessing their own affective disturbances, even in the presence of psychotic symptoms, but not the ability of measuring/assessing loss of contact with reality...|$|R
