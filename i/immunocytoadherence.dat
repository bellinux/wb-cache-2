40|$|<b>Immunocytoadherence</b> was {{investigated}} {{as a method}} of detecting active histoplasmosis in two groups of infected New Zealand white rabbits. Yeast-phase Histoplasma capsulatum was given intravenously to one group and intratracheally to the other. There was a striking correlation between the clinical condition of the animals and the number of rosettes seen. This number increased as the infection progressed and decreased as it regressed. The <b>immunocytoadherence</b> technique might be of value in detecting active histoplasmosis, and investigation in humans is warranted...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} Freund's {{complete}} adjuvant on the cellular response in BALB/c mice to SRBC was studied using techniques based on <b>immunocytoadherence</b> (ICA), inhibition of ICA using an antiserum to the theta alloantigen, and immune adherence (IA).

40|$|The rosette-forming cell (RFC) {{response}} of mice immunized with varying doses of Toxoplasma gondii was studied by <b>immunocytoadherence</b> (ICA). The specificity of ICA {{in the present}} system was tested by passive sensitization with hyperimmune serum in vivo and in vitro. A slight increase in RFC was observed with the latter. Prior treatment of spleen cells from immunized animals with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin resulted in total inhibition of ICA. During the primary and the secondary response after 10 days, the number of RFC rose rapidly to reach the peak on the 3 rd day. With secondary immunization 30 days later, the peak shifted to the 2 nd day. Mice infected with a lower dose of Toxoplasma had {{a greater number of}} RFC during the secondary response after 10 days than with a larger dose...|$|E
40|$|The <b>immunocytoadherence</b> (leA) {{test was}} used for the {{detection}} of an immune response in animals with sporotrichosis. Two groups of 12 male Hartley guinea pigs, injected intrascrotally with 4 X 108 viable cells of Sporothrix schenckii and kept in a room at 10 e, developed a localized infection. Rosettes appeared during the acute stage of the infection and disappeared during the healing process. The detection of these circulating, antibody-producing cells indicated that im-munoglobulins had been produced against S. schenckii. These results suggest that the leA test warrants further investigation as a serologic method for the detection of an immunologic response in human sporotrichosis. The serology of sporotrichosis has been investi-gated by various methods. An agglutination test was first used by Widal [1] who made suspensions of spores and observed agglutination in the pres-ence of specific antiserum. However, much auto-agglutination was observed and the test was rarel...|$|E
40|$|The <b>immunocytoadherence</b> (rosette) {{technique}} has been adapted {{to study the}} immune response to varying doses of type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SIII). Syngeneic erythrocytes coated with SIII were incubated with washed spleen cell suspensions isolated 0 · 5 – 39 days after i. v. injection into CBA strain mice of immunogenic (0 · 5 or 5 · 0 μg) or paralysing (500 μg) doses of SIII; the immunizing or paralysing effect of these doses of SIII was confirmed by a passive haemagglutination technique. The number of rosette-forming cells per spleen was significantly increased above the background range in twenty-seven out of forty-two, twenty-four out of thirty-seven and forty-one out of forty-six animals injected with 0 · 5, 5 · 0 and 500 μg SIII, respectively. Not only was there a greater incidence of `positive' values in the paralysed group, but the response was better maintained than in the immunized groups...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{approved}} The echinoderm axial organ {{is located}} centrally, {{at the meeting}} point of the animals ' "circulatory " systems. This, and its unusual histology, have prompted the implication {{of a number of}} different functions for the organ, including circulation, excretion and host defense. None of these have been definitively proven. Claims that starfish axial organ cells respond to antigen in an adaptive manner, resembling the vertebrate antibody response, also remain unconfirmed. The purpose of the work on Strongylocentrotus purpuratus presented in this thesis was to independently test the hypothesis that the cells of the axial organ respond to antigenic challenge. To determine if the cells are modified quantitatively following antigen encounter, the cell types of the organ were first classified according to morphological characteristics. Cell subpopulations were then monitored quantitatively after in vivo exposure to several types of antigens. Axial organ cells were also analyzed for qualitative changes; cells from antigen exposed urchins were assayed for <b>immunocytoadherence</b> to antigen-coate...|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{erythrocytes}} were pretreated with concanavalin A (Con-A-SRC), or glutaraldehyde (G-SRC), {{or specific}} rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG-SRC), or specific rabbit immunoglobulin M and complement (C-SRC). Each erythrocyte type {{was made to}} adhere to rat peritoneal cells and adhesion was measured; binding decreased as follow: conA-SRC greater than IgG-SRC greater than less than G-SRC greater than C-SRC Peritoneal cell-erythrocyte complexes were then submitted to a laminar shear flow, and resistance of binding was assayed. Binging strength decreased in the following order: G-SRC greater than C-SRC greater than IgG-SRC greater than ConA-SRC Cell suspensions were incubated at 37 degrees, and phagocytosis was measured. Ingestion decreased in the following order: G-SRC greater than IgG-SRC greater than C-SRC greater than ConA-SRC It is concluded that: Binding strength may be of importance in triggering phagocytosis; when <b>immunocytoadherence</b> is studied, two independent parameters should be considered: binding and binding strength. This report describes a new method that may allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations of similar binding specificities...|$|E
40|$|Lymphoid cells {{possess a}} variety of macromolecules on their membranes, some of which seem to be {{exclusive}} for a specific population of lymphocytes (1) or particular to a certain stage of their differentiation (2). Several studies, in particular those of Boyse, Old, and their collaborators (2, 3), have been instrumental in identifying many of these different moieties and also have given some indication of their distribution {{on the surface of}} the cells (4, 5). These surface molecules have been identified to a great extent by immunological methods or through reactions involving plant agglutinins. The functions of many of these membrane moieties, which include histocompatibility antigens and other alloantigens such as the thymus leukemia antigen (6), theta isoantigen (1), and the Ly A-B antigens (7), as well as the receptors for plant lectins, are not known at present. Immunoglobulins (Ig) 1 are included among the molecules on lymphocyte membranes. The Ig molecules have been demonstrated directly by the use of immunofluorescence (8 - 10), radioautography (8, 11), or <b>immunocytoadherence</b> tests (12), and have also been labeled while on the membrane with radioactive 125 I (13). Ig molecules are easily detectable only on bone marrowo...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported a newly discovered congenital disorder of neutrophil adhesion, leukocyte adhesion defi-ciency syndrome type 2 (LAD II). The clinical manifesta-tions of this syndrome {{are similar to}} those seen in the classic leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome, now designated type 1 (LAD I), but the two syndromes differ in the molecu-lar basis of their adhesion defects. LAD I is caused by a deficiency in the CD 18 integrin adhesion molecules while LAD II patients are deficient in expression of sialyl-Lewis X (SLe'), a carbohydrate ligand for selecting. In this report we demonstrate that neutrophils from a LAD II patient bind minimally or not at all to recombinant E-selectin, purified platelet P-selectin, or P-selectin expressed on histamine-acti-vated human umbilical vein endothelial cells, but have nor-mal levels of L-selectin and CD 11 b/CD 18 integrin, and ad-here to and migrate across endothelium when CD 11 b/CD 18 is activated. We compare LAD I and LAD II patient neutro-phil function in vitro, demonstrating that integrin and selec-tin adhesion molecules have distinct but interdependent roles in neutrophil adhesion during an inflammatory re-sponse.

40|$|There is now good {{agreement}} that immunoglobulin receptors {{on the surface}} of bone marrow-derived (B) 1 lymphocytes {{play an important role in}} the activation of such lymphocytes by antigen (1 - 3). Antibody-secreting cells are derived through mitosis and differentiation of precursor B cells, and the process of clonal expansion can involve numerous sequential mitoses (4, 5). It thus becomes of interest to ask whether antigen-activated lymphocytes retain surface Ig receptors, and, if so, whether the density of receptors per cell varies with progressive maturation of the clone. Diminution or disappearance of receptor would obviously reduce or abolish the regulatory influence which extracellular antigen could exert on the cell concerned. A number of studies, directly or indirectly related to this question, have given conflicting results. Early work on the phenomenon of <b>immunocytoadherence</b> (6, 7) was predicated on the hypothesis that antibody-forming cells had a coating of their secretory product firmly attached to the cell surface, and substantial evidence for this view has since accumulated (8, 9). On the other hand, work using membrane immunofluorescence has suggested that plasma cells, known to be fully differentiated antibody-secretin...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{echinoderm}} axial organ {{is located}} centrally, {{at the meeting}} point of the animals' "circulatory" systems. This, and its unusual histology, have prompted the implication {{of a number of}} different functions for the organ, including circulation, excretion and host defense. None of these have been definitively proven. Claims that starfish axial organ cells respond to antigen in an adaptive manner, resembling the vertebrate antibody response, also remain unconfirmed. The purpose of the work on Strongylocentrotus purpuratus presented in this thesis was to independently test the hypothesis that the cells of the axial organ respond to antigenic challenge. To determine if the cells are modified quantitatively following antigen encounter, the cell types of the organ were first classified according to morphological characteristics. Cell subpopulations were then monitored quantitatively after in vivo exposure to several types of antigens. Axial organ cells were also analyzed for qualitative changes; cells from antigen exposed urchins were assayed for <b>immunocytoadherence</b> to antigen-coated sheep erythrocytes. The coelomic fluids from the same animals were tested for antigen-specific binding molecules using ELISA assays. <b>Immunocytoadherence</b> and ELISA assays were validated with cells and sera from trout similarly exposed to antigen and control treatments. Eight subpopulations of axial organ cells were identified. Four of the cells types resemble cells found in the coelomic fluid. A possible precursor cell to the red spherule cell was found {{to be a member of}} the axial organ cell population. Changes in the axial organ cell subpopulations after antigen exposure were not significant, regardless of the type of antigen, exposure method or sample time. Cells of the axial organs from TNP-exposed urchins did not bind TNP-SRBC's, and the hemagglutination observed was neither TNP-inhibitable, nor dependent on previous expoure to the TNP antigen. Coelomic fluids from several urchins bound TNP to a greater extent than BSA, but the frequency of binding among urchins was not dependent on their prior treatment. Titrational analysis of one set of urchin coelomic fluids against the hapten, TNP, the carrier, LPS, or an unrelated protein, BSA, revealed identical binding curves with each molecule. This, in addition to a higher titer of binding molecules in the control animals compared to antigen-injected animals, led to the conclusion that the response was nonspecific. The work presented in this thesis does not support the hypotheses that the urchin axial organ cells respond to antigenic challenge either by a modification in cell types present in the organ, or by the production of cell surface or secreted antigen-specific binding molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{administration}} of OKT 3, a second immunoglobulin G 2 a (IgG 2 a) anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), and its isotype switch variant IgA on granulocyte kinetics were compared for 5 hours after the first administration of the mAb. In addition, in vivo and in vitro studies were performed on alterations in expression of CD 11 b and CD 62 L induced by these mAbs. Within 15 minutes after administration OKT 3 and IgG 2 a anti-CD 3 mAbs induced {{a significant decrease in}} circulating granulocytes, whereas IgA anti-CD 3 mAb did not. Apparently the initial decrease in circulating granulocytes depends on the heavy chain of the administered anti-CD 3 mAb, resulting in <b>immunocytoadherence</b> and sequestration in the lungs. Increased adherence to pulmonary endothelium by altered expression of CD 11 b and CD 62 L plays a minor role in this first granulocytopenia, because each mAb exerted the same effects on these adhesion molecules in vitro. The second decrease in granulocyte counts occurred 60 minutes after administration of each mAb and correlated with a significant increase in expression of CD 11 b and CD 62 L in vivo and with upregulation of CD 11 b and down-regulation of CD 62 L in vitro. These alterations could be related to the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha both in vivo and in vitro. Thus granulocyte kinetics from 30 minutes after administration of each anti-CD 3 mAb resemble neutrophil kinetics induced by TNF-alph...|$|E
40|$|The {{yolk sac}} {{is the first}} site of {{hematopoiesis}} in the mammalian embryo. However, {{little is known about}} the initial stem cells in the yolk sac. We have isolated hematopoietic stem cells from early mouse embryonic yolk sac by using a sequential protocol of nonadherence to plastic, density gradient centrifugation, <b>immunocytoadherence,</b> and cell sorting. Isolated, nonadherent, density < 1. 077 -g/cm 3, surface antigen AA 4. 1 +, wheat germ agglutinin bright (WGAbright) cells give rise to multiple lineages, including T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells, as detected by using fetal thymus organ culture, S 17 stromal feeder layers, or methylcellulose culture colony-forming cells, respectively. AA 4. 1 +, WGAbright cells expressed high levels of heat-stable antigen (HSA) and CD 45 (Ly- 5) but did not significantly express major histocompatibility complex antigens, CD 44, or Sca- 1. Peak stem cell concentration is reached by day 11, before stem cells can be found in the liver, omentum, or thymus. In vivo long-term reconstitution of lethally irradiated mice was effected by as few as 720 AA 4. 1 +, WGAbright yolk sac cells, but it required addition of a subset of bone marrow cells capable of providing immediate (short-term) radiation protection. Yolk sac donor-derived T cells, B cells, and macrophages were readily identified 6 months after transfer of yolk sac-derived stem cells. We suggest that, because of their cell surface phenotype as well as their capacity to differentiate in vitro and in vivo, the cells isolated from the mouse embryonic yolk sac may include the most primitive hematopoietic pluripotential stem cells yet identified...|$|E
40|$|The thymic anlagen {{appears in}} Tilapia mossambica at 2 days post {{hatching}} and becomes lymphoid at 5 days. Lymphoid cells were first {{seen in the}} pronephros at 14 days and in the spleen at approximately five weeks of age. Differentiation into red and white pulp regions was seen by 10 weeks of age. Light and electron microscopic studies of adult lymphoid organ revealed increases in size and lymphoid cell numbers. Adult thymus develops a clearer corticomedullary differentiation of thymic corpuscles in the medulla and in the splenic red and white pulp became more distinct. Melanomacrophage centres were seen in spleen and pronephros. Adult fish gave primary and secondary antibody responses following challenge with sheep red bloods cells (SRBC), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and human gamma globulin (HGG). Plaque forming cell and <b>immunocytoadherence</b> assays revealed that head kidney and spleen were major sites for antibody production and development of antigen reactive cells. Proliferative activity in these organs was revealed using autoradiography and scintillation counting. Increased levels of pyroninophilia were also seen following antigenic challenge. Pilot studies on adults revealed that they were capable of rejecting first and second set allografts and leucocytes from spleen and head kidney proliferated in mixed leucocyte cultures. Antibody responses to SRBC, E. coli and HGG develop at about 10 - 12 weeks of age. Fry given either a single injection of SRBC at 10 weeks or two injections of the same antigen at 10 weeks and 12 days later, {{failed to respond to}} a further challenge with SRBC 56 days after the first injection (A time when animals would normally respond positively to this antigen).

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{diagnosis of}} mesothelioma remains difficult despite advances of diagnostic technique. And specific monoclonal antibody (McAb) against mesothelioma {{have not been}} reported. In an attempt to develop mesothelioma specific McAb(s), spleen cells from a mouse immunized with isolated tumor cells were fused to a drug resistant mouse myeloma cell lines. Over 200 hybridomas were assayed for their preferential react ivity with mesothelioma cell lines or mesothelioma tumor biopsy tissues. Two monoclonal antibodies 2 A 3 and 4 E 1 were identified that bound 617 of the mesotheliomas, tested, but did not bind to the majority, 11 / 13 (for 2 A 3) and 12 / 13 (for 4 E 1), of other lung tumor types. Based upon western blot analysis of one and two-dimensional gels and upon the distribution pattern of the antibody recognized molecule in mesotheliomas and non-mesothelioma lung tumors, 2 A 3 binds to the cell adhesion molecule CD 44. While the specificity of 4 E 1 {{has not yet been}} unequivocally established it appears to recognize a variant form of the CD 44 molecule. 悪性中皮腫の診断は困難なことが多く, 特に, 肺の腺癌との鑑別は困難である. また悪性中皮腫に特異的なモノクローナル抗体もいまだ報告されていない. そこで, 悪性中皮腫に特異的モノクローナル抗体の作成を試みた. 悪性中皮腫の新鮮な手術標本から得られた腫瘍細胞で BALB/C マウスを免疫し, 脾細胞を採取した. 同脾細胞をマウスミエローマ細胞と融合し, ハイブリドーマを作成した. 200 以上のハイブリドーマより, 2 つのモノクローナル抗体 2 A 3 と 4 E 1 を 1 次スクリーニングによって選択し, <b>Immunocytoadherence</b> Assay を行った. 2 A 3, 4 E 1 ともに, 悪性中皮腫の継代培養細胞に対して陽性で, 新鮮腫瘍細胞浮遊液に対しては 7 例中 6 例が陽性であった. 初代培養細胞に対しては 2 A 3 が 6 例中 4 例, 4 E 1 が 6 例中 5 例に陽性を示した. 悪性中皮腫以外の腫瘍細胞に対しては大多数が陰性で, 2 A 3 は 13 例中 2 例, 4 E 1 は 13 例中 1 例のみが陽性であった. 2 A 3 と 4 E 1 の標的分子の解析のために Western blot を行ったところ, これら 2 つの抗体が CD 44 のstandard または variant form を認識している可能性が示唆された. さらに, 2 次元の Western blot で 2 A 3 は抗 CD 44 抗体と同じ分子量, 同じ等電点を持つ分子を認識していることが判明した...|$|E
