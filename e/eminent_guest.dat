5|$|All {{the members}} of the cast for the {{production}} were from Britain or the Commonwealth. Later in the season, one of England's few pre-war international opera stars, Eva Turner, appeared as Turandot. For the company's second season, eminent singers from continental Europe were recruited, including Ljuba Welitsch, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Paolo Silveri, Rudolf Schock and Set Svanholm. Other international stars who were willing to re-learn their roles in English for the company in its early years included Kirsten Flagstad and Hans Hotter for The Valkyrie. Nevertheless, even as early as 1948, the opera in English policy was weakening; the company was obliged to present some Wagner performances in German to recruit leading exponents of the main roles. At first Rankl conducted all the productions; he was dismayed when <b>eminent</b> <b>guest</b> conductors including Beecham, Clemens Krauss and Erich Kleiber were later invited for prestige productions. By 1951 Rankl felt that he was no longer valued, and announced his resignation. In Haltrecht's view, the company that Rankl built up from nothing had outgrown him.|$|E

Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire.

Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before.

With him was his brother-in-law, lately come from Canada, a big and rather boisterous young gentleman-farmer, with a yellow beard, by name James Blount. With him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from the neighbouring Roman Church; for the colonel's late wife had been a Catholic, and the children, as is common in such cases, had been trained to follow her. Everything seemed undistinguished about the priest, even down to his name, which was Brown; yet the colonel had always found something companionable about him, and frequently asked him to such family gatherings.|$|E

The Times said: It revealed in Mr. Karl Rankl a musical director {{who knew how to}} conduct opera. It conceded the claims of theatrical production without sacrificing the music. It proved that contrary to expectation English can even now be sung so that the words are intelligible. It confirmed what we knew already {{about the quality of the}} chorus.

5000|$|In {{the next}} three years, Rankl built the company up, reluctantly casting foreign stars when no {{suitable}} British singer could be found, and resisting attempts by Webster to invite <b>eminent</b> <b>guest</b> conductors. When Webster and the Covent Garden board insisted, Rankl took it badly that star conductors such as Erich Kleiber, Clemens Krauss and Beecham were brought into [...] "his" [...] opera house. In a biographical article in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the critic Frank Howes wrote of Rankl: [...] "By 1951 {{he had made the}} Covent Garden Company a going concern, but had also revealed, notably in his 1950 performances of the Ring, his limitations as a conductor - he was considered difficult with singers, orchestras and producers." [...] Rankl was also difficult in his relations with the Opera House's director of productions, Peter Brook, who left after two years. Critics and operagoers did not fail to notice the difference in standards between performances under Rankl and under the guests. Rankl resigned in May 1951, and conducted for the last time at the Royal Opera House on 30 June. The work was Tristan und Isolde with Kirsten Flagstad; as it was announced in advance that this would be her last appearance in the role of Isolde and her farewell performance at Covent Garden, {{the fact that it was}} also Rankl's farewell received little attention. He was never invited to conduct there again, and did not set foot in the building for another 14 years, until 1965 for the first night of Moses und Aron by his old teacher, Schoenberg; the conductor then was Georg Solti. After the end of the 1951 London season, Rankl conducted the Covent Garden company on tour; his final performance with the company was Der Rosenkavalier in Liverpool on 27 July 1951.|$|E
40|$|Critical {{thinking}} with data ” aims to teach undergraduate students {{to review and}} evaluate critically statistical information and arguments, to convince them of the relevance of statistical literacy, and to imbue them with the disposition of an enquiring statistical consultant. We use diverse strategies for engagement and broad content. Our materials are relevant, accessible, rich, interesting and varied; many are taken from the general media and are media rich. Presentation of statistical content is enriched {{through the use of}} <b>eminent</b> <b>guest</b> lecturers, case studies, and many real world examples. We do not rely on mathematics but present multiple perspectives on ideas, concepts and principles. Our abstract building block concepts are first presented through appealing and concrete case studies. Once students grasped the ideas in one context, they generalise these concepts through repeated exposure to manageable open-ended interpretative tasks using on-line and standard assessment tools. We provide illustrations of our approach.
