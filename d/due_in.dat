5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes).

Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E

5|$|After the season, disaffection {{within the}} Southern Conference {{prompted}} seven former members, including Maryland, {{to form the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).

The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to the work delays.|$|E

5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to {{her ideas}} {{about the role of}} a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill.

Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was <b>due</b> <b>in</b> part to fallout from the Watergate scandal.|$|E
