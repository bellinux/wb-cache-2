40|$|The {{ramifications of}} school <b>decline</b> are profoundly serious for the students, staff and {{community}} of a school. School <b>decline</b> is the steady downwards spiral that some schools experience when {{a complex set}} of influences interact with negative and unresolved outcomes. This study explored the largely unresearched area of school <b>decline</b> and developed a set of potential predictors of <b>decline</b> that could assist in understanding, preventing or dealing effectively with school <b>decline</b> in the future. Grounded theory, selected as a methodology appropriate for exploratory research, was used to guide the process of data collection and theory development. Three schools, labeled by agencies and the media as being in serious <b>decline</b> or “failing”, were selected for the study. Adults who were in significant roles in the schools during the <b>decline</b> periods were interviewed about their experiences. As part of the data analysis and interpretation a set of propositions was drafted and was sent to these interviewees and to fourteen educational advisors who work with schools at risk and in <b>decline.</b> The advisors’ feedback on the propositions, analysis of school related documents, Education Review Office reports and Ministry of Education file documents provided rich additional data. The factors associated with the lead up to school <b>decline,</b> and the process of <b>decline,</b> are multilayered, contextual and complex. Each study school’s experience of <b>decline</b> involved a unique combination and order of occurrence of common factors and influences. Many of the issues that predispose schools towards <b>decline</b> are associated with, and are exacerbated by, unethical or unprofessional attitudes or behaviour by individuals, and unprofessional practices within the schools and between neighbouring schools. Once <b>decline</b> begins it escalates and is difficult to stop. This thesis contributes towards the development of a theory of school <b>decline</b> by identifying potential predictors of school <b>decline</b> and by describing how <b>decline</b> begins and escalates. It also identifies factors that are associated with interventions being insufficient or ineffective. The theory of school <b>decline</b> provides insights for school leaders and educational agencies that may assist in the prediction and prevention of school <b>decline</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|Evaluations of {{wildlife}} population dynamics {{have the potential}} to convey valuable information on the type of pressure affecting a population and could help predict future changes in the population 2 ̆ 7 s trajectory. Greater understanding of different patterns of population <b>declines</b> could provide a useful mechanism for assessing <b>decline</b> severity in the wild and identifying those populations that are more likely to exhibit severe <b>declines.</b> We identified 93 incidences of <b>decline</b> within 75 populations of mammalian species using a time-series analysis method. These included linear, quadratic convex (accelerating) <b>declines,</b> exponential concave (decelerating) <b>declines</b> and quadratic concave <b>declines</b> (representing recovering populations). Excluding linear <b>declines</b> left a data set of 85 <b>declines</b> to model the relationship between each decline-curve type and a range of biological, anthropogenic and time-series descriptor explanatory variables. None of the decline-curve types were spatially or phylogenetically clustered. The only characteristic that could be consistently associated with any curve type was the time at which {{they were more likely to}} occur within a time series. Quadratic convex <b>declines</b> were more likely to occur at the start of the time series, while recovering curve shapes (quadratic concave <b>declines)</b> were more likely at the end of the time series. Synthesis and applications. The ability to link certain factors with specific <b>decline</b> dynamics across a number of mammalian populations is useful for management purposes as it provides decision-makers with potential triggers upon which to base their conservation actions. We propose that the identification of quadratic convex <b>declines</b> could be used as an early-warning signal of potentially severe <b>decline</b> dynamics. For such a population, increased population monitoring effort should be deployed to diagnose the cause of its <b>decline</b> and avert possible extinctions. Conversely, the presence of a quadratic concave <b>decline</b> suggests that the population has already undergone a period of serious <b>decline</b> but is now in the process of recovery. Such populations will require different types of conservation actions, focussing on enhancing their chances of recovery...|$|R
40|$|Background. A <b>decline</b> in {{cognitive}} test scores in elderly persons can signal {{the beginning of}} a descent into dementia or may indicate only a short-term cognitive disturbance. It would be clinically useful to distinguish between the two outcomes and to identify characteristics of each. Methods. Four hundred thirty-seven community-dwelling elderly persons were given the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) annually for an average of 7 years. A low score between baseline and final MMSE was identified. A low score 3 or more points lower than baseline score indicated cognitive <b>decline.</b> This <b>decline</b> was called persistent if the final MMSE score was also at least 3 points lower than baseline MMSE score; otherwise, the <b>decline</b> was considered transient. Results. Twenty participants (4. 6 %) experienced a persistent cognitive <b>decline,</b> 67 participants (15. 3 %) experienced a transient cognitive <b>decline.</b> Presence of the apolipoprotein e 4 allele was significantly associated with persistent cognitive <b>decline</b> (age-adjusted odd ratio [OR] 11. 46, p,. 0001) but not with transient cognitive <b>decline</b> (age-adjusted OR 1. 53, p. 219). Incorrect answers on the orientation part of the MMSE at the time of cognitive <b>decline</b> was associated with persistent <b>decline</b> compared to transient <b>decline</b> (age-adjusted OR 3. 58, p. 058).

A number of results stand out: population size preferences differ by geographic proximity: at a global level the majority of respondents favors a (global) population <b>decline,</b> but closer to home one supports a stationary population. Population <b>decline</b> is clearly not always met with fear: 31 percent would like the population to <b>decline</b> at the national level and they generally perceive <b>decline</b> to be accompanied by immaterial welfare gains (improvement environment) as well as material welfare losses (tax increases, economic stagnation).
