In the quarter-final he knocked out 15-time and defending world champion Phil Taylor by 5 sets to 2 to reach his second successive World Championship semi-final. He lost 6-4 to Adrian Lewis in the semi-finals, continuing the trend of players beating Taylor but <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> next match when the event is televised.

2500|$|Doug and Caroline marry, and Caroline is {{revealed}} {{as the author}} of a book entitled My Sister My Love, which is based very obviously on the lives of the Hamiltons and the Palmers, despite the changes of character names. Doug tries to stop Caroline promoting the book, warning her that they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> all <b>their</b> friends, but Caroline ignores him. She even makes plans for a sequel. Caroline discovers that she's pregnant, but also learns that the baby could be born with Down's Syndrome and she opts to have an abortion, later deciding that she can't go through with it. She doesn't tell Doug that she's pregnant, but instead decides to leave him and start life afresh elsewhere. Doug learns about the pregnancy, though, and he chases after Caroline and tells her that he loves her, and that he wants her to have the baby and that he doesn't care if it's handicapped, wanting them all to be together as a family. Caroline agrees to give the marriage another go and Doug buys a fish shop in Melbourne! ...|$|R

50|$|Several New South Wales Rugby League premiership clubs had {{attempted}} to lure Wally Lewis south during the 1980s, including the Bob Fulton coached Manly-Warringah which came closest to contracting him in 1986. However, the QRL, fearing they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> Lewis (easily <b>their</b> biggest star) and possibly his Wynnum-Manly, Qld and Australian teammate Gene Miles to Manly soon after losing Souths players Gary Belcher and Mal Meninga to the Canberra Raiders, blocked the move to Sydney and Lewis stayed with the Seagulls. In 1988, Lewis finally got {{to play in the}} Sydney premiership when he was signed by the Brisbane Broncos as inaugural captain of the side upon their inception in 1988, leading the new club to a 44-10 win over defending NSWRL premiers Manly at Lang Park in their first ever game. Lewis was the Broncos' top try-scorer in their first season and also later had the honor of scoring the club's first hat-trick.|$|R

Among those fooled included a local newspaper, several small-town police officers, and even the Canadian military, which dispatched troops to the Peace Bridge. Although the public concern over the legitimacy of the broadcast was not as great as in 1938, creator Kaye and director Dan Kriegler feared that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs {{as a result of the}} broadcast; Kaye claimed that he actually submitted his resignation, certain that he was going to be fired the next day.

5000|$|By about 1990, the American {{alternative}} medicine industry {{had grown to}} a $27 billion per year, with polls showing 30% of Americans were using it. Moreover, polls showed that Americans made more visits for alternative therapies than {{the total number of}} visits to primary care doctors, and American out-of-pocket spending (non-insurance spending) on {{alternative medicine}} was about equal to spending on biomedical doctors. In 1991, Time magazine ran a cover story, [...] "The New Age of Alternative Medicine: Why New Age Medicine Is Catching On". In 1993, the New England Journal of Medicine reported one in three Americans as using alternative medicine. In 1993, the Public Broadcasting System ran a Bill Moyers special, Healing and the Mind, with Moyers commenting that [...] "...people by the tens of millions are using alternative medicine.

When asked if she has an axe to grind with the Phi Beta sorority, the Dean replies that it’s “just another act of random, senseless violence perpetrated against the underdogs.” At the first competition, a soccer game, Gina is disgusted to see the way that Phi Beta’s Midge (Amelia David) and her peers are being trampled by their competitors, so she gets into the game herself and the other Splitz quickly follow suit. Although the Phi Betas lose the game, they gain an all-girl rock band, who immediately become part of their sorority.|$|E

5000|$|Baum came to {{national}} attention around Halloween 2011, when Joseph Nocera, a columnist at The New York Times, published photographs {{taken at the}} firm's Halloween party the previous year that {{had been sent to}} him by an employee. The employees were dressed like homeless or poor people, and wore signs around their necks saying things like [...] "3rd Party Squatter - I Lost My Home & I Was NEVER Served", a common response to foreclosure proceedings. Another image depicted a row of mock houses identified as [...] "Baum Estates" [...] with foreclosure notices in front, and a third display imagined the death of a Manhattan attorney who had filed a class action suit against the firm. [...] "There is this really cavalier attitude," [...] Nocera quoted his source as saying. [...] "It doesn't matter that people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> homes."

5000|$|Nonverbal content always {{accompanies the}} verbal content of messages. When {{speaking}} about nonverbal communication, Birdwhistell says [...] "it is complementary to (meaning [...] "adds to") rather than redundant with (or repeating of) the verbal behavior". For example, {{if someone is}} talking about the length of an object, they may hold out their hands to give a visual estimate of it. This is reasonably clear in the case of face-to-face communication. As Virginia Satir has pointed out, people cannot help but communicate symbolically (for example, through their clothing or possessions) or through some form of body language. In messages that are conveyed by the telephone, a messenger, or a letter, the situation or context in which the message is sent becomes part of its non-verbal content. For example, if the company has been losing money, and {{in a letter to the}} production division, the front office orders a reorganization of the shipping and receiving departments, this could be construed to mean that some people were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> jobs — unless it were made explicitly clear that this would not occur.|$|E

Guns with Mick Cripps and Nickey Alexander. Robert Stoddard, former The Dogs D'Amour singer, briefly became guitarist for the group, co-writing the song [...] "Nothing to Lose" [...] that appeared on L.A. Guns debut album. Initially, the group were to be called Faster Pussycat (later the name of another band; several of that band's members over the years were also in L.A. Guns) but soon re-adopted the L.A. Guns moniker. After writing material and playing shows, the group signed with PolyGram. Black was soon replaced by former Girl singer Phil Lewis while Kelly Nickels (formerly of Faster Pussycat) was added to the lineup.|$|E

She grew up in Spreenhagen, in Brandenburg, and last lived on Birkenweg 13, in Spreenhagen. [...] "Micki," [...] as her friends called her, was a [...] "small, free-spirited and fun-loving person." [...] She and her friends really [...] "just {{wanted to live in}} peace, without any problems and without being forbidden to do anything," [...] her friend Falko Vogt later explained. During the school year, she had little contact with other students. Instead, during her spare time, she helped in a retirement home in the neighboring village of Grünheide, where she was very popular with senior citizens. She began her Reifenkombinat apprenticeship in 1979. Falko Vogt had been thinking about escaping for a long time. He and Marienetta Jirkowsky met Peter Wiesner together in spring 1980. He, too, had not adjusted to the conditions in East Germany and had applied a number of times for an exit permit to leave the country. When Marienetta Jirkowsky turned 18, the legal age of an adult under East German law, she became engaged to Peter Wiesner. They planned to move in together in the fall of 1980. This decision, however, led to major conflicts with her parents, who were opposed to their relationship, and feared that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>their</b> only child. To prevent this from happening, they succeeded in getting a police order to ban Peter Wiesner from having any contact with their daughter. He was divorced, drank a lot, changed jobs often, prone to violence, and had a history of being in trouble with the police. After that, the three were just waiting for the right moment to leave East Germany. They planned to flee together on the night of 22 November 1980. In preparation for their escape Peter Wiesner created a folding ladder, which consisted of separate pieces, in his apartment.|$|E
