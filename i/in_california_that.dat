5|$|After the {{war with}} Mexico ended, Stone {{returned}} to the Watervliet Arsenal in 1848, again taking up his position as Assistant Ordnance Officer. He then was granted {{a leave of absence}} from the U.S. Army, and proceeded to Europe to study military practices of the armies there for two years. In 1850 he resumed duty at the Watervliet Arsenal briefly, and then was given command of the Ft. Monroe Arsenal into 1851. Later that year Stone was appointed Chief of Ordnance for the Pacific Department, a post he held until 1855, and also began construction of the Benicia Arsenal <b>in</b> <b>California</b> <b>that</b> year. During this time he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant, effective February 26, 1853.|$|E
5|$|Save Our Children was {{the first}} {{organized}} opposition to the gay rights movement, whose beginnings were traced to the Stonewall riots in 1969. The defeat of the ordinance encouraged groups in other cities to attempt to overturn similar laws. In the next year voters in St. Paul, Minnesota, Wichita, Kansas, and Eugene, Oregon overturned ordinances in those cities, sharing {{many of the same}} campaign strategies that were used in Miami. Save Our Children was also involved in Seattle, Washington, where they were unsuccessful, and heavily influenced Proposition 6—a proposed state law <b>in</b> <b>California</b> <b>that</b> would have made the firing of openly gay public school employees mandatory—that was rejected by California voters in 1978.|$|E

5|$|The {{name was}} given to the creek by Spanish explorers in the 18th century, {{although}} there are now many places <b>in</b> <b>California</b> <b>that</b> use the name. Historically, the creek served as the boundary between the Juaneño (Acjachemem) and Gabrieleño (Tongva) Indians. The creek's watershed then became a major portion of the 1842 Rancho Niguel Mexican Land Grant to Juan Avila, later purchased by two American ranchers. Although attempts to use the creek and its watershed as a municipal water source date to the early 20thcentury, the water it provided was of poor quality and erratic occurrence. As a result, the creek became neglected throughout the late part of the century, eventually becoming little more than an open wastewater drain. Despite this general decline, the Aliso Creek watershed still supports some biodiversity, and it remains a popular recreational area.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 election, New York state {{officials}} asserted that Al Franken Inc. {{had failed to}} carry required workers' compensation insurance for employees who assisted him with his comedy and public speaking from 2002 to 2005. Franken paid a $25,000 fine {{to the state of}} New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state's workers' compensation laws. At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business <b>in</b> <b>California</b> <b>that</b> no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E
