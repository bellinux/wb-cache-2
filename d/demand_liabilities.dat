50|$|The SLR is {{determined}} by a percentage of total demand and time liabilities. Time Liabilities refer to the liabilities which the commercial banks are liable to pay to the customers after a certain period mutually agreed upon, and <b>demand</b> <b>liabilities</b> are such deposits of the customers which are payable on demand. An example of time liability is a six month fixed deposit which is not payable on demand but only after six months. An example of demand liability is a deposit maintained in saving account or current account that is payable on demand through a withdrawal form such as a cheque.|$|E

The current SLR is 20.50%. This will be reduced to 20% with effect from 24th June 2017 in line with the changes in RBI Credit Policy.|$|E

40|$|The banking {{sector is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} sectors among the service. Current banking system is {{becoming}} more complex. To evaluate the performance of the banks many models is introduced by various authors, among that CAMELS Model is more popular to evaluate the performance of the banks because it measures the performance of the banks from each parameters like, C -Capital adequacy, A - Asset quality, M - Management quality, E - Earnings ability, L – Liquidity. The performance of the bank is evaluated through Camel Analysis. For this purpose the Secondary Data is collected from the annual report of the Indian bank for a period of 10 years from 2006 - 2007 to 2015 - 16. The tools used for the study is Ratios. The average capital adequacy the ratio of Total Shareholders fund to Total Asset, total asset to Total Shareholders Fund, Total Shareholders Fund to Total deposit is very less in capital value. So the total share holders fund should be increased in order to have better financial soundness.

50|$|The BUS branch banks, emulating their wildcat counterparts, {{injected}} so much {{of their}} own paper money into circulation that they cancelled their regulatory capacity: they could not with impunity demand specie payments from state banks that held public deposits without being presented with their own script for convertibility in return. These precarious economic conditions - a manifestation of “rapid expansion, speculation and wildcat banking” - prevailed in the South and West prior to the Panic, where the economic collapse would be most severe. By July 1818, the Second Bank of the United States had <b>demand</b> <b>liabilities</b> exceeding $22.4 million, whereas its specie fund stood at $2.4 million - a 10:1 ratio and double the 5:1 ratio considered sustainable.|$|E
50|$|In the past, before bank {{reserves}} were greatly weakened, {{the banks}} made tremendous profits firstly by lending out bank notes at interest, {{and later by}} lending “deposits” both of which they had themselves created. But {{as time went on}} these bonanza profits on bank notes and demand deposits became smaller and smaller as the reserve ratios became weaker and weaker, and the banks’ ability to meet their <b>demand</b> <b>liabilities</b> became more and more precarious. Eventually, ruin ensued, both to business and banking not only because operating profits were less but even more because of the havoc played with the value of their capital assets. In the ten years from 1927 to 1937 more than ten thousand banks closed their doors, with enormous losses to the stockholders {{as well as to the}} depositors and the public in general.|$|E

The necessary and sufficient condition is that good risks find it less costly to be negligent and purchase insurance. ...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{banks and}} {{financial}} intermediaries borrow short and lend long. This causes {{a risk of}} negative net worth (and failure, under simplifying assumptions), because the present discounted value of the assets is more volatile {{than that of the}} liabilities. This paper utilizes a new option pricing model for speculative assets whose log price relative is a symmetric stable Paretian random variable. This model is used to empirically evaluate the probability of failure and fair value of deposit insurance as a function of capital-asset ratio for a bank with <b>demand</b> <b>liabilities</b> and longer term, default-risk-free, perfectly marketable assets. The maturities used for the assets range from three months to 30 years (in order to incorporate thrift institutions).

The study employed the liquidity measures of commercial banks, and on that basis the performance in terms of liquidity position was established. The paper used the casual research design as the methodology of the study since the casual design is best suited to determine cause and effects of the phenomenon. This paper utilizes secondary data from National Bank of Commerce (NBC), CRDB and National Microfinance Bank (NMB). The criteria used is total deposit to core funding, liquid asset to <b>demand</b> <b>liabilities</b> and Gross loans to total deposit Tanzania {{for the period of}} ten years, and finally the hypothesis was tested to know whether there is a significant difference in terms of liquidity position by using ANOVA test.

40|$|The narrow banking {{proposal}} {{defining a}} class of safe and liquid assets (generally sovereign Government securities) for investments by weak banks, backed fully by <b>demand</b> <b>liabilities</b> (generally non-interest bearing deposits) has been considered {{as a means of}} deposit protection and a possible solution to the banking problems. The paper seeks to explain the theoretical implications of the proposal and examine its implications for the Indian public sector banks facing large non-performing loans. The evidence presented shows that even without a directive, narrow banking on the asset side is already being practised as part of the asset-liability management by these banks. However, given the structure of deposit ownership, narrow banking in its strict sense does not afford a solution to reforming weak banks. Strictly practiced narrow banking can neither guarantee deposit protection not turn around the weak banks. On the contrary, it may expose weak banks to immense market and interest rate risks which can make the banking system vulnerable to idiosyncratic and systemic risks arising from macroeconomic shocks. The paper however recognises that some contraction in the scale of operations of weak banks seems to be an unavoidable by-product of measures which may be necessary to strengthen weak banks. ...|$|E

50|$|When a {{commercial}} bank loan is extended, new commercial bank money is created if the loan proceeds are issued {{in the form}} of an increase in a customer's demand deposit account (that is, an increase in the bank's <b>demand</b> deposit <b>liability</b> owed to the customer). As a loan is paid back through reductions in the <b>demand</b> deposit <b>liabilities</b> the bank owes to a customer, that commercial bank money disappears from existence. Because loans are continually being issued in a normally functioning economy, the amount of broad money in the economy remains relatively stable. Because of this money creation process by the commercial banks, the money supply of a country is usually a multiple larger than the money issued by the central bank; that multiple was traditionally determined by the reserve requirements and now essentially by other financial ratios (primarily the capital adequacy ratio that limits the overall credit creation of a bank) set by the relevant banking regulators in the jurisdiction.|$|R

40|$|We show that, {{under the}} {{reasonable}} person negligence rule, heterogeneity of potential injurers can {{be sufficient to}} create a <b>demand</b> for <b>liability</b> insurance.

50|$|Note {{that the}} {{underlying}} reason for withdrawals by depositors in the Diamond-Dybvig model is a shift in expectations.

40|$|Axiomatic Cost and Surplus-Sharing The {{equitable}} {{division of}} a joint cost (or a jointly produced output) among agents with different shares or types of output (or input) commodities, is a central theme {{of the theory of}} cooperative games with transferable utility. Ever since Shapley’s seminal contribution in 1953, this question has generated some of the deepest axiomatic results of modern microeconomic theory. More recently, the simpler problem of rationing a single commodity according to a profile of claims (reflecting individual needs, or <b>demands,</b> or <b>liabilities)</b> has been another fertile ground for axiomatic analysis. This rationing model is often called the bankruptcy problem in the literature. This Chapter reviews the normative literature on these two models, and emphasizes their deep structural link via the Additivity axiom for cost sharing: individual cost shares depend additively upon the cost function. Loosely speaking, an additive cost sharing method can be written as the integral of a rationing method, and this representation defines a linear isomorphism between additive cost sharing methods and rationing methods...|$|R
