40|$|Conformational {{activation}} {{increases the}} affinity of integrins to their ligands. On ligand binding, further changes in integrin conformation elicit cellular signalling. Unlike {{any of the}} natural ligands of α 2 β 1 integrin, human echovirus 1 (EV 1) seemed to bind more avidly a ‘closed' than an activated ‘open' form of the α 2 I domain. Furthermore, a mutation <b>E</b> <b>336</b> A in the α 2 subunit, which inactivated α 2 β 1 as a collagen receptor, enhanced α 2 β 1 binding to EV 1. Thus, EV 1 seems to recognize an inactive integrin, and not even the virus binding could trigger the conformational activation of α 2 β 1. This {{was supported by the}} fact that the integrin clustering by EV 1 did not activate the p 38 MAP kinase pathway, a signalling pathway that was shown to be dependent on <b>E</b> <b>336</b> -related conformational changes in α 2 β 1. Furthermore, the mutation <b>E</b> <b>336</b> A did neither prevent EV 1 induced and α 2 β 1 mediated protein kinase C activation nor EV 1 internalization. Thus, in its entry strategy EV 1 seems to rely on the activation of signalling pathways that are dependent on α 2 β 1 clustering, but do not require the conformational regulation of the receptor...|$|E

The transcription of such genes could be controlled in trans by a regulatory gene(s) located within the proximal region of the C 14 CoS deletion. To identify this potential regulatory gene, a microclone library was established from microdissected D and E bands of chromosome 7. Three nonoverlapping microclones (E 305, <b>E</b> <b>336</b> B, and E 453 B) hybridizing with wildtype but not with C 14 CoS/C 14 CoS DNA were isolated. <b>E</b> <b>336</b> B represents a single-copy DNA fragment, whereas E 305 and E 453 B hybridized with 3 and 10 EcoRI DNA restriction fragments, respectively. All fragments map exclusively within the deletion. The microclones hybridized to DNA of viable C 6 H/C 14 CoS deletion heterozygotes but not to DNA of homozygotes for the lethal mutation c 10 R 75 M, which belongs to the same complementation group as c 14 CoS. DNA of v iable homozygous mutant C 62 DSD, which carries a deletion breakpoint proximal to that of c 6 H, hybridized only with E 453 B. This microclone identified 6 EcoRI restriction fragments in C 62 DSD/C 62 DSD DNA. The results demonstrate that of the isolated microclones, E 453 B identifies a locus (D 7 RT 453 B) that maps closest to the hsdr- 1 (hepatocyte-specific developmental regulation) locus, which maps between the proximal breakpoints of deletions c 10 R 75 M and c 62 DSD...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{a number}} of kinetic and spectroscopic studies, the {{chemical}} mechanisms of amine oxidation by flavoenzymes remain widely debated. The mechanisms of by Nmethyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) and tryptophan 2 -monooxygenase (TMO) were probed {{using a combination of}} pH and primary deuterium, solvent, and 15 N kinetic isotope effects. Slow substrates were chosen for these studies; MTOX was characterized with N-methylglycine and TMO was characterized with L-alanine. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects of 7. 2 and 5. 3 were observed for sarcosine oxidation by MTOX and for alanine oxidation by TMO, respectively, independent of the substrate concentration and pH. Monitoring the reduction of flavin spectroscopically revealed no intermediate flavin species with both enzyme-substrate systems. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the 15 N kinetic isotope effects observed with both systems suggest that nitrogen rehybridization and C-H bond cleavage are concerted. These results are consistent with both enzymes utilizing a hydride transfer mechanism for amine oxidation. The role of the iron ligands of tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH) was also investigated. TyrH contains one iron per monomer, which is held by three conserved amino acid residues, two histidines and a glutamate. As a probe of the plasticity of the metal binding site, each of the metal ligands in TyrH was substituted with glutamine, glutamate, or histidine. The resulting proteins were characterized for metal content, catalytic activity, and dopamine binding. The H <b>336</b> <b>E</b> and H <b>336</b> Q enzymes retain substantial catalytic activity.

The position of the charge-transfer absorbance band for the H <b>336</b> <b>E</b> and H <b>336</b> Q enzyme-inhibitor complexes is shifted relative to that of the wild-type enzyme, consistent with the change in the metal ligand.

As variáveis-respostas foram produção de colorantes amarelos, laranjas e vermelhos. Dos resultados obtidos, as variáveis mais significativas ao processo foram concentrações de extrato de levedura e de sacarose. A produção dos colorantes vermelhos foi otimizada, alcançando a produção de 2, 97 UA 490 nm, nas condições 48, 90 e 11, 80 g/L de sacarose e extrato de levedura, respectivamente, 30 °C, pH 4, 5 150 rpm <b>e</b> <b>336</b> horas de cultivo. Nos experimentos em biorreator, o melhor resultado foi obtido na frequência de agitação de 500 rpm e na mudança do pH do meio para 8, 0, após 96 horas de bioprocesso. Ademais, avaliou-se a estabilidade dos colorantes vermelhos presentes no meio fermentado em diferentes condições (pH, temperatura, sais, polímeros e tensoativos). Referente a pH e temperatura, os colorantes vermelhos mostraram-se mais estáveis nas condições alcalinas e a 70 °C. Tanto os sais (NaCl e Na 2 SO 4) quanto os polímeros (PEG 1. 000, 6. 000 e 10. 000 g/mol e NaPA 8. 000 g/mol a 5 e 15 %) e os tensoativos (Tween 20, CTAB e SDS) não causaram perda da cor nas condições avaliadas. Estudos de solubilidade e de coeficiente de partição octanol-água mostraram que os colorantes vermelhos apresentam solubilidade superior em solventes polares e característica mais hidrofílica. Nos estudos de extração, as técnicas avaliadas foram Sistemas Poliméricos de Duas Fases Aquosas (SPDFA) formados pelo sistema PEG/NaPA e Colloidal Gas Aphrons (CGA). Pela primeira técnica, os colorantes vermelhos migraram preferencialmente para a fase PEG. Os polímeros PEG 6. 000 g/mol, na presença de NaCl 0, 1 e 0, 5 M, e PEG 10. 000 g/mol, com Na 2 SO 4 0, 5 M, se destacaram dentre as condições analisadas com coeficiente de partição (K) próximo a 13, em ambos os casos, e seletividade de proteínas (SeP) próximas a 3. Para a técnica de CGA, o CTAB proporcionou os melhores resultados, seguido do Tween 20. Porém, o valor de K foi inferior ao obtido com SPDFA, com um máximo de 5 (CTAB 2 mM/pH 9, 0). Os resultados obtidos demonstram um novo produtor de colorantes naturais, as quais têm potencial de aplicação em diversos segmentos industriais.

There is worldwide {{interest in}} developing research projects involving the production and extraction of natural colorants due to serious safety problems associated with industrial use of synthetic ones. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} production of natural colorants from Penicillium purpurogenum DPUA 1275 by submerged culture (rotatory shaker and bioreactor) besides studying the red colorants extraction. To the production step, initial studies showed that 5 agar mycelial discs, sucrose and yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, and 336 hours of bioprocess promoted the best results. To optimize the colorants production a serie of factorial designs were performed. The independent variables studied were: fermentation time, agitation speed, pH, temperature, sucrose and yeast extract concentration under the responses production of yellow, orange and red colorants. From these results, the most significant variables for the process were sucrose and yeast extract concentration. The red colorants production was optimized achieving 2. 97 UA 490 nm, in the following conditions: 48. 90 and 11. 80 g/L of sucrose and yeast extract, respectively, 30 °C, 4. 5 pH, 150 rev min- 1 and 336 hours of culture. In the experiments performed in bioreactor, the condition that promoted the best results was 500 rpm and pH adjusted for 8. 0 after 96 hours of bioprocess. Furthermore, we evaluated the red colorants stability at different conditions (pH, temperature, salts, polymers and surfactants). Concerning to pH and temperature, the red colorants were more stable under basic conditions and 70 °C; not only the salts (NaCl and Na 2 SO 4) but also the polymers (PEG 1000, 6000 and 10000 g/mol and NaPA 8000 g/mol) and the surfactants (Tween 20, CTAB and SDS) not promoted loss of color upon the conditions evaluated. Studies of red colorants solubility and octanol water coefficient showed that these compounds exhibit a higher solubility in polar solvents and present hydrophilic characteristics. Subsequently, the extraction of red colorant was evaluated through two extraction methods: Polymeric Systems Aqueous Two Phase (ATPS) composed by PEG and NaPA and Colloidal Gas Aphrons (CGA). For the first technique, the red colorant preferentially migrated to the PEG phase. The best results were obtained with PEG 6000 g/mol in the presence of 0. 1 to 0. 5 M NaCl and with PEG 10000 g/mol with 0. 5 M Na 2 SO 4. To both cases the partition coefficient (K) was close to 13 and the Selectivity in terms of proteins (SeP) was close to 3. For the CGA technique, CTAB gave the best results followed by Tween 20. However, the K values were lower than the ones obtained with ATPS with a maximum of 5 in the following condition: CTAB 2 mM/pH 9. 0. For the SeP, the values obtained for both techniques were close. The results above show a new producer of natural colorants which have potential application in various industries.

40|$|In {{order to}} better assess the {{nutritional}} status of forage grasses {{there has been an}} increasing interest in studying the nutrient concentrations present in different parts of plant shoot. The aim of this work was to evaluate the nitrogen and sulphur concentrations in leaf tissues of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu grown in nutrient solutions with combined rates of both nitrogen and sulphur. An experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during the Spring season in Piracicaba-SP, Brazil, using ground quartz as substrate. A fractionated 5 ² factorial design was used, with 13 combinations of nitrogen and sulphur rates in the solutions, in mg L- 1, as follows: 14 and 3. 2; 14 and 32; 14 and 80; 126 and 12. 8; 126 and 64; 210 and 3. 2; 210 and 32; 210 and 80; 336 and 12. 8; 336 and 64; 462 and 3. 2; 462 and 32, and 462 and 80. The experimental units were set in a randomized block design, with four replications. Plants were harvested twice. Emerging leaves, recently expanded lamina and mature lamina were sampled separately at each harvest time. In these three types of tissues the nitrogen concentration was closely related to the nitrogen supply in the solution, whereas the sulphur concentration, N:S ratio and chlorophyll meter (SPAD) readings depended upon the supply of both nitrogen and sulphur. Mature lamina did not relate well to the changing in sulphur supply. To properly assess the nitrogen and sulphur concentrations, N:S ratio and SPAD readings for the Marandu grass, the two recently expanded lamina were the best tissues to indicate the availability of both nitrogen and sulphur in the nutrient solution. Há clara demanda de conhecimento da concentração de nutrientes nos componentes da parte aérea das plantas para subsidiar a avaliação do estado nutricional das gramíneas forrageiras. Para contribuir nessa área, objetivou-se avaliar as concentrações de nitrogênio e enxofre em tecidos foliares da Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu, cultivada em solução nutritiva com doses combinadas de nitrogênio e de enxofre. Foi conduzido um experimento em casa de vegetação no período da primavera, em Piracicaba-SP, empregando sílica como substrato. Utilizou-se um esquema fatorial 5 ² fracionado, com 13 combinações das doses de nitrogênio e enxofre na solução, em mg L- 1 : 14 e 3, 2; 14 e 32; 14 e 80; 126 e 12, 8; 126 e 64; 210 e 3, 2; 210 e 32; 210 <b>e</b> 80; <b>336</b> <b>e</b> 12, 8; <b>336</b> <b>e</b> 64; 462 e 3, 2; 462 e 32 e 462 e 80. As unidades experimentais foram distribuídas segundo o delineamento de blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições. Foram realizados dois cortes nas plantas e, em cada um, foram amostradas as folhas emergentes, as lâminas de folhas recém-expandidas e as lâminas de folhas maduras. Nos três tipos de tecidos amostrados, a concentração de nitrogênio foi estritamente relacionada ao suprimento de nitrogênio, enquanto a concentração de enxofre, a relação N:S e o valor SPAD dependeram do fornecimento tanto de nitrogênio como de enxofre. As lâminas de folhas maduras não refletiram a variação no suprimento de enxofre. Na avaliação das concentrações de nitrogênio e de enxofre, da relação N:S e do valor SPAD no capim-Marandu as lâminas de folhas recém-expandidas foram as melhores indicadoras da disponibilidade de nitrogênio e enxofre no meio de crescimento...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{cavitation}} (damage) has been recently discovered from the Three Gorges turbines, that suggests a complicated inception mechanism involving the boundary-layer K-mode instability triggering cavitation nucleation. As one of the elements, the level of free-stream turbulence increased by wrongly designed guide-plate on the Three Gorges turbines could be a primary concern {{in the sense of}} receptivity and the transient growth of K-mode instability. The investigation focuses on the flow analysis of the on-coming flow influenced by the guide plate in terms of flow structure(s) and turbulence level variation. Firstly, CFD has been performed to obtain the main flow features in the whole turbine passage with more detailed analysis on the free-stream pressure-fluctuations near the lower surface of the guide vanes. The unsteady flow characteristics, especially the pressure fluctuations of low-frequency spectrum have been studied that significantly alternate the turbulence intensities and spectrum in the free-stream flow. The results verify that the addition of the guide-plate increases the free-stream turbulence, particularly contributing to the occurrence of a strongest component of extremely low-frequency pressure-fluctuation (i. <b>e.</b> the 0. <b>336</b> Hz for the case 2 with opening of 16 °). These low-frequency fluctuations readily transmit throughout the entire flow passage of the turbine. An extremely large-scale and united unsteady vortex structure that occupies the whole flow passage of a Francis turbine, has been identified for the first time. That is, a vortex-ring structure triggered by the guide-plate, through the connection of the vortices in the stay-vane and guide-vane channels plus those in the runner channels, further interacts with the helical vortex-rope in the draft tube at part-load conditions (e. g. 16 ° and 30 °), forming such an united giant vortex structure. This extremely large-scale vortex structure is thus responsible for the components of extremely low-frequencies (i. <b>e.,</b> 0. <b>336</b> Hz for 16 °, 0. 15 Hz for 30 °) which have been identified from two part-load conditions. These convincing results have proved how this wrongly designed guide-plate increases the free-stream turbulence by inducing extra unsteadiness with gust-like low-frequency and explained that the flow upstream the cone of draft-tube could affect the cone flow significantly, especially under part-load operation conditions...|$|R

We investigated the accuracy of biomarkers in detecting sputum eosinophilia (≥ 3 %) in different adult asthma phenotypes. Levels of eosinophils in blood and sputum, exhaled nitric oxide fraction (FeNO) and total immunoglobulin (Ig) <b>E</b> from <b>336</b> adult patients, enrolled in three prospective observational clinical trials and recruited at five pulmonology outpatient departments, were analysed. Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) for detecting sputum eosinophilia were calculated and compared between severe and mild, obese and nonobese, atopic and nonatopic and (ex-) smoking and never-smoking asthma patients. Sputum eosinophilia was present in 116 patients (35 %). In the total group the AUC was 0. 83 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 0. 87) for blood eosinophils, 0. 82 (0. 77 - 0. 87) for FeNO and 0. 69 (0. 63 - 0. 75) for total IgE. AUCs were similar for blood eosinophils and FeNO between different phenotypes. Total IgE was less accurate in detecting sputum eosinophilia in atopic and obese patients than in nonatopic and nonobese patients.

O TAL foi realizado estratificando-se as amostras positivas em cruzes. Do total de amostras analisadas, 73 apresentaram resultados positivos, correspondendo a 17, 25 % do total. Nas amostras dos municípios de Buritis e Unaí, 18, 30 % e 16, 96 % dos resultados foram positivos, respectivamente. No município de Unaí, a Associação do Funil foi a comunidade com maior ocorrência da doença, 38, 64 %, enquanto na comunidade do Pico a incidência foi de 16, 30 % e nas outras regiões do município, 12, 5 % dos resultados foram positivos. As amostras da Associação do Funil, com 38, 64 % de resultados positivos, são oriundas de pequenas propriedades, produtoras de até 300 L de leite e que armazenam o produto em latões. É provável, portanto, que o baixo volume de leite, a acidificação, a presença de leite com mamite, e até com colostro, tenham contribuído para o aumento de resultados falso-positivos nessa associação. O programa {{nacional de}} prevenção à brucelose deve ser intensificado nas associações de pequenos produtores de leite e nas propriedades com resultado positivo com três cruzes, uma vez que o programa reduz com maior segurança a ocorrência de resultados falsos-positivos,no entanto, deve-se realizar o teste AAT como confirmatório.

In the samples of the municipalities of Buritis and Unaí, 18. 30 % and 16. 96 % of the results were positive, respectively. In the municipality of Unaí, Associação do Funil was the community with the highest occurrence of the disease, 38. 64 %, while in the community of Pico the incidence was of 16. 30 % and in the other regions of the municipality, 12. 5 % of the results were positive. The samples of Associação do Funil, with 38. 64 % of positive results, are from small farms producing up to 300 L of milk and storing the product in cans.

40|$|India is {{developing}} at an incredible rate. With development, {{there is an}} alarming increase in the demand for energy. But at the same time, we as a nation, have to economize on our energy costs to focus on human developmental needs. It is an undeniable {{fact that we have}} to strive for energy self-sufficiency to stay relevant in the modern times we live in. In such context, the idea of biomass energy becomes very important and relevant. With its inherent advantages of carbon neutrality and sustainability, biomass energy is the way forward for the nation and the world at large. Biomass energy has the potential and the promise of becoming the prime energy source. Though many forms of bioenergy are in focus of many research and development agencies/organizations, harnessing the biomass energy through combustion is the simplest method. In this project, we attempt to analyse and discuss the feasibility and sustainability of this method. We would have to dwell upon the challenges posed by this method and attempt to quell these in a scientific manner. Abundant land and water resources are the major enabler for adoption of biomass energy, as a principle. But in practice, technical variables such as calorific value, ash content, presence of sulphur, greenhouse gas emissions {{play a significant role in}} the actual adoption of biomass as a major source of energy. To study these, we have chosen wastes of six different agriculture based biomass species such as banana (Musa acuminate), coconut (Cocos nucifera), arecanut (Areca catechu), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and palm (Borassus flabellifer). The samples were analysed by proximate and ultimate analyses, and further correlation was established through regression analysis. Proximate analysis showed that the coconut has the highest volatile matter content (i. e., 73 wt. %) and banana has the highest fixed carbon content (i. e., 20 wt. %) which indicated higher calorific values. The determination of calorific values validated the former results. Palm exhibited lowest ash content suggesting no ash related problems during combustion. Ultimate analysis performed on some of the selected species showed high carbon and hydrogen contents in the leaves of coconut and arecanut. Out of some selected biomass ashes tested for their fusion temperatures, rice has the lowest initial deformation temperature (i. e., 938 0 C) which is substantially above the boiling temperature, suggesting that all the selected biomass samples can be used safely for combustion in boilers up to a temperature of 800 0 C. The bulk density of rice husk has been found out to be the highest (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>336.</b> 257 kg/m 3), suggesting facilitation of higher amount of rice husk in the boiler and, economical transportation and handling. An attempt has been made to develop empirical formulae statistically using regression analysis to predict gross calorific value using proximate and ultimate analyses data. The land requirements for energy plantation with selected biomass species were computed and found that approximately 4931, 524, 1757, 814, 3043 and 1146 hectares of land for harvesting banana, coconut, arecanut, palm, wheat and rice biomass species for assuring a perpetual supply of electricity at the rate of 5475 MWh per year for a group of 10 - 12 villages consisting of about 2000 households. Further, from the calculations of fuel requirement it was observed that coal requirement can decrease from 4968. 0 to 4289. 1 t/year and 4968 to 4008. 6 t/year with the increase in biomass content from 0 to 15 % in the briquettes of coal with rice husk and coal with palm leaf respectively which suggests that agricultural biomass wastes can be used in co-firing mode for generation of electricity by substituting a portion of coal...|$|E

Palavras-chave: Hemograma, Bothrops, cÃ£o SUMMARY: The {{aim of this}} study was to {{evaluate}} hemograms of dogs experimentally envenomed with Bothrops alternatus following different therapeutic approaches (specific anti-venom serum, flunixin meglumine and aqueous extract of Curcuma longa). Twelve Mongrel adult dogs were IM inoculated with 0. 3 mg/Kg of venom and treated two hours after venom inoculation. The dogs were divided into three groups (I, II and III) of four animals each. Group I was treated with specific anti-venom serum diluted in 0. 9 % saline which can neutralize 0. 3 mg/Kg of venom. Group II received flunixin meglumine (1, 1 mg/kg, IM) once a day for five days. Group III was treated with aqueous extract of Curcuma longa (10 %) on the skin at the site of venom inoculation, three times a day, for five days. The results showed a significant decrease (p< 0, 05) in the mean values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and packed cell volumes in all groups 168 hours after venom inoculation. The leukograms revelead leukocytosis with neutrophilia (p< 0, 05) 24 hours following venom inoculation. The leukograms revelead leukocytosis with neutrophilia (p< 0, 05) 24 hours following venom inoculation. The mean values of band neutrophils were within the normal ranges, but were increased 30 hours after inoculations in group II, and 24 - 168 hours after inoculation in group III. The leukograms revelead leukocytosis with neutrophilia (p< 0, 05) 24 hours following venom inoculation. The mean values of band neutrophils were within the normal ranges, but were increased 30 hours after inoculations in group II, and 24 - 168 hours after inoculation in group III. The numbers of eosinophils dropped significantly (p< 0, 05) in the three groups between six and 168 hours after venom inoculation. Lymphocytes counts were significantly different for groups I and II, 30 hours after venom inoculation, and for groups I and III, 336 hours following venom inoculation. Monocytosis as observed in all groups 336 hours after venom inoculation. The hemograms of dogs envenomed with B. alternatus and treated with specific anti-venom serum, flunixin meglumine and aqueous extract is characterized by anemia and leukocitosis with neutrophilia.

Genetic analyses have localized 26 qa- 3 mutants at 11 sites on the qa- 3 genetic map on the basis of prototroph frequencies. Certain mutants, <b>e.</b> g., <b>336</b> – 3 – 10 and 336 – 3 – 3, are located at opposite ends of the qa- 3 gene. Data from four-point crosses (qa- 1 S mutant 124 x five different qa- 3 mutants in triple mutants qa- 3, qa- 4, qa- 2) indicate the following orientation of the qa- 3 gene within the qa cluster: qa- 1, qa- 3 mutant 336 – 3 – 10 ("left" end) qa- 3 mutant 336 – 3 – 3 ("right" end), qa- 4, qa- 2. Ultraviolet-induced revertants have been obtained from 14 of the qa- 3 mutants. The revertable mutants fall into two major classes: those that revert by changes either at the same site or at a second site within the qa- 3 gene, and those that revert by unlinked suppressor mutations. The intragenic revertants can be further distinguished by quantative and/or qualitative differences in their quinate dehydrogenase activities. Some revertants with activities either equivalent to or less than wild type produce a thermostable enzyme, and others an enzyme which is thermolabile in vitro at 35 °. A concentration of quinic acid or shikimic acid as low as 50 µm protects the enzyme markedly from heat inactivation.

All the others groups, besides Higgins-Anderson partial hepatectomy (HP) at time T 0, received daily for fourteen days, by intraperitoneal (i. p.) route, one of the following exogenous drug: G 2 got NaCl 0. 9 % (saline) 0. 1 mL/kg,, G 3 receveid w- 3 PUFA 0. 1 g/kg, G 4 TRT 1. 0 mg/kg, G 5 DMSO 3. 3 mg/kg, and G 6 w- 6 PUFA 0. 1 g/kg. In each group, at the time 36 h(T 1), 168 h(T 2) and 336 h(T 3) post-HP, a subgroup of six rats was chosen in a randomized way to complementary hepatectomy (in G 1 a total hepatectomy was performed), when blood and the liver residual posterior lobes were taken to studies and exams. All surgical procedures were performed under inhalatory ether anesthesia. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured in plasma and in liver tissue. Blood concentrations of glucose, total bilirubin, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT,alanine transaminase) were also evaluated as indicators of hepatic damage and organic homeostasis liver-dependent.

40|$|Real estate {{taxation}} {{has been}} intensely debated lately. The main issue concerns {{the formation of}} taxable values based on the current cadastral incomes. More specifically, the point is made against the iniquity that the current surveyed values generate in the fiscal system, thus the necessity of overcoming it. It is known that the iniquity depends on the failed revision of valuation fees (related to the two-year period 1988 - 1989) and on the classification (sometimes still related to the urban cadastral) {{as well as on}} the modalities used to calculate the taxable basis through the multipliers (the IMU ones, particularly). These are the expression of a conventional (and certainly distorting) rate of return procedure which have become tools for the income variation. During the last twenty years, the Government and the Parliament have found the solution to the problem of iniquity in the revision of the current cadastral incomes. Nevertheless, they never managed to start a veritable reform process. In fact, during these years, they have just managed to introduce temporary measures as for instance paragraph 335 <b>e</b> <b>336</b> of article 1 of Law 311 of December 30 th for the revision of the classification of some territorial backgrounds or of some real estate units, thus managing to control the most evident iniquities. Some other norms were approved in order to conduct remote surveys to identify properties which were never listed in the cadastre office. More than once, other possible suitable solutions have been discussed which could have been, with a fast implementation and low use of resources, a first step towards the recovery of an equity of real estate taxation. Unfortunately, these came out to be temporary measures all the same. Last in order and worth of mention is the Ministry of Economic and Finance document by the Finance and Economy Department (hereinafter MEF) named “Ipotesi di revisione del prelievo sugli immobili” (Revision of real estate taxation proposal, August 2013) in which there is a list of all the different kind of interventions on real estate taxation, together with quantitative and qualitative valuations among which the use of the databases of the Observatory of real estate market to update the taxable basis of the Imposta municipale unica (IMU, Municipal one-tax). The solution eventually adopted by the Parliament is an overall revision capable of reforming the entire current cadastral valuation system without resorting to intermediate solutions. In fact, it has recently approved the Enabling Law 23, of 11 th March, containing «Dispositions for a more equal, transparent and growth-oriented fiscal system» in which, in the article 2, a reform of the cadastral valuation system is taken into account. It is important to notice how any contrary vote has been expressed against the Enabling Law’s text while its first reading prior to the vote in the Chamber of Deputies on September 25 th 2013, as well as in the final vote which took place on February 27 th 2014. Only during the first reading and vote in the Senate (February 4 th 2014), 12 contrary votes were registered. These elements show how the awareness of the urgency to restore an equal real estate taxation system is largely spread and accepted. What emerges from the Parliamentary debate is that different political forces are fully aware of the necessity to restore an equal real estate taxation system as well as of the complexity of the reform and its long implementation process. The auspice is to have this system implemented as soon as possible, possibly before a five-year period. About this delicate issue, also the experts in the field and the scientific world of reference have participated in the debate about the necessity of a cadastral reform through several studies. On the one hand, they want to provide empirical proof of the taxation iniquity caused by the current system; on the other hand, they want to propose possible solutions to correct this situation. Among these studies, there is the recent paper by Rocco Curto, Elena Fregonara, Patrizia Semeraro (2014) “Come rendere più eque le rendite catastali in attesa della revisione degli estimi?”(How can land registry values be made fairer pending a review of valuations?) in which a rapid and simple methodology to vary the current real estate rent through corrective coefficients of location is proposed. In this way, the taxable basis on real estate fees is re-defined in order to reduce the current fiscal iniquity caused by the obsolescence of the incomes based on the current cadastre office. However, a temporary correction to implement while waiting for the reform of the entire cadastral system. In particular, in their paper, Curto et al. (2014) propose to multiply the value of the current income by a coefficient obtained as a ratio between the average prices of a given census microzone and a reference index that “the ratio between an index price which most accurately sums up property values in individual municipalities or aggregations of municipalities in the case of the smallest municipalities (determined on the basis of market observations constituting the entire statistical sample) and the corresponding price indices of the values of each Microzone, defined on the basis of market observations (sub-samples) ” (p. 62). In the remainder of the paper, the methodology underlying the hypothesis contained in the MEF’s “Revision of real estate taxation proposal”(August 2013) is explained. Secondly, the methodological differences of corrections of real estate incomes proposed in the cited document by the MEF and in Curto et al. (2014) ’s article are then compared. Subsequently, some empirical proof is supplied relating to the two taxable-basis equity recovery methods. Lastly, further consideration on the effective and generalized implementation of the proposed methods will be made...|$|E

O primeiro experimento foi conduzido em c??maras de crescimento, sob condi????es controladas. As an??lises foram {{realizadas}} com intervalos regulares de tempo de 21 dias, iniciando as coletas no 21 ?? dia ap??s o transplante e ao total foram realizadas seis coletas.

Atrav??s dos resultados obtidos verificou-se que a transforma????o gen??tica desta variedade n??o interferiu de maneira significativano crescimento destas plantas. No segundo experimento, que apresentou objetivo de avaliar o efeito da aplica????o da radia????o UV-C, foram realizados dois ensaios, sendo queas plantas foram cultivadas em casa de vegeta????o, com temperatura e umidade controlada. No primeiro ensaio, a aplica????o da radia????o UV-C foi realizadaapenas uma s?? vez quando as plantas estavam no est??dio vegetativo. No segundo ensaio as plantas foram submetidas a duas doses de radia????o UV-C, com intervalo de 10 dias, iniciando a aplica????o quando as plantas estavam em inicio de est??dio reprodutivo. Aaplica????o durou 2 minutos com uma dose de 0, 5 kJ. m- 2. Foram avaliados: ??ndice de clorofila, fluoresc??ncia da clorofila a e trocas gasosas. No primeiro ensaio as avalia????es foram realizadas ap??s 16, 64, 168 <b>e</b> <b>336</b> horas ap??s a aplica????o da radia????o, e no segundo as 16, 64 e 168 horas ap??s a primeira aplica????o e com o mesmo intervalo ap??s a segunda aplica????o da radia????o. Por interm??dio dos resultados observou-se os gen??tipos apresentaram comportamentos distintos em rela????o os dados da fluoresc??ncia transiente. Contudo a taxa assimilat??ria l??quida foi mais afetada nos gen??tipos transformados e com maior intensidade no segundo ensaio, principalmente ap??s a segunda aplica????o da radia????o UV-C. Dessa forma verificou-se que em ambos os ensaios, a transforma????o gen??tica n??o contribuiu de maneira significativa para proporcionar melhor desempenho nessas condi????es experimentais. No terceiro experimento as plantas foram cultivadas em c??mara de crescimento. Quando estas estavam com 44 dias ap??s a semeadura, no per??odo de indu????o floral, as mesmas foram submetidas ao d??ficit h??drico por cinco dias. Foram avaliados: ??ndice de clorofila, fluoresc??ncia da clorofila a e trocas gasosas e ao final do experimento foram realizadas an??lises simult??neas da deca??da da fluoresc??ncia, reflex??o modulada a 820 nm, teor de prolina nas folhas ??rea foliar e massa seca das partes das plantas. Pode-se verificar que o gen??tipo com superexpress??o da MT-sHSP 23. 6 foi mais eficiente que os demais gen??tipos nas rea????es fotoqu??micas, permitindo que os dados do d??ficit h??drico fossem menores, contudo n??o foi poss??vel evidenciar rela????o da superexpress??o dessa prote??na com os par??metros das trocas gasosas. The objectives {{of this study}} were: a. to compare growth and yield components of Micro-Tom tomato plants with wild plants and transformed plants for different levels of MT-sHSP 23. 6 expression (mitochondrial small heat shock proteins); b. to verify damages caused by UV-C application to photosynthetic activity, in the vegetative and reproductive stages, with the same genotypes previously described; c. to compare the effects of water deficit on photosynthetic activity in Micro-Tom tomato plants with the genotypes reported, {{in the period of}} floral induction. The first experiment was carried out in growth chambers, under controlled conditions. The analyses were performed at regular time intervals of 21 days. Collections started on 21 st day after the transplant, a total of six collections. Leaf area, dry weight of the plants parts, and the number of green and red fruits were determined. From the results obtained we verified that the genetic transformation of this variety did not interfere significantly with these plants growth. In the second experiment that aimed to evaluate the effect of application of UV-C radiation, two trials were performed; the plants were grown in a green house, under controlled temperature and humidity. In the first trial the application of UV-C radiation was performed only once, when the plants were in vegetative stage. In the second trial the plants were exposed to two doses of UV-C radiation, with an interval of ten days, the application began when the plants were starting the reproductive stage. The application lasted two minutes with a dose of 0, 5 kJ. m- 2. Chlorophyll index, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and gas exchanges were evaluated. At the first trial, the evaluations were performed at 16, 64, 168, and 336 hours after the application of the radiation, and in the second trial at 16, 64, and at 168 hours after first application, with the same interval after the second application of radiation. From the results we observed that the genotypes showed different behaviors in relation to the data of transient fluorescence. However, the net assimilation rate was more affected in the transformed genotypes, with greater intensity in the second trial, especially after the second application. We noticed that in both trials genetic transformation did not contributed significantly to provide better performance under these experimental conditions. In the third trial the plants were grown in a growth chamber. Fortyfour days after sowing, in floral induction period, they were submitted to water deficit for five days. Chlorophyll index, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and gas exchanges were evaluated, {{and at the end of}} the experiment we made simultaneous analysis of fluorescence decrease, modulated reflection at 820 nm, proline content in the foliar area, and dry matter of plant parts. We could verify that genotype with over-expression of MT-sHSP 23. 6 was more efficient than the other genotypes in photochemical reactions, allowing that water deficit data were smaller, however it was not possible to identify the relation of the over-expression of these proteins with the parameters of gas exchange...|$|E

We used O:K:H;F serotyping, PCR-based genomic fingerprinting, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), and PCR detection of the three papG alleles and of the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf 1) and aerobactin (aer) gene sequences to characterize the 15 O 4 strains among <b>336</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates from three clinical collections (187 from mixed-source bacteremia, 75 from urosepsis, and 74 from acute cystitis).

Foram sujeitos do estudo pacientes admitidos para interna??o breve entre 1 ? de julho e 31 de agosto de 2008, que tinham a m?nima capacidade ps?quica para {{responder}} os question?rios, com doen?a mental por mais de um m?s e aceitaram participar voluntariamente da pesquisa. Esta se deu em duas etapas: a primeira, no momento de suas altas hospitalares, e a segunda, 30 dias depois. Os protocolos trouxeram perguntas fechadas e investigavam a assist?ncia hospitalar e ambulatorial, com base nas Portarias 224 <b>e</b> <b>336</b> do Minist?rio da Sa?de. A m?dia de idade dos participantes foi de 35 anos, sendo a minoria (31 %) casada ou em uni?o est?vel. Quanto a escolaridade, 87 % dos entrevistados tinham at? o primeiro grau. Quarenta e tr?s por cento dos pacientes fazem tratamento psiqui?trico h? mais de 10 anos e 68 % do total t?m quatro ou mais interna??es pr?vias. O tempo m?dio de interna??o foi de 13 dias. Durante a interna??o, observou-se que todos foram atendidos por m?dico, 45 % foram atendidos por psic?logos, 31 % por assistente social e 25 % tiveram terapia de grupo. A maioria (55 %) dos participantes do estudo n?o teve qualquer tipo de lazer durante a interna??o e aprovou (69 %) o sabor e a variedade da alimenta??o oferecida, bem como a limpeza e organiza??o do hospital (89 %). Os profissionais com a pior avalia??o quanto ao item educa??o foram os recepcionistas e os vigilantes, ambos somaram 10 % de insatisfeitos e muito insatisfeitos nas respostas dos usu?rios. Ap?s a alta, os profissionais mais consultados foram os m?dicos, atendendo 41 % dos entrevistados, seguidos pela terapia de grupo(22 %). Os psic?logos e os assistentes sociais atenderam a apenas 4 % da demanda, cada. Sessenta e dois por cento dos participantes reportaram-se satisfeitos com o relacionamento que t?m com a equipe, mas 30 % se mostrou insatisfeito quanto ao acesso ? assist?ncia e 57 % deles recebem algum benef?cio social. Os resultados mostraram elevado ?ndice de reinterna??o psiqui?trica no munic?pio de Manaus, ?s custas, possivelmente, da aus?ncia de uma rede assistencial especializada eficaz. Tamb?m registrou-se rela??o entre o n?vel t?cnico-profissional dos funcion?rios e a satisfa??o dos usu?rios, ficando os recepcionistas e vigilantes com a pior avalia??o. Verificou-se que, tanto durante a hospitaliza??o quanto no acompanhamento ambulatorial, os pacientes n?o tiveram assist?ncia multiprofissional. Somente o atendimento m?dico foi provido aos pacientes em ambos est?gios de assist?ncia: 100 % para os pacientes internados e 41 % aos pacientes ambulatoriais. Um ter?o dos pacientes desaprovou o acesso aos atendimentos, salientando a dificuldade em marcar consultas e a dist?ncia entre elas. O fato de dois ter?os dos entrevistados receberem algum tipo de benef?cio assistencial (previdenci?rio ou de transporte) sugere rela??o entre a qualidade e quantidade da assist?ncia com o n?mero de benef?cios. Apesar do inadequado acompanhamento intra e extra-hospitalar, 87 % dos participantes recomendariam o centro psiqui?trico a um familiar ou amigo que precisasse de assist?ncia hospitalar em psiquiatria/sa?de mental, reconhecendo o papel do CPER neste momento de transi??o do modelo hospitaloc?ntrico para um modelo substitutivo de assist?ncia em sa?de mental em Manaus. The study s {{objective was}} to evaluate both inpatient and outpatient mental health care throughout the public health system {{in the city of}} Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil, from the user s perspective of the assistance provided by the main psyquiatric hospital in the city. The subjects of this prospective, exploratory and quantitative study were patients admitted to brief psychiatric hospitalization between july the 1 st and august the 31 st of 2008, who were mentally able to answer the questionnaires, with mental illness {{for more than a month}} and willing to participating. The research happened in two different stages: upon their releases from hospital and 30 (thirty) days afterwards. The protocols consisted of closed questions concerning inpatient and outpatient mental health assistance, based on the legal regulations: Portaria 224 /MS and Portaria 336 /MS. The average age of the participants was 35 years old. The least of them (31 %) were married and women (59 %) lightly prevailed over men. As to schooling, 87 % of the interviewed have never gone to high school. Forty three percent of the patients were undertaking psychiatric treatment for over 10 years and 68 % of the total has 4 hospitalizations or more. The average hospitalization period was 13 days. Patients got to the hospital by themselves in 48 % of the times, followed by the public emergency mobile transport (31 %). All patients were consulted by a physician during hospitalization, while 45 % were attended by a psychologist, 31 % by social worker and 25 % had group therapy. Most of the participants (55 %) had no leisure and approved of the flavor and variety of food (69 %), as well as the cleaning and organization of the hospital (89 %). Receptionists and security personnel were the professionals worse evaluated concerning how polite they were, adding, each, 10 % of unsatisfied and very unsatisfied answers. The professionals who consulted more frequently the outpatients were the physicians (41 %), followed by group therapy (22 %). Technicians who consulted fewer patients were both psychologists and social workers, who attended 4 % of outpatients, each one. No participant had home care. Sixty two percent reported being satisfied with the relationship between them and mental health care staff, 30 % of the patients complained about the access to mental health assistance and 57 % received a social benefit. Those results showed high index of psychiatric readmission, possibly due to the absence of a mental health assistance network in the city. It was also registered direct relationship between the technical level of the staff and user s satisfaction concerning their education. It was found that both inpatients and outpatients did not have multiprofessional assistance. One third of the patients disapproved of the access to hospital care, mainly because of the difficulties on getting consulted. The fact that almost two thirds of the patients were receiving any sort of social benefic could be a result of the failure of adequate mental health care. Although inpatient and outpatient were not receiving quality and quantity adequate assistance, 87 % of them would recommend the psychiatric hospital to a relative or a friend, thus recognizing its role in the transition process from a hospital-focused mental health care and a substitute one...|$|E

Chem. 262, 5944 - 5946] we {{have shown}} that fibrin(ogen) chain fragment A alpha-(148 - 160) contains a site {{that contributes to the}} acceleration of Glu-plasminogen activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). In contrast with fibrin, this peptide, however, does not enhance the rate of mini-plasminogen activation. Therefore, possibly more stimulatory sites than A alpha-(148 - 160) are present in fibrin. In the present investigation we have localized a possible second type of stimulatory site in the fibrin(ogen) molecule. A whole CNBr digest of fibrinogen was applied to a Bio-Gel P- 2 column run in water, pH 4. Two peaks with stimulatory activity were observed, one at the void volume and one between the void volume and the total volume. The former contained the previously described stimulating fragment FCB- 2 [which comprises A alpha-(148 - 160) ]; the latter had not been observed before and was characterized further. The stimulating material in the low-M(r) fraction of the Bio-Gel P- 2 column was precipitated at pH 8. 3 in a virtually pure form. It has a high tryptophan content, and an M(r) of 6500 as assessed by SDS/PAGE. On reduction, a main band of M(r) 2500 is seen, plus a weakly staining band of M(r) 4000. These properties plus the amino acid sequence data identify the fragment as FCB- 5. FCB- 5 consists of two chains, i. <b>e.</b> gamma-(311 - <b>336)</b> and gamma-(337 - 379), linked by a single disulphide bond between Cys-gamma- 326 and Cys-gamma- 339. Both these chains and the disulphide bond appear to be essential for rate enhancement. FCB- 5 enhances the activation rates of Glu-, mini- and micro-plasminogen, with all five kringles, only kringle V and without kringles respectively. FCB- 5 binds t-PA, but none of the plasminogen forms binds to FCB- 5. This indicates that the rate enhancements induced by FCB- 5 are due to an effect on t-PA...|$|R

Foi utilizado o delineamento em blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições. Os tratamentos foram dispostos em esquema fatorial, envolvendo duas espécies de braquiária (Brachiaria brizantha e B. decumbens), seis doses de fluazifop-pbutil (0; 7, 81; 15, 62; 31, 25; 62, 50; e 125, 00 g ha- 1), mais o monocultivo de ambas as culturas. O feijoeiro foi plantado a 0, 5 m entre linhas, com as sementes de braquiária sendo semeadas nas mesmas fileiras do feijão. Nos sistemas consorciados, além das doses de fluazifop-pbutil, utilizou-se {{fomesafen}} (125 g ha- 1) <b>e</b> bentazon (<b>336</b> g ha- 1). Para o feijão solteiro foi utilizada uma mistura dos herbicidas fomesafen (125 g ha- 1) e fluazifop-p-butil (100 g ha- 1). Foram avaliados o estande final de plantas e o rendimento de grãos do feijoeiro com seus componentes primários. Os dados foram submetidos à analise de variância, sendo os efeitos das espécies de braquiária e das safras estudados pelo teste F, e os efeitos das doses de fluazifop-p-butil, por análise de regressão. Conclui-se que B. decumbens é mais competitiva com o feijão que B. hrizantha. Na safra da seca, a utilização de 7, 81 g ha- 1 de fluazifop-p-butil no consórcio com B. decumbens proporciona rendimento de grãos de feijão equivalente ao do monocultivo. O consórcio com B. brizantha dispensa o uso do herbicida. Na safra das águas, independentemente da espécie de braquiária, é necessária a aplicação de 31, 25 g ha- 1 de fluazifop-p-butil. To {{evaluate the}} effect of fluazifop-p-butyl doses {{on the performance of}} bean intercropped with brachiaria species, an experiment was conducted in Coimbra, MG, during the 2007 dry season and 2007 - 2008 rainy season crops. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. The treatments were set up in a factorial design, involving two species of grass (Brachiaria brizantha and B. decumbens), six doses of fluazifop-p-butyl (0, 7. 81, 15. 62, 31. 25, 62. 50, and 125. 00 g ha- 1), plus the monoculture of both cultures. The common bean plant was planted at 0. 5 m between rows, with the brachiaria seeds being sown in the same row of the bean plant. In the intercropping systems, in addition to fluazifop-p-butyl, fomesafen (125 g ha- 1) and bentazon (336 g ha- 1) were used. A mixture of fomesafen (125 g ha- 1) and fluazifop-p-butyl (100 g ha- 1) was applied to the monoculture bean. The final plant stand and the bean yield were evaluated with the primary components. Data were submitted to analysis of variance; the effects of the brachiaria species and the crop were studied by the F test and the effects of the fluazifop-p-butyl doses, by regression analysis. It was concluded that B. decumbens is more competitive with the beans than B. brizantha. In the dry season, the use of 7. 81 g ha- 1 of fluazifop-p-butyl in the intercropping with B. decumbens provides a bean yield equivalent to that of the monoculture.

In this study, we examined the phosphorylation and internalization of full-length AT(1 A) receptors and compared this to receptors with truncations and mutations of the carboxyl terminus. Epitope-tagged full-length AT(1 A) receptors, when transiently transfected in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) -K 1 cells, displayed a basal level of phosphorylation that was significantly enhanced by angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulation. Phosphorylation of AT(1 A) receptors was progressively reduced by serial truncation of the carboxyl terminus, and truncation to Lys(325), which removed the last 34 amino acids, almost completely inhibited Ang II-stimulated P- 32 incorporation into the AT(1 A) receptor. To investigate the correlation between receptor phosphorylation and endocytosis, an epitope-tagged mutant receptor was produced, in which the carboxyl-terminal residues, Thr(332), Ser(335), Thr(336), and Ser(338), previously identified as important for receptor internalization, were substituted with alanine. Compared with the wild-type receptor, this mutant displayed a clear reduction in Ang II-stimulated phosphorylation. Such a correlation was further strengthened by the novel observation that the Ang II peptide antagonist, Sar(1) Ile(8) -Ang II, which paradoxically causes internalization of wild-type AT(1 A) receptors, also promoted their phosphorylation. In an attempt to directly relate phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus to endocytosis, the internalization kinetics of wild-type AT(1 A) receptors and receptors mutated within the Thr(332) -Ser(338) region were compared. The four putative phosphorylation sites (Thr(332), Ser(335), Thr(336), and Ser(338)) were substituted with either neutral [alanine (A) ] or acidic amino acids [glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) ], the former to prevent phosphorylation and the latter to reproduce the acidic charge created by phosphorylation. Wildtype AT(1 A) receptors, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, rapidly internalized after Ang II stimulation [t(1 / 2) 2. 3 min; maximal level of internalization (Y-max) 78. 2 %], as did mutant receptors carrying single acidic substitutions (T 332 E, t(1 / 2) 2. 7 min, Y-max 76. 3 %; S 335 D, t(1 / 2) 2. 4 min, Y-max 76. 7 %; T <b>336</b> <b>E,</b> t(1 / 2) 2. 5 min, Y-max 78. 2 %; S 338 D, t(1 / 2) 2. 6 min, Y-max 78. 4 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Conduziu-se este estudo, com o objetivo de avaliar os efeitos de doses de adubos fosfatados sobre a cultura da soja e do milho, em cultivos sucessivos. O experimento foi realizado em casa de vegetação da UFGD, em vasos contendo amostras de 5, 5 dm³ de um Latossolo Vermelho Distroférrico argiloso, sendo utilizado como fontes de fósforo (P) o superfosfato triplo (SFT) e o fosfato natural de Arad (FNA). O FNA foi utilizado sob duas formas. Em uma, considerou-se o P total (Arad T) e, em outra, apenas a fração de P solúvel em ácido cítrico a 2 % (Arad SA), resultando em três fatores de estudo, cada um em seis níveis de P (0, 56, 112, 224, <b>336</b> <b>e</b> 560), expressos em mg dm- 3. A soja foi semeada em dezembro de 2006 e ao final do ciclo, efetuou-se a colheita, avaliando-se a produtividade de grãos, teores de P na folha e no solo. Após o cultivo da soja, semeou-se o milho, cuja colheita das plantas ocorreu aos 76 dias após a semeadura, sendo avaliados a produção de massa seca da parte aérea e teores de P na folha. O índice de eficiência agronômica foi calculado para ambas as culturas. Conclui-se que, para o primeiro cultivo (soja), o SFT apresentou um melhor desempenho no que se refere à produtividade de grãos, quando comparado ao FNA. No cultivo do milho em sucessão a soja, o FNA tendeu a equiparar-se ao SFT nos atributos avaliados. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of phosphate fertilizer rates on soybean and corn crops, in crop rotation. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse at the Grande Dourados University, in pots with samples of 5. 5 dm³ clayey Dystropherric Red Latosol, where the triple superphosphate (TSP) and the Arad rock phosphate (ARP) were used as P source. Two kinds of ARP were used. In one, the total P (Arad T) was considered while in the other, only the P soluble fraction in citric acid at the concentration of 2 % (Arad SA) was considered, resulting in three factors of study, each with six levels of P (0, 56, 112, 224, 336, and 560 mg dm- 3). The soybean was sowed in December 2006 and in the end of the cycle, the crop was harvested and evaluated for grain yield, P concentration in leaves and in the soil. After the soybean crop, it was turn for the corn sowing, which harvest occurred 76 days after sowing. The shoot dry matter and P concentrations in leaves were evaluated. The Index of Agronomic Efficiency was calculated for both crops. We concluded that the TSP caused a better soybean grain yield, when compared to the ARP. In the corn crop succeeding the soybean crop, the ARP tended to be similar to the TSP values in the attributes evaluated...|$|R
