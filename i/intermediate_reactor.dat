40|$|To date, {{there has}} been no {{comprehensive}} attempt to perform and/or describe catalytic reactions in the gas phase that utilize metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts. In addition, {{there has been}} no attempt to reaction engineer these MOF catalysts in order to determine their regimes of optimal catalytic activity and possible limitations to their use. A zinc-based MOF that has been post-synthetically modified with a homogeneous palladium catalyst, Pd(CH 3 CN) 2 Cl 2, is used to catalyze the hydrogenation of propylene. The catalyst is assembled in a packed-bed reactor under a continuous flow of reactants. The reaction is optimized with respect to isoreticular metalation, reactant flow rate, and reactor temperature. Maximum catalytic conversion is found at intermediate metalations of 40 % and 60 %, high hydrogen flow of 50 ccm, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>reactor</b> temperatures of 100 °C and 150 °C. The MOF- 60 catalyst is exposed to a traditional catalyst poison, carbon monoxide (CO). It is found that the MOF is reversibly poisoned upon introduction of CO. Upon poisoning, catalytic conversions rates of 90 %- 100 % are dramatically reduced to less than 10 %- 30 %, depending on the CO flow rate and the reactor temperature. The CO poisoning is shown to be reversible, a similar effect as found with palladium on carbon (Pd/C). The time scale of poisoning and recovery is very fast for both the MOF catalyst and Pd/C (approximately 10 - 30 seconds). Other effects of temperature on the MOF- 40 are also investigated. At fixed reactant flow, the temperature grid is partitioned into finer steps of 10 °C to determine the temperature that yields the highest catalytic conversion. It is found that conversion is nearly uniform in the range between the highest conversions, i. e., conversion plateaus between the optimum temperatures. The catalyst also exhibits a weak thermal hysteresis. There is no significant improvement in conversion with thermal cycling after alternating the reactor temperature between 100 °C and 200 °C for 8 hours...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{review the}} {{potential}} of long and <b>intermediate</b> baseline <b>reactor</b> neutrino experiments in measuring the mass and mixing parameters. The KamLAND experiment can measure the solar mass squared difference very precisely. However {{it is not at}} the ideal baseline for measuring the solar neutrino mixing angle.

The first results from the KamLAND experiment in Japan [1] has showed that the electron antineutrinos undergo flavor oscillations on their way from their source to the detector.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} pyrolysis technologies, focusing on reactor designs and companies commercializing these technologies. The renewed interest in pyrolysis {{is driven by the}} potential to convert lignocellulosic materials into bio-oil and biochar and the use of these intermediates for the production of biofuels, biochemicals, and engineered biochars for environmental services. This review presents slow, intermediate, fast, and microwave pyrolysis as complementary technologies that share some commonalities in their designs. While slow pyrolysis technologies (traditional carbonization kilns) use wood trunks to produce char chunks for cooking, fast pyrolysis systems process small particles to maximize bio-oil yield. The realization of the environmental issues {{associated with the use of}} carbonization technologies and the technical difficulties of operating fast pyrolysis reactors using sand as the heating medium and large volumes of carrier gas, as well as the problems with refining the resulting highly oxygenated oils, are forcing the thermochemical conversion community to rethink the design and use of these <b>reactors.</b> <b>Intermediate</b> pyrolysis <b>reactors</b> (also known as converters) offer opportunities for the large-scale balanced production of char and bio-oil.

The current practice for the disposal of this waste is either by land-spreading, land-filling or incineration which are unsustainable. This work has explored the intermediate pyrolysis of pre-conditioned de-inking sludge pellets in a recently patented 20 kg/h <b>intermediate</b> pyrolysis <b>reactor</b> (The Pyroformer). The reactor is essentially two co-axial screws which are configured {{in such a way}} as to circulate solids within the reactor and thus facilitate in the cracking of tars. The potential application of using the volatile organic vapours and permanent gases evolved would be to generate both combined heat and power (CHP) located at paper making sites. The results show that de-inking sludge could be successfully pyrolysed and the organic vapours produced were composed of a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds and some fatty acid methyl esters as detected by liquid GC-MS. The calorific value of the oil after condensing was between 36 and 37 MJ/kg and the liquid fuel properties were also determined, permanent gases were detected by a GC-TCD and were composed of approximately 24 % CO, 6 % CH and 70 % CO (v/v%). The solid residue from pyrolysis also contained a small residual calorific value, and was largely composed of mainly calcium based inert metal oxides. The application of applying intermediate pyrolysis to de-inking sludge for both CHP production and waste reduction is in principle a feasible technology which could be applied at secondary fibre paper mills. © 2013 Elsevier B.

The main aim of this thesis is to investigate the pyrolytic behaviour and kinetics of Chlorella vulgaris, a green microalga. Under pyrolysis conditions, these microalgae show their comparable capabilities to terrestrial biomass for energy and chemicals production. Also, the evidence from a preliminary pyrolysis by the <b>intermediate</b> pilot-scale <b>reactor</b> supports the applicability of these microalgae in the existing pyrolysis reactor. Thermal decomposition of Chlorella vulgaris occurs {{in a wide range}} of temperature (200 - 550 °C) with multi-step reactions. To evaluate the kinetic parameters of their pyrolysis process, two approaches which are isothermal and non-isothermal experiments are applied in this work. New developed Pyrolysis-Mass Spectrometry (Py-MS) technique has the potential for isothermal measurements with a short run time and small sample size requirement. The equipment and procedure are assessed by the kinetic evaluation of thermal decomposition of polyethylene and lignocellulosic derived materials (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). In the case of non-isothermal experiment, Thermogravimetry- Mass Spectrometry (TG-MS) technique is used in this work. Evolved gas analysis provides the information on the evolution of volatiles and these data lead to a multi-component model. Triplet kinetic values (apparent activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and apparent reaction order) from isothermal experiment are 57 (kJ/mol), 5. 32 (logA, min- 1), 1. 21 - 1. 45; 9 (kJ/mol), 1. 75 (logA, min- 1), 1. 45 and 40 (kJ/mol), 3. 88 (logA, min- 1), 1. 45 - 1. 15 for low, middle and high temperature region, respectively. The kinetic parameters from non-isothermal experiment are varied depending on the different fractions in algal biomass when the range of apparent activation energies are 73 - 207 (kJ/mol); pre-exponential factor are 5 - 16 (logA, min- 1); and apparent reaction orders are 1. 32 – 2. 00.

40|$|The brewing {{process is}} an energy {{intensive}} process that uses {{large quantities of}} heat and electricity. To produce this energy requires a high, mainly fossil fuel consumption {{and the cost of}} this is increasing each year due to rising fuel costs. One of the main by-products from the brewing process is Brewers Spent Grain (BSG), an organic residue with very high moisture content. It is widely available each year and is often given away as cattle feed or disposed of to landfill as waste. Currently these methods of disposal are also costly to the brewing process. The focus of this work was to investigate the energy potential of BSG via pyrolysis, gasification and catalytic steam reforming, in order to produce a tar-free useable fuel gas that can be combusted in a CHP plant to develop heat and electricity. The heat and electricity can either be used on site or exported. The first stage of this work was the drying and pre-treatment of BSG followed by characterisation to determine its basic composition and structure so it can be evaluated for its usefulness as a fuel. A thorough analysis of the characterisation results helps to better understand the thermal behaviour of BSG feedstock so it can be evaluated as a fuel when subjected to thermal conversion processes either by pyrolysis or gasification. The second stage was thermochemical conversion of the feedstock. Gasification of BSG was explored in a fixed bed downdraft gasifier unit.

The method, which involves the two-step reaction of low-grade titanium slag with molten NaOH without the introduction of additives, can significantly reduce the extent of caking. The NaOH and low-grade titanium slag mixture was first reacted at 350 degrees C for 60 min. The temperature was then increased to 550 degrees C in 40 min. Finally, the mixture was reacted at 550 degrees C for 75 min. The effects of the reaction temperatures. NaOH-to-slag mass ratio and the reaction time on the titanium extraction were investigated. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and apparent density were used to characterize the extent of caking. In the low grade titanium slag, silicate phase prior to pseudobrookite phase reacts with molten NaOH at 350 degrees C in the process of two-step molten reaction and formed sodium silicate. Microstructural and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption results show that the firstly formed sodium silicate did not diffuse into the entire reaction system and powder-shaped intermediate product was formed. Approximately 97 % of titanium in the titanium slag could be extracted under the optimal reaction conditions. In addition, the content of TiO 2 obtained in the product reached 99. 3 %.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the ASME/DOE Gen IV Task 7 Part I is to review the current {{experience}} on various high temperature <b>reactor</b> <b>intermediate</b> heat exchanger (IHX) concepts. There are several different IHX concepts that could be envisioned for HTR/VHTR applications {{in a range of}} temperature from 850 C to 950 C. The concepts that will be primarily discussed herein are: (1) Tubular Helical Coil Heat Exchanger (THCHE); (2) Plate-Stamped Heat Exchanger (PSHE); (3) Plate-Fin Heat Exchanger (PFHE); and (4) Plate-Machined Heat Exchanger (PMHE). The primary coolant of the NGNP is potentially subject to radioactive contamination by the core as well as contamination from the secondary loop fluid. To isolate the radioactivity to minimize radiation doses to personnel, and protect the primary circuit from contamination, intermediate heat exchangers (IHXs) have been proposed as a means for separating the primary circuit of the NGNP (Next Generation Nuclear Plant) or other process heat application from the remainder of the plant. This task will first review the different concepts of IHX that could be envisioned for HTR/VHTR applications in a range of temperature from 850 to 950 C. This will cover shell-and-tube and compact designs (including the platefin concept). The review will then discuss the maturity of the concepts in terms of design, fabricability and component testing (or feedback from experience when applicable). Particular attention will be paid to the feasibility of developing the IHX concepts for the NGNP with operation expected in 2018 - 2021. This report will also discuss material candidates for IHX applications and will discuss specific issues {{that will have to be}} addressed in the context of the HTR design (thermal aging, corrosion, creep, creep-fatigue, etc). Particular attention will be paid to specific issues associated with operation at the upper end of the creep regime...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the biodegradation of complex hydrocarbon wastes, with emphasis on chlorinated aromatic compounds, in an anaerobic/aerobic bioprocess environment was made. A reactor configuration was developed consisting of linked anaerobic and aerobic reactors which served {{as the model for}} a proposed bioremediation strategy targeting subterranean soil/sediment/aquifer chlorinated phenol-contaminated environments. Here oxygen is frequently limited and sulphate is readily available, as occurs especially in marine sediment and intertidal habitats. In the anaerobic system the successful transformation and mobilization of the model contaminant, 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol, was shown to rely on reductive dechlorination by a sulphate-reducing dependent dechlororespiring co-culture. This was followed in the aerobic system by degradation of the pollutant and its metabolites, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, 4 -chlorophenol and phenol, by immobilized white-rot fungi. The strategy was initially investigated separately in laboratory bench- and <b>intermediate</b> scale <b>reactors</b> whereafter reactors were linked to simulate the integrated biodegradation strategy. The application of the fungal reactor to treat an actual waste stream by degrading complex mixtures of hydrocarbons in a waste oil recycling effluent was also investigated. The mineralization of phenol and 2, 4, 6 -TCP by immobilized fungal cultures was studied in pinewood chip and foam glass bead-packed trickling reactors. The reactors were operated in sequencing batch format. Removal efficiency increased over time and elevated influent phenol and TCP (800 and 85 mg. L⁻¹) concentrations were degraded by > 98 % in 24 – 30 h batch cycles. Comparable performance between the packing materials was shown. Uptake by the packing was negligible and stripping of compounds induced by aeration had a minimal effect on biodegradation efficiency. Reactor performances are discussed in relation to sequencing batch operation and nutrient requirements necessary to sustain fungal activity in inert vs. organic material packed systems. It was shown that a co-culture consisting of sulphate-reducing and dechlororespiring bacteria established in fed-batch and soil flasks, as well as pine chip-packed fluidized bed reactors. Results showed reductive dechlorination of 2, 4, 6 -TCP to be in strict dependence on the activity of the sulphate-reducing population, sulphate and lactate concentrations. Transformation to 2, 4 -DCP, 4 -CP and phenol was enhanced in sulphate deficient conditions. Dechlororespiring activity was found to be dependent on the fermentative activity of sulphate-reducing bacteria, and the culture was also shown to mobilize and dechlorinate TCP in soils contaminated with the pollutant. Linking the systems achieved degradation of the compound by > 99 % through fungal mineralization of metabolites produced in the dechlororespiring stage of the system. pH correction to the anaerobic reactor was found to be necessary since acidic effluent from the fungal reactor inhibited sulphate reduction and dechlorination. The fungal reactor system was evaluated at intermediate-scale using a complex waste oil recycling effluent. Substantial COD reduction (> 96 % in 48 h batch cycles) and removal of specific effluent hydrocarbon components was shown in diluted, undiluted (COD > 37 g. L⁻¹) and 2, 4, 6 -TCP-spiked effluents. Industrial application of the fungal reactor was evaluated in a 14 m³ pilot plant operated on-site at a waste oil processing plant. ...|$|R
40|$|Oxidation flow {{reactors}} (OFRs) using low-pressure Hg lamp emission at 185 and 254  nm produce OH radicals {{efficiently and}} {{are widely used}} in atmospheric chemistry and other fields. However, knowledge of detailed OFR chemistry is limited, allowing speculation in the literature about whether some non-OH reactants, including several not relevant for tropospheric chemistry, may {{play an important role}} in these OFRs. These non-OH reactants are UV radiation, O(1 D), O(3 P), and O 3. In this study, we investigate the relative importance of other reactants to OH for the fate of reactant species in OFR under a wide range of conditions via box modeling. The relative importance of non-OH species is less sensitive to UV light intensity than to water vapor mixing ratio (H 2 O) and external OH reactivity (OHR ext), as both non-OH reactants and OH scale roughly proportionally to UV intensity. We show that for field studies in forested regions and also the urban area of Los Angeles, reactants of atmospheric interest are predominantly consumed by OH. We find that O(1 D), O(3 P), and O 3 have relative contributions to volatile organic compound (VOC) consumption that are similar or lower than in the troposphere. The impact of O atoms can be neglected under most conditions in both OFR and troposphere. We define “riskier OFR conditions” as those with either low H 2 O (  200  s − 1 in OFR 254). We strongly suggest avoiding such conditions as the importance of non-OH reactants can be substantial for the most sensitive species, although OH may still dominate under some riskier conditions, depending on the species present. Photolysis at non-tropospheric wavelengths (185 and 254  nm) may play a significant (>  20  %) role in the degradation of some aromatics, as well as some oxidation <b>intermediates,</b> under riskier <b>reactor</b> conditions, if the quantum yields are high. Under riskier conditions, some biogenics can have substantial destructions by O 3, similarly to the troposphere. Working under low O 2 (volume mixing ratio of 0. 002) with the OFR 185 mode allows OH to completely dominate over O 3 reactions even for the biogenic species most reactive with O 3. Non-tropospheric VOC photolysis may have been a problem in some laboratory and source studies, but can be avoided or lessened in future studies by diluting source emissions and working at lower precursor concentrations in laboratory studies and by humidification. Photolysis of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) samples is estimated to be significant (>  20  %) under the upper limit assumption of unity quantum yield at medium (1 [*]×[*] 10 13 and 1. 5 [*]×[*] 10 15  photons cm − 2  s − 1 at 185 and 254  nm, respectively) or higher UV flux settings. The need for quantum yield measurements of both VOC and SOA photolysis is highlighted in this study.
