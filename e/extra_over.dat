He played only once in 1982, but in 1983, he was brought into the team when Somerset's Test players, Ian Botham, Vic Marks, Viv Richards and Joel Garner disappeared on World Cup duty and stayed there for much of the season. Ollis's first game of the season was against Gloucestershire at Bristol; after two declarations, Gloucestershire set Somerset 330 to win in 217 minutes and as opening batsmen Ollis and Somerset captain Peter Roebuck made no attempt to go for the runs. At the designated close of play, they had reached 174 for no wicket, with Ollis not out 99, and Gloucestershire captain David Graveney bowled an <b>extra</b> <b>over</b> in an attempt to secure Ollis his century; however Ollis was unable to score from it, and finished on 99 not out. That proved to be the highest score of Ollis's first-class career, though he passed 50 twice more in the 1983 season on his way to his best aggregate and average, 517 runs at 25.85.|$|E

40|$|Eddy {{covariance}} (ECV) is a direct, {{accurate and}} reliable micrometeorological mass transfer method for measuring evaporation and evapotranspiration (ET). It {{has been used}} successfully {{for the last decade}} to measure evaporation from natural and agricultural plant communities. However, {{a review of the literature}} provided no instances of it being used to measure evaporation losses occurring during sprinkler irrigation. Instead, sprinkler irrigation research has focused on using traditional methods acknowledged to have many limitations. Some of these limitations can be overcome by adopting this new technique. In this field study the feasibility of ECV to measure the total evaporation during sprinkler irrigation over the cotton crop is established. The trials were carried out at small scale (area 0. 2 ha) at the Agricultural Station at USQ using a low pressure impact type sprinkler irrigation system. Results indicated that ECV technique was clearly able to measure the different rates of total evaporation before, during and after sprinkler irrigation. Using this technique, the average additional evaporation (loss) as a direct result of sprinkler irrigation was measured as about 0. 2 mm/hr (50 % <b>extra)</b> <b>over</b> the grass surface, 0. 36 mm/hr (44 %) at the early stage of the cotton crop and 0. 30 mm/hr (63 %) at the mature stage in comparison with pre irrigation period. ...|$|E

However, the OEM tire well is not effective for the off-road enthusiast that needs an <b>extra</b> <b>over</b> size tire in case of an emergency. While off-roading {{it is important to be}} equipped with all the necessary tools and parts to get out safely because there is no roadside assistance off-road.

In order to optimize the space inside and out of the vehicle, a device is needed that will allow for the trunk space, roof rack, and trailer hitch to be free for other accessories. This device must carry an oversize spare tire, a gas tank, and at least two bikes. Thus, the objective of this project is to use skills gained in the Mechanical Engineering Technology curriculum at Central Washington University in order to design, build, and test a device that will solve this problem while optimizing available solutions. This problem was solved by the use of a curt trailer hitch multi-use receiver and the construction of a multipurpose spare tire carrier that mounts into the multi use receiver. This project was successful because it solved the problem and successfully carried an oversize spare tire, a gas can, and two bikes while being able to attach a trailer to the ball.

40|$|Background: We {{are moving}} to second-wave {{analysis}} of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), characterized by comprehensive bioinformatical and statistical evaluation of genetic associations. Existing biological knowledge is very valuable for GWAS, which may help improve their detection power particularly for disease susceptibility loci of moderate effect size. However, a challenging {{question is how to}} utilize available resources that are very heterogeneous to quantitatively evaluate the statistic significances. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present a novel knowledge-based weighting framework to boost power of the GWAS and insightfully strengthen their explorative performance for follow-up replication and deep sequencing. Built upon diverse integrated biological knowledge, this framework directly models both the prior functional information and the association significances emerging from GWAS to optimally highlight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for subsequent replication. In the theoretical calculation and computer simulation, it shows great potential to achieve <b>extra</b> <b>over</b> 15 % power to identify an association signal of moderate strength or to use hundreds of whole-genome subjects fewer to approach similar power. In a case study on late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) for a proof of principle, it highlighted some genes, which showed positive association with LOAD in previous independent studies, and two important LOAD related pathways. These genes and pathways could be originally ignored due to involved SNPs only having moderate association significance. Conclusions/Significance: With user-friendly implementation in an open-source Java package, this powerful framework will provide an important complementary solution to identify more true susceptibility loci with modest or even small effect size in current GWAS for complex diseases.

40|$|For rural or {{remote areas}} in {{developing}} countries, where {{an extension of}} the existing grid is not economically or technically possible, electrification has to be carried out in small isolated power systems. For environmental and economical reasons it is beneficial if the electrification can be based on renewable energy sources. When designing such systems the need of over power production capacity is well documented. Over capacity leads to lost energy when power is available. For renewable sources like wind and solar the available power fluctuates heavily and therefore <b>extra</b> <b>over</b> capacity is required. The availability of the load increases with an increased installed capacity but reaches a level where further increase hardly effect the availability. By using a continuous controllable load (CCL) the energy usage can be maximized and frequency control can be obtained in over production situations. A case study for Dar-es-salaam in Tanzania has been carried out and {{it has been shown that}} implementing a CCL will significantly reduce the lost energy. In this study the CCL is a pumping system and thereby the extra energy will be available as water or pressurised water. However, a small negative change in the availability of the other more prioritised loads can be seen, as the CCL needs a minimum of power. This minimum power increases with the increased CCL. Due to a limited capacity of the CCL there will still be some lost energy in the system. The lost energy decreases with an increased CCL. However, the generation still need some kind of limiting equipment due to the limited capacity of the CCL...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 26 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2007 "The challenges of implementing policy?", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT:Bitumen rubber chip and spray seals have been used successfully in South Africa since 1982 and mostly on road rehabilitation projects. The main advantage of bitumen rubber seals <b>extra</b> <b>over</b> a standard binder is its superior waterproofing {{as well as its}} ability to prevent reflective cracks breaking through the newly placed chip seals or asphalt overlays and its longevity. The higher spray rates together with the better rheological properties of bitumen rubber modified binders provide the following additional benefits. â€¢Widening of working temperature range (Fraass freezing point up to softening point). â€¢Reducing temperature sensitivity. â€¢Longevity due to anti-oxidants in tyre buffings. â€¢Better adhesion. â€¢Stress absorbing qualities. â€¢Better Average Least Dimension (ALD) aggregate stands because of high B-R stiffness. â€¢Lesser stone embedment because of higher softening point. â€¢Resistance to binder absorption. â€¢Lesser pre-treatments. â€¢Superior elasticity and fatigue. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the South African design and construction procedures which have had widespread success. This paper describes the latest design methods as well as construction procedures of bitumen rubber chip and spray seals. Case studies are presented to describe the performance history. It is concluded that bitumen rubber chip seals are a viable and successful option on especially badly deteriorated roads where normal binders are ineffective.
