5|$|The flag {{does not}} differ {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern.

5|$|According to {{historian}} ZbynÄ›k Zeman, broadcasting {{became the}} most important medium for propaganda throughout the war. Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped behind enemy lines by air-ship. In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could be punished by death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E
5|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace. However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd <b>freedom),</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rights for designated airlines to operate services.|$|E

Krug also helped lead the Intellectual Freedom Round Table, the Committee on Professional Ethics, the Freedom to Read Foundation, and the Intellectual Freedom Committee. In 1969, Krug became the first head of the Freedom to Read Foundation, a sister organization to the OIF.|$|E

5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human <b>freedom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of}} life (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E

Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and a county in Washington State was also renamed for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Roa Bastos was an {{exponent}} of the Neobaroque {{style that}} brought Latin American literature {{to the fore}} internationally in the mid-20th century. Among others, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often very {{closely tied to the}} land, flora and culture of the particular writer, {{especially in the case of}} Roa Bastos. Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings (Yo, el Supremo being a notable example of the form). The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s. At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> emancipation of their homeland.|$|E

5|$|According to Sugiura, Monolith Soft's {{relations}} with Namco {{had undergone a}} negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and Monolith Soft felt they were being given less creative <b>freedom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> newly-created Namco Bandai was less willing to take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano's supportive attitude, Monolith Soft decided {{to break away from}} Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided Monolith Soft creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo's purchasing of the majority of Monolith Soft's shares from Bandai Namco Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of Monolith Soft with 80% of shares, while Bandai Namco retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of Monolith Soft shares would strengthen their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith Soft contrasted against the company's previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers and acquisitions of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two company's parallel design and development philosophies.|$|E
5|$|For {{refusing to}} {{contribute}} to the forced loan, over 70 gentlemen were arbitrarily jailed, without trial or charges brought against them. Five of them, Sir Thomas Darnell, Sir John Corbet, Sir Walter Erle, Sir John Heveningham and Sir Edmund Hampden, attempted to gain their freedom, petitioning the Court of King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus. These were awarded on 3 November 1627, with the court ordering the bailiffs to present these prisoners to the King's Bench for examination by 8 November. None of the prisoners were presented, because the bailiffs were unable to determine what they were charged with; in an attempt to get a test case to decide on the legality of the forced loans, the Attorney General Sir Robert Heath secured a writ for Darnell. This led to the Five Knights' Case, known as Darnell's Case. Darnell, unnerved by the situation, ceased pursuing his <b>freedom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other four secured writs instead, represented by John Bramston, Henry Calthorp and John Selden.|$|E
5|$|Through the Etherians, Voyager learns of {{an energy}} field being {{projected}} by a gigantic space station, the Forge, which is draining power and preventing repairs from being completed. To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use of a rare substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, the mission is a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another team member is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the extraction point, killing another team member, capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to the Borg cube to retrieve the Isodesium. While on the cube, Munro is given the chance to rescue Foster from assimilation by the Borg. Matters are complicated when the Borg corner the team, leveraging their <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to the Borg. Although successful, the Borg attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a double cross, however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of the cube and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E

50|$|The title, Freedom Rising, {{refers to}} the rapid {{expansion}} of universal <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> democracy. As <b>the</b> author explains {{at the beginning of his}} book, people have never voiced their desires for <b>freedoms</b> so frequently <b>and</b> powerfully as today. They do so not only inside but even outside democracies. Starting from here, Christian Welzelâ€™s book is about the human quest for <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> human desire for emancipation. The result is a far-reaching theory of emancipation, which describes the human empowerment process.|$|R
