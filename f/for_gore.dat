25|$|According to Bush adviser Karl Rove, {{exit polls}} {{early in the}} {{afternoon}} on election day showed Gore winning by three percentage points, but when the networks called the state <b>for</b> <b>Gore,</b> Bush led by about 75,000 votes in raw tallies from the Florida Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|The early call of Florida <b>for</b> <b>Gore</b> {{has been}} {{alleged to have}} cost Bush several close states, {{including}} Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wisconsin. In each of these states, Gore won by less than 10,000 votes, and the polls closed after the networks called Florida <b>for</b> <b>Gore.</b> Because the Florida call was widely seen as an indicator that Gore had won the election, {{it is possible that}} it depressed Republican turnout in these states during the final hours of voting, giving Gore the slim margin by which he carried each of them. Had Bush carried all four of these states, he {{would have been able to}} win the electoral vote, even with a loss in Florida. Likewise, the call may have affected the outcome of the Senate election in Washington state, where incumbent Republican Slade Gorton was defeated by approximately 2,000 votes statewide.|$|E

25|$|Many Gore {{supporters}} {{claimed that}} third-party candidate Nader {{acted as a}} spoiler in the election since Nader votes could have been cast <b>for</b> <b>Gore,</b> and for instance, Nader allegedly threw the election outcome to Bush. Nader received 2.74 {{percent of the popular}} vote nationwide, getting 97,000 votes in Florida (by comparison, there were 111,251 overvotes) and 22,000 votes in New Hampshire, where Bush beat Gore by 7,000 votes. Winning either state would have won the general election <b>for</b> <b>Gore.</b> Defenders of Nader, including Dan Perkins, argued that the margin in Florida was small enough that Democrats could blame any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including Workers World Party candidate Monica Moorehead, who received 1,500 votes. But the controversy with Nader also drained energy from the Democratic party as divisive debate went on in the months leading up to the election.|$|E
25|$|A {{study in}} 2002 by the Progressive Review, found no {{correlation}} in pre-election polling numbers for Nader {{when compared to}} those <b>for</b> <b>Gore.</b> In other words, most {{of the changes in}} pre-election polling reflect movement between Bush and Gore rather than Gore and Nader, and they conclude from this that Nader was not responsible for Gore's loss.|$|E
25|$|Even if the Supreme Court {{had decided}} {{differently}} in Bush v. Gore, the Florida Legislature had been meeting in Special Session since December 8th {{with the sole}} stated purpose being {{the selection of a}} slate of electors on December 12th, should the dispute still be ongoing. Had the recount gone forward, it would have awarded those electors to Bush, based on the state-certified vote, and the likely last recourse <b>for</b> <b>Gore</b> would have been to contest the electors in the United States Congress. The electors would then only have been rejected if both GOP-controlled houses had agreed to reject them.|$|E

500|$|Bradley's {{campaign}} initially {{had strong}} prospects, due to high-profile endorsements {{and as his}} fundraising efforts gave him a deep war chest. However, it floundered, {{in part because it}} was overshadowed by Senator John McCain's far more attention-gaining, but ultimately unsuccessful, campaign for the Republican nomination; McCain had stolen Bradley's [...] "thunder" [...] on several occasions. Bradley was much embarrassed by his two to one defeat in the Iowa caucus, despite spending heavily there, as the unions pledged their support <b>for</b> <b>Gore.</b> He then lost the New Hampshire primary 53-47%. Bradley finished a distant second during each of the primaries on Super Tuesday.|$|E

500|$|Similar {{to their}} {{experience}} with bringing Black onto the project, obtaining the voicework of the metal artists were also unexpected but beneficial. This led to some confusion during voice recording sessions; both Lita Ford and Rob Halford had difficulties with lines involving a character named [...] "Lita Halford". Furthermore, both Black and Osbourne frequently injected profanity into their scripted lines during recording sessions. Instead of rerecording these, the development left these in the game, but included the option for a profanity content filter to be enabled by the player to [...] "bleep" [...] out these words and mask such word on screen using the Parents Music Resource Center [...] "Parental Advisory" [...] label, an icon that Schafer considered {{to be part of}} the history of heavy metal. [...] A similar filter exists <b>for</b> <b>gore</b> in the game, preventing any dismemberment and disabling blood in the game. Schafer stated the filters were added to the game in consideration of older players that may not wish to see such aspects, or for parents who opt to play the game with younger children. During development, Schafer stated that while he could not confirm what other musicians and bands would be in the game, there would be more than already stated, and that these musicians were [...] "especially conducive to character creation" [...] due to the amount of theatrics used in their concert shows.|$|E

2500|$|The scandal arguably {{affected}} the 2000 U.S. {{presidential election in}} two contradictory ways. Democratic Party candidate and sitting vice president Al Gore said that Clinton's scandal had been [...] "a drag" [...] that deflated the enthusiasm of their party's base, and {{had the effect of}} reducing Democratic votes. Clinton said that the scandal had made Gore's campaign too cautious, and that if Clinton had been allowed to campaign <b>for</b> <b>Gore</b> in Arkansas and New Hampshire, either state would have delivered Gore's needed electoral votes regardless {{of the effects of the}} Florida recount controversy.|$|E
2500|$|The Voter News Service's {{reputation}} was damaged by {{its treatment of}} Florida's presidential vote in 2000.

Although most of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, counties in the Florida panhandle, located in the Central Time Zone, had not yet closed their polls. Discrepancies between the results of exit polls and the actual vote count caused the VNS to change its call twice, first from Gore to Bush and then to [...] "too close to call". Due in part to this (and other polling inaccuracies) the VNS was disbanded in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, Maryland {{was one of}} {{six states}} to vote for Jimmy Carter. In recent years, Maryland {{has been among the}} most {{reliable}} states for Democratic nominees.

2500|$|In the 2000 presidential {{election}} in Florida, George W. Bush defeated Al Gore by 537 votes. Nader received [...] votes, which led to claims that {{he was responsible for}} Gore's defeat. Nader, both in his book Crashing the Party and on his website, states: [...] "In the year 2000, exit polls reported that 25% of my voters would have voted for Bush, 38% would have voted <b>for</b> <b>Gore</b> and the rest would not have voted at all." [...] Michael Moore at first argued that Florida was so close that votes for any of seven other candidates could also have switched the results, but in 2004 joined the view that Nader had helped make Bush president. When asked about claims of being a spoiler, Nader typically points to the controversial Supreme Court ruling that halted a Florida recount, Gore's loss {{in his home state of}} Tennessee, and the [...] "quarter million Democrats who voted for Bush in Florida." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, a {{consortium}} of news organizations, assisted by professional statisticians , examined numerous hypothetical ways of recounting all the Florida ballots. The study was conducted {{over a period of}} 10 months. The consortium examined 175,010 ballots that vote-counting machines had rejected. In each alternative way of recounting the rejected ballots, the number of additional votes <b>for</b> <b>Gore</b> was smaller than the 537-vote lead that state election officials ultimately awarded Bush. Under the strategy that Al Gore pursued {{at the beginning of the}} Florida recount — filing suit to force hand recounts in four predominantly Democratic counties — Bush would have kept his lead, according to the ballot review conducted by the consortium. Likewise, if Florida's 67 counties had carried out the hand recount of disputed ballots ordered by the Florida Supreme Court on December 8, applying the standards that election officials said they would have used, Bush would have emerged the victor by 493 votes. On the other hand, the study also found that if the official vote-counting standards had not rejected ballots containing overvotes (where a voter selects more than one candidate in a race where each voter may only choose one candidate) a statewide tally would have resulted in Gore emerging as the victor by 60 to 171 votes. These tallies conducted by the NORC consortium are caveated with the statement: [...] "But no study of this type can accurately recreate Election Day 2000 or predict what might have emerged from individual battles over more than 6 million votes in Florida's 67 counties." ...|$|E
