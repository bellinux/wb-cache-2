Giant stars <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E

5|$|The icon of fearless {{and noble}} Dacians as {{predecessors}} to modern Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist {{movements in the}} late 1920s and 1930s. On the one hand, Dacians have {{a significant role in}} creating a history of an ethnically pure origin for Romanian people. However, at the same time, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more relegated role in describing Romania as a civilized and cosmopolitan nation, less so than Romans do.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E

Interestingly, no cockatoo species are found in Borneo (despite their presence on nearby Palawan and Sulawesi) or many Pacific islands, although fossil remains have been recorded from New Caledonia.|$|E
5|$|Galapagos {{sharks are}} active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend {{to remain in}} shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thousands}} of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes, and the survival rate {{of works by}} the major artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, {{but there are still}} anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> higher survival rate.|$|E

5|$|Max Payne 2 {{uses the}} same game engine as the one used in Max Payne, but with several {{significant}} upgrades. Even though the game only supports DirectX 8.1, the graphics in Max Payne 2 mimic those generated by DirectX 9 by making optimal use of effects such as reflection, refraction, shaders, and ghosting. The developers considered one particular scene in which effects are used well: When Max has lucid dreams, the screen appears fuzzy and out of focus. Since Max Payne, the polygon count (the number of polygons rendered per frame) has been increased, which smooths out the edges of character models. In addition, characters <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> greater range of expressions. Previously, Max had only one expression available; in Max Payne 2, he often smirks and moves his eyebrows to react to different scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{observations}} in the 1900s gave the first {{clues about the}} Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any rotation. He surmised the planet must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> longer rotation period than had previously been thought. Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde. Radar observations of Venus were first {{carried out in the}} 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the modern value.|$|E
5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E

5|$|Untreated DPB {{leads to}} bronchiectasis, {{respiratory}} failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%. With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB now <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, {{and prevention of}} associated infections like P.aeruginosa. The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment {{has been allowed to}} end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study of}} the venom of four Sistrurus pit viper species found {{significant}} variation in the toxicity to mice. This variation {{was related to the}} proportion of small mammals in the diet of those species. The idea that Sistrurus venom had evolved to accommodate a mammal-based diet was supported by phylogenetic analysis. The researchers suggested that the basis for the difference in toxicity was the difference in muscle physiology in the various prey animals. Two lineages of elapid snakes, common sea snakes and Laticauda sea kraits, have independently colonized marine environments, and shifted to a very simple diet based on teleosts, or ray-finned fish. A 2005 study found that both these lineages <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> simpler set of venom proteins than their terrestrial relatives on the Australian continent, which have a more varied and complex diet. These findings were confirmed by a 2012 study, which compared the venoms of Toxicocalamus longissimus, a terrestrial species, and Hydrophis cyanocinctus, a marine species, both within the subfamily Hydrophiinae (which is also within the Elapid family). Despite being closely related to one another, the marine species had a significantly simpler set of venom proteins. The venoms of the sea snakes are nonetheless among the most toxic venoms known. It has been argued that since sea snakes are typically unable to prevent the escape of bitten prey, their venoms have evolved to act very rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Abelson's studies {{indicated}} {{that in order}} to reduce the equilibrium time, he needed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> greater temperature gradient. The NRL considered building it at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station in Annapolis, Maryland, but this was estimated to cost $2.5 million, which the NRL regarded as too expensive. Other sites were canvassed, and it was decided to build a new pilot plant at the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory (NBTL) at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where there was space, steam and cooling water, and, perhaps most important of all, engineers with experience with high-pressure steam. The cost was estimated at $500,000. The pilot plant was authorized by Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, the Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships on 17 November 1943. Construction commenced on 1 January 1944, and was completed in July. The NBTL was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the steam and cooling water systems, while the NRL dealt with the columns and subsidiary equipment. Captain Thorvald A. Solberg from the Bureau of Ships was project officer.|$|E

5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E
50|$|Na+ loss {{approximately}} {{correlates with}} fluid loss from ECF, since Na+ <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> higher concentration in ECF than ICF.
