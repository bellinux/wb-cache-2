40|$|The main {{objective}} of this comparative survey {{of the use of}} classification in science information is to explore the possibility of adopting a standard general classification in this field. Classification is defined as the grouping, division and/or sequencing according to meaning, of subject representations such. Els catalogue or index terms, descriptors, etc. Classification is used in Hintermediate " documents (bibliographies, abstracts, indexes, etc.) to arrange entries in a meaningful sequence and to structure the relations between subject terms. Classificatory arrangements used in a number of secondary publications are compared with general classifications and with each other. Classificatory relations used in some major thesauri are also compared with general classifications and with each other. The general classifications differ from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>documents</b> with which they were compared in two ways: they lack some of the subject terms used by the documents, and differ in some of their classifactory relations (grouping, decision and sequencing). The overall picture is that, although classification schemes do not occur in all <b>intermediate</b> <b>documents,</b> the use of classificatory relations for both arrangement and thesauric information retrieval is widespread.

We describe experimental results to illustrate the effectiveness of our interactive storytelling approach over multiple text datasets.

40|$|The Web can be {{regarded}} as a large repository of diversified information in the form of millions of websites distributed across the globe. However, the ever increasing number of websites in the Web has made it extremely difficult for users to find the right informa- tion that satisfies their current needs. In order to address this problem, many researchers explored Web Mining as a way of developing intelligent websites, which could present the information available in a website in a more meaningful way by relating it to a user’s need. Web Mining applies data mining techniques on web usage, web content or web structure data to discover useful knowledge such as topical relations between documents, users’ access patterns and website usage statistics. This knowledge is then used to develop intelligent websites that can personalise the content of a website based on a user’s prefer- ence. However, existing intelligent websites are too focussed on filtering the information available in a website to match a user’s need, ignoring the true source of users’ problems in the Web. The majority of problems faced by users in the Web today, can be reduced to issues related to a website’s design. All too often, users’ needs change rapidly but the websites remain static and existing intelligent websites such as customisation, personalisa- tion and recommender systems only provide temporary solutions to this problem. An idea introduced to address this limitation is the development of adaptive websites. Adaptive websites are sites that automatically change their organisation and presentation based on users’ access patterns. Shortcutting is a sophisticated method used to change the organi- sation of a website. It involves connecting two documents that were previously unlinked in a website by adding a new hyperlink between them based on correlations in users’ visits. Existing methods tend to minimize the number of clicks required to find a target document by providing a shortcut between the initial and target documents in a user’s navigational path. This approach assumes the sequence of <b>intermediate</b> <b>documents</b> appearing in the path is insignificant to a user’s information need and bypasses them. In this work, we explore the idea of adaptive websites and present our approach to it using wayposts to address the above mentioned limitation. Wayposts are <b>intermediate</b> <b>documents</b> in a user’s path which may contain information significant to a user’s need that could lead him to his intended target document. Our work identifies such wayposts from frequently travelled users’ paths and suggests them as potential navigational shortcuts, which could be used to improve a website’s organisation...|$|R

40|$|Incoherent {{background}} {{can create}} an intrinsic problem for standard small angle neutron scattering measurements. Biological samples contain hydrogen {{which is a}} strong incoherent scatterer thus creating an intrinsic source of background that makes determination of the coherent scattering parameters difficult in special situations. This can especially be true for the Q-range from around 0. 1 - 0. 5 Å- 1 where improper knowledge of the background level can lead to ambiguity in determination of the samples structure parameters. Polarization analysis {{is a way of}} removing this ambiguity by allowing one to distinguish the coherent from incoherent scattering, even when the coherent scattering is {{only a small fraction of}} the total scattered intensity. 3 He spin filters are ideal for accomplishing this task because they permit the analysis of large area and large divergence scattered neutron beams without adding to detector background or changing the prorogation of the scatter neutron beam.

For relative inequality and all currently <b>documented</b> <b>intermediate</b> inequality concepts, the orderings fail our consistency requirement, as do all indices which respect these orderings. However, the absolute inequality partial ordering satisfies consistency. We identify two classes of indices of absolute inequality, one containing rank-independent and the other rank-dependent indices, which measure attainment and shortfall inequality consistently (in fact identically).

Rich assemblages of plants and animals that utilize aspen forests, as well as economic values of tourism, grazing, hunting, and water conservation, make aspen ecosystems among the most valuable vegetation types in this region. The 43 -ha Pando clone near Fish Lake, Utah, is an iconic example of an aspen community undergoing rapid decline due to overstory mortality and chronic recruitment failure. As part of a larger project to restore Pando, we fenced, treated, and monitored a portion of this famous grove with the intent of documenting regeneration responses and using such practices at larger scales. Twenty-seven randomly stratified monitoring plots were placed across this landscape in order to better understand herbivory and regeneration responses to distinct treatment categories: protected and unprotected, and passive (fenced only) and active (burning, shrub removal, selective overstory cutting) treatments. At each site, we measured basal area and mortality on mature trees, made counts of juvenile and <b>intermediate</b> suckers, <b>documented</b> browse levels and herbivore scat presence, and characterized environmental conditions in terms of aspen and common juniper cover, treatment type, elevation, slope, and aspect. Our results confirmed a positive regeneration response to browsing cessation after fencing, whereas non-fenced areas showed no improvement. Within the fence, there was a significantly better response of active treatment vs. passive and there was no significant difference between treatment types in terms of level of regeneration. Both active and passive management produced regeneration levels that were sufficient to replace dying canopy trees if managers continue to protect suckers until they exceed the reach of browsers. These results support a growing body of research suggesting managers need to invest in continuous protection from herbivory in stable aspen forests, as well as targeting additional post-treatment protection, to ensure adequate regeneration. We examine ramifications of these results for broader restoration purposes in the remainder of Pando, as well as other aspen communities regionally, with the ultimate goal of restoring ecological process toward greater ecosystem resilience...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{interaction}} of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with several reactive oxygen species is of great interest in inflammatory conditions where an uncontrolled release of these potentially damaging <b>intermediates</b> has been <b>documented.</b> This study focused on the scavenging of three species (hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid) with {{several members of the}} oxicam family and with the sulfoanilide nimesulide. Reaction with hydroxyl radical was assessed by the modified deoxyribose assay, and rate constants were calculated showing values between 0. 8 and 1. 1 × 1010 M- 1 s- 1 for oxicams and of about 0. 9 × 1010 M- 1 s- 1 for nimesulide and ibuprofen. These were consistent with those of the literature but in the same range as those for other NSAIDs and for several thiol-containing molecules. The study of hydrogen peroxide scavenging by the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) assay lacked specificity but no interaction could be evidenced by the glutathione peroxidase assay. The scavenging of hypochlorous acid was finally investigated by the recently developed para-aminobenzoic acid assay which demonstrated better performances for meloxicam (1. 7 × 104 M- 1 s - 1) as compared to the other oxicams (tenoxicam: 4. 0 × 10 4 M- 1 s- 1, piroxicam: 3. 6 × 104 M- 1 s- 1, lornoxicam: 4. 3 × 104 M - 1 s- 1) and nimesulide (2. 3 × 103 M - 1 s- 1). These rate constants were, however, lower than those for thiol-containing molecules and ascorbate. These results suggest that the antioxidant properties of NSAIDs could be influenced by a proper pharmacomodulation as far as the scavenging of hypochlorous acid is concerned while the interest is quite limited for the scavenging of hydroxyl radical. © 2004 Elsevier B.

This thesis explores current practice variations and professionals’ support needs and describes the development and testing of the Mental Capacity Assessment Support Toolkit (MCAST). Aims: To develop a toolkit to facilitate and improve mental capacity assessment and test the feasibility of its use in healthcare settings. Method: A sequential, mixed methods design was employed. Published research evidence and case law were reviewed. Multidisciplinary healthcare professionals were interviewed about their practice in focus groups. This evidence informed a design specification for the MCAST. User-centred design methods were employed to develop the prototype MCAST. Design modifications were identified from survey, interview and ethnographic data collected during professional, service user and topic expert reviews of prototype iterations. Professionals piloted using the MCAST to assess hospital and <b>intermediate</b> care patients. <b>Document</b> analysis, professional surveys and patient and family carer interviews were used to investigate the MCAST’s usability, acceptability {{and its effects on}} compliance with the MCA and professionals’ confidence levels. Results: The reviews and focus group data identified barriers and facilitators to good practice and suggested that current practice varies and professionals require support to improve their assessments, especially for patients with communication disorders. The MCAST was designed to enable professionals to: i) prepare, complete and document capacity assessments; ii) identify and support patients with communication disorders during capacity assessments. Most professional participants reported that the MCAST was easy to use and helped them to assess capacity. The MCAST was considered acceptable and potentially beneficial by all patients and family carers interviewed. Use of the MCAST was associated with improved assessment documentation and increased professional confidence. Conclusion: This study provides new knowledge about capacity assessment, especially in relation to people with communication disorders. The MCAST appears feasible to use in healthcare settings.

40|$|Experimental phase equilibria {{are being}} {{increasingly}} {{used for the}} determination of pre-eruptive conditions of subvolcanic igneous bodies. Yet, numerous petrologic studies of silicic to <b>intermediate</b> rocks have <b>documented</b> evidence for disequilibrium either between phenocrysts or between phenocrysts and melt. Thus, the applicability of equilibrium experiments requires clarification. Although bulk equilibrium is generally not attained in magmas, in all cases {{it is possible to}} identify a subsystem of the magma at local chemical equilibrium (hereafter designated as the reactive magma). This is because magmas, as other natural systems, tend to approach chemical equilibrium. Local equilibrium can be proved from tests of element partitioning between coexisting phases, thermobarometric calculations, or comparing compositions of phenocrysts and melts with phases from equilibrium experimental studies. Reactive magma volumes can vary by orders of magnitude between magmatic systems, depending on physical processes and their timescales, and on equilibration kinetics. Because equilibration kinetics are much faster in melts than in crystals, sub-aphyric chemically homogeneous (on a whole-rock basis) igneous bodies (eg, Novarupta 1912 high silica rhyolite) have large reactive magma volumes, and are probably close to bulk equilibrium. By opposite, smaller reactive magma volumes are to be expected for crystal-rich bodies. The recently erupted Mt. Unzen dacite illustrates one extreme case of phenocrysts being all out of equilibrium with the interstitial melt. Another indication for small reactive magma volumes is chemical zonation of matrix glasses (eg, Laacher See Tephra). Reactive magma volumes also change with perturbations (of either physical or chemical nature) imparted to the igneous body. For pre-eruptive conditions of equilibration to be determined experimentally, starting materials must closely approach the reactive magma composition appropriate for the pre-eruptive history of the igneous body. Certain discrepancies between experimental phase and phenocryst assemblages in recent studies likely result from a poor matching between starting compositions and the appropriate reactive magma. The reactive magma concept is useful for the planning and interpretation of experimental studies on silicic to intermediate magmas...|$|R

We <b>document</b> natural variation in electrophoretic mobility among environmental isolates of cystoviruses and use crosses against a common fast mobility [greek small letter phi] 6 strain to monitor the production of hybrids with intermediate mobility, thus estimating the amount of genetic exchange. Cystoviruses from different geographic locations have very different reassortment rates when measured against [greek small letter phi] 6, with viruses isolated from California showing higher reassortment rates than those from the Northeastern US. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that cystoviruses from different geographic locations have remarkably different reassortment rates [...] despite similar genome structure and replication mechanisms [...] and that these differences are in large part due to sexual reproduction. This suggests that particular viruses may indeed exhibit diverse sexual behavior, but wide geographic sampling, across varying environmental conditions may be necessary to characterize the full repertoire. Variation in reassortment rates can assist in the delineation of viral populations and is likely to provide insight into important viral evolutionary dynamics including the rate of coinfection, virulence and host range shifts. Electrophoretic mobility may be an indicator of important determinants of fitness and the techniques herein {{can be applied to the}} study of other viruses...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s it {{has become}} commonplace to {{consider}} colonial cities as physical urban realms segregated along racial lines, with the segregationist policy — often combined with a discourse on the “sanitary syndrome” — resulting in a binary structure separating the so-called European town from the native town. While scholars {{of the social sciences}} have since long highlighted the complexities of colonial urban societies and questioned the binary scheme of ‘colonizer’-‘colonized’, few researchers have ventured into a similar analysis of the spatiality of the colonial city. If urban space has become a key notion in African urban history in the last decade, studies of what Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch called “spatialized space” are indeed still rare. This paper will argue that much is to be gained from detailed mapping and dissecting the physical colonial urban landscape. In fact, urban segregation was both embedded in as well as strengthened by building and planning strategies and practices, with official colonial policies often being compromised in the process of implementation. Two case-studies from the Belgian colonial context will be put to the fore: Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. By discussing the colonial planning in these two urban settings from a comparative perspective and doing so on a variety of scales (from the masterplan to the individual building or place) and in relation to shifting ideas on native policy, this paper will highlight both specific and more widely shared aspects of colonial urban segregation. Particular attention will be given to the discrepancies between the planning models, often formulated in the métropole, and the urban landscape that was actually realized. It will be shown that the tension between theory and practice was to some extent linked to specific local conditions of topography, culture, economy and social habits, but also resulted from differences in the agency of, for instance, <b>intermediate</b> figures. By <b>documenting</b> and analyzing of the evolutions over time of the so-called “zone neutre” or cordon sanitaire in both Kinshasa and Lubumbashi, following an approach that pays attention to racial separation as well as to social stratification within these two particular colonial urban societies, our analysis aims to go beyond the binary analytical framework of the segregated colonial city and will plea for a more complex understanding of (the physicality of) colonial cities...|$|R
30|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{we have already}} shown how prompts can stimulate the evocation of metacognitive learning strategies and how the regular mention of such learning strategies {{can be related to}} better learning outcomes and performances at the final exams (Mauroux et al. 2015). The present study extends that pilot study both {{in terms of the number}} of learners concerned as well as with respect to its duration. This confirms that asking learners to reflect on their level of mastery of a given process (“I already master ….”), their current difficulties (“I still have to learn…”), and to think how they could overcome them (“In order to improve, I will…”) through prompts stimulates the evocation of learning strategies, a practice found to be related to better grades in {{a previous}} study (Mauroux et al. 2015). However, our results indicate that not all learning strategies are equally effective; evoking metacognitive learning strategies such as “planning”, “monitoring”, or “debugging” did indeed relate to better grades in the final examination while focusing on other learning strategies did not. Additionally, our data show that the choice of metacognitive learning strategies aligns with the pacing of learning journal generation. Reflections conducted at the beginning of the training contained significantly more planning, monitoring and debugging while procrastinating reflections made towards the end of the training tended to be limited to mere global evaluations of one’s mastery of the whole recipe. The main contribution of this study is the importance it gives to appropriate pacing in completing one’s learning journal. Although a general tendency to procrastinate in completing one’s recipe book and learning journals was clearly visible in our data, we could also observe that more successful learners, as assessed by their overall grades in the final exam, tended to use the platform earlier in their training than their less successful peers. In addition, our data clearly show that starting earlier also allowed learners to complete their training with more thoroughly documented recipes; in particular, we found in the learning journals of learners, who started to complete their recipe books earlier, more pictures <b>documenting</b> <b>intermediate</b> work-steps as well as more pictures showing the final product (ideal picture) than in documents of later starting learners. Contrasting their journal entries half-way in the training with that observed at the end of the training, findings suggest that “early starters” tended to complete their journals in successive steps, while “late starters” proceeded more in a “one-shot” mode. This confirms the superiority of building what Goda et al. (2015) called “learning habits” over adopting learning behaviors mainly affected by a procrastination tendency.|$|R
40|$|H?? longa data o planejamento {{territorial}} urbano ?? foco de a????es do poder p??blico. O Estatuto das Cidades, que regulamenta os artigos da Constitui????o Federal que tratam da pol??tica urbana, tem sido considerado, por alguns estudiosos, um dos maiores avan??os legais em termos de gest??o e planejamento urbano no Brasil. Em sua se????o I apresenta, como um dos instrumentos de planejamento territorial urbano, o Plano Diretor. Este, em termos legais, vem a ser uma ferramenta voltada para a gest??o de ??reas urbanas, apesar de seu raio de atua????o, em alguns munic??pios, abarcar ??reas urbanas e n??o-urbanas ??reas rurais. Nesse ponto reside o questionamento: como esta ferramenta de gest??o incorpora as demandas de saneamento ambiental e os conflitos socioambientais inerentes aos territ??rios rurais pr??ximos aos centros urbanos? Estes, mesmo n??o urbanos, apresentam se intrinsecamente inseridos na configura????o da rede urbana, sofrendo m??ltiplas e distintas press??es do meio, da l??gica urbana. De maneira emblem??tica, pode-se apontar o Munic??pio de Nova Friburgo RJ, onde cinco de seus oitos distritos s??o predominantemente territ??rios rurais. Planos diretores municipais, ao circularem por campos de interesses distintos e que, at?? certo ponto, se chocam, representam um espa??o de disputa por territ??rios. No caso do Munic??pio de Nova Friburgo essa disputa reside de forma central na tentativa de influenciar as diretrizes do parcelamento do solo. A pesquisa apresenta um car??ter explorat??rio, onde a preocupa????o reside em proporcionar maior familiaridade com o problema, com vistas a torn??-lo expl??cito. Para tanto, enquanto procedimentos t??cnicos, a metodologia empregada envolveu pesquisa bibliogr??fica, pesquisa documental e estudo de caso. Atrav??s da conjun????o dos dados obtidos por meio destes procedimentos, conclui-se que o Plano Diretor de Nova Friburgo n??o pode ser apontado como uma ferramenta de promo????o da sa??de e justi??a socioambiental. A maneira como seu processo de configura????o e implementa????o foi, e tem sido conduzido, n??o permitiu que este documento intermediasse, de fato, os conflitos presentes neste espa??o. Longstanding territorial {{urban planning}} {{is the focus}} of shares of the public. The Statute of the Cities, which regulates the articles of the Constitution that deal with urban policy has been considered by some scholars, one of the greatest advances in terms of legal management and urban planning in Brazil. In its section I shows, as one of the instruments of urban planning, the Master Plan. This, in legal terms, has to be a tool dedicated to the management of urban areas, although its radius of action, in some municipalities, covering urban and non-urban - rural areas. At this point the question is: how does this management tool incorporate the demands of environmental sanitation and social conflicts inherent in rural areas close to urban centers? These, even non-urban, are intrinsically embedded in the configuration of the urban network, under pressure from many different means, the urban logic. As example, shows the city of Nova Friburgo - RJ, where five of its eight districts are predominantly rural. When moving between different areas of interest that are rivals to some extent, the municipal directors plans represent an area of struggle for territory. In the city of Nova Friburgo this fight lives in an attempt to influence the guidelines for the division of land. The research presents an exploratory nature, where the concern is to provide greater familiarity with the problem, to make it explicit. Thus, while technical procedures, the methodology employed involved literature, documentary research and case study. Through a combination of data obtained through these procedures, it is concluded that the Master Plan of Nova Friburgo can not be described as a tool for health promotion and social justice. The way its setup process and implementation was, and has been conducted, did not allow this <b>document</b> <b>intermediates,</b> in fact, the conflicts in this area...|$|R
