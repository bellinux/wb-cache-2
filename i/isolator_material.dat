The onset of leakage current in isolators occurred in time intervals ranging from {{a few hours to}} many hundreds of hours. In all cases, surface contamination was responsible for the onset of leakage current and subsequent isolator failure. Rate of increase of leakage current and the leakage current level increased approximately exponentially with isolator temperature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to verify the existence of magnetic polaritons in thin film metallic antiferromagnet materials. The polaritons could be generated in metallic antiferromagnet materials by fabricating layered sample with an <b>isolator</b> non-magnetic <b>materials,</b> so that disturbance from screening effect by free electron could significantly be reduced. The method used to detect the magnetic polaritons is attenuated total reflection (ATR). The existence of magnetic polaritons is indicated by reduction of reflectance in ATR spectroscopy. The result show that the value of reflectivity in a certain direction is same with opposite direction with R(k) = R(-k), if external magnetic field isn’t applied to the system. This property is called reciprocal. If external magnetic field is then introduced to the system, the ATR spectroscopy show that the reflectivity will be nonreciprocal, with R(k) ≠ R(-k...|$|R

40|$|A {{major issue}} in {{integrated}} optics is the protection of on-chip lasers against undesired external feedback. In non-integrated systems, undesired reflections can be easily blocked using Faraday isolators. However, Faraday <b>isolators</b> require magneto-optic <b>materials,</b> which are difficult to integrate into compact devices. Yu and Fan [1] have proposed a non-magnetic integrated isolator, in which a transverse mode of an optical waveguide is converted to another transverse mode only for a single propagation direction. However, the best implementation so far [2], based on a transversely non-uniform index modulation in a semiconductor, showed high losses. We present a novel design to achieve such a modulation in lowloss dielectric waveguides, using surface acoustic waves. We theoretically describe how to realize the two most essential features, which are a short interaction length and a wide isolation bandwidth. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was initiated {{to study the}} behavior of materials subjected to vibratory motion. In particular, {{the study was to}} be an investigation of the properties of felt influencing the performance of felt as a vibration isolator. The performance of felt as an isolation materials cannot be predicted with much satisfaction by the classical theory of vibratory motion and vibration isolation. It was assumed that this might be due to the internal damping of felt and that this damping was not of viscous nature. Therefore, this study was started to determine the nature of the internal friction of felt and the importance of this friction in vibratory motion and vibration isolation. Since the performance of felt as a vibration isolator could not be determined by calculation in the design stage by common procedures sued with other vibration isolation materials, another goal {{of the study was to}} set up a simple test procedure and calculation method that would more nearly give results that agree with actual performance. S. A. E. F- 6 felt was tested as a vibration <b>isolator.</b> This <b>material</b> was subjected to forced vibrations of 0. 025 inch amplitudes with frequencies of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cycles per second. Data observed, comprising amplitudes and accelerations of the vibration table and a hanging weight suspended on the felt material, were used to calculate the transmissibility of this material. Each specimen of felt was subjected to forced vibrations once daily over a period of eight days because a pronounced creep effect was observed. The sustained testing was an attempt to determine how long a period of time was required or steady state conditions to be reached. These sustained tests also determined what effects the creep had on the physical characteristics of this material. Advisor: W. L. De Baufr...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{observable}} increase in the fitting of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels on the roofs of buildings in the UK over the last decade. The origin of some fires in domestic and commercial properties {{has been attributed to}} PV systems. This thesis examines the ability of fire examiners to recognise and record details of fires believed to have originated from PV systems, as well as investigating the effect of internal heating in direct current (DC) isolators to the point at which they fail. National fire data was examined along with the methods for collecting and collating these data. This clarified that national fire data cannot identify the specifics of electrical fires. Validity of these data was then tested by identifying the confidence and competence in the recognition of the origin of fire, (especially when associated with PV systems), of some fire staff responsible for collecting fire data. This suggests that some fire scenes examiners are not confident in their own ability to recognise fires originating from PV systems. Evidence for fires occurring in PV systems in Kent between 2009 and 2014 was then examined, including a cold case forensic review of the evidence. This provided an indication that a potential common point of failure, which may lead to fire originating from a PV system, was to be found within the DC section of the PV circuits and probably within the DC isolator switch itself. Experimentation revealed that internal heating of a terminal connection can lead to changes of the phase of the insulating material, causing failure of structural integrity and therefore allowing an arc to be established. Observable post fire indicators associated with this mechanism of failure have been identified as well as hydrocarbons evolved from pyrolysis of <b>isolator</b> insulating <b>material.</b> Finally, areas for further experimental research and training of fire staff are suggested as well as the modification of recording mechanisms and building regulations...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} {{at room temperature}} to determine the shear properties of the strain <b>isolator</b> pad (SIP) <b>material</b> used in the thermal protection system of the space shuttle. Tests {{were conducted}} on both the. 23 cm and. 41 cm thick SIP material in the virgin state and after fifty fully reversed shear cycles. The shear stress displacement relationships are highly nonlinear, exhibit large hysteresis effects, are dependent on material orientation, and have a large low modulus region near the zero stress level where small changes in stress can result in large displacements. The values at the higher stress levels generally increase with normal and shear force load conditioning. Normal forces applied during the shear tests reduces the low modulus region for the material. Shear test techniques which restrict the normal movement of the material give erroneous stress displacement results. However, small normal forces do not significantly effect the shear modulus for a given shear stress. Poisson's ratio values for the material are {{within the range of}} values for many common materials. The values are not constant but vary {{as a function of the}} stress level and the previous stress history of the material.

40|$|Rubber {{vibration}} isolators {{are used}} for vibration isolation of engines at high frequen-cies. To make a good prediction regarding {{the characteristics of a}} vibration isolator in the design process, numerical models can be used. However, for a reliable prediction of the dynamic behavior of the <b>isolator,</b> the rubber <b>material</b> parameters have to be known. In practice the material parameters have to be determined with help of experiments. Normally a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA) is used to measure the dynamic material properties of test samples of the rubber. However, test samples of the rubber part of the mount are often not available. For this reason a procedure is developed to determine the parameters that describe the material behavior of an isolator with the help of measurements of the entire isola-tor. Two measurements are used: a static force-displacement and a dynamic transfer stiffness measurement. A finite element model (ABAQUS) of the mount is made and the material parameters are determined in an optimization procedure to fit the numer-ical response on the measured response. The static force-displacement measurement is used to determine the coefficients of the polynomial fit of the strain-energy function for the correct static behavior. After that a similar optimization procedure is performed to obtain the dynamic shear modulus of the isolator as function of the frequency with help of the measured dynamic transfer stiffness data. The procedure described above is illustrated for a cylindrical mount using a static and dynamic measurement in the transverse direction. 319...|$|R
