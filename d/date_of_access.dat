This paper investigates the extent to which students revisit previous online material for the purposes of building the educational spiral, and the implications for the implementation of a Faculty's Learning Management System implementation. Methods At the University of Cape Town, medical students' last <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to 16 previous online courses was determined. Students completed a survey to determine their reasons for revisiting this material and the perceived benefits of this availability. Results 70 % of the students revisited their previous online courses. The major reasons were to review lecture presentations, lectures notes, and quizzes. The perceived benefits were for understanding new material, preparation for assessments, and convenience. Although student comments were not always in line with the concept of the spiral curriculum, most referred to processes of building on previous work, and some mentioned the spiral curriculum specifically. Conclusion This study suggests that the practice of replacing previous online courses may hinder rather than support student learning. Although students visit previous material for ranges of reasons, a large number are aware of the spiral curriculum, and use the online environment to build upon previous material. Any practice, which entails replacing material and redesigning curricula content may be detrimental to the students' future learning needs, and such activities may need revision. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{analysis of the}} multi-year (1984 – 2005) dynamics of reproductive parameters in the population of Tree Sparrow Passer montanus {{was carried out in}} the vicinity of Lake Chany (Baraba forest-steppe). In this species the inter-annual dynamics cycling of the average size of clutches and eggs was revealed. The dominant clutch size cycle of the Tree Sparrow is 11 years. This species may adapt to the cycles of the air temperature dynamics similar in time during the second and third decades of May, when the most pairs begin to reproduce. Since the sparrows fledge mostly with insects, an abundance of which depends on thermal environment, such adjustment provides a higher productivity of individuals and populations in general. Less expressed 3 – 4 -year cycles of clutch size, most likely, are caused by the intra-population reasons. The average seasonal fecundity of the Tree Sparrow depends on the ratio {{between the first and second}} clutches. The proportion of second clutches varies with the periodicity of three-year and 12 -year (multiple of three). Perhaps this is due to the three-year dynamics of the age structure, as the majority of Tree Sparrow yearling are monocyclic. Rhythm spectra of long-term changes in the linear dimensions and volume of eggs of the Tree Sparrow are very similar. The most powerful cycle lasts approximately 7 -year, but there are 3 -and 2 -year periodic components less expressed on power. Probably the of egg dimensions cycling is determined by a variety of external and intra-population factors (food supply, age distribution of the population, timing and duration of their breeding season).

Author AUTHOR'S PREFACE The rapid development of science at the present time is the basis and condition for the development of civilization. This applies to the full extent to medicine, the progress of which is obvious. At the same time, humanity poses new and new challenges to medical practice that is designed to ensure the preservation of health and the maximum life. Moreover, in society the pre- setting and understanding that it is the life of every person is the goal and measure of civilization, for there is nothing more moral- significant than that. The scientific and technological achievements of civilization in many are measured and implemented by the success of medicine. It should be noted and other global eco-ethical direction of philosophy civilization: the interaction of mankind with the environment, space, can also be measured by the interests of a person, an integral element and a part, {{and one of the most}} difficult - nature. Thus, the humanization of science becomes magical a special direction of development of modern civilization. The latter advances medicine with its practical tasks on To ensure human health at the cutting edge of development science and technology. As a result, there is a tangible progress in medical technologies, which are increasingly on the achievements of the basic sciences. The most important problems of modern medicine are prevention and treatment of human diseases remain. Undoubtedly, the prospects for progress in medical They depend not only on the achievements of the basic sciences, but also on the from understanding the essence of human life in its two main health and disease. The need to deepen our understanding of the essence disease is also determined by the fact that many modern medical technologies use intensive ways to influence people. Transplantation of organs and tissues, application of stem cells, 4 on the one hand expand biological of the organism, but on the other hand, significantly alter the evolutionary but the established patterns of development of pathological processes and the formation of adaptive reactions that provide adaptation to the environment, and therefore, determine life and health. of a person. These and other issues that are associated with the emergence of modern medical technologies, understanding and progress of our knowledge in the field of the theory of disease, the condition of which has always been the basis of the development of medicine. Meanwhile, in recent years in the biomedical sciences predominantly analytical approaches to the study the nature of man. Of course, it is the deepening of our knowledge about elemental nature of man is the basis for the creation of new medical technologies. However, it should also be clear The need for awareness of the behavior of individual elements and in the integral biological system, which is the organ the self-organization of which is the main his health and the possibility of recovery in case of illness. Today, the classic idea of what to treat patient, and not a disease, should be filled with a new theoretical content, it is necessary to create a new modern theory of Leszno. Clearly realizing that it can be created only when we will fully know man as a biological system, we, At the same time, we affirm that today there is an opportunity and not- the need to begin to create it, at least, the foundations of its construction. The author devoted this task to his work. in the hope that the attempt to create the basis of the theory of the disease will be used as an element of the foundation for the construction of modern theory of medicine. Transplantation of organs and tissues, the use of stem cells, genetic medicine on the one hand expand the biological capabilities of the organism, but on the other hand, significantly change the evolutionary patterns of development of pathological processes and the formation of adaptive reactions that provide adaptation to the environment, and therefore, determine the life and health of a person. These and other issues that are associated with the emergence of modern medical technologies, urgently require the comprehension and progress of our knowledge in the field of the theory of the disease, the condition of which has always been the basis of the development of medicine. Meanwhile, in recent years in the biomedical sciences predominantly analytical approaches to the study of human nature have triumphed. Of course, it is the deepening of our knowledge of the elemental nature of man that is the basis for the creation of new medical technologies. However, it is also necessary to clearly understand the need to understand the behavior of individual elements and mechanisms in a holistic biological system, which is a human body whose self-organization is its main health and the possibility of recovery in case of illness. Today, the classical notion that it is necessary to treat a patient, and not a disease, should be filled with a new theoretical content, it is necessary to create a new modern theory of the disease. Clearly realizing that it can be created only when the human being is fully understood as a biological system, we, at the same time, assert that today there is an opportunity and the need to start its creation, at least, the formation of the foundations of its construction. The author devoted this task to his work in the hope that the attempt to create the foundations of the theory of the disease will be used as an element of the foundation {{of the construction of}} the modern theory of medicine. Along with this goal, no less important is the task at the present time to equip each physician with modern concepts of the theory of the disease, which are extremely necessary in the huge flow of medical information, especially in connection with the rapid progress of pharmacology, which open up new possibilities for controlling the organism in a state health and disease. The author is grateful to colleagues in science and medical practice and, first of all, to pathophysiologists, communication and discussions with which helped to formulate and present to your attention our ideas about modern problems of the theory of the disease. 5 INTRODUCTION Despite the validity of the statement of Academician I. M. Trakhtenberg about the complexity of formulating definitions, fundamental concepts are needed, because it is on them that knowledge, which is formed in this or that field of knowledge, is based on this or that historical stage in the development of science, including the medical one. In turn, fundamental concepts are also a perspective for improving the practical activity of mankind. Therefore, while fully agreeing with the statement about the relative and complex nature of existing concepts, including in medical science, we consider it possible and even necessary to present to the reader our vision of the modern understanding of the theory of the disease - a set of fundamental fundamental concepts in medicine. They are deduced by biomedical science on the basis of a vast historical experience of medicine and form the basic theoretical concepts that are constantly changing in connection with the development of science. Knowledge about the nature and manifestations of diseases is so numerous and, at the same time, constantly replenished, that it is very difficult to solve the problem of their complete analysis and generalization, but this is the basis, the theoretical (methodological) basis for the development of modern medicine. The need for modern methodological concepts is especially felt at the present time, when there is a rapid development and introduction of new diagnostic techniques and, especially, treatment. This allows not only to provide recovery by influencing the mechanisms of the organism, but also to significantly influence and supplement them. An example is the methods of treatment with the use of stem cells, organ and tissue transplantation, genetic engineering. In these cases, the biologically formed mechanisms of disease and recovery are changing. Therefore, the proposed methodologies should be based on a new methodological basis, i. e. general theoretical representations. Moreover, the more data accumulated about morphological, biophysical, biochemical and physiological changes in the disease, the more obvious is the need for their synthesis in the system of general concepts of the disease. Certainly, that the improvement of our ideas about the elemental components of the disease simultaneously distances us from understanding the state of the whole organism. Meanwhile, he is sick, i. e. is in a state of unhealth, it is the whole organism. It is important that this conclusion simultaneously deepens our understanding of the disease as an organism condition. We draw the attention of the reader to the fact that the philosophy and methodology of cognition of pathology must be based simultaneously on two components: factual (symptoms, data from laboratory, functional and instrumental surveys) and semantic (generalizing). Moreover, the generalization must be carried out at different levels of the organization of the living - from the cell to the whole organism. At the same time, the psychology of cognition of the disease often leads us to the specificity of the symptoms and the individual morpho-functional and biochemical indicators characteristic of pathology. The latter, indeed, are important and necessary elements characterizing the sick organism (markers, criteria), but they are not illness as a state of the whole organism. Therefore, the thinking and psychology of the physician should be based on the basic general theoretical concepts of the essence of the disease, which form an idea of the pathology of the organism, and then be specified to the level of the symptom, syndrome, nosology and disease of each patient. In turn, this is the theoretical basis for improving diagnosis and treatment. The material presented in this book is aimed at forming an understanding of the disease in the doctor, researcher and educator on the basis of patterns of development of pathology. We hope that such a philosophy of the disease will be a useful foundation for medical thinking in practical medicine and, at the same time, the formation of a methodology for medical science. AFTERWORD The main provisions of the book offered by the reader are the author's philosophy in medicine. It was formed as a result of studying medicine, analyzing the experimental and clinical experience, accumulated over many decades of scientific research and, finally, creative communication on these issues with their colleagues. The results of our discussions, the experience, ideas and comments of my colleagues prompted the author's creative thought in the knowledge of the theory of the disease. In this regard, I consider it my duty and a pleasant duty to thank all those who contributed to my work. Of course, I want special words of gratitude to address the bright memory of my teacher in the field of pathophysiology, science, philosophy and life of Boris Andreevich Pakhmurny, the years of work under the leadership of which have shaped me as a pathophysiologist. Another teacher, Professor Igor Konstantinovich Vladkovski, was interested in analyzing the clinical material. Creative communication with academicians and professors: G. N. Kryzhanovsky, Yu. V. On the ground, N. N. Zayko, D. D. Zerbino, Yu. I. Kundiyev, I. M. Trach tenberg, A. A. Moybenko, Yu. I. Gubsky skym, G. M. Butenko, A. G. Reznikov, V. F. Sagach, V. N. Yelsky, V. A. Mikhnev, A. V. Ataman and many other colleagues in the pathophysiologists shop helped clarify the basic concepts and theories of the disease theory, supported the interest in work on the book. My thinking was worked out, and its results were tested in the scientific teams of the departments of pathophysiology of the Bukovyna and Odessa medical universities, as well as the Ukrainian Research Institute of Transport Medicine, where colleagues and students (NV Krishtal, BA Nasibullin, S. V. Biletsky, AA Svirsky, AL Kukharchuk, VA Lisobey, LM Shafran, Yu. E. Rogova, AS Fedoruk, AA Avramenko, I. V. Savitsky, VN Mikhalchuk and many others) not only acted as listeners, but also in fact, co-authors of many ideas. And, finally, the 40 -year experience of teaching pathophysiology to students is invaluable, the attention and patience of which always encouraged the author to search for such forms of exposition of the pathology theory that would ensure the depth and clarity of the presentation of the material. All of the above scientific and life experience allowed me to present to your attention this work. A. GOZHENKO 81 LIST OF LITERATURE 1. Abuali Ibn Sina (Avicenna).

40|$|Background. A patent {{vascular}} {{access is}} crucial for hemodialysis patients. Stenosis and thrombosis lead to access failure. Endothelial injury via angiotensin II may mediate a hyperplastic and prothrombotic response. Thus angiotensin II inhibition with angio-tensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may pro-long vascular access patency. This study determines the impact of ACEI use on access patency in both polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) grafts and fistulas. Methods. Demographics, access history and medica-tion use were reviewed in 266 accesses from four dialysis centres. Primary patency, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> surgery to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> first <b>access</b> failure, was determined. Excluded accesses had incomplete history or < 30 day patency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{integrity}} of digital evidence {{plays an important}} role in the digital process of forensic investigation. Proper chain of custody must include information on how evidence is collected, transported, analyzed, preserved, and handled with. There are several adapted methods for evidence digital signing to (im) prove the {{integrity of}} digital evidence. Most forensic tools and applications use a certain kind of hashing algorithm to allow investigators later to verify the disk or image integrity. In this process there is a problem of binding integrity, identity and <b>date</b> and time <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to digital evidence. In this paper the authors will present a valid time stamping method to signing a digital evidence in all stages of digital investigation process. Time stamp will be obtained from the secure third party (Time Stamp Authority). It will be used to prove the time when the staff access the evidence in any stages of forensic investigation...|$|R
