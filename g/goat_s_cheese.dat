The perceptions of members of La Palma Island 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>goat</b> <b>cheese</b> regulatory council and local goat cheese producers were gathered through interviews and questionnaires. Overall, the strong commercial potential of local cheeses is acknowledged; however, increasing costs of production are perceived as the main barrier to its further development. Further, whilst the importance of collaboration is clearly acknowledged, most participating cheese producers are currently not involved in any form of collaboration. In turn, the GCRCs leadership appears to be filling some of these obvious gaps, particularly in quality assurance and promotion of 2 ̆ 7 Palmero 2 ̆ 7 cheese. In this context, some elements of the theory of collaboration were identified. The study 2 ̆ 7 s implications, as well as future research avenues will be presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} the impact of European Union (EU) export subsidy reductions on the U. S. dairy trade. We assume reductions of 36 % similar to the 1995 World Trade Organization agreement. The price substitutability between U. S. and EU dairy products is estimated using a Rotterdam-type production model. Past analyses have suggested that EU export subsidy reductions will increase U. S. dairy exports because the removal of EU subsidies will raise EU export dairy prices, rendering U. S. dairy products more competitive on world markets. This is partially true for nonfat dry milk, where our projections indicate an increase of 4. 6 % in U. S. exports. U. <b>S.</b> <b>cheese,</b> butter, and whey exports, on the other hand, rise by only 0. 2, 0. 1, and 0. 2 %, respectively. The main reason for the relatively modest gains is that the U.

40|$|Structural {{changes in}} the U.

No specific data on amount of ultra-filtered milk imports exists because these imports fall under the broader U. S. Customs Service classification of milk protein concentrate.

For ex-ample, Sumner (1993) argues that policy mod-els are too aggregated and may be harmful to the policy debate. Meilke and de Gorter (1996) contend that quantitative analyses are “woefully inadequate ” when trade policy ne-gotiations intensify into sensitive product lines. Gardner (1993) claims that computable gen-eral equilibrium (CGE) models have not been illuminating because key elements of the pro-posals dealt with nonstandard policy instru-ments (i. e., tariff-rate quotas (TRQs)). Bureau and Salvatici (2003) note that differences in methods of aggregating protection {{is one of the main}} reasons why policy results are fundamen-tally different between models analyzing an al-most identical set of liberalization scenarios. ...|$|R

The estimates are used to determine pass-through rates of cost changes under different behavioral regimes. We find that, under collusion, the pass-through rates for all brands fall between 21 % and 31 % while, under Nash-Bertrand price competition, the range of pass-through rates is between 73 % and 103 %. The mixed logit model provides a more flexible framework for studying pass-through rates than the logit model since the curvature of the demand functions depends upon the empirical distribution of consumer types.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} literature on price pass-through modeling. This literature {{has focused on}} pass-through of cost shocks for homogenous products. To get results with the homogenous products case, empirical implementation has required the maintained hypothesis of competition, or agreement, in quantity modeling. A major contribution {{of this paper is}} modeling pass-through for a differentiated products market under the maintained hypothesis of price competition or price agreement. We estimate a mixed logit model for U. <b>S</b> processed <b>cheese</b> market using unbalanced panel data and implement a price pass through simulation and related consumer welfare analysis under different regimes of competition.

40|$|Abstract The {{occurrence}} and antibiotic susceptibility {{profile of}} Staphylococcus isolates of healthy farm animal origin in Nkonkobe Municipality {{as well as}} the prevalence of putative antibiotic resistance genes were investigated using phenotypic and molecular methods. A total of 120 Staphylococcus iso-lates were isolated from 150 animal samples and consisted of Staphylococcus haemolyticus (30 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (23. 3 %) from pig, Staphylococcus capitis (15 %) from <b>goat,</b> <b>S.</b> haemolyticus (5 %) and Staphylococcus xylosus (15 %) from cattle, and other staphylococci (11. 7 %) from dead chicken and pigs. Besides this, the presence of these isolates was observed from the animal dung, showing that the organisms are shed to the environment. About 23. 3 % of these isolates were coagulase-positive and 76. 7 % were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Between 75 and 100 % of the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, tetracycline, sulfameth-oxazole, and nalidixic acid; about 38 % were methicillin-resistant staphylococci, including 12. 6 % methicillin-resistant S. aureus from pigs. In total, 12 % of all isolates were vancomycin resistant. Also, 12 % of the isolates were erythromycin resistant, while 40. 2 % were resistant to ceftaz-idime. Only the genes mecA and mphC could be confirmed, whereas the genes vanA, vanB, ermA, ermB, and ermC could not be detected. The high phenotypic antibiotic resistance and the presence of some associated resistance genes is a potential threat to public health and suggest the animals to be important reservoirs of antibiotic resistance determi-nants in the environment...|$|R

Zero purchases and missing values on coupons and unit values {{are taken into}} account in the model to correct for selectivity bias. Correlations among the three equations are found to be significant. Empirical findings show that high-quality choice significantly decreases cheese purchases, while cheese coupon usage significantly increases purchases. We find that higher income households select higher quality cheese, while larger households choose lower quality cheese. For coupon redemption, we find that African-American and Hispanic households redeem less, while Asian households have no significant difference compared to Caucasian households.

In the model, the curvature of demand is determined to a significant extent by the empirical distribution of consumers. This property reduces the prediction errors of cost pass-through caused by an erroneous assumption as to the functional form of demand. We find that, under collusion, the pass-through rates for all brands fall between 23 % and 37 % and under Nash price competition, the range of pass-through is 67 % ~ 98 %...|$|R
