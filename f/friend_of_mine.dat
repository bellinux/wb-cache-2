25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E

Nader argued that other storyline possibilities existed since he and Dimitri received [...] "a tremendous response" [...] from viewers. [...] "For years, Dimitri and Erica were a popular coupling," [...] he said. [...] "A good <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> Jack Scalia (Chris), is on...that alone would be a dynamic triangle." ...|$|E

500|$|Weeks {{before the}} release of Independiente, Arjona issued a letter in which {{he talked about his}} past {{relations}} with recording companies. In the letter, he revealed that he entered in his first record label as an exchange, commenting that [...] "a producer, <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> told them [...] that if they don't sign me they won't sign two artists he had [...] ", and that he received the [...] "minimum royalty percentage" [...] out from his most successful albums. Billboard notes that although other groups have decided to launch independently their works after having a contract with major record labels, Arjona {{is by far the most}} important artist in the Latin pop to follow this trend.|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with The Pitchfork Review, Björk expressed frustration {{over to the}} lack of recognition for all of her work on Vespertine and her other albums. She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine and it took me three years to work on that album, because it was all microbeats — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album. [...] Drew [...] is a close <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> and in every single interview he did, he corrected it. And they don't even listen to him. It really is strange.|$|E
500|$|Several {{artists have}} remixed or made a {{freestyle}} over the beat, including Eminem, B.o.B, Sean Kingston, Royce da 5'9", Trey Songz, Fat Joe, Teairra Marí, and Diggy Simmons. Simmons, {{the first to}} release a freestyle over the track told Vibe, “With that freestyle, I heard the track, loved it, then got the instrumental from a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> and just did it on the whim. It wasn’t really anything I planned. I wasn’t even ready {{for this to be}} a big thing because I’ve had tracks out before. I put my all into everything, but sometimes some tracks come out better than others. It got such a big buzz maybe because it came out the day after and people enjoyed it.” ...|$|E

500|$|Epstein {{initially}} {{offered the}} vacant position to Johnny Hutchinson of The Big Three, {{a group that}} Epstein later managed. Hutchinson turned down the offer, saying, [...] "Pete Best {{is a very good}} <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine.</b> I couldn't do the dirty on him"— although Hutchinson did play for The Beatles at short notice when Best did not turn up on the evening of his dismissal and for two subsequent bookings, until Ringo Starr was able to join. Starr was well known to the group, as he was then playing with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, the resident group at Butlins' holiday complex in Skegness. He had also occasionally replaced Best when the drummer was ill, and had performed at a recording session with Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison in Hamburg.|$|E
500|$|Mersey Beat magazine's editor, Bill Harry, {{claimed that}} Epstein {{initially}} offered the vacant drummer {{position in the}} group to Hutchinson, whom he also managed. Hutchinson refused the job, saying, [...] "Pete Best {{is a very good}} <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine.</b> I couldn't do the dirty on him." [...] Starr had previously played with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes – the alternating band in the Kaiserkeller – and had deputised when Best was ill or unable to play in Hamburg and Liverpool. Harry reported Best's dismissal {{on the front page of}} Mersey Beat magazine, upsetting many Beatles fans. The group encountered some jeering and heckling in the street and on stage for weeks afterwards, with some fans shouting, [...] "Pete forever, Ringo never!" [...] One agitated fan headbutted Harrison in The Cavern, giving him a black eye.|$|E
500|$|According to Steve Turner, one of Van Morrison's biographers, Irish painter Cecil McCartney {{influenced}} the titling of Astral Weeks. [...] Morrison related how [...] "A <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> had drawings in his flat of astral projection. I {{was at his}} house when I {{was working on a}} song which began, 'If I venture down the slipstream' and that's why I called it 'Astral Weeks'." [...] "It was a painting," [...] McCartney corrects. [...] "There were several paintings in the studio at the time. Van looked at the painting and it suggested astral travelling to him." [...] The album cover photograph of Van Morrison was taken by Joel Brodsky, best known for his [...] "Young Lions" [...] photoshoot with [...] Jim Morrison.

[...] She also mentioned she had known about [...] "Roar" [...] before its release and stated [...] "If I'm not mad I don't know why anybody else is upset". In response to the accusations, Dr. Luke tweeted on August 14, 2013: [...] "Roar was written and recorded before Brave came out." [...] In direct response to the attention [...] "Brave" [...] received {{as a result of the}} plagiarism accusations, Bareilles' record label, Epic Records, decided to promote [...] "Brave" [...] to the mainstream pop radio format.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{after taking}} a job at Columbia University, nuclear {{physicist}} Đàm Thanh Sơn {{paid a visit to}} Andrei Starinets, a friend from Sơn's undergraduate days who happened to be doing a Ph.D. in string theory at New York University. Although the two men had no intention of collaborating, Sơn soon realized that the AdS/CFT calculations Starinets was doing could shed light on some aspects of the quark–gluon plasma, an exotic state of matter produced when heavy ions are collided at high energies. In collaboration with Starinets and Pavel Kovtun, Sơn was able to use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate a key parameter of the plasma. As Sơn later recalled, [...] "We turned the calculation on its head to give us a prediction for the value of the shear viscosity of a plasma... A <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> in nuclear physics joked that ours was the first useful paper to come out of string theory." ...|$|E

[...] The poem Pinsky reads in the episode was picked by the Simpsons writing staff, [...] "The poem has two jokes in it," [...] Pinsky said, [...] "and when I say jokes I don't mean witty remarks. It's more like an optician, the pope and a zebra go into the bar and then there's a punch line at the end." [...] He stated that the poem was [...] "an elegy for a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> who liked jokes". He added that his appearance on the show gave him [...] "a lot more prestige" [...] when visiting high schools and colleges. The episode also features Karl Wiedergott as the professor at the Springfield University.|$|E
