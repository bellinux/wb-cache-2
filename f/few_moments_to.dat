She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned around to look for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return after a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E

She performed the song on July 6, 1999, during her appearance at the Woodstock 99 festival.

[...] Given permission, she selected as the artist a National Guard officer, [...] Jean-Jacques Hauer, who had already begun sketching her from the gallery of the courtroom.

As he got close to the vehicle, Kilroy was grabbed by two men, Serafín Hernández García and Malio Fabio Ponce Torres, and wrestled inside the truck. Because of his size and athletic strength, Kilroy was able to break loose about two blocks down the road after one of the gangsters stopped for a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> catch his breath. Kilroy ran from the truck but was eventually intercepted by another vehicle driven by the gangsters' allies and taken at gunpoint.

2500|$|In late 1949, Bates {{auditioned for}} the small role of Phoebe in Fox's {{upcoming}} All About Eve. In competition for the part was Zsa Zsa Gabor and others, but Bates impressed the producers and was given the part. She made a short but important appearance as the devious schemer, Phoebe, {{at the end of}} the film. Bates' image is enshrined in the film's last scene, posing in front of a three-way mirror, while holding the award won by her idol Eve Harrington, played by Anne Baxter. This memorable final scene left critics and audiences intrigued by the young actress, who they thought would star in a sequel to All About Eve. The Hollywood Reporter said of her performance, [...] "Barbara Bates comes on the screen in the last <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> more or less sum up the whole action and point of the story. It's odd that a bit should count for so much, and in the hands of Miss Bates all the required points are fulfilled." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{his debut}} novel Căderea Bastiliei, Gârbea {{produces}} a satirical portrayal {{of his fellow}} Romanian writers, disguising their real names with anagrams or other word play. Alex. Ştefănescu, who writes that such portrayals caused [...] "great agitation in the literary world", cites the author's own mock-disclaimer: [...] "The identification of some characters with real person constitutes an abuse of interpretation which the author intends to fight off with any legal means." [...] Ştefănescu however cautions against reading Căderea Bastiliei purely as a roman à clef, since the inspiration from [...] "writers' deeds" [...] is [...] "capricious" [...] and the resemblance with real persons [...] "partial". A similar opinion was voiced by poet and journalist Cornelia Maria Savu, who compared the narrator to a puppeteer and further assessed: [...] "Horia Gârbea does not hate his characters, does not love them, he understands them. And by understanding them, he offers them a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> evolve with no strings." [...] Reviewing the work from a stylistic point of view, Paul Aretzu analyzes the intrusion of [...] "intertextual indulgences" [...] throughout the work, identifying allusions to Ion Luca Caragiale, Franz Kafka, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti and others, while also noting the presence of experimental methods echoing James Joyce's Ulysses. Ştefănescu attributes such presences to parody, noting in passing the introduction of situations and even entire passages from Kafka's Metamorphosis and Albert Camus' The Plague.|$|E
2500|$|The ADE 651 {{consists}} of a swivelling antenna mounted via a hinge to a plastic handgrip. It requires no battery or other power source; its manufacturer claimed that it is powered solely by the user's static electricity. To use the device, the operator must walk for a <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> [...] "charge" [...] it before holding it {{at right angles to}} the body. After a substance-specific [...] "programmed substance detection card" [...] is inserted, the device is supposed to swivel in the user's hand to point its antenna {{in the direction of the}} target substance. The cards are claimed to be designed to [...] "tune into" [...] the [...] "frequency" [...] of a particular explosive or other substance named on the card. According to Husam Muhammad, an Iraqi police officer and user of the ADE 651, using the device properly is more of an art than a science: [...] "If we are tense, the device doesn't work correctly. I start slow, and relax my body, and I try to clear my mind." [...] The cards were supposedly [...] "programmed" [...] or [...] "activated" [...] by being placed in a jar for a week along with a sample of the target substance to absorb the substance's [...] "vapours". Initially, McCormick reportedly used his own blood to [...] "program" [...] the cards for detecting human tissue, but eventually gave up even the pretense of [...] "programming" [...] them when demand for the devices was at its peak.|$|E
