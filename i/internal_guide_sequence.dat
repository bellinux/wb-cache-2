40|$|Group I introns are {{characterized}} {{by a set of}} conserved sequence elements and secondary structures. Evidence supporting the pairing of certain of these sequences has come from the comparison of intron sequences and from the analysis of mutations that disrupt splicing by interfering with pairing. One of the structures proposed for all group I introns is an <b>internal</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequence</b> that base pairs with the upstream and the downstream exons, bringing them into alignment for ligation. We made specific mutations in the <b>internal</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequence</b> and the flanking exons of the fifth intron in the yeast mitochondrial gene for apocytochrome b (COB). Mutations that disrupted the pairing between the <b>internal</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequence</b> and the upstream exon (the P 1 pairing) blocked addition of guanosine to the 5 ' end of the intron during autocatalytic reactions and prevented formation of the full-length circular intron. In contrast, transcripts containing mutations that disrupted the pairing between the guide sequence and the downstream exon (the P 10 helix) initiated splicing but failed to ligate exons. Compensatory mutations that restored helices of normal stability mitigated the effects of the original mutations. These data provide direct evidence for the importance of the base pairing between the <b>internal</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequence</b> and the downstream exon in the splicing of a wild-type group I intron...|$|E
40|$|Catalytic RNA {{molecules}} possess simultaneously a genotype and a phenotype. However, {{a single}} RNA genotype {{has the potential}} to adopt two or perhaps more distinct phenotypes as a result of differential folding and/or catalytic activity. Such multifunctionality would be particularly significant if the phenotypes were functionally inter-related in a common biochemical pathway. Here, this phenomenon is demonstrated by the ability of the Azoarcus group I ribozyme to function when its canonical <b>internal</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequence</b> (GUG) has been removed from the 5 ? end of the molecule, and added back exogenously in trans. The presence of GUG triplets in noncovalent fragments of the ribozyme allow transsplicing to occur in both a reverse splicing assay and a covalent self-assembly assay in which the <b>internal</b> <b>guide</b> <b>sequence</b> (IGS) -less ribozyme can put itself together from two of its component pieces. Analysis of these reactions indicates that a single RNA fragment can perform up to three distinct roles in a reaction: behaving as a portion of a catalyst, behaving as a substrate, and providing an exogenous IGS. This property of RNA to be multifunctional in a single reaction pathway bolsters the probability that a system of self-replicating molecules could have existed in an RNA world during the origins of life on the Earth...|$|E

A combination of morphological features of the organism including the oval body shape, 2 – 3 contractile vacuoles, 22 – 28 nematodesmal rods in the cytopharyngeal basket, and 31 – 39 somatic kineties, distinguishes it from all other known congeners. In reconstructed small subunit (SSU) rRNA phylogenies, T. faurei groups with Isochona, a representative genus of the subclass Chonotrichia. The similarity of the infraciliature between hartmannulids and several chonotrichian examples also suggests that these taxa should be closely related. A new S 943 intron belonging to group IC 1 was identified in the SSU rRNA gene of this species.

25|$|Forty {{years after}} the {{publication}} of Manfred Eigen's primary work dedicated to hypercycles, Nilesh Vaidya and colleagues showed experimentally that ribozymes can form catalytic cycles and networks capable of expanding their sizes by incorporating new members. However, this is not a demonstration of a hypercycle in accordance with its definition, but an example of a collectively autocatalytic set. Earlier computer simulations showed that molecular networks can arise, evolve and be resistant to parasitic RNA branches. In their experiments, Vaidya et al. used an Azoarcus group I intron ribozyme that, when fragmented, has an ability to self-assemble by catalysing recombination reactions in an autocatalytic manner. They mutated the three-nucleotide-long sequences responsible for recognition of target sequences on {{the opposite end of the}} ribozyme (namely, <b>Internal</b> <b>Guide</b> <b>Sequences</b> or IGSs) as well as these target sequences. Some genotypes could introduce cooperation by recognizing target sequences of the other ribozymes, promoting their covalent binding, while other selfish genotypes were only able to self-assemble. In separation, the selfish subsystem grew faster than the cooperative one. After mixing selfish ribozymes with cooperative ones, the emergence of cooperative behaviour in a merged population was observed, outperforming the self-assembling subsystems. Moreover, the selfish ribozymes were integrated into the network of reactions, supporting its growth. These results were also explained analytically by the ODE model and its analysis. They differ substantially from results obtained in evolutionary dynamics. According to evolutionary dynamics theory, selfish molecules should dominate the system even if the growth rate of the selfish subsystem in isolation is lower than the growth rate of the cooperative system. Moreover, Vaidya et al. proved that, when fragmented into more pieces, ribozymes that are capable of self-assembly can not only still form catalytic cycles but, indeed, favour them. Results obtained from experiments by Vaidya et al. gave a glimpse on how inefficient prebiotic polymerases, capable of synthesizing only short oligomers, could be sufficient at the pre-life stage to spark off life. This could happen because coupling the synthesis of short RNA fragments by the first ribozymal polymerases to a system capable of self-assembly not only enables building longer sequences but also allows exploiting the fitness space more efficiently with the use of the recombination process. Another experiment performed by Hannes Mutschler et al. showed that the RNA polymerase ribozyme, which they described, can be synthesized in situ from the ligation of four smaller fragments, akin to a recombination of Azoarcus ribozyme from four inactive oligonucleotide fragments described earlier. Apart from a substantial contribution of the above experiments to the research on the origin of life, they have not proven the existence of hypercycles experimentally.|$|R

Binding is 10 (3) - to 10 (4) -fold tighter (4 - 5 kcal/mol at 42 degrees C) than expected from base-pairing interactions alone, implying that tertiary interactions also contribute to energetic stabilization. Binding decreases with single base changes in the substrate, substitution of deoxyribose sugars, and lower Mg 2 + concentration. Ca 2 +, which enables the ribozyme to fold but is unable to mediate efficient RNA cleavage, promotes weaker substrate binding than Mg 2 +. This indicates that Mg 2 + has special roles in both substrate binding and catalysis.

Mutations in the 3 ' exon that weaken this proposed pairing increased use of a downstream cryptic 3 ' splice site. Compensatory mutations in the guide sequence that restore this pairing resulted in even stronger selection of the normal 3 ' splice site. These changes in 3 ' splice site usage were more pronounced in the background of a mutation (414 A) which resulted in an adenine instead of a guanine being the last base of the intron.
