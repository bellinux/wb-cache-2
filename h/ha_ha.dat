5|$|To counter Cleveland’s {{image of}} {{superior}} morality, Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child {{while he was}} a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, and chanted “Ma, Ma, where’s my Pa?”—to which the Democrats, after Cleveland had been elected, appended, “Gone to the White House, <b>Ha!</b> <b>Ha!</b> Ha!” Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who claimed he fathered her child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland. Halpin was involved with several men at the time, including Cleveland’s friend and law partner, Oscar Folsom, for whom the child was also named. Cleveland did not know which man was the father, and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them. At the same time, Democratic operatives accused Blaine and his wife of not having been married when their eldest son, Stanwood, was born in 1851; this rumor was false, however, and caused little excitement in the campaign.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women who {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with {{both men and women}} and women who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with a man in the 3 months before and <b>having</b> at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % who reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with a woman were compared with those who reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only. RESULTS: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women <b>had</b> a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with both men and women were more likely than women who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> sex with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R
