40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{prevalence}} of Cryptosporidiosis in cattle and buffaloes by oocyst microscopic examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cryptosporidiosis as detected by microscopic examinations was higher in cattle (10. 5 %) than buffaloes (8. 47 %) in Lahore from August, 2007 -July, 2008. Percent prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in cattle and buffaloes was higher at Governmental dairy farms (20. 55 & 16. 66) followed by Gawala colonies (12. 77 & 9. 44), Military dairy farm (6. 11 & 4. 44) and House <b>hold</b> <b>dairies</b> (3. 88 & 3. 34). The highest percent prevalence recorded in cattle and buffaloes was during summer (15 & 12), followed by autumn (10. 88 & 20), spring (10. 88 & 7. 5) and the lowest in winter season (6. 6 & 4. 5). Infection rate was higher in young cattle and buffaloes than older. Non-significant difference was recorded in relation to sex of animals and infection rate.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Anaerobic {{digestion}} has {{a number}} of benefits as a manure treatment technology, including greenhouse gas and odor reduction, increased nutrient availability, and reduced pathogen risk. There is also a potential for electricity generation and energy recovery, although this is only achieved at additional cost. The economic feasibility of the energy conversion technology varies significantly with scale, with significant advantages for larger facilities. This study examined the feasibility of anaerobic digestion and methane recovery by applying the AgSTAR model to the full range of scales of swine and dairy producers in Iowa, under 24 policy scenarios. Based on these scenarios and accounting for model assumptions, it appears that both swine and dairy operations offer opportunities for installing either plug-flow or complete-mix digesters. For swine operations, farrow-to-finish and finishing operations needed more than 20, 000 head and 5, 000 head, respectively, to be economically feasible in the Midwestern U. S. <b>Dairy</b> operations <b>hold</b> considerably more economic promise, with feasible herd counts in the 150 to 350 head range for electricity prices of $ 0. 12 /kWh. Results indicate that increased energy prices and financial assistance will be needed to encourage significant numbers of facilities to recover energy from manure...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{management}} practices of dairy cattle production in Central Zone of Tigray. A total of 160 <b>dairy</b> cattle <b>holding</b> households were selected by systematic random sampling technique. The study employed multiple methods of data analysis including descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, T-test and qualitative analysis. Majority of the urban dairy farmers depend on hay, crop residues and concentrates for feeding their dairy cattle. Whereas, the peri-urban dairy farmers rely on dry and green roughages but less on concentrate feeds. In the urban areas, pipe water was the most common water source for the dairy cattle whereas, in the peri-urban areas, the use of river was very high. Significantly (P< 0. 05) better watering frequency was observed in urban than peri-urban areas. Access to veterinary services was significantly (P< 0. 05) better in urban areas than the peri-urban areas. About 44 % of the peri-urban dairy farmers trek their dairy cattle more than 6 km in searching veterinary services. Waste management was relatively problematic in urban areas (36. 25 %) as compared to the peri-urban areas (13. 75 %). There is also promising urban-peri-urban linkage in dairy product and by-product supply. Therefore, an appropriate feeding, watering, health management, housing and manure utilization could be the management options to improve the existing problems...|$|R

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate a crude Ostertagia ostertagi antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for monitoring gastrointestinal parasites in lactating dairy cattle. A longitudinal study of gastrointestinal parasites in lactating dairy cows was carried out in 38 herds in four provinces of Canada (Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Ontario and Saskatchewan) from September 1999 to October 2000. Bulk tank milk, cow milk, serum and fecal samples were collected monthly or quarterly from all these farms. Information on herd management factors was collected by a standard questionnaire and individual cow production data were obtained from an electronic database. The overall mean optical density ratio (ODR) was 0. 30 and ranged from - 0. 05 to 1. 55. Although a clear seasonal pattern was not observed, the ODR values tended to decrease during the housing period and start increasing in the spring before the cows went out to pasture. The second and third or greater lactation cows had significantly higher ODR values compared with first lactation animals. The individual cow ODR had a very low correlation with individual squared root fecal egg counts but showed a reasonably high correlation when herd averages values were computed (r= 0. 73). A moderate correlation (r approximately 0. 50) between the bulk tank and herd average ODR was observed. Milk yield was negatively associated with individual cow milk ODR and a quadratic effect on ODR was observed for days in milk. Twenty-eight of the herds participated in a clinical trial of eprinomectin (Ivomec Eprinex) treatment at calving. The cow level ODR values determined late in the previous lactation had a marginally significant effect (P= 0. 07) on treatment response, suggesting that high OD cows responded better to the anthelmintic treatment. However, because of the small sample size available in this model, more research is needed to better understand this relationship. In conclusion, the indirect ELISA using an O. ostertagi crude antigen appears useful as a technique for monitoring gastrointestinal parasite burdens in adult <b>dairy</b> cows and <b>holds</b> promise as a potential predictor of response to anthelmintic treatment.

40|$|The {{future of}} family farming {{is a matter}} of debate, {{especially}} because of the far-reaching economic and political changes that are occurring. One vision is that family farms will disappear because they are less efficient than large-scale industrial farming enterprises. Others foresee that they will survive, due to their ability to resist external forces and adapt their internal processes. The recent increase in worldwide demand for biofuels is changing economic and social relationships in many rural areas by creating potentially competing claims on natural resources. The huge Brazilian sugarcane industry, one of the most efficient in the world, has expanded enormously, replacing pastures. This thesis studies the (differential) impact that the increasing area of sugarcane has had on family dairy farmers in São Paulo state and the various drivers at different levels that influence land use and, therefore, the future of these farmers. Historical changes in land use, production technologies, and product and land prices are described, together with how these are linked to changing policies in Brazil. The study analyses how dairy farmers, with different rationales and resource endowments, react to the increased competition from sugarcane for land and labour.   It shows that farmers have different options and strategies when considering leasing their land for sugarcane production. It also looks at local responses and alternatives to this trend and has found that intensifying small-scale <b>dairy</b> production <b>holds</b> potential for increasing the income and quality of life of small-scale farming households. The research reveals that the increasing competition between milk production and sugarcane is not only the result of long-term governmental policies that support the expansion of the sugarcane business. It is also related to the internal dynamics of the dairy and beef chains. In the Brazilian case, different drivers (at different scales) have {{played an important role in}} the replacement of pastures by sugarcane. One factor is the ever-expanding milk frontier, which has been driven by technological innovations (e. g. UHT milk). Other factors include the price fluctuations in raw milk and beef that occurred after deregulation and the concentration that has occurred in the dairy industry and the retail sector. The study concludes that the expansion of sugarcane needs to be understood in the context of the dynamics of other agricultural sectors and the long-term national political economy rather than being seen solely as the result of recent increases in global demand for biofuel. At the farm level, the study identified a more complex set of interactions than merely a competition between sugarcane and dairy farming. The comparison of different farm types reveals that labour availability, household resilience and technology introduction are the key factors influencing farmers’ decisions. The proximity of cities that offer more attractive jobs and provide schooling opportunities for farmers’ children is largely responsible for the labour shortages in family dairy farming. The effects of sugarcane expansion are contradictory and uneven according to the different strategies and resource endowments of farmers. Leasing land to sugarcane may be attractive to farmers as it reduces labour load and risk while guaranteeing a monthly income. On the other hand, farmers who abandon dairy production and totally rent to sugarcane may be entering a ‘one way street’: once the infrastructure is dismantled, they cannot return to their former business. Nevertheless, when only part of the land is rented to sugarcane as a form of diversification, this can offer a guaranteed extra income, fitting the rationale of resilience, lowering risks and uncertainties, and providing resources for investing in intensification. Neither option is feasible for very small farms due to the size of their operation. This thesis went on to examine the option of dairy intensification as promoted by the Balde Cheio programme. The study of this  programme provides insights into the interactions between technology, innovation and family farmers’ needs. It looks at a sample of farmers who joined the Balde Cheio programme and attained high land productivity, equivalent to that observed in developed countries that employ more intense, sophisticated and highly specialized production systems. The higher productivity was due to a combination of more lactating cows per unit area (31 %), higher productivity per cow (24 %) and better labour performance (37 %) while using less land area (- 7 %). The gross margin per unit area almost doubled even though milk prices only increased by 7 %. This was achieved through having a large number of lactating cows per unit area as a result of strategies that make use of the high potential for dry matter production of tropical grasses, (rather than through achieving extremely high productivity per cow - a typical strategy of non-grazing systems). These intensified milk production systems yielded an average of R$ 3, 000 /ha, which is highly competitive with R 00 /ha for sugarcane leasing and R 00 /ha for soybean production. The average values in terms of income per family member were also very competitive in comparison to average urban wages. This research continued by analysing how such changes in the productive processes took place at the level of the family dairy farm. The examination of the internal dynamics of the Balde Cheio programme reveals several lessons for family farmer oriented research, development and extension. For example, it shows that it is possible to attain high levels of productivity and outstanding economic results without expensive ‘cutting-edge’ technologies  but with an intense circulation of different forms of knowledge and skills supported by institutional arrangements, intense networking among different types of actors and the flexible application of relatively simple techniques. Other processes applied included trialling/experimenting under real farming conditions and adjusting to the farmer’s rhythm of innovation. These processes have narrowed the gap between ‘the scientific frontier’ – the advanced research orientation of the governmental research institutes – and the realities experienced by small dairy farming systems. The results show that, despite the increasing opportunity costs for land and labour and competition for local resources (created by other commodity chains and the attraction of urban areas), it is still possible for family dairy farmers to be competitive if they are supported to sustainably intensify their production processes.  ...|$|R

He established the Dutch foundation EcoFair in 1994 to help producers in the South trade with the North. Using his in-depth experience as a human interface between the North and South, he {{now works as a}} consultant with international bodies such as the World Bank. 'Fair trade' {{is much more than a}} slogan. It is a real commercial practice, based on fairness and nonexploitation in trading relationships and on environment-friendly production of goods. Fair trade organisations (FTOs) form a well-established movement in Europe, North America, Japan, and elsewhere in the industrialised world. They have even succeeded in shifting products from the distribution channel of charity shops and health food centres into the big business of supermarkets. Fair trade is an ideal that inspires and educates. But we have a long way to go before fair products and fair trade can be of any significance to many ACP farmers. On the face of it, fair trade is about partnership between like-minded people (see Spore 67). Agricultural producers in the South seek a sustainable livelihood, and fair trade outlets in the North offer them the prospect of regular income. In the North, 'partners' in development organisations seek to open up a consumer niche market that will pay a premium for products sourced from a just, nonexploitative, and environment-friendly production system. Small is beautiful [...] . The fair trade market in Europe is still tiny, but it has some growth potential. I estimate that fair trade coffee accounts for about 2 % of the Dutch market, compared with about 5 % for bio-organic dairy products, fruit, and vegetables. Enthusiastic consumers in all northern countries will make a special effort to purchase goods with a Fair Trade label. But the point is that the fair trade niche market (sentimental market) is limited, and it will stay that way until we can move fair products into the mainstream. The main value of the fair trade movement, backed by its heavy advertising and insistence on fair trade brands and trademarks, is in educating the northern public. In fact, about half of the extra price charged for fair trade products currently represents the cost of publicity and education work in the consumer market. The fair trade banana is a case in point: it costs up to 40 % more than the 'normal' banana, whether that is a dollar banana from Latin America or an ACP plantation banana. In other words, the consumer is paying a premium to inform other consumers. Consumers are becoming more sophisticated, and self-centred but are still human. Most people prefer to buy something that is good for their purse or their health. Fair trade is often compared to the organic foods market, which is based primarily on health concerns, and secondarily on environmental interests. In Denmark, biological <b>dairy</b> products now <b>hold</b> 50 % of the total market share, but they are not necessarily produced according to the same principles as those of fair trade. We have to ensure that fair trade products reach these high levels of market share. To do so, we must move beyond the present sentimental market and into the mainstream. This cannot be done by the FTOs; the only way is to open up trade to fair market forces. From the point of view of consumers, they should be able to procure fair trade products from the mainstream, where they will get reliable quality without paying the surcharge. Faced with products of similar quality, they will choose the 'fairer' one, but not at any price. Upstream, on the production side, we have to help the producers rely on themselves, without the protection of the fair trade movement. Such protection is not sustainable and cannot cover more than a small proportion of producers. Without intending it, fair trade in fact creates division among producers. [...] . but a mass market is better for our farmers Much needs to be done to raise productivity in cooperatives and other sources of fair products, so that they can ultimately compete with multinational plantation produce. Efficiency, waste control, improved input management, economies of scale, and efficiency are concepts that must be adopted by producer groups. We must encourage greater ownership, in very real forms, of the means of production, so that producers are more responsible for their output. Further downstream, more emphasis should be paid to logistics, transport, and marketing strategies. Paradoxically, the fair trade movement is unintentionally paternalistic, which does not help our producers. Whilst a few may be able to supply the sentimental market, which is finite, most will still be exposed to the unjust global market. We have to operate in the global market, and we have to empower our producers to face its challenges. Current World Bank training programmes in West Africa aim to help farmers and traders understand new European legislation on environmental standards for agricultural produce and its restrictions on imports, for example of groundnuts from Mali and Senegal. The strategy is to negotiate directly and equally with importers and to pass through a minimum of intermediaries, whether commodity agents or FTOs. Fair trade has served its purpose in creating an awareness and a demand. But it cannot be considered the universal salvation. Gradually market forces will force FTOs out of the picture. Build confidence Ultimately, we have to deal with Africa's fundamental problem: our loss of confidence. Confidence means security, and it comes from education, taking risks, falling down and standing up again, and not always being protected. We need the confidence to develop a fair product, and to bargain for ourselves. Only then shall we have a fair market.
