Three different voltages were generally required, using three different batteries {{designated as the}} A, B, and C battery.

In June 2007 an updated head version and a version 3 combo were released. The first Epiphone Valve Juniors (version 1) were only combo amplifiers and received only a fair reception, due to such problems as buzzing and hum caused by the AC <b>filament</b> <b>voltage.</b> Epiphone then released a head version, correcting these issues and changed the AC <b>filament</b> <b>voltage</b> to DC voltage.

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} on the Electron Diffusion Gauge {{showed that the}} diocotron mode damping increases with higher neutral gas filling pressure. Yet the energy dissipated from a rotating plasma by collisions with neutrals is predicted to excite the mode. To resolve this, experiments have been conducted to examine the coupling between expansion and the m= 1 diocotron mode. Results from recent experiments have shown interesting phenomena: (1) The degree and sensitivity of mode growth is observed to be strongly dependent on filament conditions. Mode growth rates of nearly 20 sec{sup - 1 } have been observed even with negligible resistive drive. Specifically, at low <b>filament</b> bias <b>voltages</b> (and correspondingly low electron densities {approx} 1 - 2 x 10 {sup 7 } electrons/cm), the mode growth is very sensitive to the heating <b>voltage</b> across the <b>filament,</b> even though changes in <b>filament</b> heating <b>voltage</b> barely affect the plasma expansion, the plasma density profile, the filament emission, or the resulting electron density. (2) At low neutral gas pressure (< 10 {sup - 9 } Torr), the diocotron mode growth rate increases with neutral pressure. However, the growth rate is several orders of magnitude larger than theoretical predictions...|$|R

50|$|The tube checker is the second-simplest of all tube testers after {{filament}} continuity testing. Tubes {{are used}} as a low power rectifier, with all elements other than filament connections connected together as the anode, {{at a fraction of}} its normal emission. By mistake referred to sometimes as Emission Tester because they are a crude measure of emission in directly heated types (but a measure of unwanted heater-cathode leakage in indirectly heated types). Switches will need to select the correct <b>filament</b> <b>voltage</b> and pins.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} tester is the filament continuity tester, {{usually with}} a neon lamp connected {{in series with}} the filament/heater and a current limiting resistance fed directly by the mains. There is therefore no need to select the appropriate <b>filament</b> <b>voltage</b> for the particular tube under test, but this equipment will not identify tubes that may be faulty in other (more likely) ways, nor indicate any degree of wear. The same checks {{can be made with}} a cheap multimeter's resistance test.|$|E
50|$|Next in {{complexity}} is {{the emission}} tester, which basically treats any tube as a diode by carefully connecting the cathode to ground, all the grids and plate to B+ voltage, feeding the filament {{with the correct}} voltage, and an ammeter in series with either the plate or the cathode. This effectively measures emission, the current which the cathode is capable of emitting, for the given plate voltage, which can usually be controlled by a variable load resistor. Switches will need to select the correct <b>filament</b> <b>voltage</b> plus which pins belong to the filament and cathode(s).|$|E
50|$|The Epiphone Valve Junior {{has become}} very popular to modify because of its basic design. There are many websites, kits, and forums {{dedicated}} to this purpose, including the Epiphone official amps and accessories forum. Some sites offer kits to match the gain characteristics of Marshall, Fender and Vox amplifiers. These kits often do not include a bridge rectifier to convert the version 1 AC <b>filament</b> supply <b>voltage</b> to DC, instead they suggest twisting the AC leads together to cancel the generated electromagnetic fields, a technique used in twisted-pair Ethernet cable to eliminate cross-talk.|$|R
25|$|A common {{combination}} is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a gas chromatograph {{is used to}} separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the ion source, a metallic <b>filament</b> to which <b>voltage</b> is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.|$|R
50|$|The {{invention}} of the transistor in 1947 revolutionized radio technology, making truly portable receivers possible, beginning with transistor radios in the late 1950s. Although portable vacuum tube radios were made, tubes were bulky and inefficient, consuming large amounts of power and requiring several large batteries to produce the <b>filament</b> and plate <b>voltage.</b> Transistors did not require a heated filament, reducing power consumption, and were smaller and much less fragile than vacuum tubes.|$|R

Two wires of each color were provided for each circuit, and phasing was not identified by the color code.|$|E

Transmitters may be damaged if operated without an antenna, so protection circuits must detect {{the loss of the}} antenna and switch off the transmitter immediately. Tube-based transmitters must have power applied in the proper sequence, with the <b>filament</b> <b>voltage</b> applied before the anode voltage, otherwise the tubes can be damaged. The output stage must be monitored for standing waves, which indicate that generated power is not being radiated but instead is being reflected back into the transmitter.|$|E

25|$|Cold-cathode {{fluorescent}} lamps (CCFLs) {{have been made}} available {{in the form of}} CFLs. CCFLs use electrodes without a <b>filament.</b> The <b>voltage</b> of CCFLs is about 5 times higher than CFLs, and the current is about 10 times lower. CCFLs have a diameter of about 3 millimeters. CCFLs were initially used for document scanners and also for back-lighting LCD displays, and later manufactured for use as lamps. The efficacy (lumens per watt) is about half that of CFLs. CCFLs rely on the discharge itself to heat the electrodes which operate at similar temperatures to 'hot cathode' CFLs. CCFLs still have a significant warm up time (though modern electrode materials have mitigated this somewhat) and suffer similar sputtering of the electrodes when switched on cold which shortens their life. Their main advantage is much simpler driving circuitry.|$|R
25|$|Very low {{voltages}} are inefficient {{since the}} lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long <b>filaments</b> for high <b>voltages</b> are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts. Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.|$|R
50|$|Early TRF sets had {{typically}} two {{or three}} tuning knobs and tube filament voltage-control rheostats, all of {{which had to be}} set correctly to receive a station. Later (late 1920s) TRF sets had ganged tuning (one knob was used to control all stage tuning capacitors simultaneously), AC house current operation, and eliminated the <b>filament</b> <b>voltage</b> adjustments. All of these changes greatly simplified operation and made radio a household appliance that even a small child could operate, instead of the highly skilled hobbyists of the brief preceding generation. Reaction sets also had the filament adjustment rheostats for each valve, and again settings had to be right to achieve reception.|$|E

50|$|A {{different}} approach, using a Variac or a power scaling circuit, {{reduces the}} B+ supply voltage {{available to the}} power tubes thus producing power tube distortion at a reduced level such that all available output power {{is sent to the}} guitar speaker. The Variac method is not without risk, as the reduced heater voltage applied to the tubes can damage the filament and/or cathode if not operated within the manufacturer's specifications. In a power scaling circuit, by decreasing just the B+ plate voltage, the cathode bias and screen grid voltage decrease proportionately, while the <b>filament</b> <b>voltage</b> stays constant. However the term power attenuator may be a misnomer for this type of power control because lowering B+ voltage tends to increase distortion, whereas according to convention, an attenuator should not introduce distortion.|$|E
