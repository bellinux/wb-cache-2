The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E

5000|$|When EQ-5D {{was first}} developed, the scale {{used in the}} health state {{description}} part was three-level; <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>having</b> some or moderate problems, being unable to do/having extreme problems. As an example, three levels of mobility dimension are phrased as [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in walking about", [...] "I have some problems in walking about", and [...] "I am confined to bed". The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status of surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> for 1, <b>having</b> some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (<b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). 12321 indicates <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in mobility and anxiety/depression, having slight problems in self-care and pain/discomfort, and having extreme problems in usual activities. There are potentially 243 (=35) different health states.|$|R

Realizing that hrethgir will rule the universe, he suggests to Gilbertus that he teach the other humans to “think efficiently.” Erasmus apparently survives the battle when Gilbertus smuggles away his memory core.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{television}} commercial for Brazilian soft drink Guaraná Antarctica portrayed Maradona {{as a member}} of the Brazil national team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian caps Kaká and Ronaldo. Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it was a nightmare after having drunk too much of the drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air on the Argentine market, fans could see it online). Maradona replied that he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> in wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil having a tense rivalry in football, but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate, Boca Juniors' traditional rival. There is a documented phenomenon of Brazilians being named in honour of Maradona, an example being footballer Diego Costa.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{demographic}} and social network variables, independently of each other, are associated with quality of life (QoL), self-rated health or physical function. The sample consisted of 307 women aged 75 years. Social networks were assessed by Fillenbaum’s five questions and a question on ability to participate in organizations. Variables of demographic composition, QoL, health and physical function were registered. We found significant associations between social networks, QoL, health and physical functioning. Seeing friends and relatives as often as wanted, getting help when sick or disabled and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations were associated with higher QoL. Higher educational level, the ability to see friends and relatives as often as wanted and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations were associated with better health. Living alone, getting help when sick or disabled and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> participating in organizations indicated better mobility. Being younger, having higher education and <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in participating in organizations were associated with better balance. Higher scores on muscle strength were associated with being younger, not living alone and <b>having</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in participating in organizations. Our results highlight the importance of social networks for maintaining good QoL, health and physical functioning...|$|R

Five years ago, Khonani signed a contract to take the 11:30p.m. janitorial shift from Subhas and informs Jack that he is ready to start at the new time. Jack grants him permission, and calls a meeting with Subhas informing him that Khonani will take over the 11:30 shift. Subhas is not happy with this, so Jack decides to move him to 10:00p.m., which Subhas <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with. As he begins his scheduled shift, Khonani is unhappy with it as there is no trash to pick up because Subhas has already collected it.

Mukerji said, [...] "I play very different kinds of prostitutes in Saawariya and Laaga Chunari Mein Daag. The woman in Saawariya <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with her profession, whereas in the other film it's completely different". Saawariya was her only release in three years that was not produced by Yash Raj Films. The film was a box office flop and met with polarising reactions from the critics. Mukerji's performance was received favourably and she earned her second Filmfare nomination that year, this time for Best Supporting Actress. By the end of 2007, Mukerji's popularity had begun to wane.
