However, this correspondence or mapping has proven extremely difficult to find, even after some forty-five years of research on the problem.|$|E
25|$|In principle, {{the above}} {{equation}} completely describes {{the dynamics of}} an ensemble of gas particles, given appropriate boundary conditions. This first-order differential equation has a <b>deceptively</b> <b>simple</b> appearance, since ƒ can represent an arbitrary single-particle distribution function. Also, the force acting on the particles depends directly on the velocity distribution functionƒ. The Boltzmann equation is notoriously difficult to integrate. David Hilbert spent years trying to solve it without any real success.|$|E
25|$|The austere {{portrait}} in his normally constrained palette is another Whistler exercise in tonal harmony and composition. The <b>deceptively</b> <b>simple</b> design {{is in fact}} a balancing act of differing shapes, particularly the rectangles of curtain, picture on the wall, and floor which stabilize the curve of her face, dress, and chair. Again, although his mother is the subject, Whistler commented that the narrative was of little importance. In reality, however, it was an homage to his pious mother. After the initial shock of her moving in with her son, she aided him considerably by stabilizing his behavior somewhat, tending to his domestic needs, and providing an aura of conservative respectability that helped win over patrons.|$|E

This morphological diversity implies that different mechanisms exist to guide proper cell growth, division and chromosome segregation. Although the majority of studies on cell division have focused on rod-shaped cells, the development of new genetic and cell biology tools has provided mechanistic insight into the cell cycles of bacteria with different shapes, allowing us to appreciate the underlying molecular basis for their morphological diversity. In this Review, we discuss recent progress that has advanced our knowledge of the complex mechanisms for chromosome segregation and cell division in bacteria which have, <b>deceptively,</b> the <b>simplest</b> possible shape: the cocci. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{publication}} of the twelve books of La Fontaine's Fables extended from 1668 to 1694. The stories {{in the first six}} of these derive for the most part from Aesop and Horace and are pithily told in free verse. Those in the later editions are often taken from more recent sources or from translations of Eastern stories and are told at greater length. The <b>deceptively</b> <b>simple</b> verses are easily memorised, yet display deep insights into human nature. Many of the lines have entered the French language as standard phrases, often proverbial. The fables are also distinguished by their occasionally ironical ambivalence. The fable of “The Sculptor and the Statue of Jupiter” (IX.6), for example, reads like a satire on superstition, but its moralising conclusion that “All men, as far as in them lies,/Create realities of dreams” might equally be applied to religion as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Responding to its sentimental public, Argentine film {{at times}} returns to {{subjects}} of the heart. David Lipszyc's grainy portrait of depression-era Argentina, El astillero ("The Shipyard", 2000) was a hit with critics, Paula Hernandez's touching ode to immigrants, Inheritance (2001), {{has become something of}} a sleeper, Adolfo Aristarain's Common Places (2002) follows an elderly professor into retirement, Cleopatra (2003), Eduardo Mignona's tale of an unlikely friendship, received numerous awards, as did Carlos Sorín's touching El perro ("The Dog", 2004). Emotional negativity, a staple for filmmakers anywhere, was explored in Mario Sabato's India Pravile (2003), Francisco D'Intino's La esperanza (2005) and Ariel Rotter's El otro ("The Other", 2007) each deals with mid-life crises in very different ways. The pronounced sentimentality of the average Argentine was also the subject of Robert Duvall's 2002 Assassination Tango, a <b>deceptively</b> <b>simple</b> crime drama that shows that still waters do, indeed, run deep.|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} {{of human and}} other eukaryotic cells to recognize a disparate variety of damaged sites in DNA, and selectively excise and repair them, resides in a <b>deceptively</b> small <b>simple</b> protein, a 38 - 42 kDa zinc-finger binding protein, XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum group A), that has no inherent catalytic properties. One key to its damage-recognition ability resides in a DNA-binding domain which combines a zinc finger and a single-strand binding region which may infiltrate small single-stranded regions caused by helix-destabilizing lesions. Another is the augmentation of its binding capacity by interactions with other single-stranded binding proteins and helicases which co-operate in the binding and are unloaded at the binding site to facilitate further unwinding of the DNA and subsequent catalysis. The properties of these reactions suggest there must be considerable conformational changes in XPA and associated proteins to provide a flexible fit {{to a wide variety}} of damaged structures in the DNA...|$|R

Honeycutt wrote that due to its close adherence to the history the drama sagged at one point, but that the film did not feel as long as its 141 minutes because the filmmakers were [...] "good at cutting to the chase". Ansen said Straczynski's dialogue tended to the obvious, but that while the film lacked the moral nuance of Eastwood's others, the well-researched screenplay was [...] "a model of sturdy architecture", each layer of which built audience disgust into a [...] "fine fury".

They also added that original characters like Kirby were the stars of the Game Boy rather than established characters such as Link, Mario, Samus Aran, and Pit. They would again praise Kirby's Dream Land for being an original game in their [...] "History of the Game Boy" [...] article, adding that while [...] "attitude" [...] was common in new platforming mascots, Kirby was cheery and adorable, while the game featured [...] "breezy, casual gameplay and lighthearted atmosphere". GameSpy's Gerald Villoria, Brian Altano, and Ryan Scott called it [...] "basic" [...] compared to later titles in the series, adding that it lacked a sense of danger because Kirby could fly. Nintendo Power editors George and Bob shared roughly similar opinions of the game; George stated that it is a really fun game, owing its quality to its excellent play control and well thought out concept, while Bob stated that it is <b>deceptively</b> <b>simple</b> looking, when it in fact features a decent challenge for more experienced gamers.

Fitch likewise enjoyed the gameplay mechanics, but found the social elements {{to be less}} successful despite not actively irritating him. Moore praised the battle system {{and implementation of the}} Job system, although the latter necessitated grinding to unlock its full value. He also praised the ability to adjust encounter rates and battle speed, and positively noted the social features as engaging secondary activities. Marchiafava found that the battle and Job systems held up throughout the entire game, and like Moore found the social systems enjoyable. Nair was positive about the depth and strategy the gameplay opened up, despite criticizing the amount of options increasing {{the amount of time spent}} in battle. Both Evans and Robertson praised the battle system and general gameplay, with Robertson calling the former innovative within the genre. Riendeau found that the battle system's depth and quality gave her feelings of elation when she successfully killed opponents, but also saw the need to grind for experience emerging during the later stages of the game negatively impacted the experience. Parkin referred to the Bravely and Default systems as the game's [...] "central - and brilliant - conceit". Fuller, while finding the microtransactions a [...] "waste of money", he greatly enjoyed the battle mechanics and multiple user-friendly features. Halestorm shared the positive opinions of other reviewers on the battle system, alongside praising the game's amount and quality of content. Many reviewers positively compared the gameplay and style to earlier Final Fantasy games. Multiple western reviewers commented negatively on the repetitive late-game section.|$|E

'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor." [...] A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros.

[...] Amy Taubin from Film Comment said: [...] "The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is <b>deceptively</b> <b>simple</b> ... What's remarkable about Carol is that it seems to exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara." [...] David Stratton of The Australian wrote: [...] "The meeting of these two women is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors make it very clear that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight." ...|$|E
