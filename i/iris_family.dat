40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is the most}} common cause of severe visual impairment affecting older adults in the developed world. The pathogenesis of AMD is not fully understood. This study sought to investigate the association between macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and glare recovery time (GRT) with a selection of other confirmed and putative AMD risk factors (RF) : age, gender, body mass index (BMI), calculated percentage body fat (%BF), <b>iris</b> colour, <b>family</b> history (FH) of AMD, and ocular vascular perfusion (OVP) RF: migraine, Raynaud's phenomenon (Rph) and vascular dysregulation (VDys). Interocular comparison was assessed for MPOD and GRT. The effect of ocular dominance on MPOD and GRT, and GRT repeatability was also examined. The use of GRT as a surrogate measure for MPOD was assessed. In this healthy, mixed-gender, White population no significant association was found between MPOD measured by heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP) at 0. 5 ° eccentricity and any AMD or OVP RF assessed by this study. No significant interocular difference in MPOD was found. No significant association was found between MPOD and ocular dominance. GRT after 30 -second duration bleach using the direct ophthalmoscope was significantly and positively associated with age. No significant association was found for any other AMD or OVP RF examined, after correction for age. No significant interocular difference was found. No significant association was found with ocular dominance. GRT intra-session repeatability was good and inter-session repeatability was moderate. This method of GRT was not found to be a good surrogate measure for MPOD. This study generated three new theories: the possible association between the OVP RF migraine, Rph and VDys and AMD risk, the Müller cell (Mc) / neuroglial cell hypothesis for macular pigment, and the retinal theory for Meares-Irlen syndrome (MIS) also known as Visual Stress...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in twin births {{has created a}} requirement for biometric systems to accurately determine {{the identity of a}} person who has an identical twin. The discriminability of some of the identical twin biometric traits, such as fingerprints, iris, and palmprints, is supported by anatomy and the formation process of the biometric characteristic, which state they are different even in identical twins due to a number of random factors during the gestation period. For the first time, we collected multiple biometric traits (fingerprint, face, and <b>iris)</b> of 66 <b>families</b> of twins, and we performed unimodal and multimodal matching experiments to assess the ability of biometric systems in distinguishing identical twins. Our experiments show that unimodal finger biometric systems can distinguish two different persons who are not identical twins better than they can distinguish identical twins; this difference is much larger in the face biometric system and it is not significant in the iris biometric system. Multimodal biometric systems that combine different units of the same biometric modality (e. g. multiple fingerprints or left and right irises ∗) show the best performance among all the unimodal and multimodal biometric systems, achieving an almost perfect separation between genuine and impostor distributions...|$|R

40|$|The Panel Library and Editor is a {{graphical}} {{user interface}} (GUI) builder for the Silicon Graphics <b>IRIS</b> workstation <b>family.</b> The toolkit creates "widgets" which can be manipulated by the user. Its appearance {{is similar to that}} of the X-Windows System. The Panel Library is written in C and is used by programmers writing user-friendly mouse-driven applications for the IRIS. GUIs built using the Panel Library consist of "actuators" and "panels. " Actuators are buttons, dials, sliders, or other mouse-driven symbols. Panels are groups of actuators that occupy separate windows on the IRIS workstation. The application user can alter variables in the graphics program, or fire off functions with a click on a button. The evolution of data values can be tracked with meters and strip charts, and dialog boxes with text processing can be built. Panels can be stored as icons when not in use. The Panel Editor is a program used to interactively create and test panel library interfaces in a simple and efficient way. The Panel Editor itself uses a panel library interface, so all actions are mouse driven. Extensive context-sensitive on-line help is provided. Programmers can graphically create and test the user interface without writing a single line of code. Once an interface is judged satisfactory, the Panel Editor will dump it out as a file of C code that can be used in an application. The Panel Library (v 9. 8) and Editor (v 1. 1) are written in C-Language (63 %) and Scheme, a dialect of LISP, (37 %) for Silicon Graphics 4 D series workstations running IRIX 3. 2 or higher. Approximately 10 Mb of disk space is required once compiled. 1. 5 Mb of main memory is required to execute the panel editor. This program is available on a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format for an IRIS, and includes a copy of XScheme, the public-domain Scheme interpreter used by the Panel Editor. The Panel Library Programmer's Manual is included on the distribution media. The Panel Library and Editor were released to COSMIC in 1991.

40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. Objective: To {{describe the}} distribution and associations of demographic, familial, medical, and ocular factors with intraocular pressure (lOP). Methods: A cluster stratified random sample of urban and rural residents of Victoria, Australia, aged 40 years and older. Participants completed an interview and underwent a standardized dilated ophthalmic examination including measurement of IOP with an electronic applanation tonometer (Tono-Pen). Glaucoma status (possible, probable, definite) was determined by a consensus panel. The main outcome measure was IOP. Results: The {{mean age of the}} 4576 participants was 59 years, 53 % were women, 32 % were born overseas, and 132 had open-angle glaucoma. Geometric mean (SD) IOP was 14. 3 (± 1. 5) mm Hg. The relationship between IOP and nuclear sclerosis, <b>iris</b> color, and <b>family</b> history of glaucoma depended on glaucoma status. In those with glaucoma, family history of glaucoma and country of birth were significantly associated with IOP in multivariate models (model: r²= 0. 08, P= 0. 01). In the group without glaucoma, place of residence, use of alcohol, iris color, vitamin E intake, and spherical equivalent were associated with IOP (model: r²= 0. 01, P=. 006). Conclusion: In participants with glaucoma, genetic factors seem to be stronger predictors of IOP, whereas in those without glaucoma, lifestyle and physiological factors seem to play a greater role.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} {{the suitability of}} the threatened species, Iris pumila L., as a possible bioindicator of traffic pollution in its natural habitats (mostly protected areas and natural reserves). We examined its potential to accumulate lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni) in polluted habitats, and the genetic variability for this capability, since {{it is an important}} facet of bioindicator suitability. We estimated the concentrations of Pb and Ni in the leaves of 17 I. pumila clones (genotypes) grown in one of their natural habitats, the unpolluted semi-arid habitat of the protected Deliblato Sands Special Natural Reserve, and in the leaves of 18 <b>Iris</b> pumila full-sib <b>families</b> grown in an experimental plot in a heavily polluted urban location in Belgrade, Serbia. Comparison of the contrasting habitats by one-way ANOVA analysis showed that both Pb and Ni concentrations were significantly higher (six-fold) in the I. pumila leaves collected from plants grown in the polluted urban habitat. Two-way ANOVA (randomized block design) analysis performed on the full-sib families grown in the urban location failed to detect significant genetic variation for metal accumulation in I. pumila leaves. A significant block effect on the concentration of Ni in leaves was detected, indicating responsiveness to microenvironmental variability. These results suggest that I. pumila can serve as a good indicator of traffic pollution in protected areas. The response is stable since genetic variability of I. pumila populations does not appear to influence its role as an indicator greatly. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.
