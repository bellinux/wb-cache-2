25|$|I recall my thrilled first exposure, as a teenager, {{to one of}} his long-necked women, {{with their}} piquantly tipped heads and mask-like faces. The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp that I was. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> I used up Modigliani's value for my life.

What were their individual breaking points? And if they did break, would they stay broken or grope toward a recovery? ...|$|E

His father Leonard was a court stenographer and a World War II veteran in the United States Navy. His mother Eleanor was an artist whose parents were Jewish immigrants living and working in the city's Garment District. When Gould was five years old his father took him to the Hall of Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History, where he first encountered Tyrannosaurus rex.

I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb.

500|$|Shostakovich scholar Laurel Fay {{suggests}} that this concert was [...] "an event of legendary import all by itself". Journalist Michael Tumely calls it [...] "a legendary moment in Soviet political and military history". Critic U.S. Dhuga {{suggests that}} this performance [...] "was popularly – and, of course, officially – recognized as the prelude to actual victory over the Germans". The blockade was breached in early 1943 and ended in 1944. Eliasberg concurred with Dhuga's assessment, saying that [...] "the whole city had found its humanity... <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine". There was no official recognition {{of the significance of}} the concert: one musician noted that afterwards [...] "there was no feedback, nothing until 1945".|$|E
500|$|Discussing Simmons' {{actions in}} the episode, Henstridge noted that the {{previous}} episodes in the season had established the character's new position high in the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy so that this episode could see her abuse that power, using her position to help her friends, including the now ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Johnson, rather than the agency of its director. Henstridge said that [...] "this is the whole reason that she [...] {{but it is a}} turning point for because <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> she could've gone the other way" [...] and chose to protect her new position. Henstridge appreciated the episode exploring the relationship between Simmons and Johnson, feeling that there was [...] "so much bad blood" [...] between them after the events of the third season that could be explored. She compared this to a relationship between sisters.|$|E

500|$|According to Lopez, {{the song}} is about missing someone terribly; [...] "someone who is missing someone so much and has done {{something}} so wrong to the person that they know they can't fix it. So they just hate themselves right <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> they can't stand , they regret everything that they did and they wish they could change things." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted the chorus of [...] "Me Haces Falta" [...] to be self-loathing, with the lines: [...] "Tú me haces falta/Sí, me arrepiento/Me odio/Estoy desesperada" [...] (English: [...] "I miss you/Yes, I repent/I hate myself/I'm desperate").

500|$|Jackman also {{watched a}} woman undergo brain tumor surgery and was shaken {{to see the}} woman have similar blond hair to his wife: [...] "All I {{could think of was}} my wife on that table.

[...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders."

500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again.

Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> the cold will do that.

500|$|In 1971, Erik Hornung {{published}} a study rebutting these views. He {{points out that}} in any given period many deities, even minor ones, were described as superior to all others. He also argues that the unspecified [...] "god" [...] in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity the reader chooses to revere. Although the combinations, manifestations, and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting, they were always restricted to a finite number of forms, never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way. Henotheism, Hornung says, describes Egyptian religion better than other labels. An Egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on. Hornung concludes that the gods were fully unified only in myth, at the time before creation, after which the multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence.|$|E
500|$|Ben Parker's {{wife and}} Peter's aunt. Field said {{the main reason}} {{she felt she had}} to be in the film was because of {{producer}} Laura Ziskin (they worked together on the 1985 film Murphy's Romance) because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that [...] "when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have." [...] Webb said that while [...] "we all love Aunt May", he wanted to create a tension between May and Peter.

Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

500|$|Kunal Guha of the Mumbai Mirror lauded the film's {{direction}} and cinematography saying, [...] "Menon has the tenacity of a Sofia Coppola to produce frames where not much happens but one {{is unable to}} look away", and concluded, [...] "The film deserves a watch for being one that doesn't try too hard and for its approach to an extreme situation." [...] Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle, while also praising the technical expertise, said, [...] "Neha Parti Matiyani beautifully captures the beautiful city of Kochi" [...] and called the film [...] "unmissable" [...] saying, [...] "'Waiting' is a refreshing subject that is engaging enough right up till its open ended climax."

500|$|The idea of {{the film}} {{initially}} came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence.

[...] "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', {{and it was like}} whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script. I was very inspired by that, and tried to do that in [...] And a lot of the feelings you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory." ...|$|E

From that point on, Sakura becomes very distant from the group, especially the newly arrived original Syaoran, because of his similarities to the clone whom she has come to know.
