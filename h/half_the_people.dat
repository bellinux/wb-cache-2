5|$|Action T4 was a {{programme}} {{of systematic}} {{murder of the}} physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that mainly took place from 1939 to 1941 and continued {{until the end of}} the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; in addition gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the provisions of a law promulgated 14 July 1933, the Nazi regime carried out the compulsory sterilisation of over 400,000 individuals labelled as having hereditary defects. More than <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> sterilised were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour and cleanliness. Mentally and physically ill people were also targeted. The majority of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless and criminals. Other groups persecuted and killed included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits and members of the political and religious opposition.|$|E

In the 18th century, the main land was explored by Samuel Hearne for the Hudson's Bay Company and by Alexander Mackenzie.

25|$|In September 1745, {{during the}} Jacobite rising of 1745, the {{advancing}} Jacobite army of Prince Charles Edward Stuart was heading towards Edinburgh, {{but in order}} to get there had to pass by Stirling Castle which was being held by British-Hanoverian forces under the command of Major General William Blakeney. On 14 September the Jacobites squeezed through the space between the extremity of the Touch Hills and the castle rock, bringing them within range of Blakeney’s artillery. Blakeney opened fire at the Jacobite’s white flag hoping to hit the Chevalier (Stuart) himself, but the bullet landed about twenty yards from him. He fired four times but without success, the cannon being only a 6-pounder and at a distance of a mile and a <b>half.</b> <b>The</b> <b>people</b> of Stirling then emerged to watch the Jacobites pass through St. Ninians {{on the far side of}} the narrows. The Prince and the Jacobites had at that time no intention of conflict with the Red coats in Stirling Castle and instead had their sights set firmly on Edinburgh.|$|E

500|$|Historian Annette Atkins has {{explored}} the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics. [...] In {{the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms. [...] Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer-Labor party in the 1930s. [...] Isolationism was strong, Atkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s. [...] In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened. [...] Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength. [...] Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> live. [...] The state high income tax is troublesome, and complaints are often heard about to generous welfare benefits. [...] The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue. [...] State government has become much more friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship. [...] Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists.

500|$|The {{paintings}} were composed within {{several years of}} Alexander coming to power. His father and predecessor, King Milan, was so unpopular {{that he had to}} abdicate his throne. Alexander's reign was marked by protracted political instability, culminating in the coup d'état that resulted in his death. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson believes The Takovo Uprising was composed in response to the chaotic political climate. She writes: [...] The painting, she asserts, was to serve as [...] "a reminder of Serb achievements during and after the Second Uprising, and of the leadership that made those successes possible." [...] Jovanović's positioning Obrenović slightly left of centre ensures that he fully dominates the scene. [...] "The brown soil and gravestones of the churchyard," [...] Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "stand as reminders of the transitory nature of physical life". The political scientist Anamaria Segesten suggests that the portrayal of Obrenović wearing Turkish clothing, particularly a turban, might be a reference to his collaboration with the Ottomans prior to the uprising, and his adoption of Ottoman customs while staying in Istanbul. She notes that <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> gathered around Obrenović are also wearing Turkish clothes, signifying that while they might temporarily have professed loyalty to the Ottoman sultan, they are actually patriots willing to rise up and fight for the Serbian cause when the moment is right. [...] "While clearly caught up in the emotion of the moment," [...] Filipovitch-Robinson writes, [...] "they are solid and dignified, ordinary people united by shared beliefs and a common cause." ...|$|E
