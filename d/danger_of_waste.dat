People who depend on river would be cried out. Though the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> so clear and invite people to react, it didn’t mean that every entrepreneur would love to process the waste. Since the thinking pattern of the society {{about the importance of}} processing waste hadn’t formed. That’s why the government should take part by making Installation of Waste Processing. (Instalasi Pengolahan Air Limbah – IPAL). Every action to disturb the environment would cause a reaction from people. The good and health environment is a right for everybody. The people reaction were various like protest, complaint, and claim to loss which caused by the negative effect of industrial waste. Magetan Regional Government in handling the waste developed two program : short and long scale programs. Short scale program was done through : (1) LIK operated Installation of Waste Processing. (Instalasi Pengolahan Air Limbah – IPAL) in optimal way; (2) Build new Installation of Waste Processing. (Instalasi Pengolahan Air Limbah – IPAL). For middle scale program, the government applied a waste handling program : (1) relocation development; (2) proportional way in processing waste. The problem statement in this research were : (1) How the application of government program in eradicating leather industry waste at Magetan Residence. (2) What kind of supporting and inhibiting factor in handling leather industry waste at Magetan residence. This research aimed to : (1) find out the application of regional government program in eradicating the leather waste of leather organization at Magetan; (2) find out the supporting factors and inhibiting factors in eradicating water waste of leather company at Magetan. Descriptive research was : “descriptive meant to explore and classify a phenomena or social fact, by describe several variables related with researched problems and unit. This research didn’t consider about the relation between variable”. To support the research, the writer used data collection technique : (1) Observation; (2) in-depth interview; (3) documentation. Data analysis technique which would be used in this research was interactive model, where the general concept stated that there were three thins in analysis which were cycle and interactive process between four axis along data collection, and move back and forth among reduction, data served, and conclusion. According to the previous research proved : (1) government program in eradicating water waste of leather organization at Magetan was done by short and moderate scale program. In short scale program, the government could operate Installation of Waste Processing.

Exposure to {{atmospheric}} PMS, PAHS, PCDD/FS and metals near an {{open air}} waste burning site in Beirut. Lebanese Science Journal, 17 (2) : 91 - 103. 			Since July 2015, Lebanon has experienced the worst {{solid waste management}} crisis in its history. Consequently, open-air waste burning {{in the vicinity of}} highly populated areas in Beirut has become a common practice. This study evaluates the effects of open-air dumping and burning on local air quality and public health. The levels of particulate matter (PM 10, PM 2. 5), gaseous and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), and particle-bound metals at a residence close to waste burning are reported. Concentrations, determined between October 2 and December 2, 2015, were compared either to previous measurements or to measurements taken away from a nearby burning incident, and after it had rained. Subsequently, the cancer risk due to exposure to these chemicals was assessed. Results showed alarming increases in pollutant concentrations which was translated into an increase in short-term cancer risk from about 1 to 20 people per million on the days when waste was being burned. Findings were shared with the public to warn the community against the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> mismanagement, and underline the obvious need for solid waste management at the governmental and municipal levels...|$|R

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) while the hazardous components in the waste are regulated by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED). This paper addresses monitoring relating to radionuclide containment performance, passive institutional controls, and record keeping over a 10, 000 -year time frame. Monitoring relating to the hazardous components and the associated regulator are not addressed in this paper. The WIPP containment performance is mandated by release limits set by regulation. Regulations also require the radioactive <b>waste</b> containment performance <b>of</b> the WIPP to be predicted by a ''Performance Assessment. '' The EPA did not base the acceptance of the WIPP solely on predicted containment but included additional assurance measures. One such assurance measure is monitoring, which may be defined as the on-going measurement of conditions in and around the repository. This case study {{describes the}} evolution of the WIPP monitoring program as the WIPP project progressed through the planning, site characterization, regulatory promulgation, and eventual operational stages that spanned a period of over 25 years. Included are discussions of the regulatory requirements for monitoring, selection of monitoring parameters, trigger values used to identify unexpected conditions, assessment of monitoring data against the trigger values, and plans for post-closure monitoring. The United EPA established the requirements for Passive Institutional Controls (PICs) for disposal sites. The requirements state the a disposal site must be designated by the most permanent markers, records, and other passive institutional controls practicable to indicate the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wastes</b> and their location.

Citation counts of articles and the relationship between the misuse rate and impact factor, immediacy index, or cited half-life were also evaluated. Materials and methods: All original articles in the four selected journals published in 2011 were searched for descriptive statistics reporting with either mean ± SD or mean ± SEM. The impact factor, immediacy index, and cited half-life of the journals were gathered from Journal Citation Reports Science edition 2011. Scopus was used to search for citations of individual articles. The difference in citation counts between the SD group and SEM group was tested by the Mann–Whitney U test. The relationship between the misuse rate and impact factor, immediacy index, or cited half-life was also evaluated. Results: The frequency of inappropriate reporting of SEM was 13. 60 % for all four journals. For individual journals, the misuse rate was from 2. 9 % in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica to 22. 68 % in American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Articles using SEM were cited more frequently than those using SD (p =  0. 025). An approximate positive correlation between the misuse rate and cited half-life was observed. Conclusion: Inappropriate reporting of SEM is common in medical journals.

The purposes of this illustrative case study were to identify the process of communicating recycling and the modes of persuasion that led behavior change of Hamlet villagers from past behavior to recycling behavior. To collect data, direct observation and semi-structured interviews were conducted in Hamlet in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. This study identified the process of communicating recycling in Hamlet can be divided into six stages: introducing the idea of recycling to the family, relying on the local leaders, communicating to a small group of Hamlet villagers, getting acceptance of Hamlet villagers, seeking involvement of Hamlet villagers and establishing social recognition. In line with theory of planned behavior, behavior change can be seen from persuasive messages that have been aimed to change attitude, normative beliefs and perceived behavioral control. To change attitude, the persuaders provided information that raised awareness of “waste as a problem” and communicated recycling in accordance with Islamic faith and Javanese culture. With respect to normative beliefs, they used commitment technique and block leader approach to convince “other people are doing recycling. ” While to ease villagers in performing recycling behavior (perceived behavioral control), they conveyed message that “recycling is easy”, emphasized income generation, encouraged involvement and recruited new generation of persuaders. Further, this study found the persuaders used ethos by presenting credibility, humility and trustworthy.
