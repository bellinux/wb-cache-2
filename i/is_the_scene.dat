5|$|In New Zealand, Malone's {{death was}} widely {{reported}} and keenly felt, {{particularly in the}} Taranaki region. The soldiers of the Wellington Regiment held their former commander in high regard and paid {{for the construction of}} the Malone Memorial Gate, white marble gates at the entrance to King Edward Park in Stratford. The gate, one of New Zealand's largest war memorials that commemorates an individual soldier, was officially opened on 8 August 1923 in front of a large crowd. The gate <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of an annual ceremony held on 8 August to commemorate the memory of Malone. A fictionalised colonel based on Malone was a major character in a 1982 play written by Maurice Shadbolt, Once on Chunuk Bair, which told the story of the Wellington Battalion's battle of 8 August. In 1992, the play was filmed as Chunuk Bair. A plaque in his honour was unveiled in the New Zealand Parliament's Grand Hall in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Aegean Sea setting {{includes}} {{a mass of}} shipwrecked vessels. Athens is a war-torn city under assault by Ares, the God of War; beyond the city is the Desert of Lost Souls, a vast and windy desert of ancient ruins. The majority of the game occurs in Pandora’s Temple, which is chained {{to the back of}} the Titan Cronos, who crawls through the desert. The massive temple, constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III, is filled with traps and monsters, and has three sections dedicated to the Titan Atlas and gods Poseidon and Hades, respectively. The Underworld is a fiery realm with spiked pillars full of souls and flaming versions of previously encountered enemies. Athens <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of the final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War's throne room.|$|E
5|$|The Front of the Stage is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, {{with the}} Harpsicals and Theorbo's which {{accompany}} the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd {{to the great}} Pylasters, {{on each side of}} the Stage... Behind this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Scene,</b> which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.|$|E

25|$|Mucianus invaded Rome on December 20 of 69, {{and quickly}} {{defeated}} {{the forces of}} Vitellius.

Vespasian returned to Rome in late September 70, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> historians believe to be depicted on Frieze B.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{well-known}} sequences of the film <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of a train robbery at night time. Cinematographer Roger Deakins used various cinematographic techniques to give the train more of a presence when it was in pitch darkness. The idea was to generate a sense of forbidding atmosphere by using only the lanterns held up by the outlaws and the 5K PAR light mounted {{on the front of}} the train In order to enhance the blacks, Deakins did a slight bleach bypass on the negative, which was especially important in terms of rendering detail.|$|E
25|$|The chapel of Santa Ana {{is located}} in the north of the town. Its facade is very sober and {{contains}} a medallion of the saint, which was placed there in 1973. Inside, the saint is represented along the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus. This is the only chapel which does not have a canon vault but rather a gothic style one. Each year, pilgrims to Chalma leave from and return to this chapel. The neighborhood around it, called Barrio Norte or Barrio Santa Ana was the traditional exit to Mexico City. The chapel of Santa Ana <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of the commemoration of the Virgen de los Dolores (Virgin of the Sorrows) on the sixth Friday of Lent and the Procession of the Holy Burial (Santo Entierro) during Holy Week.|$|E
25|$|It is {{somewhat}} infrequent for {{the core of}} a large city to be hit directly by a tornado (due to their relatively small area and the relative lack of large cities in the highest tornado threat region)—especially a large intense tornado—yet several other tornadoes have tracked through the City of St. Louis and several of these tornadoes were also very deadly and destructive. Among these events are: 1871 (9 killed), 1890 (4 killed), 1904 (3 killed, 100 injured), 1927 (79 killed, 550 injured, once the 2nd costliest in US history), and 1959 (21 killed, 345 injured). This makes St. Louis the worst tornado afflicted urban area in the U.S. Additionally, the Greater St. Louis area <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> of even more historically destructive and deadly tornadoes. Oklahoma City is the metropolitan area with the most frequent significant tornadoes.|$|E
