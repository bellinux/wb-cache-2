This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally <b>hot</b> <b>liquids</b> and rocks onto attackers.|$|E

They are built into the walls and are used by the {{soldiers}} on the inside to pour molten lead or other <b>hot</b> <b>liquids</b> on soldiers trying to scale the walls. The Rohtas Fort has hundreds of them and each one is beautifully decorated with geometric patterns. The pictures is of a machicolation near the Langar Khana (Mess Hall).|$|E
40|$|Effect {{of an air}} gap on {{the heat}} {{transfer}} of protective materials upon <b>hot</b> <b>liquid</b> splashes Yehu Lu 1, Guowen Song 2, Jun Li 1, 3 and Stephen Paskaluk 2 The thermal protective performance of fabrics against <b>hot</b> <b>liquid</b> splashes was investigated under different configurations. The air gap of 6 mm between specimen and sensor was simulated and compared with direct contact configuration. Three liquids (distilled water, canola oil, drilling mud) at 85 C were applied as challenge <b>hot</b> <b>liquid</b> hazards. The results showed that fabric permeability significantly affected heat transfer due to the occurrence of mass transfer both with and without a spacer. The absorbed energy and second-degree burn time presented significantly negative correlation. The effect of air gap on thermal performance was investigated. The findings demonstrated that minimizing mass transfer could effectively improve thermal protection against <b>hot</b> <b>liquid</b> splashes and the existing of an air layer could improve thermal performance.

500|$|A burn {{is a type}} {{of injury}} to [...] skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from <b>hot</b> <b>liquids,</b> solids, or fire. While rates are similar for males and females the {{underlying}} causes often differ. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people.|$|E
2500|$|The {{enormous}} stone bridge {{constructed by}} Sultan Ghazi over the moat {{led to an}} imposing bent entrance complex. Would-be assailants to the castle {{would have to take}} over six turns up a vaulted entrance ramp, over which were machicolations for pouring <b>hot</b> <b>liquids</b> on attackers from the mezzanine above. Secret passageways wind through the complex, and the main passages are decorated with figurative reliefs. The Ayyubid block is topped by the Mamluk [...] "Throne Hall", a hall where Mamluk sultans entertained large audiences and held official functions.|$|E

50|$|Old {{thermometers}} {{were all}} non-registering thermometers. That is, the thermometer {{did not hold}} the temperature after it was moved to a place with a different temperature. Determining the temperature of a pot of <b>hot</b> <b>liquid</b> required the user to leave the thermometer in the <b>hot</b> <b>liquid</b> until after reading it. If the non-registering thermometer {{was removed from the}} <b>hot</b> <b>liquid,</b> then the temperature indicated on the thermometer would immediately begin changing to reflect the temperature of its new conditions (in this case, the air temperature). Registering thermometers are designed to hold the temperature indefinitely, so that the thermometer can be removed and read at a later time or in a more convenient place. Mechanical registering thermometers hold either the highest or lowest temperature recorded, until manually re-set, e.g., by shaking down a mercury-in-glass thermometer, or until an even more extreme temperature is experienced. Electronic registering thermometers may be designed to remember the highest or lowest temperature, or to remember whatever temperature was present at a specified point in time.|$|R
