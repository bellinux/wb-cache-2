Gate-level 3 D circuits with uncertain component delays are analyzed, and safe bounds on timing constraints for <b>correct</b> <b>circuit</b> operation are computed.

The non-deterministic nature of teleportation necessitates the conditional introduction of corrective quantum gates and additional ancillae during circuit execution.

Introduction As feature size of CMOS technology decreases, the balance between gate and wire delays is going worse, with wiring delays moving into dominance. The dominant wire delay causes many troubles in synchronous designs: since wire delays depend on the final physical design, the system performance strongly depends on physical implementation, so many design cycles are needed to obtain a <b>correct</b> <b>circuit.</b> Delay-insensitive asynchronous communication can simplify design, reducing sensitivity to circuit delays; nevertheless, conventional delay-insensitive techniques (i. e. dual-rail coding) are expensive in terms of energy [1] [...] ...|$|R

Although the framework does not guarantee existence of such an implementation, nor its discovery, it does provide a characterization of architectural implementation so that the question "is this a correct implementation?" can be answered by equational rewriting.
