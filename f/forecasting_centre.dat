40|$|Data {{assimilation}} is {{the process}} of finding the best estimate of the current state of a system. In numerical weather prediction (NWP) this system is the atmosphere and oceans.

The validity of the fundamental assumption that the errors in the transformed variables are uncorrelated is tested in a variety of dynamical regimes. The results show that the errors in the PV-based variables are uncorrelated across all regimes tested. This is not the case, however, for the vorticitybased variables. This suggests that the PV-based control variables imply a better representation of the background errors than the current vorticity-based variables. 2...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the year}} 2010 the Flood <b>Forecasting</b> <b>Centre</b> (FFC) {{calibrated}} and implemented a distributed flood forecasting model {{to support the}} FFC’s remit to provide flood risk forecasts across England and Wales, UK. The distributed nature of the model, designed to run at 15 -min time-steps on a 1 km 2 grid, enables the spatial variability of rainfall measurements and forecasts, rather than lumped catchment averages, to be captured. Such a distributed model should therefore benefit greatly from the spatial and temporal resolution afforded by radar observations. Initial results have highlighted {{the importance of the}} quality of the gridded rainfall fields and in a number of cases erroneous radar rainfall data have been shown to contribute to poor model performance. It is suggested that gridded datasets of sufficient quality will be best provided by capturing the spatial variability inherent in radar data together with raingauge data in a merged product...|$|E
