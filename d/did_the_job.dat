25|$|Maintaining a {{comfortable}} temperature inside {{such a large}} glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely {{on the fact that}} they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors {{at the end of each}} day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> perfectly.|$|E
500|$|Michigan {{started the}} 1975 season ranked #3 in the country, {{and moved into}} the [...] #2 spot with a 23–6 win over Wisconsin in the season opener. [...] Despite being {{hampered}} by a muscle pull, Bell still rushed for 210yards in 28carries against Wisconsin. [...] After the game, Bell noted that he [...] "couldn't cut as well as (he) would have liked," [...] but he played through the injury realizing that, as a senior, [...] "the coaches expect us to show the way." [...] On being named the UPI's Midwest Back of the Week, Bell noted, [...] "It's really {{an honor to be}} recognized like that, {{but you have to have}} a lot of help out there. [...] I thought Rick Leach was just super in the game. [...] He sure didn't look like a freshman. [...] And our offensive line <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> despite having so many sophomores in there." [...] Bell's 210-yard performance against Wisconsin stood as the school record in a season opener for 28years until Chris Perry rushed for 232 yards in the 2003 season opener against Central Michigan.|$|E

500|$|The Honda Juno {{had been}} the first scooter to use {{polyester}} resin, or fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP), bodywork, and even though production of the Juno had stopped in 1954 as a result of Honda Motor's financial and labor problems at the time, Fujisawa continued to encourage research in polyester resin casting techniques, and these efforts bore fruit for the Super Cub. The new motorcycle's fairing would be polyethylene, the most widely used plastic, which reduced weight over FRP, but Honda's supplier had never made such a large die cast before, so the die had to be provided by Honda. The Super Cub was the first motorcycle ever to use a plastic fairing. Motorcycling historian Clement Salvadori wrote that the plastic front fender and leg shields were, [...] "perhaps the Cub's greatest contribution; plastic <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> just as well as metal at considerably lower cost." [...] The technology developed in the Isle of Man TT racing program was equally vital to the new lightweight motorcycle, making possible [...] from a 50cc four-stroke Honda engine, where the first engine the company built a decade earlier, a [...] "fairly exact copy" [...] of the 50cc two stroke war-surplus Tohatsu engine Honda had been selling as motorized bicycle auxiliary engine, had only a [...] output. Honda's first four stroke, the 1951 E-type, had just a little more power than the Super Cub, , [...] with nearly triple the displacement, [...]|$|E

2500|$|Five {{pitchers}} {{who were}} primarily relievers have been {{inducted into the}} Baseball Hall of Fame. Hoyt Wilhelm {{was the first to}} be elected in 1985, followed by Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley, Bruce Sutter, and Goose Gossage. Eckersley was the first closer in the one-inning save era to be inducted. He believed that he was inducted because he was both a starter and a reliever. [...] "If I came up today as a closer and played 20 years, would I have made it ? These pitchers <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> they were supposed to do for 20 years. What else are they supposed to do?" [...] said Eckersley.|$|E
2500|$|However, Clark was {{determined}} that VI Corps should strike directly for Rome as evidenced in his later writing: [...] "We not only wanted the honor of capturing Rome, but felt that we deserved it... Not only did we intend {{to become the first}} army to seize Rome from the south, but we intended to see that people at home knew that it was the Fifth Army that <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> and knew the price that had been paid for it." [...] He argued to Alexander that VICorps did not have the strength to trap the German 10th Army and Alexander, instead of making his requirements clear, was conciliatory and gave the impression that a push on Rome was still a possibility if Buffalo ran into difficulties. On May6, Clark informed Truscott that [...] "..the capture of Rome is the only important objective and to be ready to execute Turtle as well as Buffalo".|$|E
2500|$|Newly crowned {{champion}} di Grassi said of {{his title}} success, [...] "This journey, this day started {{three years ago when}} we started season one, and then {{we got a lot of}} good results. I arrived in London fighting for the championship, even though I got disqualified from winning a race. Season two, the same situation, even got disqualified from winning a race. Finally I came here as an underdog, 10 points behind and had the nerves to keep calm, I <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> yesterday and today managed to win it also. I’m so happy for my team, so happy for the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to have not given up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Di Grassi was delighted with his victory, calling it [...] "the best day in my Formula E career" [...] and reserved praise for his team after they used much of their energy to understand their lack of competitiveness at the preceding New York City races. He felt the secret was to remain calm and exercise what the driver could do to motivate the people he/she is surrounded by for the season's remaining races, [...] "Formula E can go from heaven to hell in one lap or one decision or one problem. Today we <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Tomorrow is a completely different day, a completely different environment. We’re {{going to try to}} do the same as we did here.” Vergne spoke of his happiness over his team's growing strength and their double podium finish. He said he was hit from both sides at the race's start, causing him to lose positions, but spoke highly of his car, [...] " [...] I thought the car was just perfect and was able to push really hard. I was catching everyone in front, using less energy than them, so I think the strategy was really nice.” Third-place finisher Sarrazin stated that he was down on pace and became aware of Buemi closing on him by glancing at his rear-view mirrors. However, he was aware Buemi was challenging for the championship.|$|E
2500|$|At Sydney, Terry Jenner retired {{hurt when}} he ducked into a short {{delivery}} from Snow {{in the first}} innings. Umpire Lou Rowan warned the fast bowler for intimidatory bowling yet again, but Snow and Illingworth objected strongly, the captain saying [...] "That's the only bouncer he's bowled" [...] {{and that he would}} complain to the A.C.B. Rowan later claimed that Illingworth and Snow swore at him, which they denied. The bowler was loudly booed and [...] "when he returned to his fielding position at long-leg Snow was pelted with bottles, cans and eaten pies". Some of the crowd wanted to shake his hand, but then he was grabbed by a drunk [...] at Paddington Hill who was forced to let go by other spectators. In 1998 the eighty-year-old Trevor Guy told the Sydney Morning Herald that he was the man who had grabbed Snow in order to tell him what he thought about him hitting Jenner. Guy and Snow, in Australia for the 1998–99 Ashes series agreed that they had no hard feelings. To avoid injury to his team, Illingworth took his men back to the dressing room without the permission of the umpires, an unprecedented move in Test cricket. The England manager Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field and Alan Barnes of the A.C.B. demanded that they return immediately or they would forfeit the match and the Ashes. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down. Furthermore, he strongly objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. It took seven minutes for the groundstaff to move the debris, during which one was hit on the head with a beer-can and had to be taken to hospital. Jenner returned to bat at 235–8 and made a brave 30, last man out on 264 to give Australia a lead of 80 runs. England made 302 in their second innings and set Australia 223 to win. Snow took a wicket in his first over, but smashed his finger on the wooden boundary fence trying to catch a six off Keith Stackpole. He was taken to hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic to reconstruct his shattered finger bones. England's spinners <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> dismissing Australia for 160 to win by 62 runs and regain The Ashes while Snow was on the operating table. He recovered in time to join in [...] "the champagne-filled, beer-laden, hangover-inducing rejoicings of Sydney". Snow's 31 wickets (22.83) was the most by an England bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood's 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932–33. No England bowler after Snow has taken 25 wickets in a Test series in Australia.|$|E
