50|$|In 2007 a {{congestion}} pricing scheme was implemented, the Controlled Vehicular Access system, {{in order to}} reduce long-term parking stays and traffic while promoting business in the city. An ANPR-based automated system takes photos of vehicles as they enter and exit the charging zone and vehicle owners are billed according to the duration of their stay. Various exemptions and <b>flexible</b> <b>billing</b> rules make the system the next evolutionary step of systems like the London congestion charge programme. Main differences from the London system include ex post invoicing (with financial incentives/penalties for early/late payment), prepayments not day-specific, hourly instead of daily rates, a maximum daily charge (8 hours), free dashes (free if duration under 30 minutes), defined free access periods for delivery and service vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Advanced {{metering}} {{systems can}} provide benefits for utilities, retail providers and customers. Benefits will {{be recognized by}} the utilities with increased efficiencies, outage detection, tamper notification and reduced labor cost {{as a result of}} automating reads, connections and disconnects. Retail providers will be able to offer new innovative products in addition to customizing packages for their customers. In addition, with the meter data being readily available, more <b>flexible</b> <b>billing</b> cycles would be available to their customers instead of following the standard utility read cycles. With timely usage information available to the customer, benefits will be seen through opportunities to manage their energy consumption and change from one REP to another with actual meter data. Because of these benefits, many utilities are moving towards implementing some types of AMR solutions.|$|E

Huia were omnivorous and ate adult insects, grubs and spiders, as well as the fruits of a small number of native plants. Males and females used their beaks to feed in different ways: the male used his bill to chisel away at rotting wood, while the female's longer, more <b>flexible</b> <b>bill</b> was able to probe deeper areas. Even though the huia is frequently mentioned in biology and ornithology textbooks because of this striking dimorphism, not much is known about its biology; it was little studied before it was driven to extinction.|$|R

30|$|In {{the last}} few years, the use of cloud {{services}} has become widespread. According to International Data Corporation (IDC) [37], public spending on cloud services is estimated to reach $ 107 billion by the year 2017. A large number of cloud service providers (CSP), service brokers, and customers are increasingly taking advantage of cloud features such as elasticity, scalability, universal access, low entry cost, <b>flexible</b> <b>billing,</b> easy metering, and convenient monitoring. Despite the increase in demand and popularity, there are major challenges in moving a business to the cloud, such as compliance, security, and privacy. There are many works considering security and privacy in clouds but we are concerned here only with compliance aspects, which have strong relation to those attributes; in fact, there are relatively few works dealing mostly with compliance aspects.|$|E
30|$|Features such as elasticity, scalability, {{universal}} access, low entry cost, and <b>flexible</b> <b>billing</b> motivate {{consumers to}} migrate their core businesses to the cloud. However, {{in doing so}} there are challenges about security, privacy, and compliance. Businesses are pressured to comply with regulations depending on their service types; for example, in the US government agencies are required to comply with FISMA, healthcare organizations are required to comply with HIPAA; public retail companies must to comply with SOX and PCI. We survey work on compliance issues and we conclude {{that the lack of}} reference architectures and relevant patterns makes compliance harder than it should be. We also explore current industrial trends of compliance approaches. We end by summarizing compliance issues and give some guidelines about what this architecture and its corresponding patterns should contain.|$|E

Since the service choice is a complicated task in a competitive en-vironment we propose a software agent which purchases services on behalf of the user. The user agent is also supported by an agent for evaluating delivered services. At the ISP site, a <b>flexible</b> <b>billing</b> and accounting sys-tem exists.

30|$|Central to a {{cloud-based}} architecture {{is the ability}} to purchase compute and storage resources using a <b>flexible,</b> on-demand <b>billing</b> model, much like the way traditional utilities (e.g. electricity) are purchased. This utility pricing model changes the way compute and storage can be exploited, encouraging scalable architectures and shifting the focus to almost unlimited, instant and on-demand resources with a direct monetary cost. Provisioning resources from a cloud provider is fast (typically taking times on the order of 1 min to 1 hour) and there is usually no minimum rental period, reducing or eliminating the need for large capital expenses as projects start-up or expand.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The energy {{industry}} has recently begun using smart meters to take finegrained readings of energy usage. These smart meters enable <b>flexible</b> time-of-use <b>billing,</b> forecasting, and demand response, {{but they also}} raise serious user privacy concerns. We propose a novel technique for provably hiding sensitive power consumption information in the overall power consumption stream. Our technique relies on a rechargeable battery that {{is connected to the}} household’s power supply. This battery is used to modify the household’s power consumption by adding or subtracting noise (i. e., increasing or decreasing power consumption), in order to establish strong privacy guarantees in the sense of differential privacy. To achieve these privacy guarantees in realistic settings, we first investigate the influence of, and the interplay between, capacity and throughput bounds that batteries face in reality. We then propose an integrated method based on noise cascading that allows for recharging the battery on-the-fly so that differential privacy is retained, while adhering to capacity and throughput constraints, and while keeping the additional consumption of energy induced by our technique to a minimum. ...|$|R

40|$|Stiffness of {{the human}} foot is central to its {{mechanical}} function, such as elastic energy storage and propulsion. Its doubly-arched structure, manifested as longitudinal and transverse arches, is thought to underlie the stiff nature. However, previous studies have focused solely on the longitudinal arch, and {{little is known about}} whether and how the transverse arch impacts the foot's stiffness. The common observation that a <b>flexible</b> currency <b>bill</b> significantly stiffens upon curling it transversally underlies our hypothesis that the transverse arch dominates the foot's stiffness. Through human subject experiments, we show that transversally reinforcing the ball of the foot by means of sports tape can increase the midfoot bending (dorsiflexion) stiffness by 53 % on average. Such a result is possible if and only if midfoot bending is mechanically coupled with splaying of the distal metatarsal heads, thus engaging the distal transverse ligament. Using a simplified foot model, we elucidate a mechanism for such coupling to arise because of the transverse arch; namely transverse curvature couples sagittal plane bending with stretching along the transverse direction. We therefore conclude that the previously ignored distal metatarsal transverse ligaments, by way of the transverse arch, likely underlie the midfoot's elastic response by an amount comparable to or surpassing the plantar fascia, the windlass mechanism and other longitudinal tissues. Our findings impact current practice in clinical, sports and evolutionary biomechanics that focus solely on the longitudinal arch and on two-dimensional sagittal plane mechanics.

40|$|Current payment {{policies}} in e-learning environments {{are based on}} the pay-for-all-even-if-partiallyused paradigm. Even worse, the learners get learning modules independently on their profile, needs and tasks. The learner has to pay for a whole course or for wasteful information, although he is interested only in parts of it, like a lecture about business solutions or some exercises. Furthermore, payment systems (e. g. credit card etc.) and payment models (pay all, without discount management) are offered which are not suitable for customizable content adaptivity and delivery. In future, e-learning systems must be more <b>flexible.</b> Learners are <b>billed</b> only for what they really need. We call this the paywhat-you-really-needed (PaWYRN) paradigm. To deliver the correct payment-based content {{in the right place at}} the right time, a content generation module is required which considers all models above. There is a need of a generic, formalized solution. To design such web-based learning systems we used the SiteLang methodology which allows to specify entire websites by means of their structuring (database structure, static integrity constraints), behavior (processes and dynamic semantics), information support (views, units and containers) and of the interaction and story space (scenes, media objects and dialogue steps). The DaMiT learning system aims at solving both tasks: high flexibility and adaptivity in content and PaWYRN payment. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{argues that}} the {{incremental}} audit production costs associated with issuing a qualified opinion are difficult for public accounting firms to recoup through audit fees alone. It proposes that audit production costs associated with qualifications may be recouped through non-audit service (NAS) fees in addition to audit fees. Further, it proposes that such recoupment follows a differential timing pattern. Audit fees, because of their more constrained nature, {{are more likely to}} be elevated as a consequence of qualification presence in the year subsequent to the qualification. On the other hand, NAS fees, by virtue of their very nature and more <b>flexible</b> <b>billing</b> opportunities provided, are likely to be so affected in the year concurrent with the qualification. The research is based on Australian data, as there are few jurisdictions in the world that require disclosure of both audit and non-audit fees. Using a sample of 270 companies, a significant and positive association is found between the presence of an audit qualification and significantly higher fees paid. This relationship holds both in the case of an audit qualification contemporaneous with the fee charged, and of one occurring in the year preceding the disclosed fee(s). The effect on audit fees, however, occurs only on a lagged opinion basis, while the effect on NAS fees occurs only on a concurrent opinion basis...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of biomedical research has brought substantial scientific and administrative data management challenges to modern core facilities. Scientifically, a core facility {{must be able to}} manage experimental workflow and the corresponding set of large and complex scientific data. It must also disseminate experimental data to relevant researchers in a secure and expedient manner that facilitates collaboration and provides support for data interpretation and analysis. Administratively, a core facility must be able to manage the scheduling of its equipment and to maintain a <b>flexible</b> and effective <b>billing</b> system to track material, resource, and personnel costs and charge for services to sustain its operation.

To address these informatics challenges, we introduce a comprehensive system called MIMI (multimodality, multiresource, information integration environment) that integrates the administrative and scientific support of a core facility into a single web-based environment. We report the design, development, and deployment experience of a baseline MIMI system at an imaging core facility and discuss the general applicability of such a system in other types of core facilities. These initial results suggest that MIMI will be a unique, cost-effective approach to addressing the informatics infrastructure needs of core facilities and similar research laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Virtualization {{is a key}} {{technology}} for cloud computing as it allows several operating system instances to run on the same machine, enhances resource manageability and enables <b>flexible</b> definition of <b>billing</b> units. Virtualization works by adding a software layer, a hypervisor, {{on top of the}} hardware platform. Virtual Machines, VMs, are run on top of the hypervisor, which provisions hardwares resources to the VM guests. In addition to enabling higher utilization of hardware resources, the ability to move VMs from one host to another is an important feature. Live migration is the concept of migrating a VM while it is running and responding to requests. Since VMs can be re-located while running, live migration allows for better hardware utilization. This is because placement of services can be performed dynamically and not only when the are started. Live migration is also a useful tool for administrative purposes. If a server needs to be taken off-line for maintenance reasons, it can be cleared of services by live migrating these to other hosts. This thesis investigates the principles behind live migration. The common live migration approaches in use today are evaluated and common objectives are presented as well as challenges that have to be overcome in order to implement an ideal live migration algorithm. The performance of common live migration approaches is also evaluated and it is found that even though live migration is supported by most hypervisors, it has drawbacks which makes the technique hard to use in certain situations. Migrating CPU and/or memory intensive VMs or migrating VMs over low-bandwidth links is a problem regardless of which approach that is used. To tackle this problem, two improvements to live migration are proposed and evaluated, delta compression and dynamic page transfer reordering. Both improvements demonstrate better performance than the standard algorithm when migrating CPU and/or memory intensive VMs and migrating over low bandwidth links. Finally, recommendations are made on which live migration approach to use depending on the scenario and also what improvements to the standard live migration algorithms should be used and when...|$|R
40|$|Pervasive {{digitization}} {{of human}} environment has dramatically changed our everyday lives. New technologies {{which have become}} an integral part of our daily routine have deeply affected our perception of the surrounding world and have opened qualitatively new opportunities. In an urban environment, the influence of such changes is especially tangible and acute. For example, ubiquitous computing (also commonly referred to as UbiComp) is a pure vision no more and has transformed the digital world dramatically. Pervasive use of smartphones, integration of processing power into various artefacts as well as the overall miniaturization of computing devices can already be witnessed on a daily basis even by laypersons. In particular, transport being an integral part of any urban ecosystem have been affected by these changes. Consequently, public transport systems have undergone transformation as well and are currently dynamically evolving. In many cities around the world, the concept of the so-called electronic ticketing (e-ticketing) is being extensively used for issuing travel permissions which may eventually result in conventional paper-based tickets being completely phased out already in the nearest future. Opal Card in Sydney, Oyster Card in London, Touch & Travel in Germany and many more are all the examples of how well the e-ticketing has been accepted both by customers and public transport companies. Despite numerous benefits provided by such e-ticketing systems for public transport, serious privacy concern arise. The main reason lies in the fact that using these systems may imply the dramatic multiplication of digital traces left by individuals, also beyond the transport scope. Unfortunately, there has been little effort so far to explicitly tackle this issue. There is still not enough motivation and public pressure imposed on industry to invest into privacy. In academia, the majority of solutions targeted at this problem quite often limit the real-world pertinence of the resultant privacy-preserving concepts due to the fact that inherent advantages of e-ticketing systems for public transport cannot be fully leveraged. This thesis is aimed at solving the aforementioned problem by providing a privacy-preserving framework which can be used for developing e-ticketing systems for public transport with privacy protection integrated from the outset. At the same time, the advantages of e-ticketing such as fine-grained <b>billing,</b> <b>flexible</b> pricing schemes, and transparent use (which are often the main drivers for public to roll out such systems) can be retained...|$|R
