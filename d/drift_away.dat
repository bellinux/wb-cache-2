5|$|He {{revealed}} in his 1996 autobiography {{that he had}} a strained relationship with his brother Bobby. Though the pair had different personalities, Jack felt that Bobby began to <b>drift</b> <b>away</b> from the Charlton family following his marriage to Norma, who did not get along with their mother. Bobby did not see his mother after 1992 until her death on 25 March 1996 {{as a result of the}} feud, though he and Norma did attend her funeral. Though the two brothers remained distant, Jack presented Bobby with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award on 14 December 2008.|$|E

5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down {{the entire length of the}} Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to <b>drift</b> <b>away</b> from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{abortive}} {{attack on}} Montreal {{led to the}} full mobilization of local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 men, but they soon began to <b>drift</b> <b>away.</b> Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.|$|E
5|$|Solti took up {{the musical}} {{directorship}} of Covent Garden in August 1961. The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him {{there might be a}} <b>drift</b> <b>away</b> from the company's original policy of opera in English. Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular, and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi. As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars.|$|E

5|$|Victor's death {{scene was}} filmed outside The Bridge Hotel and pub at Shawford railway bridge, {{next to the}} River Itchen, Hampshire, on 21 July 2000. The cold {{temperature}} {{on the night of}} the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big emotional impact upon the cast and crew during filming. However, Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor's arm falling into the shot and his cap <b>drift</b> <b>away</b> in the gutter. After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000. Unlike the location shoot, Renwick was too concerned with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode.|$|E
5|$|Despite her 50 guns, Centurions {{armament}} {{left her}} vulnerable as most were carronades, short-range heavy cannon that were useless {{in the face}} of the long-range gunnery from Marengo. Centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13:15 had been holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through, which caused her to slowly <b>drift</b> <b>away</b> from the shore, out of control. Seeing that his opponent was disabled, Linois decided not to press the attack and issued orders for his squadron, accompanied by their prize, to sail away. Lind gradually regained control of his ship and even managed to raise some sail in pursuit, but the French were too far ahead. After some final parting shots, Centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing the damage. Linois remained within sight for the rest of the day, but showed no sign of renewing the action; he disappeared on the north-east horizon at dusk.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters are {{a classic}} example of a {{keystone}} species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to <b>drift</b> <b>away</b> and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.|$|E
5|$|Titanics {{survivors}} {{were rescued}} around 04:00 on 15April by the RMS Carpathia, which had steamed {{through the night}} at high speed and at considerable risk, as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs en route. Carpathias lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe more than a half) had died overnight. The remaining survivors– {{an unknown number of}} men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to <b>drift</b> <b>away.</b> It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner Oceanic, with the bodies still aboard.|$|E

25|$|Foul weather plagued 25 June; only 11 sorties of {{tactical}} air struck {{in support of}} the Royalists. There was a lull in the fighting, during which Neutralists began to <b>drift</b> <b>away</b> from the battlefield. The day passed in relative quiet. On the morning of 26 June, the U.S. Army attaché decided to evacuate Neutralist dependents from the base. Someone dubbed the operation Swan Lake. When the coming evacuation became known, Neutralist soldiers began to <b>drift</b> <b>away</b> southwards toward Xieng Dat. The poor weather continued on the 26th, and air support was limited to 13 sorties.|$|E
