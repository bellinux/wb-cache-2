5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam, {{known in}} Japan as , , and , are three Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon {{franchise}} that are linked through evolution. Abra <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Kadabra after gaining enough experience in battle, and Kadabra <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Alakazam after being traded to another trainer. Created by Ken Sugimori, they {{first appeared in}} the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels. They have appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the Psi Pokémon, using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its abilities unless rested. This behavior ceases once it <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. Able to remember everything since its birth, Alakazam's IQ is around 5000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Alakazam {{is also one of the}} handful of Pokémon to be capable of undergoing Mega Evolution, which increases its strength and makes it appearance undergo a few noticeable changes.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} {{finished}} generating energy through thermonuclear fusion, it <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> a more compact, degenerate state. During this process {{the dimensions of}} the star are significantly reduced, which can result in a corresponding increase in angular velocity.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
50|$|Cretolamna is {{believed}} to have <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the genus Otodus sometime in the Paleocene. Otodus {{is believed}} to have <b>evolved</b> later <b>into</b> the Carcharocles genus. Others believe that Cretolamna <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the Paleocene shark Palaeocarcharodon, which some think <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Carcharodon carcharias.|$|R
50|$|In some dialects vowels {{interrupted}} by stop have <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> individual phonemes themselves, {{for example in}} Todos Santos dialect/oʔ/ represented by o' has <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> /ɵʏˀ/ and /oʔo/ represented by o'o has <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> /ɵ'ʉ/.|$|R
50|$|Later, multi-effects type <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> {{modeling}} guitar, and {{the other}} two types <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> current guitar-synthesizers.|$|R
5|$|Hill Street precinct captain Frank Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti) {{deals with}} law {{enforcement}} issues while juggling personal crises. His precinct responds to a hostage situation at a local liquor store that becomes difficult when it <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> a media circus, complicated by an aggressive SWAT team leader, Howard Hunter (James B. Sikking), who encounters nervous young gang members. Furillo attempts to negotiate with their gang leader. His secret lover, public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel), appears to be his nemesis as she hounds him about a client who is the lost victim of police bureaucracy. Furillo's ex-wife, Fay (Barbara Bosson), publicly demeans him {{in response to his}} bounced child-support check.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of time, a snowpack may settle under its own weight until its density is {{approximately}} 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50% of water. Snow that persists into summer <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> névé, granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Névé has a minimum density of , which is roughly half of the density of liquid water.|$|E
5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also {{substantial}} differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is {{the part of the brain}} that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.|$|E
50|$|These two results {{provided}} two competing systems for study {{of behavior and}} <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> ethology and further <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> comparative psychology.|$|R
5000|$|For [...] "Pro" [...] racing {{with the}} NHRA, Nostalgia Super Stock <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Pro Stock and FX <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Funny Car.|$|R
50|$|By the 19th century, coursed strings where <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> 6 single-stringed {{instruments}} {{much like}} that of the guitar today. It had <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the modern look except for size, retaining a smaller frame.|$|R
5|$|In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue {{receives}} a Charmander from his grandfather Professor Oak. It <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> a Charmeleon, and when Blue is possessed by a Gastly in the Lavender Tower, so is Charmeleon. Blue's Charmeleon is eventually released from its possession {{only to be}} faced down by an Arbok, owned by Koga. Charmeleon tricked Koga by using a zombie Psyduck to deflect Arbok's acid attack before literally slicing the Arbok in half with his tail. Blue later appears with an evolved Charizard and gains access to Saffron City by helping to disable a barrier created by a Mr. Mime. Later, Red and Blue face off against Koga's Articuno and are frozen by its Ice Beam, but they ultimately defeat the Team Rocket Executive with Charizard's Flamethrower. It then teams up with Red's newly evolved Venusaur, Saur, and Green's Blastoise, Blasty, to defeat Sabrina's monster Pokémon. They end Team Rocket's control of Saffron City, splitting apart the three birds in the process.|$|E
5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> a red giant and the stage is set for mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to having}} severe PTSD and {{being unable to}} do her job {{correctly}} anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally and she ultimately decides {{to go to work}} after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child, and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton (Scott Foley), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang {{to come up with a}} wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.|$|E
5000|$|This is the {{precursor}} of {{the so called}} [...] "packet communication" [...] that eventually <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> today's TCP/IP technology. SDLC itself <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> HDLC, one of the base technologies for dedicated telecommunication circuits.|$|R
50|$|In the 17th century, the whitedish <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> a meatless dessert pudding {{with cream}} and eggs and, later, gelatin. In the 19th century, {{arrowroot}} and cornflour were added and the dish <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the modern blancmange.|$|R
50|$|Several of the {{facilities}} <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> hospitals or medical facilities: Glockner Tuberculosis Sanatorium <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Penrose Hospital. Beth-El Hospital, with the National Deaconess Sanitarium, <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Memorial Hospital. St. Francis Hospital was a hospital that had a sanatorium in its three building complex. Union Printers Home and the Modern Woodmen Tuberculosis Sanatorium, now Mount Saint Francis, are going concerns with skilled nursing care. Today, however, the structure's usages are different. Miramont Castle, which {{was the site of}} the Montcalm Sanitarium, is now a museum. National Methodist Sanatorium <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> a building for the Ent Air Force Base and its site is now part of the United States Olympic Training Center.|$|R
5|$|In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri {{plan their}} next heist. As Dixit's {{analysis}} has named Rio {{the location of}} Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, and Ali immediately falls for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. Aryan forces Sunehri {{to play a game}} of Russian roulette. Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted shots from the gun, neither is injured, because Aryan has not loaded the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. Sunehri indicates that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up {{on the top of a}} waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free.|$|E
5|$|In the Pokémon anime, the Saffron City Gym Leader, Sabrina owns an Abra, {{which she}} sends {{out in a}} battle against the series protagonist, Ash. After battling, Sabrina's Abra <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Kadabra, causing Ash to forfeit the match due to Kadabra's new and more {{powerful}} psychic abilities. Ash later returns for a rematch, and Ash's Haunter makes Sabrina laugh, which causes Kadabra to also laugh due to the psychic bond it has with Sabrina. Because of Kadabra and Sabrina's laughter, {{they are unable to}} fight, and hand over the gym badge. Abra later appears in the series under the ownership of Mira, who offers to teleport everyone to Hearthome city using her Abra, but instead teleports them to a flooded city to find a Poké Ball containing a Sandshrew that was lost in the newly flooded lake. One of Abra and Kadabra's other appearances is living in an abandoned mining colony with several other Psychic-type Pokémon. Alakazam's first appearance was as a giant Alakazam awakened near the site of the Pokémopolis ruins. Alakazam has also been owned by many notable trainers, such as Luana, the Gym Leader of Kumquat Island, Eusine, Anabel, and Kenny.|$|E
5|$|The Sandmans main {{character}} is Dream, the titular Sandman, also known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai'ckul and Lord L'Zoril, {{who is the}} anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E
50|$|The Air Battalion Royal Engineers (ABRE) was {{the first}} flying unit of the British Armed Forces {{to make use of}} heavier-than-air craft. It <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the Royal Flying Corps which in turn <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> the Royal Air Force.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} three modest aims: {{to present a}} puzzle, to show why some obvious {{solutions}} aren’t really “easy outs”, and to introduce our own solution. The puzzle is this. When it was small and had waterlogged streets, Toronto carried the moniker ‘Muddy York’. Later, the streets were drained, it grew, and Muddy York officially {{changed its name to}} ‘Toronto’. Given this, each premise in the following argument seems true. Yet the conclusion is a contraction. P 1 : Muddy York = Toronto P 2 : Muddy York <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Toronto P 3 : The context “__ <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Toronto” is transparent, i. e., it allows substitution of co-referring singular terms P 4 : It’s not the case that Toronto <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Toronto C 1 : Toronto <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Toronto [By P 1, P 2 and P 3] C 2 : Toronto both did and did not <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> Toronto [By P 4 and C 1...|$|R
5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E
5|$|On Cybertron Cyclonus, {{dispatched}} {{from the}} Dead Universe {{on a mission}} to activate the Nega-Core, inadvertently alerts the Autobots to his presence, but is still able to activate the Core, as well as its lethal guardian Thunderwing. On Garrus-9 Prime calls in the Wreckers to deal with the escalating situation as Nemesis Prime leads the forces of the Dead Universe from the Benzuli expanse. Meanwhile, Hardhead accompanies Nightbeat to Gorlam Prime in an attempt to find his missing memories. Attacked by Micromasters, Nightbeat is taken control of by Jhiaxus and Hardhead reluctantly eliminates him, before disappearing into the dimensional portal. A furious Nemesis Prime realizes he must do Nightbeat's job of eliminating Optimus Prime personally. The Wrecker's assault on Thunderwing proves futile, while Arcee teams up with Banzai-Tron to track down the escaped Monstructor, and Jetfire prepares to use Thunderwing's technology to enable other Autobots to survive the effects of the Benzuli expanse. Dealer's attempt to retrieve the Magnificence for himself backfires when a suspicious Hot Rod uses it to confirm his doubts about Dealer, who is promptly killed. Hot Rod then uses the Magnificence to locate the other Nega-Cores and their guardians, (Sixshot and Monstructor), and passes the information on. Jetfire then formulates a plan to override Jhiaxus' control of them via taking over their mental link. Nemesis Prime attacks Optimus on Garrus-9 personally, but is betrayed and killed by Galvatron, who is then tossed into a solar pool by Prime. Jetfire's plan works, as Cloudburst's team, now equipped with Thunderwing's technology, is able to dispose of the Nega-Cores in the Dead Universe, closing it off completely. Jhiaxus is hunted down on Gorlam Prime by Arcee and Hardhead (now undead like the Dead Universe's inhabitants), where his immortality means Arcee can kill him over and over. On Earth, Sideswipe, having beaten Straxus and Grindcore, decides he has proven himself and leaves without Sunstreaker. Over the following years, Gorlam Prime <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> a new Cybertron, and its inhabitants evolve into beings like Transformers. But on Garrus-9, Galvatron still lives within the solar pool. In the aftermath of this, the former Decepticon assassin Drift, his outlook changed by meeting the legendary third faction of Cybertronians, attempts to rescue Autobot captives from a Decepticon ship, and ends up crossing path with Kup and the Wreckers. An impressed Kup, believing everyone deserves a second chance, offers him a spot on his new commando squad.|$|E

25|$|Even after {{differentiation}} {{can be seen}} {{between the}} sexes, some stages are common, e.g. the disappearing of the membrane. On the other hand, sex-dependent development include further protrusion of the genital tubercle in the male to form the glans of the penis and in the female, the clitoral glans. The urogenital fold <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> the shaft of the penis in males and the Labia minora in females; the labioscrotal swelling <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> the scrotum in males, and into the Labia majora in females.|$|E
25|$|In post-Vedic texts, Indra is {{depicted}} as an intoxicated hedonistic god, his importance declines, and he <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> a minor deity in comparison {{to others in the}} Hindu pantheon, such as Shiva, Vishnu, or Devi. In medieval Hindu texts, Indra is an aspect of Shiva.|$|E
25|$|LGS {{is seen in}} {{approximately}} 4% of children with epilepsy, and {{is more common in}} males than in females. Usual onset is between the ages of three and five. Children can have no neurological problems prior diagnosis, or have other forms of epilepsy. West syndrome is diagnosed in 20% of patients before it <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> LGS at about 2 years old.|$|E
50|$|Federalists (partisans of Francisco de Paula Santander, who saw centralism as a {{restriction}} of freedom) would later <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> the Liberal Party of Colombia.
