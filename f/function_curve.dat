Analyzing petrophysics of Formation Type I and II by mercury injection curve normalization, it’s vital to developing method choice on tapping {{the potential of}} Formation Type II.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess left {{ventricular}} function in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, left ventricular func-tion curves (plotting stroke work index vs left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) were constructed using angiotensin to augment, and nitroprusside to reduce, afterload. Hemodynamic responses to these alterations in afterload were measured. Resting ejection fractions and qualitative assessment of left ventricular angiographic contraction abnormalities were also determined. Changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure following afterload interventions could be linearly related to changes in mean aortic pressure, but mitral valve gradients were unaffected. Afterload reduction with nitroprusside did not augment cardiac output. Afterload elevation with angiotensin significantly depressed both cardiac output and calculated mitral valve areas. Patients with normal resting ejection frac-tions evidenced normal ventricular <b>function</b> <b>curves</b> and those with depressed ejection fractions showed flat or declining <b>function</b> <b>curves.</b> Contraction abnormalities, generally in the posterobasal area, correlated well with abnormal left ventricular <b>function</b> <b>curves.</b> MUCH EVIDENCE exists which suggests that left ventricular function is abnormal in many patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.

40|$|Background: Mean {{systemic}} {{filling pressure}} (Pmsf) {{can be measured}} at the bedside with minimally invasive monitoring in ventilator-dependent patients using inspiratory hold maneuvers (Pmsfhold) as the zero flow intercept of cardiac output (CO) to central venous pressure (CVP) relation. We compared Pmsfhold with arm vascular equilibrium pressure during vascular occlusion (Pmsfarm) {{and their ability to}} assess systemic vascular compliance (Csys) and stressed volume by intravascular fluid administration. Methods: In mechanically ventilated postoperative cardiac surgery patients, inspiratory holds at varying airway pressures and arm stop-flow maneuvers were performed during normovolemia and after each of 10 sequential 50 -mL bolus colloid infusions. We measured CVP, Pmsfarm, stroke volume, and CO during fluid administration steps to construct CVP to CO (cardiac <b>function)</b> <b>curves</b> and Δvolume/ΔPmsf (compliance) curves. Pmsfhold was measured before and after fluid administration. Stressed volume was determined by extrapolating the Pmsf-volume curve to zero pressure intercept. Results: Fifteen patients were included. Pmsfhold and Pmsf arm were closely correlated. Csys was linear (64. 3 ± 32. 7 mL • mm Hg, 0. 97 ± 0. 49 mL • mm Hg • kg predicted body weight). Stressed volume was estimated to be 1265 ± 541 mL (28. 5 % ± 15 % predicted total blood volume). Cardiac <b>function</b> <b>curves</b> of patients with an increase of > 12 % to 500 mL volume extension (volume responsive) were steep, whereas the cardiac <b>function</b> <b>curves</b> of the remaining patients were flat. Conclusions: Csys, stressed volume, and cardiac <b>function</b> <b>curves</b> can be determined at the bedside and can be used to characterize patients' hemodynamic status.

[...] The word information, in the context of Fisher information, refers to information about the parameters. Information such as: estimation, sufficiency and properties of variances of estimators.

40|$|In this paper, we {{initiate}} a geometrically oriented study {{of local and}} global non-abelian zeta <b>functions</b> for <b>curves.</b> This consists of two parts: construction and justification. For the construction, we first use moduli spaces of semi-stable bundles to introduce {{a new type of}} zeta <b>functions</b> for <b>curves</b> defined over finite fields. Then, we prove that these new zeta functions are indeed rational and satisfy the functional equation, based on vanishing theorem, duality, Riemann-Roch theorem for cohomology of semi-stable vector bundles. With all this, we next introduce certain global non-abelian zeta <b>functions</b> for <b>curves</b> defined over number fields, via the Euler product formalism. Finally we establish the convergence of our Euler products, from the Clifford Lemma, an ugly yet explicit formula for local nonabelian zeta functions, a result of (Harder-Narasimhan) Siegel about quadratic forms, and Weil’s theorem on Riemann Hypothesis of Artin zeta functions. As for justification, surely, we check that when only line bundles are involved, (so moduli spaces of semi-stable bundles are nothing but the standard Picard groups), our (new) zeta functions coincide with the classical Artin zeta <b>functions</b> for <b>curves</b> over finite fields and Hasse-Weil zeta <b>functions</b> for <b>curves</b> over number fields respectively.
