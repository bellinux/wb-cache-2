40|$|It is {{well known}} that the total power {{converted}} by a wave <b>energy</b> <b>farm</b> is influenced by the hydrodynamic interactions between wave energy converters, especially when they are close to each other. Therefore, to improve the performance of a wave <b>energy</b> <b>farm,</b> the hydrodynamic interaction between converters must be considered, which can be influenced by the power take-off damping of individual converters. In this paper, the performance of arrays of wave energy converters under optimal hydrodynamic interaction and power take-off damping is investigated. This is achieved by coordinating the power take-off damping of individual converters, resulting in optimal hydrodynamic interaction as well as higher production of time-averaged power converted by the farm. Physical constraints on motion amplitudes are considered in the solution, which is required for the practical implementation of wave energy converters. Results indicate that the natural frequency of a wave energy converter under optimal damping will not vary with sea states, but the production performance of a wave <b>energy</b> <b>farm</b> can be improved significantly while satisfying the motion constraints.

40|$|The {{lignocellulose}} in {{forage crops}} represents a {{second generation of}} biomass feedstock for conversion into energy-related end products. Some of the most extensively studied species for cellulosic feedstock production include forages such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). An advantage of using forages as bioenergy crops is that farmers are familiar with their management and already {{have the capacity to}} grow, harvest, store, and transport them. Forage crops offer additional flexibility in management because they can be used for biomass or forage and the land can be returned to other uses or put into crop rotation.

The objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive data set on the performance and agronomic limitations of several bioenergy feedstocks in Eastern Canada. Part One of this report examines the productivity of switchgrass and short rotation forestry (SRF) willow in a side by side paired comparison study established to assess their economic and agronomic viability in eastern Canada.

40|$|On the one hand, {{biofuels}} {{may provide}} {{environmental and social}} benefits, for instance, when local communities in developing countries are supplied with power and process energy from oil producing plants, in particular when they are grown on land which is not suited for food production. On the other hand, the ongoing expansion of large scale <b>energy</b> <b>farming</b> for transport biofuels can lead to various environmental and social problems. Corn production for ethanol (additive to petrol) for instance resulted in nutrient pollution of the Mississippi basin and the Gulf of Mexico. The growing demand of transport biofuels in Europe can only be met by increasing imports. This contributes to the conversion of grasslands, savannahs and forests in the tropics, losses of biodiversity and additional green house gas emissions. Even if the use of biomass for other purposes, for instance, the combined production of electricity and heat usually provides a better greenhouse gas balance than transport biofuels, energy cropping remains problematic for various reasons. Whereas, when biomass is used for material purposes first, and the energy is recovered from the subsequent waste, a multiple dividend can be gained. The authors address a number of measures for improvement. They also recommend that {{in view of the}} complex circumstances of biofuel production and application, current policy mandates and targets for biofuels should be reconsidered.

40|$|Concerns {{about climate}} change related to fossil fuel carbon dioxide {{emissions}} require the development of alternative energy resources. In most scenario studies on future energy supply, bio-energy {{is one of the}} dominant renewable alternatives foreseen. Apart from the use of residues and wastes, the cultivation of dedicated energy crops will be necessary. Especially in densely populated regions such as the Netherlands, energy crop introduction is strongly hampered by lack of available land, related to the low valued added of energy crops compared to e. g. agriculture. A strategy that may help overcome these problems is multiple land use: combining the production of energy crops to other targets on the same tract of land. If a plot not only generates biomass, but also serves other functions such as nature management, more income may be generated, and overall land use efficiency may increase. Central question in this thesis is whether, and to what extent, multiple land use can improve opportunities for energy crops in the Netherlands, in comparison with energy cropping as single land use. We specified this question into three criteria: (1) multiple land use <b>energy</b> <b>farming</b> options should be biophysically feasible; (2) such combinations should lead to lower biomass production prices compared to single land use; (3) the combinations should open up an area for energy cropping significant to the national renewable energy targets. The first research topic was to further identify and specify the concept of multiple land use, and develop an operationalisation procedure. Subsequently, specific options for combination of energy crop cultivation with another function were elaborated. In a relatively simple and qualitative way, we analysed four options with willow as an energy crop: combination with drinking water production (on two levels), with traditional willow coppice management, and with an ecological corridor function. We executed more detailed studies on two combination options: willow in hydrological buffer zones around nature reserves, and willow as a breeding bird habitat. Most studied options of combining willow SRC with another function into a multiple land use type appeared to be biophysically feasible. The effect on financial competitiveness of introducing willow SRC in Multiple Land Use varies per combination: in some cases, like the option in groundwater protection areas, competitiveness remains unchanged, while in others, such as the buffer zones, a significant competitiveness increase can be obtained. However, the price reductions are not in the order of magnitude that the price of energy crops draws near to the current prices of biomass residues, the only resource currently applied for bioenergy. The total of land potentially suitable for the investigated options adds up to ca. 100, 000 ha, while the area with improved financial competitiveness is ca 30, 000 ha in total. Given the projections on required area for meeting the national renewable energy objective, MLU areas with improved financial competitiveness will only partly meet this area claim. Therefore, multiple land use will enhance opportunities for energy crop introduction in the Netherlands, but it will not be the panacea for large-scale introduction of competitive <b>energy</b> <b>farming.</b> Potential areas remain limited, as well as financial benefits compared to single land use, and several implementation problems may hamper introduction in practice. This limited perspective on the short term may be altered by long-term developments, such as technical innovations, and developments in the EU Common Agricultural Policy and in the global climate policy...|$|E
40|$|Externalities of {{electricity}} production from biomass and coal are investigated and compared for the Dutch context. Effects {{on economic activity}} and employment are investigated with help of Input/Output and multiplier tables. Valuations of damage from emissions to air are based on generic data from other studies. In addition external costs are estimated for nitrogen leaching and {{for the use of}} agrochemicals for energy crop production. The average private costs for biomass and coal based power generation are projected to be 68 and 38 mECU/kWh respectively in the year 2005. It is assumed that biomass production takes place on fallow land. Coal mining is excluded from the analysis. If the quantified external damages and benefits are included the cost range for bio-electricity is 53 - 70 mECU/kWh and 45 - 72 mECU/kWh for coal. Indirect economic effects (increment of Gross Domestic Product) and the difference in CO 2 emissions are the most important distinguishing factors between coal and biomass in economic terms. Damage costs of other emissions to air (NOx, SO 2, dust and CO) are of the same order of magnitude for both coal and biomass (coal mining excluded). In this analysis environmental impacts of <b>energy</b> <b>farming</b> are compared mainly to fallow land focused on the use of fertilizers and agrochemicals. The related damage costs appear to be low but should be considered as a preliminary estimate only. The quantitative outcomes should not be considered as the external costs of the two fuel cycles studied. Many impacts have not been valued and large uncertainties persist e. g. with respect to the costs of climate change and numerous dose response relations. More detailed analysis is desired with respect to macro-economic impacts. The results serve as a first indication, but the outcomes plead for the support of bio-electricity production and/or taxation of coal based power generation...|$|E
