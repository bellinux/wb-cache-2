50|$|The Soyuz uses {{a method}} {{similar to the}} Apollo to deorbit itself. The {{spacecraft}} is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for deorbiting fully 180° ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry; the spacecraft travels on an elliptical <b>Hohmann</b> <b>orbit</b> {{to a point where}} it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.|$|E
50|$|Because its modular {{construction}} {{differs from that}} of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180° ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical <b>Hohmann</b> <b>orbit</b> to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to apply the formula given above to calculate the Δv in km/s needed to enter a Hohmann transfer orbit to arrive at various destinations from Earth (assuming circular orbits for the planets). In this table, the column labeled [...] "Δv to enter <b>Hohmann</b> <b>orbit</b> from Earth's orbit" [...] gives the change from Earth's velocity to the velocity needed {{to get on a}} Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the sun. The column labeled [...] "v exiting LEO" [...] gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centered on the earth) when 300 km above the Earth's surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the speed (7.73 km/s) of this low Earth orbit (that is, the depth of Earth's gravity well at this LEO). The column [...] "Δv from LEO" [...] is simply the previous speed minus 7.73 km/s.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{electrodynamic}} tethers for propulsion {{and power}} generation is attractive for mis-sions {{to the outer}} planets, which are traditionally handicapped by large propellant require-ments, large times of flight, and a scarcity of power available. In this work, the orbital dynamics of a spacecraft using electrodynamic tether propulsion during the mission phases of capture, apojove pump-down and perijove pump-up in the Jovian system are investigated. The main result is the mapped design space involving mission duration, tether length and minimum perijove radius. Phase-free flyby sequences are also included, which provide per-formance upper bounds for a given mission architecture. It {{is found to be}} advantageous to utilize in-bound only flybys of the Galilean moons during capture, and few, if any, out-bound only flybys during apojove pump-down. The electrodynamic tether system is also shown to be capable of lowering the spacecraft’s orbit to a Europa-Ganymede <b>Hohmann</b> <b>orbit</b> with a total flight time after entering Jupiter’s sphere of influence of just under two years under reasonable assumptions for spacecraft mass and tether parameters...|$|E

50|$|<b>Hohmann</b> {{transfer}} <b>orbit</b> - An orbital maneuver {{that moves}} a spacecraft from one circular orbit to another using two engine impulses. This maneuver {{was named after}} Walter Hohmann.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{reversibility}} of <b>orbits,</b> <b>Hohmann</b> transfer <b>orbits</b> {{also work}} {{to bring a}} spacecraft from a higher orbit into a lower one; in this case, the spacecrafts engine is fired {{in the opposite direction}} to its current path, slowing the spacecraft and causing it to drop into the lower-energy elliptical transfer orbit. The engine is then fired again at the lower distance to slow the spacecraft into the lower circular orbit.|$|R

50|$|Low-thrust engines {{can perform}} an {{approximation}} of a <b>Hohmann</b> transfer <b>orbit,</b> {{by creating a}} gradual enlargement of the initial circular orbit through carefully timed engine firings.

50|$|The <b>Hohmann</b> {{transfer}} <b>orbit</b> {{alone is}} a poor approximation for interplanetary trajectories because it neglects the planets' own gravity. Planetary gravity dominates the behaviour of the spacecraft {{in the vicinity of}} a planet and in most cases Hohmann severely overestimates delta-v, and produces highly inaccurate prescriptions for burn timings.|$|R
50|$|Journeys to {{the nearest}} planets, Mars and Venus, often use a <b>Hohmann</b> {{transfer}} <b>orbit,</b> an elliptical path which starts as a tangent to one planet's orbit round the Sun and finishes as a tangent to the other.

50|$|Maneuvering {{into a large}} {{circular}} orbit, e.g. a geostationary orbit, {{requires a}} larger delta-v than an escape orbit, although the latter implies getting arbitrarily far away and having more energy than needed for the orbital speed of the circular orbit.

2500|$|Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a {{space flight}} {{simulation}} video game developed {{and published by}} Squad for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

50|$|Every two years, {{low-energy}} transfer {{windows open}} up which allow movement between planets {{with the lowest}} possible delta-v requirements. Transfer injections can place spacecraft into either a <b>Hohmann</b> transfer <b>orbit</b> or bi-elliptic transfer orbit. Trans-Mars injections can be either a single maneuver burn, such as that used by the NASA MAVEN orbiter, or a series of perigee kicks, such as that used by the ISRO Mars Orbiter Mission.|$|R
50|$|However, even using a <b>Hohmann</b> {{transfer}} <b>orbit,</b> {{it might}} take decades for a spaceship {{to travel to the}} outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and it requires a very large delta-v budget, because the spacecraft would have to travel for 800 million km (500 million miles) or more against the force of the Sun's gravity. Since gravitational assist maneuvers offer a way to gain speed without using propellant, all missions to the outer planets have used them.|$|R
