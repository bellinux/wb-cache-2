40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} theoretical contribution on {{the onset of}} rotating magneto-convection and a new experimental setup built to study the onset {{and the development of}} convection in the <b>Earth</b> <b>Tangent</b> Cylinder (TC). The theoretical contribution is a linear stability analysis of the onset of convection for an electrically conducting fluid in rotation and permeated by a magnetic field. This work highlighted the importance of the magnetic field as it enforces a specific mode of convection at onset for a certain range of parameters. The apparatus was designed to show for the first time experimentally the significant role played by the magnetic field on the flow structures and bring forward the first evidence of a polar vortex in the TC with a quantitative measurement technique such as particle image velocimetry (PIV). In order to reach these goals, the experimental setup consisted in an hemispherical dome filled with a transparent conducting fluid heated at the center, cooled on the outside and spun inside a high external magnetic field. The hemispherical dome is approximatively 30 cm diameter. The fluid used is sulphuric acid at 30 % mass concentration, because of its conductivity of approximatively 80 S/m and its transparency, allowing both interactions with the magnetic field and visualization for PIV measurements. To compensate against the weak conductivity of sulphuric acid we used a unique 10 T magnet. As a result, we were able to study the di↵erence in the convective flow between the magnetic and nonmagnetic case. It has been shown that convective structures under a magnetic field at onset become much larger leading to one o↵ axis vortex. Above onset it has also been highlighted that this structure is maintained whereas without magnetic field the flow is very di↵erent between onset and developed convection. Indeed at the onset we observe numerous structures that coalesce into one large centered structure far from the onset of convection...|$|E

40|$|Particular exact {{solutions}} of the hydrodynamic equations {{for a small}} sea are presented. They {{have been}} obtained under the following assumptions: sea on <b>Earth's</b> <b>tangent</b> plane; constant density; viscous-like stress tensor made up by an isotropic part and two other parts only horizontally isotropic; traceless and dissipative viscous-like stress tensor. In the search of particular exact solutions a supplementary hypothesis has been assumed: the advective part results from the gradient of suitable potentials (kinetic energy and rotational potential). Since the exact solution is considered as an initial solution in a perturbation approximation, the small Coriolis force has been neglected. For a small rectangular sea as the Adriatic sea, the solutions satisfy the conditions on the fixed boundaries (bottom and coastlines of the sea) with a very good approximation. The conditions at the free surface will be also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Some {{particular}} solutions of the hydrodynamic equations are presented. In {{the solutions}} the velocity {{is a complex}} exponential on space variables, i. e. {{it is a real}} exponential multiplied by sine and cosine functions. The amplitude of the exponential is a time dependent complex vector. These particular solutions have been obtained using the approximation of a constant density fluid lying in the <b>Earth’s</b> <b>tangent</b> plane. The equations in eulerian approach contain the advective part which is balanced by two pressure terms. The first term corresponds to the kinetic energy, the second term to a rotational energy. The existence of this last energy implies rather strict conditions on the possible solutions. The exponential solutions are obtained neatly under the assumption of a vanishing Coriolis force. However the solutions obtained under this approximation may still be a good initial solution of the hydrodynamic equations for a sea like the Adriatic. The friction has been represented by a symmetric tensor with vanishing trace and constant coefficients, which operates linearly on the components of the velocity. The tensor is not assumed to be necessarily isotropic in the vertical direction...|$|R
50|$|All curves through point p have a tangent vector, {{not only}} world lines. The sum of two vectors is again a tangent vector {{to some other}} curve and the same holds for {{multiplying}} by a scalar. Therefore, all tangent vectors in a point p span a linear space, called the tangent space at point p. For example, taking a 2-dimensional space, like the (curved) surface of the <b>Earth,</b> its <b>tangent</b> space at a specific point would be the flat approximation of the curved space.|$|R
40|$|To {{estimate}} the earth’s radiation budget {{at the top}} of the atmosphere (TOA) from satellite-measured radiances, it is necessary to account for the finite geometry of the earth and recognize that the earth is a solid body surrounded by a translucent atmosphere of finite thickness that attenuates solar radiation differently at different heights. As a result, in order to account for all of the reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation from the planet by direct integration of satellite-measured radiances, the measurement viewing geometry must be defined at a reference level well above the earth’s surface (e. g., 100 km). This ensures that all radiation contributions, including radiation escaping the planet along slant paths above the <b>earth’s</b> <b>tangent</b> point, are accounted for. By using a field-of-view (FOV) reference level that is too low (such as the surface reference level), TOA fluxes for most scene types are systematically underestimated by 1 – 2 W m � 2. In addition, since TOA flux represents a flow of radiant energy per unit area, and varies with distance from the earth according to the inverse-square law, a reference level is also needed to define satellite-based TOA fluxes. From theoretical radiative transfer calculations using a model that accounts for spherical geometry, the optimal reference level for defining TOA fluxes in radiation budget studies for the earth is estimated to be approximately 20 km. At this reference level, there is no need to explicitly account for horizontal transmission of solar radiation through the atmosphere i...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} onset of magnetoconvection between two {{infinite}} horizontal planes subject to a vertical magnetic field aligned with background rotation. In order to gain insight into the convection {{taking place in the}} <b>Earth's</b> <b>tangent</b> cylinder (TC), we target regimes of asymptotically strong rotation. The critical Rayleigh number Ra_c and critical wavenumber are computed numerically by solving the linear stability problem in a systematic way. A parametric study is conducted, varying the Ekman number, E (ratio of viscous to Coriolis forces) and the Elsasser number, Λ (ratio of the Lorentz force to the Coriolis force). E is varied from 10 ^- 9 to 10 ^- 2 and Λ from 10 ^- 3 to 1. Apply to arbitrary thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers, our results verify and confirm previous experimental and theoretical results showing the existence of two distinct unstable modes at low values of E one being controlled by the magnetic field, the other being controlled by viscosity (often called the viscous mode). Asymptotic scalings for {{the onset of}} these modes have been numerically confirmed and precisely quantified. We show that with no-slip boundary conditions, the asymptotic behaviour is reached for E< 10 ^- 6 and establish a map in the (E,Λ) plane. We distinguish regions where convection sets in either in the magnetic mode or in the viscous mode. Our analysis gives the regime in which the transition between magnetic and viscous modes may be observed. We also show that within the asymptotic regime, the role played by the kinematic boundary conditions is minimal...|$|R

40|$|Spherical shell dynamo models {{based on}} {{rotating}} convection {{show that the}} flow within the tangent cylinder is dominated by an off-axis plume that extends from the inner core boundary to high latitudes and drifts westward. Earlier studies explained the formation of such a plume {{in terms of the}} effect of a uniform axial magnetic field that significantly increases the length scale of convection in a rotating plane layer. However, rapidly rotating dynamo simulations show that the magnetic field within the tangent cylinder has severe lateral inhomogeneities that may influence the onset of an isolated plume. Increasing the rotation rate in our dynamo simulations (by decreasing the Ekman number E) produces progressively thinner plumes that appear to seek out the location where the field is strongest. Motivated by this result, we examine the linear onset of convection in a rapidly rotating fluid layer subject to a laterally varying axial magnetic field. A Cartesian geometry is chosen where the finite dimensions. (x; z) mimic. (phi, z) in cylindrical coordinates. The lateral inhomogeneity of the field gives rise to a unique mode of instability where convection is entirely confined to the peak-field region. The localization of the flow by the magnetic field occurs even when the field strength (measured by the Elsasser number Lambda) is small and viscosity controls the smallest length scale of convection. The lowest Rayleigh number at which an isolated plume appears within the tangent cylinder in spherical shell dynamo simulations agrees closely with the viscous-mode Rayleigh number in the plane layer linear magnetoconvection model. The lowest Elsasser number for plume formation in the simulations is significantly higher than the onset values in linear magnetoconvection, which indicates that the viscous-magnetic mode transition point with spatially varying fields is displaced to much higher Elsasser numbers. The localized excitation of viscous-mode convection by a laterally varying magnetic field provides a mechanism for the formation of isolated plumes within the <b>Earth's</b> <b>tangent</b> cylinder. The polar vortices in the Earth's core can therefore be non-axisymmetric. More generally, this study shows that a spatially varying magnetic field strongly controls the structure of rotating convection at a Rayleigh number not much different from its non-magnetic value...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} paleomagnetic record from 682 discrete samples from Eltanin 27 – 21 (69. 03 °S 179. 83 °E), a 16 -meter long piston core recovered in 1968 at a water depth of 3456 m by the USNS Eltanin {{as part of}} Operation Deep Freeze. After removal of a low-coercivity overprint, most samples yield stable characteristic remanent magnetization directions. The downhole variation in the magnetic inclination provides a well-resolved magnetostratigraphy from the Brunhes Chron (0 – 0. 781 Ma), through the Reunion Subchron (2. 128 – 2. 148 Ma), and into Chron C 2 r. 2 r. The sedimentation rates are sufficiently high that even short-term geomagnetic features, like the Cobb Mountain excursion, are resolved. The record from Eltanin 27 – 21 provides {{new insights into the}} behavior of the geomagnetic field at high latitudes, about which very little is currently known. Using the variability in the inclinations during stable polarity intervals, we estimate that the dispersion in the paleomagnetic pole position over the past ~ 2 Myr is 30. 3 °± 4. 3 °, which is significantly greater than observed at low to mid latitude sites. The higher dispersion observed at Eltanin 27 – 21 is consistent with numerical modeling of the geodynamo. That modeling has shown that polar vortices can develop in the Earth's core within the tangent cylinder, defined as the cylinder coaxial with the Earth's rotation axis and tangent to the inner core/outer core boundary. The polar vortices produce vigorous fluid motion in the core, which creates greater geomagnetic field variability above the tangent cylinder at the surface of the <b>Earth.</b> The <b>tangent</b> cylinder intersects the Earth's surface in the polar regions at 79. 1 ° latitude, which is relatively close to the latitude of Eltanin 27 – 21...|$|R
