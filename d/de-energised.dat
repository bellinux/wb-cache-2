50|$|Every pipe or vessel {{is subject}} to heat loss when its {{temperature}} is greater than ambient temperature. Thermal insulation reduces {{the rate of heat}} loss but does not eliminate it.

40|$|ATP {{delivery}} and its usage are achieved by cycling of respective intermediates through interconnected coupled reactions. At steady state, cycling between coupled reactions always occurs at zero {{resistance of the}} whole cycle without dissipation of free energy. The cross-bridge cycle can also be described by a system of coupled reactions: one energising reaction, which energises myosin heads by coupled ATP splitting, and one <b>de-energising</b> reaction, which transduces free energy from myosin heads to coupled actin movement. The whole cycle of myosin heads via cross-bridge formation and dissociation proceeds at zero resistance. Dissipation of free energy from coupled reactions occurs whenever the input potential overcomes the counteracting output potential. In addition, dissipation is produced by uncoupling. This is brought about by a load dependent shortening of the cross-bridge stroke to zero, which allows isometric force generation without mechanical power output. The occurrence of maximal efficiency is caused by uncoupling. Under coupled conditions, Hill’s equation (velocity {{as a function of}} load) is fulfilled. In addition, force and shortening velocity both depend on [Ca 2 +]. Muscular fatigue is triggered when ATP consumption overcomes ATP delivery. As a result, the substrate of the cycle, [MgATP 2 −], is reduced. This leads to a switch off of cycling and ATP consumption, so that a recovery of [ATP] is possible. In this way a potentially harmful, persistent low energy state of the cell can be avoided...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{partial discharge}} (PD) phenomena in HVDC insulation, including diagnostic methods {{that are being}} developed. PD detection and analysis is {{used to assess the}} condition of electrical insulation in many types of HV equipment during manufacture, acceptance testing and condition assessment of equipment in the field. In HVAC systems, the phase of the power frequency cycle has a dominant influence on PD activity. Consequently, phase-resolved PD patterns form the cornerstone of many diagnostic techniques for HVAC insulation. However, this approach cannot be used for HVDC systems. The increasing use of HVDC in recent years has led to a growing interest in how PD diagnosis techniques developed for AC systems can be adapted for use with HVDC equipment. Under the influence of an electrostatic (DC) field, the flow of PD current is unipolar, which means that mobile charges in the insulation are subject to forces that cause them to migrate from one conductor to the other, with conductivity of the insulation playing a significant role. This can lead to the accumulation of localised regions of trapped charge. While PD pulses tend to occur much less frequently under HVDC conditions than under comparable HVAC excitation, this trapped charge can cause bursts of discharge activity when the steady-state equilibrium is disturbed, most notably during energising and <b>de-energising.</b> Measurements are presented to illustrate PD behaviour in various test objects subjected to HVAC, HVDC and composite (HVDC plus modulation) voltages. Additional tests on defective 33 kV cables are described, which include DC ramp tests, polarity reversal and soak testing at DC overpotentials. Results results demonstrate how PD activity can be influenced by comparatively minor features of the applied HVDC voltage, such as those associated with ripple from converter switching. Finally, PD data acquisition and analysis techniques are discussed with a view to optimising the application of PD detection under HVDC conditions...|$|R
50|$|When {{the distant}} signal is at 'caution' or yellow (on), the {{electro-magnet}} is <b>de-energised.</b> As the train passes, the permanent magnet sets the system. However, since the electro-magnet is <b>de-energised,</b> {{the system is}} not reset. After the one-second delay within which the system can be reset, a horn warning is given until the driver acknowledges by pressing a plunger. If the driver fails to acknowledge the warning within 2.75 seconds, the brakes are automatically applied. If the driver does acknowledge the warning, the indicator disk changes to yellow and black, to remind the driver that he has acknowledged a warning. The yellow and black indication persists until the next signal and serves as a reminder between signals that the driver is proceeding under caution. The one-second delay before the horn sounds allows the system to operate correctly down to speeds as low as 1.75 miles per hour. Below this speed, the caution horn warning will always be given, but it will be automatically cancelled when the electromagnet resets the system if the driver has not already done so. The display will indicate all black once the system resets.|$|E
50|$|Mechanically, these {{trains are}} very {{different}} from the previous generation Melbourne trains. The X'Trapolis 100 was the first EMU in Melbourne to have computer-controlled traction, braking and safety systems. A continuous electrical circuit runs {{along the length of the}} train, which, when energised allows the train's emergency brakes to release. The circuit will be <b>de-energised</b> by a number of events, such as the driver releasing a vigilance control, applying an emergency brake or passing a signal at stop.

50|$|Some {{organizations}} additionally consider {{working on}} unearthed <b>de-energised</b> equipment {{to be another}} form of live-line working. This is because the line might become inadvertently charged (e.g. through a back-charged transformer, possibly {{as a result of}} an improperly connected, inadequately isolated emergency generator at a customer facility), or inductively coupled from an adjacent in-service line. To prevent this, the line is first grounded via a clamp known as a bond or drain earth. Once this is in place, further work is not considered to be live-line working.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} global {{energy needs}} and the high integration of renewable energy generation have changed the requirements for the electricity grid. Countries are becoming unable to cover their energy demands with their own means {{and the need for}} power exchange between neighboring countries has increased. Consequently, power needs to be transmitted over longer distances and multi-terminal complex grids need to be created to facilitate the energy evolution. Contrary to the existing AC grids, HVDC is an appealing alternative for future grids. VSC technology {{has been the focus of}} recent HVDC research due to its inherent advantages. However, the use of fully-controllable switches becomes a disadvantage in case of DC contingencies. Thus far, opening the AC breakers has been the only way to clear DC faults, by completely <b>de-energising</b> the system and interrupting the power transfer with significant economic and societal consequences. Other protection concepts include multi-level converters with full-bridge submodules, which are able to limit the fault current; and control methods which identify the faulty lines. However, DC switch breakers are necessary to isolate the faulty line from the network, allowing normal operation to be resumed. The main contributions of this thesis are the comparison of different grid operating topologies under fault cases; and the impact analysis of different current limiting measures and control strategies on the developing DC fault currents. A four terminal grid in radial configuration was simulated using Matlab/Simulink®, and the natural fault response of the stations in most common HVDC grid topologies was studied. Additionally, two selective fault detection methods are proposed, which take into account the current direction on DC lines and the rate of rise of the fault currents. Four DC breaker technologies were simulated for all analysed grid topologies, and compared on the basis of the total DC fault interruption time and their influence on the system post-fault coordination and operation restoration. With the concepts analysed in this thesis, MTDC network system designers will be able to understand and tackle DC contingencies to facilitate an uninterruptible power flow between the different interconnected AC grids.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} stepping motors {{to date is}} in low power open loop positioning systems. It is widely known that self synchronisation offers a significant improvement in dynamic performance in addition to step integrity. The necessary positional feedback is traditionally provided by a position encoder. However the fitting of such a device is usually expensive and inconvenient. Previous analyses of stator current waveforms of motors driven from the conventional L/R drive have revealed rotor position dependant characteristics {{which can be used}} to provide self positional feedback. A variety of different schemes using both on and off phases have been proposed in the literature. Successful self synchronisation utilising some of these characteristics has been reported for multiple stack variable reluctance stepping motors. When the active suppression drive is used, the variable reluctance stepping motor offers high specific output and efficiency making it a contender in controlled speed drive applications as well. Lower manufacturing cost makes the single stack motor additionally attractive. A single stack stepping motor driven under self synchronised control from self positional feedback and using active suppression drives is potentially an efficient cost effective drive offering precision speed and position control. The single stack motor has significant mutual inductances between phases. This coupling considerably complicates the task of obtaining self positional feedback, especially when active suppression drives are used. This research investigates the suitability of the single stack variable reluctance stepping motor to position encoderless self synchronisation when driven by an active suppression drive and chopper current limiting. An algorithm for obtaining the necessary self positional feedback has been developed and the equipment necessary to implement it has been designed and constructed. Certain characteristics which restrict the performance of the algorithm have been observed during operation. These characteristics have been explained in terms of the significant mutual inductances between phases inherent in the single stack motor. A linear model of the on and <b>de-energising</b> phase currents has been developed and implemented numerically. The results have been used to generate theoretical torque vs speed plots. These plots show good agreement with the measured performance. A linear model of the self positional feedback algorithm has been developed to further the analytical understanding of the advances made experimentally. The numerical solutions identify the cause of the performance restrictions and simulate the nature of the observed self positional feedback characteristics closely. A suggestion is made for continuing research which is believed likely to yield significant results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the presence of diazoxide- and nicorandil-activated K+ channels in rat skeletal muscle. Activation of potassium transport in the rat skeletal muscle myoblast cell line L 6 caused a stimulation of cellular oxygen consumption, implying a mitochondrial effect. Working with isolated rat skeletal muscle mitochondria, both potassium channel openers (KCOs) stimulate respiration, depolarize the mitochondrial inner membrane and lead to oxidation of the mitochondrial NAD-system in a strict potassium-dependent manner. This is a strong indication for KCO-mediated stimulation of potassium transport at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Moreover, the potassium-specific effects of both diazoxide and nicorandil on oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria were completely abolished by the antidiabetic sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, a well-known inhibitor of ATP-regulated potassium channels (KATP channels). Since both diazoxide and nicorandil facilitated swelling of <b>de-energised</b> mitochondria in KSCN buffer at the same concentrations, our results implicate {{the presence of a}} mitochondrial ATP-regulated potassium channel (mitoKATP channel) in rat skeletal muscle which can modulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation...|$|E
