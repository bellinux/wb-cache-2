Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection {{than what is}} available in the stores with prices occasionally varying. Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.|$|E

This definition reflect three main components- service provider, service receiver and the channels {{of service delivery}} (i.e., technology). For example, as concerned to public e-service, public agencies are the service provider and citizens as well as businesses are the service receiver. The channel of service delivery is the third requirement of e-service.

Is it simply because furniture <b>e-tailing</b> or the online market is still at a nascent stage? If that is so, it is a ‘land’ of opportunity for new businesses. Or could it be that it is very difficult and challenging to e-tail furniture? Is the situation compounded by the limited market size and other market attributes?
