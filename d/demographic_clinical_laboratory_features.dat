40|$|Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} represents, by far, {{the major}} cause of mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC). The renal disease associated with this pathological condition is now well described. By contrast, renal involvement in patients with MC not associated with HCV has been only poorly described, and few cases have been reported. We analyzed the <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> and outcome in patients presenting with renal disease associated with MC not related to HCV infection. Records of 20 patients with MC and renal disease, with no evidence of HCV by serology and polymerase chain reaction analysis, were retrospectively analyzed. Renal biopsies and extensive searches for lymphoproliferative disorder were performed in all patients at presentation. MC was related to primary Sjögren Syn-drome (pSS) in 9 patients, and to non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1 patient, while MC was classified as essential in the remaining 10 cases.

40|$|Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CPS) is often {{preceded by a}} viral illness and has recurrent "flulike" symptoms. We compared <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> (markers of inflammation and viral infection) among 717 patients with chronic fatigue (CF) with and without a self-reported postinfectious onset to identify associated clinical and biologic findings and to examine the subset of patients with CFS. Only subjective fever, chills, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, poorer functional status, and attribution of illness to a physical condition {{were significantly associated with}} a postinfec-tious onset. The features of patients with CPS were virtually identical to those of the broader category of patients with CF. We conclude that a postinfectious onset was not associated with a pattern of abnormalities across multiple psychosocial and biologic parameters. There has been growing interest in several conditions associ-ated with persistent fatigue. These include chronic fatigue syn-drome (CFS), an illness characterized by disabling fatigue, subjective fever, sore throat, sleep difficulties, and neuropsy-chiatric disturbances [1], as well as unexplained chronic fatigue (CF) that does not meet strict criteria for CFS.

We analyzed the etiology as well as <b>clinical</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> of patients with biopsy-proven AA amyloidosis and evaluated the ultimate outcome. Methods: Seventy-three patients (24 female; mean age 41. 85 ± 15. 89 years) were analyzed retrospectively. <b>Demographic,</b> <b>clinical</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> were studied and the outcome was assessed. Results: Familial Mediterranean Fever and tuberculosis were the most frequent causes of amyloidosis. Mean serum creatinine and proteinuria at diagnosis were 4. 65 ± 4. 89 mg/dl and 8. 04 ± 6. 09 g/day, respectively; and stage I, II, III, IV and V renal disease were present in 19. 2 %, 13. 7 %, 16. 4 %, 11 %, and 39. 7 % of the patients, respectively. ESRD developed in 16 patients during the follow-up period. All of the ESRD patients started a dialysis programme. Thirty patients (41 %) died during the follow-up period; median patient survival was 35. 9 ± 6. 12 months. Old age, tuberculosis etiology, advanced renal disease and low serum albumin levels were associated with a worse prognosis. Serum albumin was a predictor of mortality in logistic regression analysis.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> of children with KD who were diagnosed and managed in the American Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. METHOD: Patients with KD were retrospectively identified from the hospital discharge records between 2002 and 2010. Atypical cases of KD were excluded. A standardized form was used to collect <b>demographic</b> data, <b>clinical</b> information, echocardiography and laboratory results. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with KD, {{with a mean age}} of 2. 5 ¡ 1. 9 years, were identified. Eighty-five point seven per cent of patients were under 5 years of age. A seasonal pattern favouring the winter months was noticed. In addition to fever and bilateral conjunctival injection, changes in the oral cavity and lips were the most commonly detected clinical signs in our cases. Coronary artery abnormalities were detected in nine patients. The majority of our patients had started treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin in the first 10 days of the onset of fever, and only one patient required systemic steroids for intravenous immunoglobulin-resistant KD. The coronary artery abnormalities resolved in all nine patients within 8 months. CONCLUSION: This study is the most comprehensive series of children from Turkey with KD included in Medline. A...|$|R

We report the first tularemia epidemic occurring in Sivas, and some features of the cases. Methods: Twenty-nine patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Clinic of Cumhuriyet University Hospital, between January 2009 and June 2010 were retrospectively investigated. Microagglutination method was used for serological diagnosis. Patients were reviewed and recorded for <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features.</b> Results: 15 of the patients were male and 14 were female. The mean age was 41. 8 years. The mean time between {{the onset of the}} symptoms and diagnosis was 38 days. Francisella tularensis was detected by polymerase chain reaction in lymph node aspirate from two patients. This epidemic was thought to be waterborne. In most of the cases (75. 9 %), the disease presented itself in the oropharyngeal form. The majority of the patients (93. 1 %) had cervical lymphadenopathy. Prior to diagnosis of tularemia, several antibiotic regimens ineffective for tularemia were given to 72. 4 % of the patients. Streptomycin and doxycycline combination was given to most of the patients (44. 8 %) for treatment. No mortality or sequela except for scar was observed.

OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical and biological characteristics of newly diagnosed Churg-Strauss syndrome, {{according to the presence}} or absence of ANCA. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of manifestations of participants who were enrolled in treatment trials between December 1995 and December 2002. SETTING: Multicenter study in 63 clinical centers in France, Belgium, Latvia, and the United Kingdom, coordinated by the French Vasculitis Study Group. PARTICIPANTS: 112 patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome that was recently diagnosed on the basis of current classifications. MEASUREMENTS: The authors compared principal <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> according to ANCA status at diagnosis. RESULTS: The authors detected ANCA in 43 (38 %) patients. Positive ANCA status at diagnosis was associated with renal involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and biopsy-proven vasculitis, whereas negative ANCA status was associated with heart disease and fever. LIMITATIONS: The authors assessed ANCA by immunofluorescence, but they did not assess ANCA centrally or systematically retest if ANCA was undetected at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypically, ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative Churg-Strauss syndrome might differ. The association of ANCA positivity with clinical symptoms that indicate inflammation and necrosis of small vessels might characterize a predominantly vasculitic pattern of the Churg-Strauss syndrome. status: publishe...|$|R

Methods: Between January and June 2007, 0 - 5 year old children with wheezing attending the Pediatric Clinics, University of Mersin were prospectively enrolled. Nasopharyngeal wash specimens obtained at enrollment were tested for viral detection by HEXAPLEX® PLUS multiplex polimerase chain reaction. Relationships between viral pathogen and patients’ <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> and treatment modalities were assessed. Results: At least one viral agent was detected in 73 % of all patients. hMPV was found in 59. 7 %of the cases and it was the most commonly isolated agent. It caused wheezing in 6 - 11 month old children mostly. Bronchopneumonia was more frequent among hMPV positive patients than those infected by influenza. Clinical manifestations of hMPV and PIV were similar. Coinfection was detected in 53 %of all patients. Patients with hMPV coinfections showed a relatively more severe clinical course than patients with non-hMPV coinfections. Conclusion: Respiratory viruses are the most important cause of wheezing in this age group and hMPV was the most commonly isolated pathogen. Hence, to prevent unnecessary antibacterial treatment and to apply suitable antiviral treatment to selected patients, virologic diagnosis from respiratory secretions is mandatory.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare and evaluate the <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> of late onset and early onset AS patients who were followed up in a single rheumatology center. A total of 339 patients who have been diagnosed with AS according to modified New York criteria were included in the study. The patients whose initial symptoms were observed after 50 years of age were accepted as late onset AS. Out of 339 patients, 27 (7. 9 %) were diagnosed as late onset AS and 312 (92. 3 %) patients were evaluated as early onset AS. Of 27 late onset patients, 10 were male and 17 were female. Delay in the diagnosis was 5. 8 years for early onset AS, while it was 3. 8 years for late onset AS (p = 0. 001). Higher levels of acute phase reactants and more methotrexate (MTX) use were detected in early onset AS patients compared to late onset AS (p = 0. 001, p = 0. 007, respectively). Statistically, there was no difference between these two groups, with regard to disease clinical activity indexes, anthropometric measurement parameters, uveitis and peripheral joint involvement. In this study, we showed that early and late onset AS patients may present with different <b>clinical,</b> genetic, and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features.</b> Late onset AS patients are characterized with lower human leukocyte antigen-B 27 sequence, less inflammatory sign, delayed diagnosis, and less MTX and anti- tumor necrosis factor alpha drug usage. </p...|$|R

Blood samples were collected for HIV and malaria testing, blood culture and full blood counts, and a chest X-ray was performed. A panel of common respiratory viruses was investigated using two independent multiplex RT-PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and viral type. RV species and genotypes were identified by semi-nested PCR assays, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. RESULTS: At least one respiratory virus was identified in 206 (74. 4 %) children hospitalized with clinical pneumonia. RV {{was the most common}} virus identified in both HIV-infected (17 / 38, 44. 7 %) and HIV-uninfected (74 / 237, 31. 2 %; p= 0. 100) children. RV-A was the most common RV species identified (47 / 275, 17. 0 %), followed by RV-C (35 / 275, 12. 6 %) and RV-B (8 / 275, 2. 9 %). Clinical presentation of the different RV species was similar and overlapping, with no particular species being associated with specific clinical features.

Previous studies in Nepal have highlighted the importance of murine typhus {{as a cause of}} febrile illness in adults and enteric fever as a leading bacterial cause of fever among children admitted to hospital. Methods: We prospectively studied a total of 1084 febrile children aged between 2 months and 14 years presenting to a general hospital outpatient department in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, over two study periods (summer and winter). Blood from all patients was tested by conventional culture and by real-time PCR for Rickettsia typhi. Results: Putative etiological agents for fever were identified in 164 (15 %) patients. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) was identified in 107 (10 %), S. enterica serovar Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi) in 30 (3 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae in 6 (0. 6 %), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in 2 (0. 2 %), Haemophilus influenzae type b in 1 (0. 1 %), and Escherichia coli in 1 (0. 1 %) patient.

Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a small vessel vasculitis; but is also included in the various classification systems of chronic urticaria by some authors. The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of accompanying conditions, and to compare the <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> of patients with CSU and UV. Materials and Methods: In this study, the files of CSU (n= 146) and UV (n= 43) patients who had been hospitalized between January 2010 -December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed in terms of demographic data, disease-specific history, accompanying diseases, medications and laboratory findings. Results: When comparing between the two groups for statistical differences, it was found that the frequencies of personal atopy and angioedema were significantly higher in patients with CSU; however, the patients with UV had significantly higher rates for female gender and the presence of systemic symptoms compared to those with CSU. It was determined that the mean values for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, as well as the rates of antinuclear antibody positivity and hypocomplementemia were significantly higher in the UV group, compared with those in the CSU group. Accompanying factors were determined as infections, medications, autoimmune diseases and malignities in order of frequency in both CSU and UV groups, but only the frequency of autoimmune diseases was significantly higher in patients with UV group.

Aims: A retrospective study was performed at a UK centre to identify the demographic and presenting features of a spinal TB population, their response to treatment, and the value of follow up MR studies. Patients and Results: Twenty one patients were identified with mean symptom duration of 11 (1. 5 – 36) months having been assessed by a health practitioner on 3. 2 (0 – 10) occasions before referral for investigation for ST. Twenty were born outside the UK. Their mean duration of residence in the UK was 6. 67 (0. 75 – 20) years, and six (32 %) were resident for more than 10 years. Most (85. 7 %) did not have a medical history and one was HIV positive. Back pain, neurological, and constitutional symptoms were found in 100 %, 29 %, and 38 % respectively. Musculoskeletal and neurological signs were found in 29 % and 19 % respectively. Spinal MR performed between 6 and 12 months suggests that six months of chemotherapy (for a fully sensitive organism) may not be sufficient to achieve disease resolution. Conclusions: Awareness of the <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> of an ST population may facilitate earlier diagnosis. Guidance is required on the appropriate use and interpretation of MRI in th...|$|R
40|$|Background: Amyloid A (AA) {{amyloidosis}} is a multisystem, {{progressive and}} fatal disease. Renal involvement occurs {{early in the}} course of AA. We aimed to investigate the etiology, <b>clinical</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features,</b> and outcome of patients with biopsy-proven renal AA amyloidosis. Materials and Methods: A total of 121 patients (male/female: 84 / 37, mean age 42. 6 ± 14. 4 years) were analyzed retrospectively between January of 2001 and May of 2013. <b>Demographic,</b> <b>clinical</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> and outcomes data were obtained from follow-up charts. Results: Familial Mediterranean fever (37. 2 %) and tuberculosis (24. 8 %) were the most frequent causes of amyloidosis. Mean serum creatinine and proteinuria at diagnosis were 2. 3 ± 2. 1 mg/dL and 6. 7 ± 5. 3 g/day, respectively. Sixty-eight (56. 2 %) patients were started dialysis treatment during the follow-up period. Mean duration of renal survival was 64. 7 ± 6. 3 months. Age, serum creatinine and albumin levels were found as predictors of end-stage renal disease. Fifty patients (% 41. 3) died during the follow-up period. The mean survival of patients was 88. 7 ± 7. 8 months (median: 63 ± 13. 9). 1, 2 and 5 years survival rates of patients were 80. 7 %, 68. 2 % and 51. 3 %, respectively. Older age, male gender, lower levels of body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum albumin, calcium, and higher levels of phosphor, intact parathyroid hormone and proteinuria were associated with a higher mortality. Higher serum creatinine, lower albumin, dialysis requirement and short time to dialysis were predictors of mortality. Conclusion: The outcome of patients with AA amyloidosis and renal involvement is poor, particularly in those who had massive proteinuria, severe hypoalbuminemia and dialysis requirement at the outset...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare and {{contrast}} the initial presenting <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> neuroimaging, and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> in a cohort of children affected from multiple sclerosis (MS) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). METHODS: A 12 -year prospective study was conducted in 68 pediatric patients (age<or= 17 years) who presented with a first episode of central nervous system inflammation suggestive of a demyelinating multifocal pathology. All patients had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. The mean follow-up period, as at ending on December 31, 2007, was 6. 8 +/- 2. 7 years (range 3. 2 - 12. 6 years). RESULTS: At clinical onset, children who developed MS during the follow-up (48 patients; 34 females, 14 males; mean age at onset: 14. 4 +/- 2. 5) significantly differed from children affected by ADEM (20 patients; 8 females, 12 males; mean age at onset: 8. 1 +/- 3. 8) for the following parameters: prevalence of females affected (female/male ratio: 2. 8 versus 0. 6, P= 0. 03); mean age at onset (P< 0. 001); monosymptomatic onset (73...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} recognition that asthma and eczema are heterogeneous diseases. We investigated the predictive {{ability of a}} spectrum of machine learning methods to disambiguate clinical sub-groups of asthma, wheeze and eczema, using a large heterogeneous set of attributes in an unselected population. The aim was to identify to what extent such heterogeneous information can be combined to reveal specific clinical manifestations. The study population comprised a cross-sectional sample of adults, and included representatives {{of the general population}} enriched by subjects with asthma. Linear and non-linear machine learning methods, from logistic regression to random forests, were fit on a large attribute set including <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features,</b> genetic profiles and environmental exposures. Outcome of interest were asthma, wheeze and eczema encoded by different operational definitions. Model validation was performed via bootstrapping. The study population included 554 adults, 42 % male, 38 % previous or current smokers. Proportion of asthma, wheeze, and eczema diagnoses was 16. 7 %, 12. 3 %, and 21. 7 %, respectively. Models were fit on 223 non-genetic variables plus 215 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In general, non-linear models achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than other methods, especially for asthma and wheeze, less for eczema, with areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of 84 %, 76 % and 64 %, respectively. Our findings confirm that allergen sensitisation and lung function characterise asthma better in combination than separately. The predictive ability of genetic markers alone is limited. For eczema, new predictors such as bio-impedance were discovered. More usefully-complex modelling is the key {{to a better understanding of}} disease mechanisms and personalised healthcare: further advances are likely with the incorporation of more factors/attributes and longitudinal measures...|$|R
40|$|Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is an {{uncommon}} neoplasm of liver compared with hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic resection seems {{to provide the}} only chance for therapeutic success. The records of 77 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated over a 28 -year period were studied to determine <b>demographics,</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>features,</b> <b>laboratory</b> findings, diagnostic tests, operative management, and results of therapy. Survival was analyzed according to three treatment groups: conservative management, palliative operation, and hepatic resection. Conservative management was used for 15 patients, and hepatic resections were performed in 39 patients. The remaining 23 patients had laparotomy alone (10 patients), bile duct intubation (4 patients), hepatic artery ligation (3 patients), bilienteric bypass (3 patients), gastrojejunostomy (1 patient), insertion of a hepatic artery port for regional chemotherapy (1 patient), or open drainage of an abscess (1 patient). The median survival after conservative management, palliative operation, and hepatic resection were 1. 8, 2. 9, and, 12. 2 months, respectively. After hepatic resection, patients without lymphatic permeation (p < 0. 02) or hilar nodal metastases (p < 0. 0003) survived significantly longer. We concluded that hepatic resection is indicated for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma when it is deemed resectable. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Forty-one {{patients}} with extrahepatic biliary obstruction by metastatic gastric carcinoma underwent retrospective {{study to determine}} <b>demographics,</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>features,</b> <b>laboratory</b> findings on presentation, time interval from previous gastrectomy, level of biliary obstruction, methods of palliation, complications from treatment, treatment results, and survival. Thirty-seven patients underwent biliary decompression by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) (35 patients), endoscopic insertion of plastic stent (one patient), and operative insertion of T tube (1 patient). The remaining 4 patients had no biliary drainage procedure performed. Subsequently expandable metallic biliary stents were inserted in 9 patients through the PTBD tract. Two patients received postdrainage external irradiation. Reduction in serum total bilirubin was seen in all patients after drainage. Two patients were alive {{at the time of}} this analysis. The median survival of these 41 patients was only 70 days. The 6 - and 9 -month survival rates were 27. 0 % and 9. 7 %, respectively. Hemoglobin (p < 0. 001) and total bilirubin (p < 0. 002) on presentation were found to be independent factors predicting survival. Extrahepatic biliary obstruction by metastatic gastric carcinoma was associated with poor survival. Patients with profound anemia or jaundice on presentation carried the worst prognosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To study prospectively the serum {{prolactin}} (PRL) concentrations among male {{patients with}} {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) and their possible relationship to disease activity and manifestations. Methods. Serum PRL levels were measured by radioimmunoassay in 31 male patients with SLE and 31 age matched controls. <b>Demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>features</b> of the patients were obtained. Mean PRL levels from both groups were compared, and PRL from patients with SLE was correlated with variables of disease activity, including the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), complement level, and anti-dsDNA titer. Thirteen patients were followed serially and changes in PRL levels in relation to fluctuation in disease activity were evaluated. Results. Mean PRL levels were higher in male patients with SLE than healthy controls; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (230 vs 194 mlU/l; p = 0. 06). Hyperprolactinemia was found in 4 patients (13 %) and {{was not associated with}} particular clinical manifestations or autoantibodies. Considering all patients as a whole, PRL levels did not correlate with variables of disease activity and {{there was no difference in}} PRL between patients with active versus inactive disease. A subanalysis of the 4 hyperprolactinemic patients revealed a higher SLEDAI score than those with normal PRL (8. 8 vs 3. 7; p = 0. 20); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Among the hyperprolactinemic patients, PRL levels did not correlate with SLEDAI score or anti-dsDNA titer. Prospective studies of PRL levels in 13 patients did not indicate a role of PRL in the monitoring of disease activity or predicting relapses. Conclusion. Hyperprolactinemia occurred in a small proportion of male patients with SLE and its significance remained unclear. Serum PRL level did not correlate with disease activity and was not a reliable marker for disease monitoring. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To seek {{insights}} into the heterogeneity of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) complicating {{systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (sJIA) through the analysis of a large patient sample collected in a multinational survey. Methods. International pediatric rheumatologists and hemato-oncologists entered their patient data, collected retrospectively, in a Web-based database. The <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> <b>laboratory,</b> histopathologic, therapeutic, and outcome data were analyzed in relation to (1) geographic location of caring hospital, (2) subspecialty of attending physician, (3) demonstration of hemophagocytosis, and (4) severity of clinical course. Results. A total of 362 patients were included by 95 investigators from 33 countries. <b>Demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> <b>laboratory,</b> and histopathologic <b>features</b> were comparable among patients seen in diverse geographic areas or by different pediatric specialists. Patients seen in North America were given biologics more frequently. Patients entered by pediatric hemato-oncologists were treated more commonly with biologics and etoposide, whereas patients seen by pediatric rheumatologists more frequently received cyclosporine. Patients with demonstration of hemophagocytosis had shorter duration of sJIA at MAS onset, higher prevalence of hepatosplenomegaly, lower levels of platelets and fibrinogen, and were more frequently administered cyclosporine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and etoposide. Patients with severe course were older, had longer duration of sJIA at MAS onset, had more full-blown clinical picture, and were more commonly given cyclosporine, IVIG, and etoposide. Conclusion. The clinical spectrum of MAS is comparable across patients seen in different geographic settings or by diverse pediatric subspecialists. There was a disparity in the therapeutic choices among physicians that underscores the need to establish uniform therapeutic protocols...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> <b>laboratory</b> and genetic <b>features</b> and radiographic damage at onset on the outcome after 2 years in a prospective study of 147 patients with classical or definite RA with disease duration shorter than 1 year at entry. Outcome was determined by physical disability and by radiographic damage of hands and feet. By means of multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis outcome was explained from variables at the start and during the first 6 months. No clinically relevant conclusions could be made for physical disability due to the low explained variance and small number of patients with bad physical disability. Radiographic damage after 2 years was pre-dicted by high disease activity at the start (measured as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein or Disease Activity Score) combined with DR 4 or DR 2 (as a prognostically favourable factor) and rheumatoid factor positivity. Radiographic damage could be better predicted if disease activity during the first 6 months was included. Absence or pres-ence of progression of radiographic damage could be correctly predicted in 83 % of the patients. KEY WORDS: Prognosis, Early rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|The California Encephalitis Project (CEP), {{established}} in 1998 to explore encephalitic etiologies, has identified patients with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies, the likely etiology of their encephalitis. This study compares {{the presentation of}} such patients to those with viral encephalitis, so that infectious disease clinicians may identify individuals with this treatable disorder. Patients were physician-referred, and standardized forms were used to gather <b>demographic,</b> <b>clinical,</b> and <b>laboratory</b> data. <b>Features</b> of anti-NMDAR+ patients were compared with the viral encephalitides of enteroviral (EV), rabies, and herpes simplex- 1 (HSV- 1) origins. Sixteen cases with confirmed viral etiologies were all negative on NMDAR antibody testing. Ten anti-NMDAR+ patients were profiled with a median age of 18. 5  years (range 11 – 31  years). None were Caucasian. They had a characteristic progression with prominent psychiatric symptoms, autonomic instability, significant neurologic abnormalities, and seizures. Two had a teratoma, and, of the remaining eight, four had serologic evidence of acute Mycoplasma infection. The clinical and imaging features of anti-NMDAR+ patients served to differentiate this autoimmune disorder from HSV- 1, EV, and rabies. Unlike classic paraneoplastic encephalitis, anti-NMDAR encephalitis affects younger patients and is often treatable. The association of NMDAR antibodies in patients with possible Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection warrants further study...|$|R
