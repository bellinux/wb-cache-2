25|$|I am {{forced to}} the appalling {{conclusion}} that I {{would never have}} become a writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization {{of the extent to}} which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice except to write my way out.

2500|$|For {{several years}} Truffaut had become {{increasingly}} interested in people {{from his life}} who had died, beginning with his mentor and father-figure André Bazin, who had died the day before Truffaut began shooting his first feature, The 400 Blows. Truffaut told a reporter for L'Express: [...] "I'm faithful to the dead, <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> them. I'm forty-five and already beginning {{to be surrounded by}} dead people." [...] In 1977 Truffaut lost two other important father-figures: Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois and Roberto Rossellini, whom Truffaut called [...] "the most intelligent man, with André Bazin" [...] during an interview with Le Matin de Paris. Around this time Truffaut had watched Shoot the Piano Player and noticed that half the actors had since died. In an interview with [...] magazine Truffaut asked [...] "Why not have the same range of feelings for the dead as for the living, the same aggressive or affectionate relationship?" [...] and added that he wanted to film [...] "what {{it would be like to}} show on screen a man who refuses to forget the dead." [...] According to him, The Green Room is not the worshipping of death, but an extension of the love for the people that we have met and who are no longer alive, and the idea that they have a permanency. What matters is that Davenne refuses to forget, and this refusal is important for Truffaut.|$|E
