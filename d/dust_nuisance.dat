This has made the poultry industry vulnerable to unsubstantiated criticism. Recently, the Australian poultry industry have made a significant investment in research to obtain accurate estimates of odour, dust and volatile chemical emission rates from typical poultry housing systems. This paper describes the measurement of odour emissions from tunnel ventilated poultry housing systems in different climatic zones in Queensland and Victoria, Australia (humid sub-tropical and Mediterranean respectively) during two seasons (summer and winter). Samples were collected at defined intervals over typical batch production cycles to define the odour emission profiles. These samples were analysed using dynamic olfactometry according to the Australian Standard 4323. 3 to derive the odour concentration values. Ventilation rates were measured concurrently, allowing the calculation of odour emission rates. Odour concentration and emission rates were assessed in terms of ventilation rate, ambient and shed air temperature and relative humidity and litter moisture status. Odour emission rates varied with bird age. Seasonal differences in odour emission rate were also observed...|$|E

40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase in}} the use of coal as an energy source for the production of steel has resulted in several investigations into environmental cycling of coal unleashes pollutants. Among these is the release of various liquid effluents that are associated with coal throughout the carbonization, cleaning and combustion processes. The industries, like coal, by-product coke-plants, coal washeries and thermal power plants unleash their liquid effluents that are required urgent attention for the treatment, before they are discharged into the contemporary water streams. There’s also the release of ash pond decant into the local water bodies from the coal-based industries. Such unleash pond decant tends to deposit ash all along its path thereby inflicting fugitive <b>dust</b> <b>nuisance</b> when it dries up. Additionally when such water mixes with a water body, it will increase the turbidity of the water body thereby decreasing the primary productivity.

40|$|Abstract Background Dust {{exposure}} {{is a well-known}} occupational hazard for terrestrial workers and astronauts alike {{and will continue to}} be a concern as humankind pursues exploration and habitation of objects beyond Earth. Humankind’s limited exploration experience with the Apollo Program indicates that exposure to dust will be unavoidable. Therefore, NASA must assess potential toxicity and recommend appropriate mitigation measures to ensure that explorers are adequately protected. Visual acuity is critical during exploration activities and operations aboard spacecraft. Therefore, the present research was performed to ascertain the ocular toxicity of authentic lunar dust. Methods Small (mean particle diameter[*]=[*] 2. 9 [*]±[*] 1. 0 μm), reactive lunar dust particles were produced by grinding bulk dust under ultrapure nitrogen conditions. Chemical reactivity and cytotoxicity testing were performed using the commercially available EpiOcular TM assay. Subsequent in vivo Draize testing utilized a larger size fraction of unground lunar dust that is more relevant to ocular exposures (particles Results In vitro testing indicated minimal irritancy potential based on the time required to reduce cell viability by 50 % (ET 50). Follow-up testing using the Draize standard protocol confirmed that the lunar dust was minimally irritating. Minor irritation of the upper eyelids was noted at the 1 -hour observation point, but these effects resolved within 24 hours. In addition, no corneal scratching was observed using fluorescein stain. Conclusions Low-titanium mare lunar dust is minimally irritating to the eyes and is considered a <b>nuisance</b> <b>dust</b> for ocular exposure.

40|$|In the {{environment}} of smelting works we meet many risky factors endangering the health of employees. Due to the excessive exposure to these risks, employees may suffer from many health problems. Many aspects {{play an important role}} in the rise of these problems. They are, for example, fitness and individual performance, ability to adapt, age, sex and etc. Dust is one of the most important factors affecting the organism of each employee during the job at smelting works. My Bachelor´s Thesis, in its theoretical part, summarizes the basic information about the issues of dust by using available literature. It specifically focuses on the characteristics of this risk, essential knowledge regarding the anatomy of airways, describes effect of dust on an organism and shows related illnesses. The objective of the practical part was to create a hypothesis in the area of risk related to <b>dust</b> <b>nuisance</b> in the smelting works, analyze the health risk of this factor in working conditions and segmentation of jobs into categories.

40|$|Fugitive {{dust from}} {{quarrying}} and related extractive industry activities is a long-standing and intractable problem. Attempts to control emissions are directed by legislation and informed by statutory guidance, within the overall context {{of national and}} international air quality strategies. In many cases, local monitoring {{is a prerequisite for}} efficient development of dust suppression. In cases of dispute or of particular concern, it is often necessary to confidently attribute problem dust to one or more local source(s) – in effect to answer the fundamental question: whose dust is it? This contribution describes a method of dust source attribution developed by DustScan Ltd, which combines a simple and cost-effective technique for collecting ambient dust by direction, with multi-element analysis by plasma spectrometry. DustScan is a passive system for monitoring fugitive dust 360 ° around a replaceable sampling head. It uses a transparent, permanent adhesive, ‘sticky pad’ on a 70 mm diameter cylindrical monitoring head. Measurement of dust coverage on the sticky pads after monitoring uses a computer-based scanning system and bespoke software. The pattern of dusting on the sticky pad indicates the direction and scale of potential <b>dust</b> <b>nuisance</b> by direction. Given this information, samples may be taken according to suspected dust source, and subjected to a range of geochemical analyses including acid dissolution (HF-HNO 3) prior to analysis by ICPAES or ICP-MS. Rigorous blank correction procedures are essential to account for metallic components of the sticky pads themselves, but good results are obtained for a range of elements including Cu, As, Cd and Pb. Careful assessment of the data often allows sourcespecific elemental criteria to be established; the elemental fingerprints of dust type. In the simplest of cases, this is sufficient to identify the source of a problem dust, but more commonly some form of mixture deconvolution is required. Various intuitive graphical techniques have been successful in small-scale studies, but multivariate statistics and least-squares mass balance methods provide powerful tools for source attribution as the site database increases. Examples of the application of such techniques to a variety of extractive industry sites demonstrate the utility of the methods in the extractive industries and elsewhere...|$|E

Nowadays, a lot of attention has been turned toward health effects of air pollution. The objective of this study is detection of the total dust concentration and assessment of the health effect of <b>nuisance</b> <b>dust</b> among workers in a tile production factory. MethodsIn this study airborne dust concentration was measured and evaluated by using NIOSH 0500 method. In order to determine the health effects, a standard questionnaire was used. All of personnel of workshop 1 (n= 50) and workshop 2 (n= 50) were assigned to the case group and one hundreds of factory employees were assigned to the control group. Results analyzed using Z test. ResultsAccording to the obtained results, concentration of dust in workshop 1 corridor was higher than that of workshop 2 corridor (59. 262 mg/m 3 and 32. 158 mg/m 3 respectively). Also, these results showed that there are significant differences between two groups in incidence of symptoms such as dry cough, eye irritation, skin redness, shortness of breath, blurred vision, skin irritation, hoarseness of voice, dry mouth and throat, throat itching and skin itching (P< 0. 05). However, there were not significant differences in incidence of headache, chest pain, epiphora of eyes, mucus cough, sinus problems and chest wheezing between two groups. ConclusionOn the basis of these results it was revealed that <b>nuisance</b> <b>dust</b> can affect human health and performance. This in turn can increase the medical service load and costs. As a result of inadequate control systems established in the industries, lack of information and appropriate training, and lack of personal protective equipment all across the industries, we suggest a more comprehensive research project to evaluate the effects of industrial air pollution on the workers in order to improve quality of their lives and work.

30|$|The rock dust is {{considered}} as <b>nuisance</b> <b>dust</b> {{that should have}} no adverse effect {{to the health of}} the miners, especially to the workers performing the rock dusting operations. However, it should be noted that research on the effects of rock dust to miners’ health is still limited. The most important factor to consider is the content of silica (SiO 2). Any extended accumulation of dust with high silica content in human lungs, together with the tissue reaction to its presence, is usually referred to as pneumoconiosis (Du Plessis 2014). Therefore, for miners’ health, MSHA requires that the rock dust not contain more than 5 % combustible matter or more than a total of 4 % free and combined silica (SiO 2). However, further medical studies should be performed on silica and other mineral components in the rock dust to determine their effects to human health.|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} reclamation technologies based on sewage sludge treatment, however, {{one that is}} most purposeful consists in applying the sludge {{in order to achieve}} green cover (bioremediation with plants) on fine grained waste disposal sites which have a high potential for soil formation on the one hand, but on the other, are highly vulnerable to erosive action of wind and atmospheric precipitation. The technological waste at the Janikowo Soda Plant has liquid consistence, contains fine-grained (dust-like) and water soluble calcium compounds, and is highly alkaline and saline. The waste was disposed and dehydrated in the large-area earthen ponds elevated beyond the ground level. The combined surface of all the exploited settling ponds (with roads and escarpments jointly) exceeds 105 ha. Dehydration by infiltration and evaporation was a source of unrestricted dust emissions from the drying and dry surfaces of the waste site. Urgent action was then deemed necessary to manage the high risk of <b>nuisance</b> <b>dust</b> to the local population, technical infrastructure, engines and cars. Consequently, it was decided {{that the best way to}} manage <b>nuisance</b> <b>dust</b> would be to create a thick and permanent vegetal cover on the waste site. The vegetal cover would also limit salt infiltration from the disposal site to groundwater and to adjacent agricultural land, and contribute to improving the local landscape values. Treatment with adequately high (appropriate for reclamation purposes) doses of sewage sludge and sowing of plants which have a high growth potential and nutrient demand resulted in the quick establishment of green cover on the waste disposal site. The contents of mineral elements in plants and in the top layer of the ground reclaimed were analyzed starting from the year 2000 onwards until the year 2013. The chemical composition of sewage sludge was systematically analyzed as well. No excessive contents were found of main elements neither of heavy metals in both plants and grounds. The vegetation was mown twice during the vegetation season and clippings were stacked in prisms. The biomass after humification was spread as an organic fertilizer throughout the area under reclamation.

The Joint Research Centre (JRC) in close cooperation with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) carried out an analysis and assessment of what type of information on nanomaterials was provided in the received registrations. The aim of the assessment was to develop options for an adaptation of the REACH regulation to ensure proper information generation and reporting and an appropriate risk/safety assessment of nanomaterials (Nano Support project). It {{should be noted that}} this analysis and assessment was not a compliance check of the dossiers. From 26000 submitted registration dossiers covering 4700 substances finally 25 dossiers (19 substances) were identified to cover nanomaterials or nanoforms of a substance. It is possible that other dossiers are considered to cover nanomaterials or nanoforms by the registrants, however such dossiers could not be identified to address nanoforms given the information contained in those dossiers. The identified 25 dossiers were subject to a detailed analysis and assessment of information provided for all endpoints including substance identity, physico-chemical properties, human health, environmental fate & behaviour, ecotoxicity, PBT assessment, Classification and Labelling as well as the attached Chemical Safety Report documenting the Chemical Risk/Safety Assessment. In order to evaluate how the safety of workers and consumers was ensured, it was appropriate to check how the "Derived No (Minimum) Effect Levels" (DN(M) ELs) were established for substances, covering nanomaterials or nanoforms. DNELs were established mainly for long term inhalation exposure of workers. Half of the assessed dossiers included an oral long term DNEL for the general population. DNELs were usually not specific for nanosized forms and, in the few cases where they were calculated for nanosized materials, they were not derived from hazard data for the nanoform. Different methods for deriving the DNELs were applied and few dossiers derived DNELs by applying the default assessment factors in the REACH guidance [...] Several DNELs were based on available Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) for inhalable and respirable <b>dust</b> or the <b>nuisance</b> <b>dust</b> levels, which have not been established for nanosized materials.

A general threshold limit value has been established for an occupational exposure to those aerosols amounting to 6 mg/cubic meter in Germany and 5 mg/cubic meter in the U. S. respectively. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate effects of a long-term exposure to <b>nuisance</b> <b>dusts.</b> In addition to lung clearance measurements, the functions of the alveolar leucocytes were studied. Three dusts were tested in parallel. Test materials were titanium dioxide, polyvinyl chloride powder (PVC) and iron powder at aerosol concentrations of 3. 2, 8 and 20 mg/cubic meter. The exposure lasted up to 8 months. The used animals were female Fischer rats. Ten animals of each concentration group were taken for lung lavage. Lavagable lung cells were examined for the following parameters: total cell number, cell viability, phagocytic activity, adherence and chemotaxis tests, peroxidase staining and differential cell counti ng. The results showed an almost constant number of total cells over all groups except the highest PVC concentration group, the cell number of which increased significantly. The number of polymorphonuclear cells increased from low to higher concentrations. The results indicate more pronounced effects by PVC powder compared to TiO sub 2 and Fe dust. Previous experiments during exposure of the animals have shown that PVC reduces alveolar lung clearance...|$|R
40|$|Chromium oxide, {{trivalent}} 10 - 20 1308 - 38 - 9 0. 5 mg/m 3 0. 5 mg/m 3 At {{very high}} temperatures such as during refractory use, other/additional forms of chromium compounds (such as hexavalent chromium compounds) may be formed, triggering other applicable exposure guidelines. In addition, refractory may become contaminated with other hazardous substances (e. g., metals, alkaline materials). The specific processing {{and use of}} this refractory should be fully evaluated to assess the entire scope of health hazards. Note: 1) TLV and PEL values given above are 8 -hour, time-weighted averages, unless otherwise specified. 2) NE = None Established, and means that the substance is not assigned a specific TLV or PEL. Substance regulated by OSHA as particulates not otherwise regulated (PNOR, PELs- 15 mg/m 3 total dust, 5 mg/m 3 respirable fraction) and by ACGIH as particulates not otherwise classified (PNOC, TLV- 10 mg/m 3 total dust, 3 mg/m 3 respirable fraction) and is considered a <b>nuisance</b> <b>dust.</b> 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION EMERGENCY OVERVIEW: Solid brick or other form, practically odorless. As-manufactured product does not pose significant fire hazard. Refractory particulates formed during processing, installation, maintenance procedures and/or tear-out may be irritating to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract, and may cause pulmonary system effects.
