5|$|As a boy, Truman was {{interested}} in music, reading, war, and history, all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very close. As president, he solicited {{political as well as}} personal advice from her. He rose at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen. Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention at Convention Hall in Kansas City; his father had many friends who were active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.|$|E

5|$|Following this defeat, Buckner {{retired to}} Glen Lily but {{remained}} active in politics. Though he always claimed membership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party,</b> he opposed the machine politics of William Goebel, his party's gubernatorial nominee in 1899. In 1903, he supported his son-in-law, Morris Belknap, for governor against Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham. When the Democrats again nominated William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election, Buckner openly supported Bryan's opponent, Republican William Howard Taft.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{remained}} active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> {{after his}} 1880 defeat and began stumping {{on behalf of}} other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state.

He {{became a member of the}} state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{announced}} his candidacy {{in a radio}} broadcast on November 3, painting the race as a choice between a free society and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.|$|E

5|$|After {{following}} his father {{into the local}} politics of his home county, Clements agreed to chair the gubernatorial campaign of Thomas Rhea in 1935. Already committed to Rhea, he turned down an offer from Happy Chandler to chair his campaign, beginning the rift between the two men. Clements {{went on to the}} Kentucky Senate in 1941. In 1944, he was selected as Democratic floor leader of the senate and successfully campaigned for a larger budget than that proposed by Republican governor Simeon Willis. His stand against Willis made him popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> and he went on to serve two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1944 to 1948.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1860, Bryan grew up {{in rural}} Illinois and in 1887 moved to Nebraska, where he practiced law and entered politics. He won {{election}} to the House of Representatives in 1890, and was re-elected in 1892, before mounting an unsuccessful US Senate run. He {{set his sights on}} higher office, believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a relatively minor figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> In anticipation of a presidential campaign, he spent much of 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated {{his seat}} in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, {{but this was not}} to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party,</b> the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election closedecided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.|$|E

5|$|Though he professed {{membership}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> Brady was notably disengaged from politics. In 1843 he {{was made}} the interim district attorney for New York County. Two years later, Brady was appointed the city's corporation counsel, a position in which he served two terms, each term lasting for a year. In 1850 Brady ran for, but was not elected to, the position of Attorney General of New York. Brady was on John C. Breckinridge and Joseph Lane's 1860 Democratic ticket for Governor of New York. When the American Civil War began, Brady switched sides and became an ardent supporter of Abraham Lincoln and his Republican Party. He deeply disdained Southern politics and policy.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican in {{a heavily}} Democratic state, Bradley found little success {{early in his}} {{political}} career. He was defeated for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of Ulysses S. Grant at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to Simon Bolivar Buckner, he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> over the issue of free silver, he defeated Parker Watkins Hardin in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate for blacks and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was born}} near Lexington, Kentucky to a {{prominent}} local family. After non-combat service during the Mexican–American War, {{he was elected}} as a Democrat to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1849, where he took a states' rights position against interference with slavery. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1850, he allied with Stephen A. Douglas {{in support of the}} Kansas–Nebraska Act. After reapportionment in 1854 made his re-election unlikely, he declined to run for another term. He was nominated for vice-president at the 1856 Democratic National Convention to balance a ticket headed by James Buchanan. The Democrats won the election, but Breckinridge had little influence with Buchanan and, as presiding officer of the Senate, could not express his opinions in debates. In 1859, he was elected to succeed Senator John J. Crittenden at the end of Crittenden's term in 1861. As vice president, Breckinridge joined Buchanan in supporting the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas, which led to a split <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

5|$|By early 1896, many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by {{then in the}} third year of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Laffoon {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. {{to live with}} his uncle, U.S. Representative Polk Laffoon. There he served as a {{messenger}} in the office of Judge C. R.

In September 1887, he enrolled at Columbia Law School (asserted by Vernon Gipson to have been a prior designation for George Washington University Law School). On October 17, 1888, he matriculated to Washington and Lee University, where he earned a law degree in 1890. He returned to Madisonville, was admitted to the bar, and began practicing in the office of Judge William H. Yost. He became active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and served as a county election officer. In 1892, he was elected city attorney of Madisonville over Ward Headley. In 1894, he ran for the office of county attorney for Hopkins County, but lost to Roy Salmon by seventeen votes.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} her term as {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{announced her}} intent to run for governor in 1983. Her opponents for the Democratic nomination included Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane and Grady Stumbo, the former secretary of the state's Department of Human Resources. Collins had the support of many leaders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> but just before the primary, Governor Brown endorsed Stumbo, charging that both Sloane and Collins would use their gubernatorial appointment power to dispense party patronage. Although this was a common practice at the time, Brown notably shunned it during his term. With 223,692 votes, Collins edged out Sloane (219,160 votes) and Stumbo (199,795 votes) to secure the nomination. Sloane asked for a recanvass of the ballots, but ultimately decided it would not change the outcome and conceded defeat.|$|E
