In the transition temperature range from 2 D adatom islanding to step-flow growth, systematic controlled air leaks into the growth chamber induce pits in the growth surface. We show that pits are also correlated with oxygen-contaminated flux from Si sublimation sources. From a thermodynamic standpoint, multilayer growth pits are unexpected in relaxed homoepitaxial growth, whereas oxidation is a known cause for step pinning, roughening, and faceting on <b>elemental</b> <b>surfaces,</b> both with and without growth flux. Not surprisingly, pits are thermodynamically metastable and heal by annealing to recover a smooth periodic step arrangement. STM reveals new details about the pits' atomistic origins and growth dynamics.

However, there are some well known cases where DFT fail to predict the correct adsorption site for CO on a metal surface, notably the Pt(111), Rh(111), and Cu(111) surfaces [2].

Etafilcon A and polymacon contact lenses, prior to and after exposure to LCS were fixed on the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber after which P. aeruginosa # 3 was allowed to adhere for 2 h. After adhesion, bacterial detachment was stimulated by perfusing the chamber with an LCS or by passing an air-bubble through the chamber. After exposure to an LCS, the adhesion of P. aeruginosa # 3 could either be enhanced or decreased, depending on the contact lens and LCS involved. Initial deposition rates of P aeruginosa # 3 could not be related with changes in <b>elemental</b> <b>surface</b> composition of the contact lenses, but decreased with an increasing ratio of oxygen involved in O=C bonds relative to oxygen in O-C bonds. P. aeruginosa # 3 adhered tenaciously to both types of contact lenses and the passage of an air-bubble through the flow chamber detached only up to 9 % of the adhering bacteria. Alternatively, the LCS most effective in decreasing bacterial adhesion after exposure (LCS A), was least effective in detaching adhering R aeruginosa # 3 (8 - 15 %), while the other LCS detached up to 42 % of adhering bacteria. In conclusion, different LCS have different abilities to detach the adhering P aeruginosa # 3 from contact lens surfaces and all leave adsorbed components on the surface after soaking. Adsorbed components rich in O-C bonds increased adhesion of P. aeruginosa # 3 under the conditions {{used in this study}} and should, therefore, be avoided...|$|E

In this paper physicochemical cell-surface properties, including hydrophobicity (determined by water contact angles), pH dependence of zeta potentials, <b>elemental</b> <b>surface</b> composition (determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), and adhesion to hexadecane, of four genotypically characterized Lactobacillus species (eight L. acidophilus, eight L. casei, four L. fermentum, and seven L. plantarum strains) were determined to see whether a grouping of the strains according to their phenotypes could be obtained that corresponded with the genotypic characterization of the strains. The strains showed major differences in physicochemical cell-surface properties: at the species level relationships could be observed between water contact angles, isoelectric points, and the N/C and O/C <b>elemental</b> <b>surface</b> concentration ratios, with nitrogen-containing groups (proteins) being responsible for increased hydrophobicities and isoelectric points, and oxygen-containing groups (phosphates and polysaccharides) yielding decreased hydrophobicities and isoelectric points. A hierarchical cluster analysis grouped all L. acidophilus strains in one well-separated cluster that also included two L. casei and two L. fermentum strains. Separation of L. acidophilus from the other species was done predominantly on the basis of increased cell surface hydrophobicity (average water contact angle of 63 degrees) and isoelectric point (approximately pH 3. 3) as compared with the other species, which had lower water contact angles and isoelectric points, and corresponded with the observation that only L. acidophilus strains adhered in measurable numbers to hexadecane. Also, the L. plantarum strains were grouped closely together in one cluster, but this cluster was heterogeneous due to the inclusion of L. casei and L. fermentum strains...|$|E
