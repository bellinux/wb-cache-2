40|$|Background The rise {{in health}} care-associated infections has placed a greater {{emphasis}} on cleaning and disinfection practices. The majority of policies advocate using detergent-based products for routine cleaning, with detergent wipes increasingly being used; however, there is no information about their ability to remove and subsequently transfer pathogens in practice. Methods Seven detergent wipes were tested for their ability to remove and transfer Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Clostridium difficile spores using the 3 -stage wipe protocol. Results The ability of the detergent wipes to remove S aureus, A baumannii, and C difficile spores from a stainless steel surface ranged from 1. 50 log 10 (range, 0. 24 - 3. 25), 3. 51 log 10 (range, 3. 01 - 3. 81), and 0. 96 log 10 (range, 0. 26 - 1. 44), respectively, following a 10 -second wiping time. All wipes repeatedly transferred significant amounts of bacteria/spores over 3 consecutive surfaces, although the percentage of total microorganisms transferred from the wipes after wiping was low for a number of <b>products.</b> Conclusions Detergent-based <b>wipe</b> <b>products</b> have 2 major drawbacks: their variability in removing microbial bioburden from inanimate surfaces and a propensity to transfer pathogens between surfaces.

Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} pesticides can easily bond to surface dislodgeable residues (SDRs) commonly known as dust. There are various methods that can be used to characterize the presence and exposure of pesticides indoors. Wipe sampling is one of the important methods commonly used to measure pesticides on surfaces due to its simple and inexpensive nature, however, several methods exist for wipe sampling and each method has varying steps involving different wiping material, pre-treatment of wipes, wetting solvent, surface type, collection pattern, and storage. The purpose of this literature review is to summarize concisely the methods from eighteen recent studies that used surface wipes to sample for pesticides from indoor environments.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{assessed}} {{the health risks}} for children exposed to phthalate through several pathways including house dust, surface wipes and hand wipes in child facilities and indoor playgrounds. Methods: The indoor samples were collected from various children’s facilities (40 playrooms, 42 daycare centers, 44 kindergartens, and 42 indoor-playgrounds) in both summer (Jul-Sep, 2007) and winter (Jan-Feb, 2008). Hazard index (HI) was estimated for the non-carcinogens and the examined phthalates were diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP). The present study examined these four kinds of samples, i. e., indoor dust, surface <b>wipes</b> of <b>product</b> and hand <b>wipes.</b> Results: Among the phthalates, the detection rates of DEHP were 98 % in dust samples, 100 % in surface wipe samples, and 95 % in hand wipe samples.

40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are a {{class of}} brominated flame retardants (BFRs) once extensively used in the plastics {{of a wide range}} of consumer products. The listing of certain congeners that are constituents of commercial PBDE mixtures (including c-octaBDE) in the Stockholm Convention and tightening regulation of many other BFRs in recent years have created the need for a rapid and effective method of identifying BFR-containing plastics. A three-tiered testing strategy comparing results from non-destructive testing (X-ray fluorescence (XRF)) (n = 1714), a surface wipe test (n = 137) and destructive chemical analysis (n = 48) was undertaken to systematically identify BFRs in a wide range of consumer products. XRF rapidly identified bromine in 92 % of products later confirmed to contain BFRs. Surface <b>wipes</b> of <b>products</b> identified tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), c-octaBDE congeners and BDE- 209 with relatively high accuracy (> 75 %) when confirmed by destructive chemical analysis. A relationship between the amounts of BFRs detected in surface wipes and subsequent destructive testing shows promise in predicting not only the types of BFRs present but also estimating the concentrations present. Information about the types of products that may contain persistent BFRs will assist regulators in implementing policies to further reduce the occurrence of these chemicals in consumer products.

However, the potential uses of nonwovens in traditional clothing outerwear (e. g. shirtings) are still limited. The low stress mechanical properties of fabrics (e. g. bending, extension, shear and recovery from extension) {{can be used as}} a measure of the suitability of fabrics to be used in clothing. In respect of the low stress mechanical properties of nonwoven fabrics, hydroentangled, fabrics have values that are most similar to woven fabrics used for apparel applications. Experimental hydroentangled fabrics produced using different conditions were studied and charactensed in terms of their low stress mechanical properties. It was established that if the specific energy applied remains constant, the jet profile used to apply the energy influences low stress mechanical properties. In general, alternating injectors (face and back) gave the most acceptable combination of low stress mechanical properties for clothing applications. Fabric area density, thickness and density were also found to affect the low stress dimensional and mechanical properties. An investigation of hydroentangled fabric geometry and its relation to the low stress mechanical properties of fabrics was carried out, Hydroentanglement of webs in both the MD and CD (in succession) produced fabrics having a lower shear rigidity compared to fabrics hydroentangled in the MD or CD only (which is the normal convention).

40|$|Background. Non-porous {{environmental}} surfaces accidentally/deliberately {{contaminated with}} bioagents might {{play a role}} in the spread of infections. The risk of such spread can be reduced with judicious use of liquid chemical disinfectants. Such chemicals are usually applied directly on the target surface as a liquid by immersion, flooding, spray, or by wiping with a disinfectant-wetted fabric. However, the assessments and label claims of microbicidal activities of such chemicals are often based on testing against individual classes of microbes without an appropriate soil load, while pathogens in the field are either unknown or may exist as mixtures in body fluids or other organic/inorganic debris. Further more, the influence of the mechanical action of wiping in decontaminating surfaces is hardly ever assessed. Wiping microbially-contaminated surfaces with an ineffective disinfectant may also spread localized contamination over a wider area, thus enhancing the risk of spread of infections. The potential impact of such spread remains virtually unknown. This study was, therefore, aimed at filling these three gaps in our knowledge. Experimental. To simulate field conditions better, the challenge was a cocktail of bacterial spores (Geobacillus stearothermophilus), a vegetative bacterium (Acinetobacter baumannii), a mycobacterium (Mycobacterium terrae), and a non-enveloped virus (hepatitis A) in a soil load. Disks (1 cm in diameter) of brushed stainless steel were used as prototypical hard, non-porous environmental surface. Each disk received 10 muL of the microbial suspension. The inoculum was then dried prior to direct contact with the test disinfectant or assessing the effect of wiping for decontamination and transfer of contamination. In both decontamination methods, normal buffered saline (NBS) was used as the control fluid. Results. The microbial mixture successfully evaluated the efficacy claims and spectrum of activity of disinfectants concurrently, with no major differences in inactivation of microbes when challenged alone or as a mixture. Surprisingly, peracetic acid (PAA; 1, 000 ppm) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) -based formulations (40, 000 to 70, 000 ppm) reduced the viability of the spores to undetectable levels, but without complete inactivation of the virus at the same contact time and temperature. Chlorine dioxide (CD) and a 5. 25 % (w/v) solution of sodium hypochlorite, i. e., domestic bleach (DB), showed the broadest spectrum of microbicidal activity. However, their activities depended on air temperature. While CD (500 and 1, 000 ppm) and DB (5, 000 ppm) completely inactivated HAV and the spores at room temperature (∼ 22 - 24 °C), these formulations only killed the virus at 4 °C but not the spores. M. terrae and A. baumannii were relatively readily inactivated and proved to be very similar in their sensitivities to all the tested chemicals. In <b>general,</b> <b>wiping</b> with a disinfectant-wetted fabric was more effective than direct kill for decontamination. Our data suggested that applying a formulation directly on to a contaminated surface, letting it dry, and then wiping the surface with a disinfectant helped achieve greater log 10 reductions while reducing substantially the risk of transfer of contaminants to clean areas. Conclusions. This study assessed the relative strengths and the spectrum of activity of the tested formulations concurrently and under conditions more akin to those expected under field conditions. Incorporation of a cocktail of microorganisms into a single test permitted a more reliable means of classifying microbicides based on their spectrum of activity. Chlorine releasing agents proved to be more effective and have a broader spectrum of activity as compared to the peroxygens. Disinfectant activity depended on air temperature, and none of them was effective against the spores at 4 °C. Decontamination by wiping with disinfectants proved to be faster and more effective than direct kill. However, a higher risk of a wider spread of contamination during wiping was also evident in this study. The foundations laid by this investigation should allow more detailed studies using actual infectious bioagents. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
