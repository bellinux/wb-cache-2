50|$|Inswinging crosses usually {{arise when}} {{a player who}} is right-footed {{is on the left}} side of the pitch (or one who is left-footed and is on the right side of the pitch) and prefers to cross with the inside of the {{dominant}} foot. Commonly seen among set-plays (where the player can orient himself to kick with his dominant foot on the opposite flank), inswingers are typically aimed at a <b>heading</b> <b>level,</b> in the hope of creating a headed deflection. The curve imparts a momentum towards the goal, with more favorable chances for deflections to result in a goal. On the other hand, the curl may also bring the ball closer to the goalkeeper, allowing them to more easily rush out and gather (or clear) the ball.|$|E

We give particular emphasis to the construction of price indexes at the basic <b>heading</b> <b>level,</b> since we believe it is here that the biggest problems lie.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a stochastic approach {{based on the}} country-product-dummy (CPD) method for the computation of purchasing power parities (PPPs) in the International Comparison Program. The approach develops estimation strategies {{in conjunction with the}} country-product-dummy method to derive a range of multilateral index number methods for the compilation of PPPs at the basic <b>heading</b> <b>level</b> as well as at higher levels of aggregation. At the basic <b>heading</b> <b>level</b> our approach generates Jevons geometric index, arithmetic and harmonic indexes as well as the Dutot index. At higher levels of aggregation, a weighted stochastic model with alternative stochastic specifications and the method of moments (MOM) are used to derive the Geary-Khamis, Iklé, Rao and other multilateral index number methods employed in international comparisons. Expressions for computing standard errors for PPPs based on these formulae are also derived. Existence of solutions to the estimating equations derived from the weighted method of moments or the maximum weighted likelihood is also discussed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{hierarchical}} {{structure of a}} document {{plays an important role}} in understanding the relationships between its contents. However, such a structure is not always explicitly represented in web documents through available html hierarchical tags. Headings however, are usually differentiated from ‘normal’ text in a document in terms of presentation thus providing an implicit structure discernable by a human reader. As such, an important pre-processing step for applications that need to operate on the hierarchical level is to extract the implicitly represented hierarchal structure. In this paper, an algorithm for heading detection and <b>heading</b> <b>level</b> detection which makes use of various visual presentations is presented. Results of evaluating this algorithm are also reported...|$|E

40|$|The Department of Regional Development (DRD), Northern Ireland, {{designed}} and constructed numerous highways cuttings in stiff overconsolidated glacial tills during the 60 's and 70 's. The designs were {{largely based on}} ~ntemporary empirical approaches using undrained shear strength, with limited consideration given to the long-term stability of the slopes. Recently {{there has been an}} increased frequency of reported slope failures including the failure at Dromore, Co. Down. Consequently Queen's University of Belfast and Roads Service (Northern Ireland), in collaboration With the University of Saskatchewan, have completed a comprehensive hydrogeological research study on a new 18 m deep cutting in a drumlin formed in overconsolidated till at Loughbrickland, Co. Down; Northern Ireland. The primary objective was {{to examine the effects of}} environmental changes on the groundwater regime with a particular focus on the stability of the slope. A laboratory and field instrumentation programme was carried out including detailed monitoring of <b>head</b> <b>levels</b> and local meteorological conditions. Three years of validated climate and <b>head</b> <b>level</b> data provided a comprehensive understanding of seasonal hydrogeological fluctuations within the Loughbrickland drumlin slope. The <b>head</b> <b>level</b> fluctuations demonstrate a clear relationship with seasonal variation in climate. TheÃ‚Â· data set provides a basis for further investigation into the effects of cyclic pore water pressure fluctuations and progressive failure on the long-term stability ofslopes. The collated field data was used to create a transient coupled seepage/slope stability model, using SeeplW and SlopelW (Geoslope International, Calgary, Alberta) to analyse the impact of climate on pore water pressure and subsequently slope stability. The model was calibrated using the field and laboratory data and was capable of accurately simulating the annual fluctuations in <b>head</b> <b>level.</b> A sensitivity analysis was completed to. assess the effect of predicted UKCIP climate scenarios on the slope stability of the cutting at Loughbrickland. The model simulates that climate change (UKCIP scenarios) will have minimal effect on the annual cycle of <b>head</b> <b>levels</b> and therefore on the short to medium term slope stability.

These approaches are designed to make complete use of the information available and at the same time provide meaningful and fully operational methods for the computation of PPPs. Two measures of similarity proposed by Diewert (2009) are used in conjunction with the Paasche-Laspeyres spread in implementing the MST, WEKS and minimum distance approaches. The paper establishes analytical properties of the methods and also provides an empirical illustration using data generated from the ICP 2005 at the basic <b>heading</b> <b>level.</b> Robustness of the results to different methods and to alternative methods of similarity is examined...|$|E
40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science, 2012. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate if the International Comparison Program (ICP) methodology could be used to examine the different buying power (worth) of the currency on the same products or goods amongst South African provinces. The method will be tested on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) food data collected from January 2006 to December 2006 from the main cities in the provinces. The food basket is obtained via the Income and Expenditure Survey (IES), which is generally updated every 5 years. South Africa (SA) has disparities and differentials in economic indicators such as the CPI, Gross Domestic Product and employment, amongst the provinces which are caused by among other things geographic set-up, urbanisation, inflation rates, and expenditure patterns. We use the monthly data to do an inter-provincial comparison of food prices by deriving annual purchasing power parities (PPPs) for each of the provinces, using the Country Product Dummy (CPD) method recommended as best practice by the World Bank. The CPI data is validated using the SEMPER software developed by the African Development Bank (AfDB). The validated data is examined for variability over the months and between the provinces using Analysis of Variance. Significant price differences are found for various products over the months and between provinces. The validated data was used to compute PPPs at the group and basic <b>heading</b> <b>level.</b> PPPs were investigated for differences in the provinces on grouped level of food products using Analysis of Variance. The reliability of PPPs between provinces is investigated both at grouped and basic <b>heading</b> <b>level</b> of products using the Cronbach-alpha statistic. The results show that there are no significant variations in PPPs across provinces. This could be due to the similar business opportunities or developments in the provinces or due to the aggregation of prices from the individual product (basic heading) to the main product group level. This implies that the cost of the food basket is the same across provinces...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} impact on the {{reported}} cause-of-death patterns of a verbal autopsy coding strategy based on a review of every death by multiple coders versus a single coder. Methods Deaths in 45 villages (total population 180 162) in southern India were documented during 12 months in 2003 – 2004, and a standard verbal autopsy questionnaire was completed for each death. Two physician coders, each unaware of the other’s decisions, assigned an underlying cause of death in accordance with the causes listed in the chapter headings of the International classification of diseases and related health problems, 10 th revision (ICD- 10). For the three chapter headings that applied to more than 100 of the deaths, agreement for subsets of causes of death within the chapter was also analysed. In the event of discrepancies, a third coder was used to finalize a cause of death. Cohen’s kappa statistic (K) was used to measure levels of agreement between the two physician coders. Findings In total, 1354 deaths were documented, and a verbal autopsy was completed for 1329 (98 %) of them. At the chapter <b>heading</b> <b>level</b> of the ICD- 10, physician coders assigned the same cause to 1255 deaths (94 %) (K = 0. 93; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 92 – 0. 94). The patterns of death derived from the causes assigned by each physician were all very similar to the patterns obtained through the consensus process, with the rank order of the 10 leading causes of death being the same for all three coding methods. Conclusion Duplicate coding of verbal autopsy results has little advantage over a single-coder system for mortality surveillance or for identifying population patterns of death. Resources could be better diverted {{to other parts of the}} mortality surveillance process...|$|E
