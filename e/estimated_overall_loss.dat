There are, however, limited studies looking at the fluxes and interactions of reactive N compounds and aerosols following fertilisation with manure. In this study, state-of-the-art chemical analysers (GRAEGOR, QCLAS, PTRMS) were used to investigate concentrations, fluxes and chemical interactions of reactive nitrogen containing trace gases (NH 3, HNO 3, HONO) and aerosols (NO 3 −) above a grassland fertilised with 164 kg N ha− 1 of cattle slurry. Emissions of NH 3 peaked at > 67 μg m− 2 s− 1, based on a 30 min average.

30|$|The 2012 Emilia {{earthquake}} sequence, despite only moderate magnitude, {{was characterized}} {{by a series of}} events that generated extensive damage in a densely inhabited area, one of the richest Italian industrial districts. Severe structural damage to approximately 500 factories in the Emilia district was reported (Liberatore et al. 2013). Many precast concrete industrial structures were heavily damaged, and up to 7000 employees lost their jobs because of the direct or indirect effects of this disaster. Overall, the sequence resulted in 27 victims, significant damage to public and private structures, and damage to historical heritage such as churches, towers, castles, and palaces (Mucciarelli and Liberatore 2014). The National Council of Engineers <b>estimated</b> <b>overall</b> <b>losses</b> of about 13 billion Euro based on the funding requested from the Italian government for reconstruction (Centro studi 2014). These figures refer to: (1) restoration of residential and public buildings; (2) damage to infrastructure; (3) damage to historical and artistic heritage; and (4) impact on productive activities. A similar estimated loss was confirmed by an independent source (Bevere et al. 2015) without accounting for the secondary losses due to the interruption of industrial production.|$|R

The method involves scoring each cob in the sample on a visual damage scale and then using a simple equation to <b>estimate</b> <b>overall</b> sample weight <b>loss.</b> The coefficients in the equation are determined in advance of field work by calibrating the visual scale against a laboratory loss assessment technique. The visual scale method was found to be rapid, simple and had many advantages for on-farm work.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Constellation (Cx) Program {{development}} effort, several {{test flights}} were planned to prove concepts and operational capabilities of the new vehicles being developed. The first test, involving the Eastern Test Range, is the Ares I-X launched in 2009.

This paper describes the methodology used to develop first flight <b>estimates</b> of <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> of vehicle (LOV) failure probability, specifically for the Ares I-X. The method described in this report starts with the Air Force s generic failure probability estimate for first flight and adjusts the value based on the complexity of the vehicle as compared to the complexity of a generic vehicle. The results estimate a 1 in 9 probability of failure. The paper also describes traditional PRA methods used in this assessment, which were then combined with the updated first flight risk methodology to generate inputs required by the malfunction turn analysis to support estimate of casualty (Ec) calculations as part of the Final Flight Data Package (FFDP) delivered to the Eastern Range for Final Flight Plan Approval...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} work by Domingo-Ferrer et al., rank swapping and multivariate microaggregation {{has been identified}} as well-performing masking methods for microdata protection. Recently, Dandekar et al. proposed using synthetic microdata, as an option, in place of original data by using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique. The LHS method focuses on mimicking univariate as well as multivariate statistical characteristics of original data. The LHS-based synthetic data does not allow one to one comparison with original data. This prevents <b>estimating</b> the <b>overall</b> information <b>loss</b> by using current measures. In this paper we utilize unique features of LHS method to create hybrid data sets and evaluate their performance relative to rank swapping and multivariate microaggregation using generalized information loss and disclosure risk measures...|$|R
50|$|The {{worst of}} the effects from Jose {{occurred}} in Antigua and Barbuda, as winds up to 102 mph (164 km/h) were reported. About 500 houses and a newly built church were destroyed. About 50% of residents were left without water and 90% of people experienced power outages. Overall, twelve people were injured, one fatality occurred, and an elderly blind man was listed as missing. Flooding in Saint Kitts and Nevis washed out several major roads and caused landslides. Additionally, one person was killed during the storm. In Sint Maarten, mudslides and flooding damaged houses and roads, especially those in low-lying areas. Nearly 15 in of rain and winds up to 100 mph (160 km/h) in Anguilla left roads impassable and power outages, and damaged houses, crops, and shipping facilities. Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands caused extensive power outages and minor damage, <b>estimated</b> at $40,000. <b>Overall,</b> <b>losses</b> from the storm was less than $5 million.|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a structured expert judgment (EJ) {{study on the}} ecological and economic impacts of ship-borne nonindigenous species (NIS) in the Laurentian Great Lakes (GL). We used EJ because uncertainty is large {{about the impact of}} NIS, especially in the context of other interacting factors that affect ecosystem services (e. g., climate and land use change, pollution, management activities, economic market fluctuations). Empirical studies that control for other factors to isolate NIS effects are almost always conducted at small spatio-temporal scales, with no clear approach available for scaling effects up to levels relevant for guiding policy and management decisions. In other disciplines, EJ has been used for broad-scale risk and impact assessment when substantial scientific uncertainty exists, especially when uncertainty bears on decision-making. In the context of on-going policy debates about the net value of oceanic shipping into the GL, we use EJ to contribute to the quantification of the net costs of NIS on ecosystem goods and services. Since the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, 70 % of the NIS newly discovered in the GL (57 spp.) have been introduced via transoceanic shipping. We elicited ten North American GL experts regarding ecosystem services affected by NIS in several economic sectors: commercial and recreational fishing, raw water usage, and wildlife watching. A calibration method assessed each expert’s ability to characterize uncertainty. Experts differed significantly in calibration performance, and experts' opinions indicated substantial uncertainty about impacts. To generate aggregate impact assessments, with uncertainty bounds, we combined experts' judgments based on calibration performance. Aggregate results indicated that NIS-associated reductions in commercial fishing range from 11 % (L. Erie) to 338 % (L. Ontario); (mean reduction for other 3 lakes = 36 %). Experts <b>estimated</b> <b>overall</b> <b>losses</b> to recreational fishing at 18 %. For 2006, US losses were estimated at $ 11 M for commercial fisheries and $ 600 M for recreational fisheries. Average annual NIS-related expenses for raw water users were estimated at $ 66 K per facility. Wildlife watching impacts were negligible (< 1 %). All impacts are expected to grow into the future, at most doubling during our 20 yr time horizon. Our study used a novel application of EJ to provide the first comprehensive and bounded estimates of ship-borne NIS impacts in the GL. These results will be available to compare with estimates from other sources on the costs to replace oceanic shipping in the GL with other transportation modes or otherwise reduce the probability of introduction of NIS from ships...|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} {{that the majority of}} the publications introduce methods that are processed in the pixel domain. This trend can be attributed to the rich heritage of work in the image processing area. In most cases, pixel-based methods require more processing power than bitstream-based methods. NR quality estimation is a widely adopted application in the area of online quality monitoring. It is thus required to employ computationally less complex methods. This fact necessitates to focus towards designing bitstream-based or hybrid methods. The distortions present in a network can introduce a variety of temporal perturbations in a video transmitted through it. Such perturbations have to be monitored by service providers to ensure a given threshold of visual quality at the end users’ premises. This can be performed using NR metrics which estimate the impact of degradation in the temporal domain. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods are designed to account for a single or a limited set of degradations. Therefore, it is not easy to make an <b>estimate</b> of the <b>overall</b> <b>loss</b> of visual quality. Hence, methods which can make a complete assessment of the quality are desirable. Similarly, attention can be drawn towards designing less complex methods which are not application specific, such as the methods that are not limited to a particular coding standard.|$|R
40|$|Objective To <b>estimate</b> the <b>overall</b> {{economic}} <b>losses</b> due {{to human}} and animal cystic echinococcosis (CE) in Spain in 2005. Methods We obtained data on annual CE incidence from surveillance and abattoir records, and on CE-related treatment and productivity losses ({{human and animal}}) from the scientific literature. Direct costs were those associated with diagnosis, surgical or chemotherapeutic treatment, medical care and hospitalization in humans, and condemnation of offal in livestock (sheep, goats, cattle and pigs). Indirect costs comprised human productivity losses and the reduction in growth, fecundity and milk production in livestock. The Latin hypercube method was used to represent the uncertainty surrounding the input parameters. Findings The <b>overall</b> economic <b>loss</b> attributable to CE in humans and animals in 2005 was estimated at 148 964 534 euros (€) (95 % credible interval, CI: 21 980 446 – 394 012 706). Human-associated losses were estimated at € 133 416 601 (95 % CI: 6 658 738 – 379 273 434) and animal-associated losses at € 15 532 242 (95 % CI: 13 447 378 – 17 789 491). Conclusion CE is a neglected zoonosis that remains a human and animal health concern for Spain. More accurate data on CE prevalence in humans (particularly undiagnosed or asymptomatic cases) and better methods to estimate productivity losses in animals are needed. CE continues to affect certain areas of Spain, despite several control initiatives since 1986. Given the high economic burden of CE, additional funding is needed to reduce human and animal infection rates through improved disease surveillance, regular treatment of dogs and greater cooperation between agencies...|$|R

40|$|Flat Plate Collectors (FPC) {{is widely}} used for {{domestic}} hot-water, space heating/drying and for applications requiring fluid temperature less than 100 oC. The absorber plate of the FPC transfers solar energy to liquid flowing in the tubes. The flow can takes place due to thermosyphon effect or by forced convection. However, certain energy absorbed by the plate is lost to atmosphere due to higher temperature of the plate. The collector efficiency {{is dependent on the}} temperature of the plate which in turn is dependent on the nature of flow of fluid inside the tube, solar insolation, ambient temperature, top loss coefficient, the emissivity of the plate and glass cover, slope, etc. The objective of the present work is to determine the influence of the emissivity of the absorber surface, ambient temperature, spacing between the glass cover and the absorber surface on efficiency of flat plate collector. The influence of operating parameters on flat plate collector is numerical studied. Methods to reduce the losses and compare with the performance of evacuated tube collector (ETC) are proposed by using FORTRAN software. Related equations from previous researcher have been included in the FORTRAN coding the get the data. The influence of the emissivity of the absorber surface, ambient temperature spacing between absorber plate and the glass cover on convection heat transfer coefficient, the <b>overall</b> top <b>loss</b> coefficient are theoretically <b>estimated.</b> The <b>overall</b> top <b>loss</b> coefficient on the flat plate collector is also theoretically determined.

As the placenta was firmly {{adhered to the}} uterine wall, following safe delivery, it took over one hour and more than 10000 ml blood loss until the placenta was removed. Additional blood was ordered, but there was delay in delivery. Bleeding was extremely beyond our estimation, and hardly controlled despite of transfusing 1400 ml of prepared blood. With stopping operation and continuing hyperoxic ventilation, we decided to start intraoperative blood salvage. Though hemoglobin, platelet, and base excess decreased to 2. 7 g/dl, 1000 /μl, and - 11. 2, hemodynamics could be maintained with use of a blood salvage system. Salvaged blood was very helpful to manage critical hemodilution until additional blood was reached. <b>Overall</b> <b>estimated</b> blood <b>loss</b> was 20190 ml and massive blood transfusion was needed.
