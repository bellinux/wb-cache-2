Third, the optimal <b>damping</b> <b>factors</b> of the improved PLL control for rectifier and inverter are calculated. Simulations and calculations validated the following three conclusions: (1) in rectifying operation, the equivalent system resistance has a negative impact on the stability of the system and {{this is not the case}} for inverting operation; (2) adding the alternative <b>damping</b> <b>factors</b> to PLL control shows similar results compared with changing the impedance angle of AC system; (3) the proposed optimal <b>damping</b> <b>factors</b> of PLL can effectively extend the power transfer limits under both rectifier and inverter modes...|$|R

25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate <b>damping</b> <b>factor,</b> and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given output level.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{a large amount of}} research, the {{understanding}} of damping forces in vibrating structures is not well developed. A major reason for this is that, by contrast with inertia and stiffness forces, the physics behind the damping forces is in general not clear. As a consequence, modelling of damping from the first principle is difficult, if not impossible, for real-life engineering structures. The common approach is to use the proportional damping model where it is assumed that the damping matrix is proportional to mass and stiffness matrices. The main limitation of the proportional damping approximation {{comes from the fact that}} the variation of <b>damping</b> <b>factors</b> with respect to vibration frequency cannot be modelled accurately by using this approach. Experimental results however suggest that <b>damping</b> <b>factors</b> can vary with frequency. In this paper a new generalized proportional damping model is proposed in order to capture the frequency-variation of the <b>damping</b> <b>factors</b> accurately. A simple identification method is proposed to obtain the damping matrix using the generalized proportional damping model.

2500|$|Crossovers can be passive or active. A passive {{crossover}} is an electronic circuit {{that uses a}} combination {{of one or more}} resistors, inductors, or non-polar capacitors. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, {{passive crossover}}s have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in <b>damping</b> <b>factor</b> before the voice coil [...] An active crossover is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands before power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass. Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.|$|E
