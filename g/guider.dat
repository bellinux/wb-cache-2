40|$|Different firms issue {{earnings}} guidance at {{dramatically different}} rates. We suggest that frequent <b>guiders</b> more likely represent {{a type of}} firm that is attempting to develop a reputation for enhanced disclosures through their guidance issuances. Furthermore, the desire to build a reputation and the opportunities to learn provided by issuing more frequent guidance should translate into frequent <b>guiders</b> providing higher quality guidance than occasional <b>guiders.</b> We examine our hypotheses in three stages. First, we find that guidance frequency is positively correlated with variables associated with reputation with capital market participants and reputation in product and labor markets. Second, our cross-sectional analysis shows that frequent <b>guiders</b> provide guidance that is more accurate and specific, timelier, and less optimistically biased. Third, controlling for overall time trends, we find that firms display improvements over time in their guidance properties. Overall, our {{results are consistent with}} the reputation-building and learning-by-doing arguments...|$|R

60|$|Now let us {{turn our}} horse into a man, His rider to a spirit, if we can. Then let us, by {{the methods of}} the <b>guider,</b> Tell every horse how he should know his rider. Some go, as men, direct in a right way, Nor are they {{suffered}} to go astray; As with a bridle they are governed, And kept from paths which lead unto the dead. Now this good man has his especial <b>guider,</b> Then by his going let him know his rider. Some go as {{if they did not}} greatly care, Whether of heaven or hell they should be heir. The rein, it seems, is laid upon their neck, They seem to go their way without a check. Now this man too has his especial <b>guider,</b> And by his going he may know his rider. Some again run as if resolved to die, Body and soul, to all eternity. Good counsel they by no means can abide; They'll have their course whatever them betide. Now these poor men have their especial <b>guider,</b> Were they not fools they soon might know their rider. There's one makes head against all godliness, Those too, that do profess it, he'll distress; He'll taunt and flout if goodness doth appear, And at its countenancers mock and jeer. Now this man, too, has his especial <b>guider,</b> And by his going he might know his rider.|$|E

40|$|The {{first chapter}} of this {{dissertation}} examines the association between guidance frequency, guidance properties, and market reactions. The {{results suggest that the}} characteristics and market responses to guidance issued by occasional and frequent <b>guiders</b> differ. Compared to occasional <b>guiders,</b> frequent <b>guiders</b> issue guidance in a timelier manner and their guidance issuances are less optimistically biased, more accurate, and more precise. Controlling for the amount of news issued, the market reaction to guidance issued by frequent <b>guiders</b> is more positive for good news and less negative for bad news, consistent with market awareness of the differences in guidance properties between frequent and occasional <b>guiders.</b> Overall, the results are consistent with frequency being an important classificatory variable. The second chapter examines whether investors and analysts recognize differences in individual managers' guidance accuracy and bias, and if they tailor their responses to management guidance. The results suggest that investors react more strongly and assign more credibility to managers who have greater guidance accuracy, and that investors adjust for guidance bias by reacting more positively (less negatively) to good (bad) news guidance issued by managers who are more pessimistic. However, the results for the changes in analysts' consensus forecasts suggest that analyst experience {{plays an important role in}} their responses to management guidance. I find that in their forecast revisions, analysts adjust for managers' guidance accuracy and bias only if the analysts themselves have sufficient forecasting experience...|$|R
