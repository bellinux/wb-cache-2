25|$|In the 1980s, CND {{underwent}} a major revival {{in response to}} the resurgence of the Cold War. There was increasing tension between the superpowers following the deployment of SS20s in the Soviet Bloc countries, American Pershing missiles in Western Europe, and Britain's replacement of the Polaris armed submarine fleet with Trident missiles.

25|$|Twenty-four NZSAS {{personnel}} were deployed to Kuwait in February 1998 on Operation GRIFFIN {{during a period}} of <b>international</b> <b>tension</b> with Iraq, tasked with rescuing downed airmen in hostile territory {{in the event of a}} US-led aerial campaign. A smaller force replaced them in May 1998 for a further two-month tour. There were no missions into Iraq undertaken during the deployment, though it was considered a useful opportunity to practice mobile desert warfare skills, and to have contact with US Forces which had been limited since the United States suspended its ANZUS relations with New Zealand in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The Permanent Court of International Justice, {{often called}} the World Court, existed from 1922 to 1946. It was an {{international}} court attached to the League of Nations. Created in 1920 (although {{the idea of an}} international court was several centuries old), the Court was initially well-received from states and academics alike, with many cases submitted to it for its first decade of operation. With the heightened <b>international</b> <b>tension</b> of the 1930s, the Court became less used. By a resolution by the League of Nations on 18 April 1946, the Court ceased to exist and was replaced by the International Court of Justice.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish Air Force {{was created}} on July 1, 1926 when the {{aircraft}} {{units of the}} Army and Navy were merged. Because of the escalating <b>international</b> <b>tension</b> during the 1930s the Air Force was reorganized and expanded from four to seven squadrons. When World War II broke out in 1939 further expansion was initiated and this substantial expansion was not finished {{until the end of}} the war. Although Sweden never entered the war, a large air force was considered necessary to ward off the threat of invasion and to resist pressure through military threats from the great powers. By 1945 the Swedish Air Force had over 800 combat-ready aircraft, including 15 fighter divisions.|$|E
25|$|Callaghan became Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet in November 1911 and {{was advised}} in December 1913 that his tenure would be {{extended}} for another twelve months. With increasing <b>international</b> <b>tension</b> he started preparing his fleet for war. At {{the outbreak of}} the First World War in July 1914, Callaghan set sail in his flagship for his war station at Scapa Flow. There he met his successor-designate Sir John Jellicoe who had received orders from First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill to relieve the ageing Callaghan of command of his fleet. Callaghan was bitterly disappointed not to command his fleet in the war he had completely readied it for. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, The Nore.|$|E
25|$|Callaghan became Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, {{with his}} flag in the {{battleship}} HMS Neptune {{and with the}} acting rank of admiral in November 1911. Following an inspection of his fleet by King George V he was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 11 May 1912 and, after a separate visit by the President Raymond Poincaré of France in 1913, he was also awarded the Grand Cordon of the French Legion of Honour. He was promoted to the substantive rank of full admiral on 17 May 1913 and was advised in December 1913 that his tenure would be extended for another twelve months. With increasing <b>international</b> <b>tension</b> he started preparing his fleet for war.|$|E

25|$|Competing British and Spanish {{claims to}} the {{territory}} between their respective colonies of South Carolina and Florida {{was a source of}} <b>international</b> <b>tension,</b> and the colony of Georgia was founded in 1733 in part to protect the British interests. The Spanish theoretically lost their claim to the territory in 1742 after the Battle of Bloody Marsh (on St. Simons Island). However, settlement south of the Altamaha River (what is now Glynn and Camden Counties) was discouraged by both the British and Spanish governments. One group of settlers led by Edmund Gray sparked Spanish military action after settling on the Satilla River in the 1750s near present-day Burnt Fort, and were subsequently disbanded by the Royal Governor John Reynolds.|$|E
25|$|The Church of the East had its {{inception}} {{at a very}} early date in the buffer zone between the Parthian and Roman Empires in Upper Mesopotamia, known as the Assyrian Church of the East. The vicissitudes of its later growth were rooted in its minority status in a situation of <b>international</b> <b>tension.</b> The rulers of the Parthian Empire (250 BC – AD 226) were on the whole tolerant in spirit, and with the older faiths of Babylonia and Assyria in a state of decay, the time was ripe for a new and vital faith. The rulers of the Second Persian empire (226–640) also followed a policy of religious toleration to begin with, though later they gave Christians the same status as a subject race. However, these rulers also encouraged the revival of the ancient Persian dualistic faith of Zoroastrianism and established it as the state religion, with the result that the Christians were increasingly subjected to repressive measures. Nevertheless, it was not until Christianity became the state religion in the West (380) that enmity toward Rome was focused on the Eastern Christians. After the Muslim conquest in the 7th century, the caliphate tolerated other faiths but forbade proselytism and subjected Christians to heavy taxation.|$|E
25|$|In September 1920, the CSG made a {{strategic}} {{decision that the}} defence of the northern frontier must begin with a rush into Belgium. The French army never deviated from {{the belief that the}} loss of the agricultural, mining and industrial resources could never be repeated. In September, the Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920 was signed, for military co-operation; if <b>international</b> <b>tension</b> increased, the Belgians would request assistance and the French would send an army to the Belgian-German border, making it the main line of French resistance to a German attack. As the policy was studied, it became clear that a force moving to the Belgo-German border would have to be mobile if it were to forestall the Germans for a defensive battle from prepared positions. Motorised transport would be necessary to rush forward French troops, then ferry engineer stores to fortify the positions. The French army created mobile fortification parks stocked with material for fortification, ready to be moved by road and rail but if the Belgian army was overwhelmed, the French might be forced into an encounter battle and a war of movement in the central Belgian plain. French strategy was to avoid a decisive battle early on, after the disaster of the Battle of the Frontiers in 1914 but the necessity of avoiding a war on French soil, meant that a forward move could not be avoided.|$|E

500|$|The Mortara case was, in {{the view}} of Timothy Verhoeven, the {{greatest}} controversy to surround the Catholic Church in the mid-19th century, as it [...] "more than any other single issue... exposed the divide between supporters and opponents of the Vatican". Abigail Green writes that [...] "this clash between liberal and Catholic worldviews at a moment of critical <b>international</b> <b>tension...</b> gave the Mortara affair global significance—and rendered it a transformative episode in the Jewish world as well". Mortara himself suggested in 1893 that his abduction had been, for a time, [...] "more famous than that of the Sabine Women".|$|E

500|$|In some of Vaughan Williams's {{music of}} the 1930s there is an {{explicitly}} dark, even violent tone. The ballet Job: A Masque for Dancing (1930) and the Fourth Symphony (1935) surprised the public and critics. The discordant and violent tone of the symphony, written {{at a time of}} growing <b>international</b> <b>tension,</b> led many critics to suppose the symphony to be programmatic. Hubert Foss dubbed it [...] "The Romantic" [...] and Frank Howes called it [...] "The Fascist". The composer dismissed such interpretations, and insisted that the work was absolute music, with no programme of any kind; nonetheless, some of those close to him, including Foss and Boult, remained convinced that something of the troubled spirit of the age was captured in the work.|$|E
500|$|Following {{increased}} <b>international</b> <b>tension</b> {{surrounding the}} German annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938, the Norwegian parliament granted extraordinary appropriations {{to modernize the}} Norwegian Armed Forces. The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service (RNNAS) and the Norwegian Army Air Service were prioritized for funds from the [...] Norwegian Neutrality Fund. The RNNAS' share of the funds were designated to buy 12 Heinkel He 115 torpedo bombers and 24 reconnaissance aircraft, {{as well as several}} new naval air stations. The Dornier Do 22, Northrop 8-A, Northrop 2GP and Vultee V-11 GB were considered and proposals retrieved. The commission quickly decided the Vultee V-11 GB was the best aircraft to satisfy both air services' needs. On the part of the Royal Norwegian Air Service, the requirements were for a reconnaissance aircraft with a range of 1,500km, a top speed of no less than 320km/h and a payload of a 900kg torpedo or the equivalent in bombs.|$|E
500|$|In {{times of}} high <b>international</b> <b>tension,</b> the V-bombers would be {{dispersed}} {{and have been}} maintained at a high state of readiness; if the order was given to deploy a nuclear strike, Victors at high readiness would have been airborne in under four minutes from the point the order had been issued. British intelligence had estimated that the Soviets' radar network was capable of detecting the Victor at up to 200 miles away, so to avoid interception, the Victor would follow carefully planned routes to exploit weaknesses in the Soviet detection network. [...] This tactic was employed {{in conjunction with the}} Victor's extensive onboard electronic countermeasures (ECM) to increase the chances of evasion. Whilst originally the Victor would have maintained high-altitude flight throughout a nuclear strike mission, rapid advances of the Soviet anti-aircraft warfare capabilities (exemplified by the downing of a U2 from 70,000 ft in 1960) led to this tactic being abandoned: a low-level high-speed approach supported by increasingly sophisticated ECMs was adopted in its place.|$|E
