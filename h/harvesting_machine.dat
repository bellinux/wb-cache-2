5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick <b>Harvesting</b> <b>Machine</b> Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had come under attack from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines.|$|E

25|$|Traditional hand {{harvesting}} {{of whole}} bunches has been increasingly {{challenged by the}} <b>harvesting</b> <b>machine</b> for dry white wines, an economic choice but not always a qualitative one. The fragility of the grape requires either a rapid transfer to the Winery, or protection from oxidation. When the transport time between vine and winery is long, the harvest can be refrigerated and kept away from oxygen using nitrogen or dry ice.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{problems}} found in mechanical harvest of sugar cane {{is the lack of}} synchronism between the <b>harvest</b> <b>machine</b> and the infield wagon, causing crop losses as well as operational capacity. The objective of the present research was to design a system capable of helping to synchronize the sugar cane <b>harvest</b> <b>machine</b> with the wagon. The communication between tractor and <b>harvest</b> <b>machine</b> is wireless. Two ultrasound sensors coupled to the elevator and a microprocessor manage such information, generating a correct synchronization among the machines. The system was tested in laboratory and on field performing its function adequately, maintaining the two machines in synchronization, indicating and alerting the operators their relative positions. The developed system reduced the sugar cane lost in 60 kg ha - 1 comparing to the harvest with the system turned off...|$|R
25|$|The Daily Compass was chiefly financed {{through the}} Chicago, Illinois, philanthropist Anita McCormick Blaine, the McCormick <b>Harvesting</b> <b>Machine</b> Company heiress, who {{furnished}} either $300,000 or $2 {{million for the}} start-up (sources differ). She was introduced to Thackrey in late April 1949 by a mutual friend who had intended to put up half the money. When the friend backed out, Blaine invested the whole amount in return for all the preferred stock; Thackrey held 51% of the common stock, and control.|$|E
25|$|Reality intervened, however. The paper's initial {{financial}} {{needs were}} met by a one-year subsidy provided by Anita McCormick Blaine, an heir to the McCormick <b>Harvesting</b> <b>Machine</b> Company fortune, which soon expired, leaving the editors {{in charge of a}} paper with a production cost of 12 cents an issue and a cover price of just 5 cents. The paper skipped issues and slashed pay of its office staff, barely surviving the financial crisis. The paper's cover price was hiked to 10 cents in an effort to balance costs and revenues.|$|E
25|$|Stanton's role in Manny's legal trio {{was as a}} researcher. Though he {{admitted}} that George Harding, an established patent lawyer, was more adept at the scientific aspects of the case, Stanton worked to summarize the relevant jurisprudence and case law. To win McCormick v. Manny for Manny, Stanton, Harding and Watson had to impress upon the court that McCormick had no claim to exclusivity in his reaper's use of a divider, a mechanism on the outer end of the cutter-bar which separated the grain. A <b>harvesting</b> <b>machine</b> would not have worked properly without a divider, and Manny's defense knew this. However, to assure a win, Watson opted to use duplicity—he employed a model maker named William P. Woods to retrieve an older version of McCormick's reaper and alter it to be presented in court. Woods found a reaper in Virginia which was built in 1844, one year prior to McCormick's patent being granted. He had a blacksmith straighten the curved divider, knowing that the curved divider in Manny's reaper would not conflict with a straight one in McCormick's reaper. After using a salt and vinegar solution to add rust to where the blacksmith had worked to ensure the antiquity of the machine was undeniable, Woods sent the reaper to Cincinnati. Stanton was joyed when he examined the altered reaper, and knew the case was theirs. Arguments for the case began on September 1855. In March 1856, Justices John McLean and Thomas Drummond delivered a ruling in favor of John Manny. McCormick appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and McCormick v. Manny, was, all of a sudden, a political issue, and the matters concerning the case {{found their way to}} the floor of Congress.|$|E

Labor tensions increased the following year as the Knights of Labor went on strike against Jay Gould's rail empire, and a strike against the McCormick <b>Harvesting</b> <b>Machine</b> Company ended in the bloody Haymarket riot. Weaver believed the nation's hard-money policies were responsible for labor unrest, calling it [...] "purely a question of money, and nothing else" [...] and declaring, [...] "If this Congress will not protect labor, it must protect itself". He saw the triumph of one plank of the Greenback platform when Congress established the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate the railroads. Weaver thought the bill should have given the government more power, including the ability to set rates directly, but he voted for the final bill.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- Utilization rate is an {{important}} factor in calculating machine rates for forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>machines.</b> Machine rates allow an evaluation of harvesting system costs and facilitate comparisons between different systems and machines. There are many factors that affect utilization rate. These include mechanical delays, non-mechanical delays, operational lost time, and personnel time. As a result utilization rate can be highly variable and difficult to accurately estimate without detailed information. This paper reports on an ongoing study to measure the utilization rates for forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>machines</b> in the southern US, specifically rubber tired grapple skidders. Electronic service recorders were mounted on four grapple skidders on a harvesting operation in east central Alabama. To date, 44 working days have been monitored for three of the skidders and 19 for the fourth machine. The average utilization rate ranged from 76. 5 percent to 64. 8 percent...|$|R
