40|$|In this thesis, {{turbulent}} forced {{convective heat}} transfer downstream of blockages with <b>elongated</b> <b>holes</b> in a rectangular channel was studied. The rectangular channel has a width-to-height ratio of 12 : 1. The blockages {{have the same}} cross section {{as that of the}} channel. The diameter of all <b>elongated</b> <b>holes</b> of the blockages is three quarters of the channel height. The blockages are classified into two different types with two different hole-to-blockage area ratios (ratio of total crosssectional area of holes to cross-sectional surface area of the blockage) of 0. 5 or 0. 6. For each hole-to-blockage area ratio, the blockages are again subdivided into three different cases using three different aspect ratios (hole-width-to-height ratio) which are determined by the number of holes four, six, and eight holes per blockage. Experiments for total six different cases of blockages were performed under a uniform wall temperature condition (50 C). The experiments were conducted at three different Reynolds numbers of about 7, 000, 12, 000, and 17, 000, respectively. Three copper plate heaters with twenty one embedded thermocouples were used to measure the average heat transfer on the surface of channel walls between two consecutive blockages. Results from this study showed that the blockages with <b>elongated</b> <b>holes</b> enhance the average heat transfer by up to 5. 06 and 4. 08 times that by fully developed turbulent flow through a smooth channel at the same Reynolds numbers for small and large holeto- blockage area ratios, respectively. The friction factor ratios for small and large holeto- blockage area ratios of the blockages reached 345 and 89 times, respectively, that by fully developed turbulent flow through a smooth channel at the same Reynolds numbers. TP (Thermal Performance) values varied from 0. 65 to 1. 11 depending on cases. According to the results, Case L- 2, which has six <b>elongated</b> <b>holes</b> and hole-toblockage area ratio of 0. 6, is the best option from the TP point of view.

The approach does not use any Bayesian hypothesis regarding an unknown object; instead, the standard statistical requirements for the procedure for finding a desired object estimate are presented.

40|$|Cold-expansion {{testing of}} D 6 ac plates {{containing}} an elongated (non-circular) hole, of 2 : 1 aspect ratio, has been undertaken using an AMRL designed interference fit plug/sleeve arrangement. The aim {{has been to}} determine the practical viability of the process as an option for addressing the cracking problem at the non-circular fuel flow vent hole number 13 in the wing pivot fitting of the F- 111 C aircraft in service with the RAAF. The key issue being that in the open literature, only cold expansion to circular holes has been reported, and application to non-circular holes would represent a significant new development. In the testing, three nominally identical plate specimens were cold expanded, with sleeves of two different material types (ie high strength tool steel (D 2) and stainless steel) being assessed. Strain gauge readings around the <b>elongated</b> <b>hole</b> boundary were recorded at various stages of the cold-expansion process, {{as well as some}} typical full-field qualitative photoelastic strain distributions. In all cases nominal expansion levels greater than 2. 5 % were achieved, along with maximum peak strains of more than 10, 000 micro-strain and maximum residual strains greater than 1600 micro-strain. These results indicate that highly effective cold expansion has been achieved. It was also demonstrated that subsequent to cold expansion, effective interference fitting could be achieved, without the need for post cold-expansion machining. The particular advantages available by using stainless steel sleeves have been identified, and an improved surface finish at the holes in the plug is also recommended.

The blockages {{and the channel}} had the same cross section, and a distance equal to twice the channel height separated consecutive blockages. Naphthalene sublimation experiments were conducted with four hole aspect ratios (hole-width-to-height ratios) and two hole-to-blockage area ratios (ratios of total hole cross-sectional area to blockage area). The effects of the hole aspect ratio, for each hole-to-blockage area ratio, on the local heat (mass) transfer distribution on the exposed primary channel wall between consecutive blockages were examined. Results showed that the blockages with holes enhanced the average heat (mass) transfer by up to 8. 5 and 7. 0 times that for fully developed turbulent flow through a smooth channel at the same mass flow rate, respectively, in the smaller and larger hole-to-blockage area ratio (or smaller and larger hole diameter) cases. The <b>elongated</b> <b>holes</b> caused a higher average heat (mass) transfer and a larger spanwise variation of the local heat (mass) transfer on the channel wall than did the round holes. The second study explored the heat transfer enhancement for pool boiling on nano-structured surfaces. Experiments were conducted with three horizontal silicon surfaces, two of which were coated with vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with heights of 9 and 25 ????m, respectively, and diameters between 8 and 15 nm.

In the improved connection, steel tubes are inserted into drill holes in glulam and fixed to the glulam with resin injection. Aluminum splice plates with curved slots, or curved <b>elongated</b> <b>holes,</b> are fastened mechanically by using high-strength bolts that go through the steel tubes. Since the compression due to bolt tension is fully supported by the steel tubes, the reduction of bolt tension due to shrinkage of the glulam can be avoided. The use of slotted aluminum splice plates allows stable energy dissipation due to smooth sliding between the aluminum splice plates and the end surfaces of the steel tubes within the specified range of rotation angle. Through quasistatic cyclic loading tests of two connection specimens, it was demonstrated that stable and nearly rigid-plastic hysteresis loops were obtained whose equivalent viscous damping ratio was more than 30 % {{in the range of}} rotation angle close to or greater than 1 / 50 radian.

The parameters varied were the panel aspect ratios and the shapes and sizes of centrally placed holes in them.

The modelling used allowed the web plate to assume its natural boundary conditions. The results show that the buckling strength of a web panel bounded by flanges and stiffeners can be estimated by assuming that its edges are fixed. A simple formula which relates the elastic buckling stress of a perforated web plate to that of a similar intact web is proposed.

40|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{experiments were}} conducted to study the thermal performance characteristics of blockages with round and <b>elongated</b> <b>holes,</b> positioned in a 12 : 1 rectangular channel. Naphthalene sublimation technique was adopted to conduct experiments with four different blockage configurations, flow rates corresponding to Reynolds numbers (based on channel hydraulic diameter) of 7, 000 and 17, 000, and at three blockage locations. The hole area to channel area ratio for all four blockage configurations was the same at 0. 196. The hole width was half the channel height, and the distance between consecutive blockages was twice the channel height. Average heat transfer, local heat (mass) transfer and overall pressure drop results were obtained. The thermal performance for a particular blockage configuration was {{measured in terms of}} the heat transfer enhancement and the friction factor ratio. Heat transfer enhancement was measured as a ratio of average Nusselt number on the blockage surface to the Nusselt number for a thermally fully developed turbulent flow in a smooth channel. Results indicate that this ratio ranged between 3. 6 and 12. 4, while the friction factor ratio varied between 500 - 1700. The blockage configuration with round holes was found to yield best thermal performance, while the configuration with largest hole elongation was nearly equal in thermal performance. In order to compare different blockage configurations, an average value of upstream and downstream side thermal performances was used. A general downward trend in Nusselt number ratio with elongation of holes was observed on the upstream side and a reverse trend was observed on the downstream side. An upward trend in the Nusselt number ratio with blockage hole elongation on the downstream side of a blockage was primarily due to jet reversal from the downstream blockage and its impingement on the downstream surface of the upstream blockage. Local experiments were performed to compare against the results from average experiments and also to gain insights into the flow behaviour. There was good agreement between the results from local and average mass transfer experiments.
