5000|$|By 1940 {{the water}} {{users of the}} Kings River were leaning towards letting the USACE build the dam, {{in light of the}} continual water-rights {{problems}} associated with the USBR's plans, in addition to full federal funding offered by the USACE. The Flood Control Act of 1944 cemented this <b>decision,</b> <b>authorizing</b> the construction of four dams in the Tulare Lake basin of the San Joaquin Valley - Pine Flat, Terminus, Success and Isabella - as a USACE undertaking. The president signed a bill appropriating preliminary funds for Pine Flat Dam on April 2, 1945, but only [...] "reluctantly" [...] and [...] "the emphasis that he'd try to avoid dispensing any more money to the army for the dam". Roosevelt planned to take the Pine Flat issue to Congress, but never got the chance - he died of a brain hemorrhage just ten days later at his home in Georgia.|$|E
50|$|Hallucinogenic {{substances}} {{are among}} the oldest drugs used by human kind, as hallucinogenic substances naturally occur in mushrooms, cacti {{and a variety of}} other plants. Numerous cultures worldwide have endorsed the use of hallucinogens in medicine, religion and recreation, to varying extents, while some cultures have regulated or outright prohibited their use. In most developed countries today, the possession of many hallucinogens, even those found commonly in nature, is considered a crime punishable by fines, imprisonment or even death. In some countries, such as the United States and the Netherlands, partial deference may be granted to traditional religious use by members of indigenous ethnic minorities such as the Native American Church and the Santo Daime Church. Recently the União do Vegetal, a Christian-based religious sect whose composition is not primarily ethnicity-based, won a United States Supreme Court <b>decision</b> <b>authorizing</b> its use of ayahuasca. However, in Brazil, ayahuasca use in a religious context has been legal since 1987. In fact, it is a common belief among members of the União do Vegetal that ayahuasca presents no risk for adolescents within the church, as long as they take it within a religious context.|$|E

While adopting an instrument of enhanced cooperation does not seem the best way to overcome the dysfunctions of Article 81, para. 3, TFEU — related to the requirement for unanimity — the need to protect fundamental rights — as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union — in applying future instruments of private international law on property regimes will affect the discretionary power accorded to Member States in this area...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 82 - 91). The Arab Spring {{swept in}} 2011 igniting {{a process of}} regime change after decades of dictatorship and authoritarian rule. The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt were relatively swift and painless and did not require humanitarian interventions. In the case of Libya, stiff and violent resistance from the Qadhafi regime prevented a peaceful transition. Subsequently, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) drew on a Chapter VII UN Security Council resolution to undertake military action in order to end mass killings and other gross violations of human rights. In the case of Syria, although the casualties were significantly larger and the destruction greater, the UN Security Council was deadlocked, {{primarily because of the}} consecutive Russian and Chinese vetoes, and could not reach a <b>decision</b> <b>authorizing</b> humanitarian intervention. One aim of this thesis is to shed light on the underlying causes of this inconsistent international approach to humanitarian interventions. Stated otherwise, the thesis aims at exploring the motives behind the changed attitudes and conduct of Russia and China at the UN Security Council in the case of Syria. The paper further examines how this failure to interfere militarily to end the conflict intensified the need to provide aid to ever growing populations that have been affected by the ranging violence. This leads to an examination of the complex relationship between foreign military intervention and humanitarian aid. Arguing that the provision of aid is a substitute for humanitarian intervention when the political environment does not permit the latter, the thesis allocates ample space for discussing aid politics in the Syrian context. 1 hard copy: x, 91 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|E
