She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs.|$|E
40|$|Telephone: 01223 337147 In a {{world of}} uncertainty, {{imperfect}} information and irreversible decision-making, speculation and information acquisition will generate bubbles, herding and <b>frenzies</b> in housing demand. The instability generated will be further exacerbated by liquidity constraints and institutional change. In this paper, the influence of herds, <b>frenzies</b> and bubbles on housing demand is assessed {{in the context of}} housing markets in England and Wales. Econometric models of housing transactions are estimated to capture herding effects, bubbles and crashes. In addition, techniques are used to capture regime switching, with regime switches being conditioned upon political and institutional changes in UK housing mortgage markets emerging in the 1980 s. The evidence presented reveals that bubbles, herding and <b>frenzies</b> are important phenomena in housing markets and that the housing market is more effectively modelled when these destabilising effects are introduced into the analysis. The paper concludes with some policy implications. 1...|$|R

5|$|Groups often {{form when}} {{individuals}} converge on a food source, whereupon a feeding <b>frenzy</b> may occur. This {{seems to be}} triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities {{when it is not}} slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal.|$|E

They sold the first pictures of Shiloh through the distributor Getty Images with the aim of benefiting charity, rather than allowing paparazzi to make these valuable photographs. People and Hello! purchased the North American and British rights to the images for $4.1 and $3.5 million respectively, a record in celebrity photojournalism at that time, with all proceeds donated to UNICEF.|$|E
5|$|The Ripper murders mark an {{important}} watershed {{in the treatment}} of crime by journalists. Jack the Ripper was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media <b>frenzy.</b> Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E

5|$|A beach party {{takes place}} at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While {{treading}} water, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death a shark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins {{was killed in a}} boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is then placed on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting <b>frenzy.</b> Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from a shark attack.|$|E
5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded {{back to the}} Flames, in {{exchange}} for Joe Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence {{in the locker room}} as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans into a <b>frenzy</b> and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with the Flames, and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E

By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} that explains how stocks can crash without fundamental news and why crashes {{are more common}} than <b>frenzies.</b> A crash occurs via the interaction of rational and naive investors. Naive traders believe that prices follow a random walk with serially correlated volatility. Their expectations of future volatility are formed adaptively. When the market crashes, naive traders sell stock {{in response to the}} apparent increase in volatility. Since rational traders are risk averse as well, a lower price is needed to clear the market: the crash is a self-fulfilling prophecy. <b>Frenzies</b> cannot occur in this model. ...|$|R

This feedback effect from the financial market to the investment decision gives rise to trading <b>frenzies,</b> in which speculators all wish to trade like others, generating large pressure on prices. Coordination among speculators is sometimes desirable for price informativeness and investment efficiency, but speculators' incentives push in the opposite direction, so that they coordinate exactly when it is undesirable. We analyze the effect of various market parameters on the likelihood of trading <b>frenzies</b> to arise...|$|R
