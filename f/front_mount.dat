2500|$|Several Japanese models {{included}} an All Wheel Drive version (ATTESA). The engines {{used in the}} Japanese models ranged greatly in capacity and type. The SSS Attesa LTD model used a [...] "redtop" [...] SR20DET (154kW/206hp). This was a similar engine/drivetrain package to the Pulsar GTi-R (169kW). It had only a single throttle body as opposed the GTi-R multiple throttle body, smaller bearings, hydraulic rather than solid lifters, and a smaller turbo. The GTi-R had a large top mount intercooler, while the SSS ATTESA LTD had a smaller <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> intercooler. The Bluebird SSS was set apart from the North American Altima in that not only having the SR20DET and AWD Attesa as an option, it also had power folding retracting mirrors (some heated) and a rear wiper if equipped with a spoiler.|$|E

50|$|Front trailer hitches {{are also}} widely used on pickup trucks and full size SUVs for {{multiple}} purpose. A front-mounted hitch can accommodate additional truck {{equipment such as}} <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> bike carriers, fishing / hunting gear, winches, step plates, snow plows and more. It also allows a driver to temporarily maneuver a trailer with better visibility into any convenient place. Front trailer hitches are mounted directly to the frame of a vehicle to ensure a reliable connection. Front hitches are typically equipped with standard size receiver tubes to accommodate a variety of hitch mount equipment.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{generation}} 1JZ-GTE employs twin CT12A turbochargers arranged in parallel and blowing through a side-mount or <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> air-to-air intercooler.

The bore and stroke {{are the same as}} for the 1JZ-GE: 86 mm bore Ã— 71.5 mm stroke. Yamaha may have had a hand in the development or production of these engines (possibly the head design), hence the Yamaha badging on certain parts of the engine, such as the cam gear cover. In 1991, the 1JZ-GTE was slotted into the all-new Soarer GT.|$|E
5000|$|Virtual tuning, colloquially {{known as}} 'chopping' or 'VTuning', is the 2D {{graphical}} modification of automobiles, {{with the use}} of raster graphics editing software. Modifications such as aerodynamic and after market body-kits, wheels, <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> inter-coolers and carbon fibre body panels, as well as interior or race car modifications, are super-imposed on a stock image in order to increase its aesthetic appeal. Whilst some designs are realistic in nature, {{one of the reasons why}} virtual tuners chop is to try modifications that may not be technically feasible if translated to real life [...] Virtually tuned cars are the complete and comprehensive makeovers of ordinary cars.|$|E
50|$|An M35A2 {{cargo truck}} with a 10000 lb PTO-driven Garwood front winch is 112 in tall, 96 in wide and 277 in long, and 13030 lb empty (13530 lb empty when {{equipped}} with the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> winch, according to dashboard dataplates). The standard wheelbase cargo bed is 8 feet wide by 12 feet long (2.4 x 3.6 m), with only 7.25 feet of this width being flat floorspace between the stake-pockets, the tailgate rising 16 inches above {{the floor and the}} side-walls/stake-pockets rising 12 inches above the floor. The M35A2 was available with a canvas soft top or a metal hard top. Metal hard-top configurations are most often found on vehicles that have been equipped with cold-weather gear, including additional insulation in the cab, as well as engine coolant or multifuel-fired cab personnel heaters.|$|E

50|$|Iowa law allowed townships to {{levy a tax}} {{for fire}} protection, and Columbia and East Des Moines Townships {{contracted}} with the City to provide this service. Individual property owners from other townships could contract for fire protection. About 1960, the townships bought a fire truck on an International chassis with a <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> pump, and the chemical tank truck was retired but the pump was salvaged and used later. In the early 1970s the two townships purchased a truck, had a tank built and a pump (from the old chemical truck) installed for use as a tanker truck and the City and the townships built a building to house the tanker as well as certain city operations and equipment. In about 1974, the City purchased a new fire truck on a Ford chassis. A new fire station has since been built on Walnut Street at 6th Street, and there is more room for newer equipment.|$|E
50|$|A teleside {{converter}} (also {{known as}} a telephoto conversion lens or a <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> teleconverter) is a secondary lens which is mounted {{on the front of}} a photographic lens to increase the effective focal length of the lens they are attached to. They are used on cameras and video cameras with non-interchangeable lenses to increase the magnification of the image. Their design is usually that of an afocal Galilean telescope that alters the width of the entering beam of light without affecting the divergence of the beam, so they can change the effective focal length 1 to 3 times without increasing focal ratio. The down side to teleside converters is they will vignette the image on the wide angle setting if used on a zoom lens. Minimum Focal Length without vignetting will increase inline with higher power of the teleside converter. Before vignetting appears (four black corners), light fall-off will appear first and in general shooting this light fall-off may not be noticeable. The other concern is Minimum Working Distance, so the teleside converter cannot be used below minimum working distance and it depends on both the camera and the teleside converter being used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>mounted</b> {{longitudinal}} engines with {{rear-wheel drive}} (FR) {{is a common}} layout of luxury cars. European marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar have almost never adopted <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> engines with front-wheel drive (FF) and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars. Japanese brands such as Lexus and Infiniti also have predominantly FR lineups. The FR layout, while {{more expensive than the}} FF, has been retained by these luxury manufacturers as it allows for higher performance engines (particularly the straight-6, V8, and other engine configurations with more cylinders), better handling, and a smoother ride.|$|R

30|$|It can be {{observed}} from FigureÂ  8 and TableÂ  7 that the front part of the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> frame has a maximum deformation of 0.82 Â mm, mainly {{because there are no}} rubber blocks. The stress in the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> is mainly distributed in the six bolt holes and two sides of the vertical part of the metal frame, and the bolt hole of the horizontal part has a maximum stress of 82.017 Â MPa. Compared with the left and right mounts, the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> has larger deformation and stress, and is more easily damaged during use, and hence, it is necessary to improve the reliability of the <b>front</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|E
