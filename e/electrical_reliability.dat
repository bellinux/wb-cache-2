40|$|ABSTRACT: The goal of {{this paper}} is to test if the promised U.

This research is the first in the literature to combine states that offer retail choice, by deregulating their electric utilities, with North American Electric Reliability Corporation reserve margin forecasts, from 2014 - 2023, to analyze whether deregulated retail-choice states are adding adequate generating capacity to meet demand, and thus provide high <b>electrical</b> system <b>reliability,</b> when compared to the U. S. as a whole. This paper’s results on <b>electrical</b> system <b>reliability</b> in the deregulated states are timely and important for U. S. electricity energy policy. Additionally, this is the first paper in the literature to propose a new space-time business model that adequately addresses the complex, multidiscipline, multidimensional, U. S. electrical system deregulated market. Future research will specify the new business model’s mathematical formulation...|$|R

2500|$|The {{development}} of the 16-cylinder EMD 50 and 60 series locomotives in the late 1970s and early 1980s was spurred {{by the introduction of}} [...] 16-cylinder GE B36-7 (B-B) and GE C36-7 (C-C) locomotives by EMD's main competitor General Electric. EMD previously manufactured the [...] 20-cylinder SD45 and SD45-2 locomotives, but they had a reputation for high fuel consumption. [...] In 1980, the SD50 model was added to the EMD Catalog. [...] However, the SD50's <b>electrical</b> <b>reliability</b> was poor and, similarly, the [...] 16-645F engine had poor mechanical reliability, both believed to be largely due to excessive vibration from the 950 maximum rpm of the 645F prime mover.

[...] Although the carbody and frame are nearly indistinguishable from the earlier SD50, the SD60 featured the new 16-cylinder EMD 710G3A prime mover, AR-11 traction alternator, D-87 traction motors and a microprocessor-based control system that governed various electrical systems within the locomotive (e.g., wheel slip and transition).|$|E

50|$|These boats all had air conditioning, {{refrigerated}} storage for food, generous fresh water distilling units, clothes washers, and bunks for nearly every crew member; these were luxuries virtually {{unheard of in}} other navies. The Bureau designers felt that if a crew of 60-80 men were to be expected to conduct 75-day patrols in the warm waters of the Pacific, these types of features were vital {{to the health and}} efficiency of the crew. They could be added without impact to the boat's war fighting abilities due to the extra room of the big fleet boat. However, one feature in particular had a very practical side to it. Submerge a submarine {{for any length of time}} and the heat generated by the recently shut down engines, electronic gear, and 70 warm bodies will quickly raise internal temperatures above 100 F. High humidity generated by tropical waters will quickly condense and begin dripping into equipment, eventually causing electrical shorts and fires. Air conditioning, acting mostly as a dehumidifier, virtually eliminates this problem and greatly increases mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>reliability.</b> It proved to be a key factor in the success of these boats during World War II.|$|E
