60|$|For {{a moment}} he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and <b>watched.</b> Then, as the beast, {{resisting}} its rider's efforts, backed again, sprang forward and seized the bridle.|$|R
60|$|Round {{spun the}} boat in the eddy, she was sucked down till the water trickled over her gunwale, {{and for a moment}} they knew not if they were lost or saved. Eric <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and <b>watched,</b> then slowly the boat lifted her nose, and they were safe from the {{whirlpool}} of the lost dragon.|$|R
60|$|Gomez leant forward till {{his face}} touched the window pane. He {{strained}} his eyes till they ached; but the darkness was impenetrable. Yet stay,--what was that? A feeble yellow light was glimmering {{far away in}} the heart of that great gulf of darkness. He <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> and <b>watched</b> it steadily. Then he turned round.|$|R
60|$|Shefford ran up {{the shore}} toward the Indian. He climbed the jutting slant of rock. The boat was now full in the turn--it moved faster--it was nearing the smooth incline above the rapid. There! it glided down--heaved darkly up--settled back--and {{disappeared}} in the frothy, muddy roughness of water. Shefford <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and <b>watched.</b> A dark, bobbing object showed, vanished, showed again to enlarge--to take {{the shape of a}} big flatboat--and then it rode the swift, choppy current out of {{the lower end of the}} rapid.|$|R
60|$|The big log {{reached the}} bank and ran half way up the short incline before its speed slackened much. Festing <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he <b>watched,</b> for some gravel cars had come down the track, {{and he could not}} tell where they were. The log was going slower, but he doubted if it would stop.|$|R
60|$|Nares set <b>his</b> lips, and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he <b>watched</b> them. The shadowy {{entrance}} of the hut was not far away, but it seemed impossible that they could reach it before one, at least, of them was struck. Herrero, blind with fear, seemed to flag already, but Gavin drove him on, and Nares could see that his face was set and grim. They went by a cluster of negroes running to intercept them, and the tall man in the white duck seemed to fling his comrade forward into the hut. Then he spun round pitching up the heavy rifle. There was a flash and a detonation, and Ormsgill heard a curious droning sound as if a bee had passed above his head. In another second a man who stood close at his Suzerain's side lurched forward with a strangled cry. Then Gavin sprang into the hut, and when the old man made a sign four of his retainers laid hands on Ormsgill and his companion. They were big muscular men, and Nares looked at Ormsgill, who submitted quietly.|$|R
60|$|A low {{and very}} swift shadow flashed {{across the open}} space behind the man. Harry laughed hoarsely as the man went down and rolled over with an indistinct object {{apparently}} on his back. He cried out, there was a confused shouting, {{and some of his}} companions came running toward him, showing black against the light. Frank <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he <b>watched.</b> He expected to see two flashes from the window, since Mr. Webster and Mr. Oliver had now an easy mark, but they did not fire. The next moment he shrank in sudden horror, for the cries grew sharper and suggested pain and an extremity of fear. Then he felt that, regardless of the hazard, he could almost have cheered the smugglers on as they ran toward the prostrate man, who was struggling vainly with the furious dog. They surged about him in a confused group, and just then, to Frank's amazement, a pistol flashed among the firs {{on the edge of the}} bush. It was followed by a sudden clamor, whereupon the group broke up, and running men streamed out across the clearing. The smugglers vanished, and Harry sprang out from among the stumps shouting wildly.|$|R
60|$|Once more vague, shadowy objects flitted {{out of the}} bush, {{and swept}} towards the stockade. They ran without order, furiously, while more of their comrades emerged from the shadows behind them, until the narrow strip of cleared space was filled with running figures. There {{appeared}} to be swarms of them, and Ormsgill <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he <b>watched.</b> He saw them plunge into a crawling trail of low lying mist, that seemed torn apart suddenly when once more {{the face of the}} stockade was streaked with little spurts of flame. It closed on them again until all was hidden but the intermittent flashing, and the jarring thud of the machine gun rent the din. One could not tell what was going on, and it was by a tense effort Ormsgill held himself still with every nerve in him quivering. How long the tension lasted he did not know, but at length the ringing of the rifles died away again, and as a little puff of chilly breeze rolled the haze aside it became evident that the space before the stockade was once more empty. He could see the stockade clearly, and {{the edge of the forest}} now cut sharply against the sky.|$|R
60|$|Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, {{looking down}} from the top of a tall tree, held their breath. Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel, looking down from another tree, held their breath. Unc' Billy Possum, {{sticking}} his head out from a hollow tree, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Bobby Coon, looking through a hole in a hollow stump in which he was hiding, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Reddy Fox, lying flat down behind a heap of brush, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Peter Rabbit, sitting bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch, with eyes and ears wide open, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> And all the other little people who happened to be where they could see did the same thing.|$|R
60|$|Agravaine <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> But all was well. The damsel bowed.|$|R
60|$|The Frolic was {{abreast of}} them, and he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with suspense.|$|R
60|$|And all {{the time}} Unc' Billy Possum <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and lay low.|$|R
60|$|Louis <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and stood}} rigid at the meaning her words conveyed.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Groombride <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{and turned}} purple. Then he stamped his foot.|$|R
60|$|March felt reassured; nevertheless, he {{shut his}} eyes very tight and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|And then, {{looking toward}} the bed, he saw that dirty lady, and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with astonishment.|$|R
60|$|And as Petru {{looked at}} her the magic flute dropped by his side, and he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|Jimmy, {{knowing what}} the hazard was, pressed <b>his</b> telegraph, and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> until a harsh voice rose again.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} sitting on {{the far edge of the}} pool, staring down into the water, resting her head on one {{drawn-up}} knee. She had been bathing; he could see that at once. Her coppery body was still wet and glistening with moisture, sparkling in the sun. She had not seen him. He stopped, holding <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>watching</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Several {{times they}} {{came close to}} where Leo was lying, and he fairly <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> until they passed on.|$|R
60|$|The ship leaped. Kramer closed <b>his</b> {{eyes and}} <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> They were moving out into space, gaining speed each moment.|$|R
6000|$|... [Illustration: [...] "Dropping {{his chin}} upon the stock, he {{stiffened}} <b>his</b> arms and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> as he squeezed the trigger"--Page 327.] ...|$|R
6000|$|The father <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> What {{on earth}} could this mean? [...] "And {{who is the}} girl, Granville?" [...] he asked, with unconcealed interest.|$|R
6000|$|Razumov <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{before the}} bronze as if expecting a crash. Behind his back a voice {{he had never}} heard before insisted politely-- ...|$|R
60|$|Wetherell <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> For {{a moment}} Mr. Worthington sat very still, his face drawn, {{and then he}} wet his lips and rose slowly.|$|R
6000|$|At this {{juncture}} in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect {{turned the corner}} of the street ahead. Tommy <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> Would they hail it? ...|$|R
60|$|Flower <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> with anxiety; then {{he smiled}} softly and pleasantly as {{he listened to the}} terms in which his {{somewhat}} difficult host was addressed.|$|R
60|$|He almost <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> {{while she}} spoke, caught in amazement. He was {{standing}} close beside her chair, {{his right hand}} rested upon its tall back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heâ€™ll {{never do}} it!" [...] groaned the pilot. Then he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> {{for three or}} four hundred yards behind the captain Mrs. Pepper pounded in pursuit.|$|R
6000|$|Arthur turned {{cold and}} hard as granite. His heart rose with a murderous, slow swell. He <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> while the calm, amused {{voice of the}} Major replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Drop it!" [...] snapped out Delmar, and {{the tone}} of his voice was terrible to hear. Mose's heart stopped beating; he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> expecting the {{shooting}} to begin.|$|R
6000|$|... (Geoffrey <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath.</b> The pen dropped unheeded {{from his}} fingers. It was coming. The light {{that his brother}} couldn't throw on the subject was dawning on it at last!) ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> for a moment. The tramp of {{approaching}} footsteps warned {{him of the}} coming of an intruder. The Captain came to a standstill before their chairs and saluted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the usual}} thing. He <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> till I thought he'd burst. Then he damned me in heaps, and I took good care {{to keep out}} of his sight till next day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Even that Andrew Barton {{you were}} singing {{of on the}} stair just now.' He dipped again in the ink-well, and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> over a {{sweeping}} line, {{as though he had}} forgotten everything else.|$|R
60|$|But while Beresteyn <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> and Stoutenburg {{tried to}} steady the {{trembling}} of his hand, he raised Bucephalus {{above his head}} and with a wild shout pointed toward the southern horizon far away.|$|R
