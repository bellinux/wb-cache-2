Inventory specialists set up a line bearing on their <b>hand</b> <b>compass</b> and determine how many plots to take on this survey line. This is done by determining the distance between survey lines (B), the distance between plots (D), and the surface area (A) of the tract. The number of samples that should be taken is then calculated as follows:The survey starts with the surveyor selecting two random numbers between and B and and D for the first plot and line location. The surveyor then measures the length to the first plot, surveys, and repeats the procedure. Once at the boundary, the surveyor turns 90° and continues on to the next transect.|$|E

[...] Instead of a magnetized needle or disc, most hand bearing compasses feature liquid damping with a floating card design (a magnetized, degreed float or dial atop a jeweled pivot bearing).

5000|$|A {{bearing compass}} is a {{magnetic}} compass mounted {{in such a way}} that it allows the taking of bearings of objects by aligning them with the lubber line of the bearing compass. A surveyor's compass is a specialized compass made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with map making. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 Cyclopaedia. The bearing compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand. In 1885, a patent was granted for a <b>hand</b> <b>compass</b> fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the prismatic compass. [...] Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror. First patented in 1902, the Bézard compass consisted of a field compass with a mirror mounted above it. [...] This arrangement enabled the user to align the compass with an objective while simultaneously viewing its bearing in the mirror.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{change in}} {{emphasis}} from tractor and highlead logging systems to the advanced logging systems of skyline, balloon, and helicopter has stirred researchers {{to study the}} operations of the advanced systems. The extra work involved in preparing an area for contract timber removal using advanced logging systems, however, has not been studied. The impacts of the extra time and extra manpower required for this process are large and they are important impacts which need to be taken into consideration during crew work planning. This is difficult to do since the factors which affect crew manhours have not been defined. The objectives of this paper are to determine which factors affect the number of manhours spent on the presale fieldwork portion of preparing a U. S. D. A. Forest Service timber sale for contract; to compare presale field work time on conventional and special-design sales; and to develop a methodology for predicting presale fieldwork time. Previous studies suggest some factors which affect forestry work, but the quantitative changes in production caused by each factor have not been measured. Logging operation research and human engineering studies report that the following factors affect production: underbrush, topography, weather, heat, cold, muscle fatigue, motivation, the work-rest period, tobacco, and alcohol. Motivation is often an overriding factor which outweighs all other considerations. Motivation was not measured in this study, but it was expected to have some effect on the results. Topography, underbrush, and weather were expected {{to be the most important}} variables for predicting manhours. Data or presale fieldwork time were collected from 16 districts on eight National Forests in Oregon and Washington, using a form designed to simplify data collection and coding for computer input. The form was a daily work record which could be easily filled out in a few minutes by the field crew. District personnel on each of the 16 districts were personally contacted about cooperating in the study, but they were not pressured to collect data even if they agreed to cooperate. The sample was designed to collect a distribution of data from the coast, eastside, and Cascade areas respectively, but most data collected came from the Cascade area. Activity categories for data collection included layout, traverse, marking,cruising, skyline profile, wildlife related activity, land line retracement, spur road traverse, spur road location, and timber stand examination. The data were separated by activity and by complete units, and were analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression program. Variables found to increase the number of manhours required for presale fieldwork were acres, boundary sinuosity, and silvicultural treatment. The significant variables which reduced manhours were landscape management designation and the distance walked from the vehicle to the unit. These two variables had been expected to increase manhours, but the effect of motivation may have been the cause for the unexpected reverse of sign on the regression coefficients. Special design designation showed no significant effect on manhours except through boundary sinuosity. The regression equations recommended for use in predicting manhours are for the activities of layout using on-the-ground aerial photo-interpretation; traverse using a <b>hand</b> <b>compass,</b> clinometer, and chain; marking of leave trees; cruising by the variable plot method; and for the Cascade area complete units. Nomographs are provided for the solution of these regression equations...|$|E

5000|$|A {{practical}} example of obtaining a position fix {{would be for}} a ship to take bearing measurements on three lighthouses positioned along the coast. These measurements could be made visually using a <b>hand</b> bearing <b>compass,</b> or in poor visibility electronically using radar or radio direction finding. Since all physical observations are subject to errors the resulting position fix is also subject to error. Although in theory two lines of position (LOP) are enough to define a point, in practice 'crossing' more LOPs provides greater accuracy and confidence, especially if the lines cross at a good angle to each other. Three LOPs are considered the minimum for a practical navigational fix. The three LOPs when drawn on the chart will in general form a triangle, known as a 'cocked hat'. The navigator will have more confidence in a position fix that is formed by a small cocked hat with angles close to those of an equilateral triangle.|$|R

5000|$|The line of {{greatest}} slope has practical significance in map reading. On the terrain {{it is often}} far more discernible, even intuitively obvious, rather than accurately picking out the consistent height level on what is likely the undulating uneven ground along the ground represented on the contour line.

The extent and overall direction of the contour line to a map scale can only be found on the topographic map. By noting the corresponding compass vector, walking along the contour one can line up a <b>hand</b> held <b>compass</b> aligning the expected direction, and eye-balling the line of contour's estimated level, move up or down along the bearing faster - [...] to closely locate a desired point (planned point) along the hillside.

The approximation can then be refined by transit and other surveyor tools to construct on target.|$|R
