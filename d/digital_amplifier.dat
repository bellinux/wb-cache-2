50|$|The {{majority}} of today's lock-in amplifiers {{are based on}} high-performance digital signal processing (DSP). Over the last 20 years, <b>digital</b> lock-in <b>amplifiers</b> have been replacing analog models across the entire frequency range, allowing users to perform measurements up to a frequency of 600 MHz. Initial problems of the first <b>digital</b> lock-in <b>amplifiers,</b> e.g. the presence of digital clock noise on the input connectors, could be completely eliminated by use of improved electronic components and better instrument design. Today's <b>digital</b> lock-in <b>amplifiers</b> outperform analog models in all relevant performance parameters, such as frequency range, input noise, stability and dynamic reserve. In addition to better performance, <b>digital</b> lock-in <b>amplifiers</b> can include multiple demodulators, which allows analyzing a signal with different filter settings or at multiple different frequencies simultaneously. Moreover, experimental data can be analyzed with additional tools such as an oscilloscope, FFT spectrum analyzers, boxcar averager or used to provide feedback by using internal PID controllers. Some models of the <b>digital</b> lock-in <b>amplifiers</b> are computer-controlled and feature a graphical user interface (can be a platform-independent browser user interface) and a choice of programming interfaces.|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} problem of pulse-width modulation (PWM) based open-loop digital Class-D audio power amplifiers is the inherent nonlinearity of the PWM process, which necessitates {{the application of}} a precompensating linearization algorithm. Severe technical difficulties arising from the stringent speed requirements of both electronic circuitry, and digital signal processing devices make the implementation of highfidelity <b>digital</b> power <b>amplifiers</b> even more challenging, despite today's advanced technology. A versatile simulation model of a <b>digital</b> power <b>amplifier</b> was developed, and the performance of three existing linearization techniques was evaluated. A digital signal processor based laboratory prototype of a <b>digital</b> power <b>amplifier</b> was designed and built, incorporating two of the simulated linearization methods. The laboratory prototype proves the effectiveness of the linearization methods for low-power PWM-signals. The laboratory prototype was also used to identify further problems associated with the open-loop <b>digital</b> Class-D <b>amplifier</b> concept, such as the influence of a non-ideal switching stage. Finally, an alternative pseudo-feedback strategy was suggested, which employs a linear adaptive filter...|$|R

50|$|Mixed-signal ICs {{are often}} used to convert analog signals to digital signals so that digital devices can process them. For example, mixed-signal ICs are {{essential}} components for FM tuners in digital products such as media players, which have <b>digital</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Any analog signal (such as an FM radio transmission, a light wave or a sound) can be digitized using a very basic analog-to-digital converter, and the smallest and most energy efficient of these {{would be in the}} form of mixed-signal ICs.|$|R
50|$|However, when wider {{bands are}} needed, for {{instance}} {{a very high}} (action potentials) or a low frequency (local field potentials), they could be filtered digitally, perhaps with second-stage analog amplifier before being digitized. There may be some drawbacks when several amplifiers in cascade. It depends on the type, analog or digital. However, in general, filters cause time-delay and amendments are needed to have signals in sync. Also, as extra complexity is added, it costs more money. In terms of <b>digital</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> a lot of works that the laboratories do are feeding back signals to the networks in closed loop, real-time. As a result, more time is needed to apply on signals when there are more <b>digital</b> <b>amplifiers</b> on the way. One solution is using field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the “blank slate” integrated circuit that is written whatever on it. Using FPGA sometimes reduces a need to use computers, resulting in a speed-up of filtering. Another problem with cascaded filters occurs when the maximum output of the first filter is smaller than the raw signals, and the second filter has a higher maximum output that the first filter. In that case, {{it is impossible to}} recognize if the signals have reached the maximum output or not.|$|R
