For the most part, I was never thrilled with the results, so I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever {{is going on in}} my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our way of trying to keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much stuff it just gets lost".|$|E
500|$|The episode—whose title means [...] "I wish" [...] in French—was {{written and}} {{directed}} by long-time X-Files contributor Vince Gilligan. Gilligan noted that, [...] "from the very beginning I always had the intention of directing an episode, but I kept putting it off because I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> didn't know enough." [...] Gilligan, however, soon learned directing techniques from his four-and-a-half years of experience on the show. As season seven neared its end and the rumors that the season would be the show's last, Gilligan decided to finally direct an episode. After approaching series creator Chris Carter, an episode set to be {{written and directed}} by Gilligan was green-lit. Initially, Gilligan's first script was a [...] "stark and scary" [...] outing for the show. However, as the deadline for the script grew closer, he relented and decided to write a more humorous episode.|$|E

500|$|López went {{to college}} at the University of Virginia (UVA) and played for the Virginia Cavaliers {{baseball}} team. Through August 2011, {{he was one of}} 29 former UVA players to have made it to the major leagues, along with among others Mark Reynolds, and Ryan Zimmerman. While playing at UVA, he went 12–9 with a 6.30 earned run average (ERA). As a hitter, he had a batting average of [...]319, 15 home runs, and 71 runs batted in (RBI). However, while still at UVA, he discovered that pitching was most likely to get him to the major leagues. Despite leaving college after only three years to play professional baseball, López continued working on his degree in psychology, which he earned in 2002 to fulfill a promise to his father-in-law. He also said, [...] "I had done three years at a great university. I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> should finish." ...|$|E
500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> came all this way, I ought to give myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
500|$|The Curse of Monkey Island was {{the first}} Monkey Island game to feature voice acting; in it, the part of Elaine Marley was given to British actress Alexandra Boyd. Boyd {{explains}} that she got the part of Elaine as she had worked with voice director Darragh O'Farrell previously; O'Farrell brought Boyd in to read for the part. Boyd joked that [...] "I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> got the part because I have red hair like her". Boyd was not contacted to return as the character for Escape from Monkey Island; Elaine was instead voiced by American actress Charity James. Nevertheless, Boyd reprised the role for Telltale Games' Tales of Monkey Island and the later enhanced remakes {{of the first two}} games. Boyd was glad to return, stating that the character [...] "is very well written and it’s fun doing all that shouting at LeChuck and Guybrush! Exhausting but fun". Rather than travelling to Telltale's studio in San Rafael, Boyd instead recorded her lines for Tales of Monkey Island in London, communicating with the director remotely with Skype. The development of Elaine's character was one of Gilbert's aims for Tales of Monkey Island; Gilbert wanted Elaine to [...] "be better informed and more capable than most of the other characters".|$|E

500|$|As {{a player}} for the Overbrook Panthers, Chamberlain {{averaged}} 31 {{points a game}} during the 1953 high school season and led his team to a 71–62 win against the Northeast High School of his future NBA teammate Guy Rodgers. He scored 34 points, won Overbrook the Public League title and a berth for the Philadelphia city championship game against {{the winner of the}} rival Catholic league, West Catholic. In that game, West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain the entire game, and despite the center's 29 points, the Panthers lost 54–42. In his second Overbrook season, Chamberlain continued his prolific scoring, among them scoring a high school record 71 points against Roxborough. The Panthers comfortably won the Public League title after again beating Northeast in which Chamberlain scored 40 points, and later won the city title by defeating South Catholic 74–50. Chamberlain scored 32 points and led Overbrook to a flawless 19–0 season. During summer vacations Chamberlain worked as a bellhop in Kutsher's Hotel. Subsequently, owners Milton and Helen Kutsher kept up a lifelong friendship with Wilt, and according to their son Mark, [...] "They were his second set of parents." [...] Red Auerbach, the coach of the Boston Celtics, spotted the talented teenager at Kutscher's and had him play 1-on-1 against Kansas University standout and national champion, B. H. Born, elected the Most Valuable Player of the 1953 NCAA Finals. Chamberlain won 25–10; Born was so dejected that he gave up a promising NBA career and became a tractor engineer ("If there were high school kids that good, I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> wasn't going {{to make it to the}} pros"), and Auerbach wanted Chamberlain to go to a New England university, so he could draft him as a territorial pick for the Celtics, but Chamberlain did not respond.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1966–67 season, Celtics coach Red Auerbach retired. Initially, he {{had wanted}} his old player Frank Ramsey as coach, but Ramsey was too {{occupied}} running his three lucrative nursing homes. His second choice Bob Cousy declined, stating {{he did not want}} to coach his former teammates, and the third choice Tom Heinsohn also said no, because he did not think he could handle the often surly Russell. However, Heinsohn proposed Russell himself as a player-coach, and when Auerbach asked his center, he said yes. On April 16, 1966 Bill Russell agreed to become head coach of the Boston Celtics followed by a public announcement two days later. Russell thus became the first African American head coach in NBA history, and commented to journalists: [...] "I wasn't offered the job because I am a Negro, I was offered it because Red <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> could do it." [...] The Celtics' championship streak ended in his first full season as head coach at eight, however, as Wilt Chamberlain's Philadelphia 76ers won a record-breaking 68 regular season games and overcame the Celtics 4–1 in the 1967 Eastern Finals. The Sixers simply outpaced the Celtics, shredding the famous Boston defense by scoring 140 points in the clinching Game 5 win. Russell acknowledged his first real loss in his career (he had been injured in 1958 when the Celtics lost the NBA Finals) by visiting Chamberlain in the locker room, shaking his hand and saying, [...] "Great". However, the game still ended on a high note for Russell. After the loss, he led his grandfather through the Celtics locker rooms, and the two saw white Celtics player John Havlicek taking a shower next to his black teammate Sam Jones and discussing the game. Suddenly, Jake Russell broke down crying. Asked by his grandson what was wrong, his grandfather replied how proud he was of him, being coach of an organization in which blacks and whites coexisted in harmony.|$|E

2500|$|On August 6, 2013, Taco Bell {{announced}} it was expanding its test market of waffle tacos to about 100 restaurants in Fresno, California, Omaha, Nebraska and Chattanooga, Tennessee, starting August 8. The waffle taco includes scrambled eggs, sausage and a side of syrup. It was the top selling item during breakfast hours at the five Southern California restaurants where they were tested earlier in 2013. The breakfast menu started on March 27, 2014. Other items include A.M. Crunchwrap, Cinnabon Delights, breakfast burrito, A.M. grilled sausage flatbread melt, hash browns, coffee and orange juice.

2500|$|Dance in the Rain is the {{follow-up}} to Coulter's third studio album Fear & Freedom (2012), which debuted at number seven on the ARIAAlbumsChart and became her first top-ten album. Coulter {{began working on}} Dance in the Rain shortly {{after the completion of}} Fear & Freedom. As executive producer of Dance in the Rain, Coulter had full control over the songwriters and producers she wanted to work with. She also spent her own money to travel overseas to write and record material for the album. Coulter intended for DanceintheRain to be an honest album and wanted to avoid following a certain sound and concept. She worked on it for two years in various places around the world, including Bali, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nashville, New York City, Paris, Sweden and Sydney. Stuart Crichton co-produced a majority of the album's songs alongside Coulter. Speaking of the inspiration behind Dance in the Rain, Coulter stated: [...] "Life throws so much at you and I write about it all...I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> had a lot to say and there were so many things I wanted to express – and I managed to pull it all together for this one album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 1991, and {{continued}} into 1992, while {{taking place at}} Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks, and Power Play Studios. During this time, Redman did another collaboration with EPMD on their fourth album Business Never Personal (1992). As EPMD member Parish Smith was often credited for mentoring Hit Squad artists Das EFX and K-Solo, Erick Sermon helped mentor Redman throughout the album, while receiving co-production credits {{for most of the}} album's songs. In spite of this, Redman was still left alone throughout the majority of the writing and recording process. He later recollected [...] "For that whole album I was {{under a lot of pressure}} to learn, and learn quickly. Erick showed me a couple of recording moves, then threw me in the studio and just left me there. I had to learn and do it myself. Erick was always there if I really needed him, so it wasn't that bad. But he had his own shit to deal with and he <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> was okay on my own." [...] Redman further stated [...] "When I first started doing the album I was mad at Erick for leaving me in the studio. I was like 'what the fuck am I doing here?' I had an album to hit the world with, and it was just up to me. But I'm glad he did it, because I learned everything that I needed to." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, she {{released}} Mi Vida Loca, which debuted at number 1 on the Regional Mexican Albums chart and number 2 on the Top Latin Albums chart in the United States, the album garnered {{an award for}} Regional Mexican Album of the Year at the 2008 Latin Billboard Music Awards. In a 2011 interview with Billboard magazine she stated, [...] "That was more of Jenni telling her story through music. My life has been so put out there by the media that I <b>figured</b> <b>I</b> might as well {{put it out there}} myself, in my own words and through my music. I wanted to clear up speculations about my private life." [...] The album also garnered Rivera her first Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year, an award she would dominate {{for the rest of her}} life. The same year {{she released}} La Diva en Vivo, a live album that consisted of songs recorded with a mariachi band, which garnered her, her second Latin Grammy nomination for Best Ranchero Album. That year she was the only female singer nominated in that category. The album was recorded at The Gibson Amphitheater in Universal City, California, Rivera sold out the concert which led her to become the first female banda singer to do so. Her tenth studio album, Jenni released in 2008, became her first No. 1 record on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. The album led Rivera to win her second Lo Nuestro Award for Banda Artist of the Year, becoming the first female act to win the accolade. A feat that currently stands to date. In 2009, she changed course and recorded her first full mariachi studio album titled La Gran Señora, which garnered a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Ranchero Album, it peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. In an interview Rivera said that releasing the album was very daring and marked her career in a positive way, she said she wanted to grow as an artist and the people that listen to banda will listen to mariachi if they find a good album that they feel is worth buying. She went on to say there are certain nationalities that will listen to mariachi and not banda. Those were the people that she was going after. She also stated, [...] "Commercializing a ranchera album is much harder. There had not been a successful female mariachi artist in a long time. It was a big risk, but it was a risk that I was willing to take. La Gran Señora ended up being the biggest-selling [...] album of 2010." ...|$|E
