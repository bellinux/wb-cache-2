As of December 2011 Croatia maintains an embassy in Budapest (headed by ambassador Ivan Bandić), a consulate general in Pécs and a consulate in Nagykanizsa. The Nagykanizsa consulate is led by an honorary consul. Hungary maintains an embassy in Zagreb and consulates in Rijeka and Split. The embassy is headed by ambassador Gábor Iván; the offices also include an army and air attaché office in the Republic of Croatia (headed by László Hajas) and the Office for Economic Affairs of the Embassy of the Republic of Hungary in the Republic of Croatia (headed by András Péter Závoczky, Counsellor <b>for</b> <b>Economy</b> and Trade).|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Dugan {{produced}} the Model E, the E standing <b>for</b> <b>economy.</b> This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller {{and less expensive}} than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs. Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable.|$|E

Sets from the previous film were reused, having survived three hurricanes, although the main pier had to be rebuilt as it had collapsed in November. The crew had four tall ships at their disposal to populate the backgrounds, which were painted differently on each side <b>for</b> <b>economy.</b> One of the ships used was the replica of HMS Bounty used in the 1962 film adaptation of Mutiny on the Bounty.|$|E

5|$|At the {{national}} level, the wards of Hyogo, Nagata and Kita form Hyogo No.2 District in the House of Representatives. Kazuyoshi Akaba of the Komeito Party has represented the district from 1993 to 2009 and again from 2012 until present, most recently elected to his 7th {{term in the}} December 2014 general election.

Electors in Hyogo also vote to elect members to the House of Representatives as part of the Kinki proportional representation block.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{framework}} to analyse the wage premium behaviour.

We find that, <b>for</b> <b>economies</b> relatively abundant in high-skilled labour, {{a rise in}} the relative endowment of high-skilled labour is accompanied by {{a rise in the}} skill premium. We further find that a rise (i) in investment costs or (ii) in the complementarities degree, requires an increase in the relative endowment of high-skilled labour, <b>for</b> the <b>economy</b> to remain in the same growth equilibrium. <b>For</b> <b>economies</b> relatively abundant in high-skilled labour, such rises are also accompanied by an increase in the skill premium.

Röpke criticized the Marshall Plan for forestalling the transition to the free market by subsidizing the current, failing systems. Erhard put Röpke's theory into practice and would later credit Röpke's influence for West Germany's preeminent success.|$|E
