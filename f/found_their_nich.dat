Whether it be rap or country, {{classical}} or punk, people have <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> in the world of music. People relate to music, and it makes them feel good. Music comes with an emotional attachment in this way. This bond is seen between listeners and performers, as well as the listeners themselves. This common love of music is seen very blatantly, as it’s played on every kind of social media, and is seen in schools across the country. In some cases, music helps with more than just mood and friendships. Music helps people feel included and equal in their societies. When it comes to the fight for equality, music is a fundamental supporter...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic and {{geothermal}} systems emit endogenous gases by widespread degassing from soils, including CH 4, {{a greenhouse}} gas 25 times as potent as CO 2. Recently, {{it has been}} demonstrated that volcanic/geothermal soils act as source, but also as biological filter for methane release to the atmosphere. For long time, volcanic/geothermal soils has been considered inhospitable for methanotrophic microorganisms, but new extremophile methanotrophs belonging to Verrucomicrobia were identified in three different areas (Pozzuoli, Italy; Hell’s Gate, New Zealand; Kamchatka, Russia), explaining anomalous behaviours in methane leakages of several geothermal/volcanic sites. Our aim was to increase {{the knowledge of the}} relationship between methane emissions from volcanic/geothermal areas and biological methane oxidation, by investigating a geothermal site of Pantelleria island (Italy). Pantelleria Island hosts a high enthalpy geothermal system characterized by high temperature, high CH 4 and very low H 2 S fluxes. Such characteristics are reflected in potentially great supply of methane for methanotrophs and scarce presence of inhibitors of their activity (H 2 S and NH 3) in the Pantelleria soils. Potential methanotrophic activity within these soils was already evidenced by the CH 4 /CO 2 ratio of the flux measurements which was lower than that of the respective fumarolic manifestations indicating a loss of CH 4 during the gas travel towards the earth’s surface. In this study laboratory incubation experiments using soils sampled at Favara Grande, the main hydrothermal area of Pantelleria, showed very high methane consumption rates (up to 9500 ng CH 4 h 1 g 1). Furthermore, microbiological and culture-independent molecular analyses allowed to detect the presence of methanotrophs affiliated to Gamma- and Alpha-Proteobacteria and to the newly discovered acidothermophilic methanotrophs Verrucomicrobia. Culturable methanotrophic Alpha-proteobacteria of the genus Methylocystis were isolated by enrichment cultures. The isolates showed a wide range of tolerance to pH (3. 5 – 8) and temperatures (18 – 45 C), and an average methane oxidation rate of 450 ppm/h. A larger diversity of proteobacterial and verrucomicrobial methanotrophs was detected by the amplification of the methane mono-oxygenase gene pmoA. This study demonstrates the coexistence of both the methanotrophic phyla Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria in the same geothermal site. The presence of proteobacterial methanotrophs was quite unexpected because they are generally considered not adapted to live in such harsh environments. Their presence at Favara Grande could be explained by not so low soil pH values (> 5) of this specific geothermal site and by the high methane availability. Such species could have <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> in the shallowest part of the soils, were the temperatures are not so high, thriving on the abundant upraising methane. Understanding the ecology of methanotrophy in geothermal sites will increase our knowledge of their role in methane emissions to the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from many}} systems {{has shown that}} stem cells are {{maintained}} in “niches” or specific regulatory microenvironments formed by stromal cells. The question of how stem cells are maintained in <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> is important, and further studies {{will lead to a}} better understanding of stem cell regulation and enhance the future use of stem cells in regenerative medicine. Here we show that cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is required for anchoring somatic stem cells (SSCs) to <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> in the Drosophila ovary. DE-cadherin and Armadillo/β-catenin accumulate in the junctions between SSCs and their neighboring cells, inner germarial sheath cells. Removal of DE-cadherin from SSCs results in stem cell loss in the adult ovary. Furthermore, the cadherin-mediated adhesion is also important for maintaining SSCs in <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> before adulthood. This study provides further support that SSCs are located in a niche formed by their neighboring cells. We have previously shown that DE-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is essential for anchoring germ-line stem cells to <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> in the Drosophila ovary. This study further implicates cadherin-mediated cell adhesion as a general mechanism for anchoring stem cells to <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> in a variety of systems...|$|R

40|$|It remains poorly {{understood}} how the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) {{are attracted to}} <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> and the functional consequences of such interaction. In the present study, we show that the cell cycle regulator cyclin A 1 in association with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR 1), is required for HSPC and <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> to maintain <b>their</b> function and proper interaction. In the absence of cyclin A 1, the HSPC in the BM are increased in their frequency and display an increased migratory and homing ability. Concomitantly, {{the ability of the}} endosteal and central BM niche zones to attract and home the wild-type HSPC is signiﬁcantly reduced in cyclin A 1 -null mice as compared to the wild-type controls. The impaired proliferation and homing of HSPC in the BM of cyclin A 1 -null mice are attributed to the increased density of microvessels in the endosteal and central BM niche zones, which is associated with the increased VEGFR 1 expression. Thus, modulation of cyclin A 1 and VEGFR 1 in HSPC and <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> may provide new insights into therapeutic approaches...|$|R

40|$|SummaryStem cells {{will undergo}} {{self-renewal}} to produce new stem cells {{if they are}} maintained in <b>their</b> <b>niches.</b> The regulatory mechanisms that recruit and maintain stem cells in <b>their</b> <b>niches</b> are not well understood. In Drosophila testes, a group of 12 nondividing somatic cells, called the hub, identifies the stem cell niche by producing the growth factor Unpaired (Upd). Here, we show that Rap-GEF/Rap signaling controls stem cell anchoring to the niche through regulating DE-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Loss of function of a Drosophila Rap-GEF (Gef 26) results in loss of both germline and somatic stem cells. The Gef 26 mutation specifically impairs adherens junctions at the hub-stem cell interface, which results in the stem cells “drifting away” from the niche and losing stem cell identity. Thus, the Rap signaling/E-cadherin pathway may represent one mechanism that regulates polarized niche formation and stem cell anchoring...|$|R
