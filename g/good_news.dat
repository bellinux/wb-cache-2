40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} earnings management through accretive share buyback and share price return of 220 Malaysian listed firms from year 2001 to 2008. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the market behavior on those firms that made <b>good</b> earnings <b>news</b> announcement through accretive share buyback. The 5 days Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) result shows that these firms earn positive share price return immediately after the earnings announcement day. Further, the regression result reports on the existence of positive effect of accretive share buyback on share price return. Basically, firms which announce <b>good</b> earnings <b>news</b> by meeting or beating EPS forecast through accretive share buyback earn positive share price return. In sum, investors reward firms that made positive earnings surprises or <b>good</b> earnings <b>news.</b> The <b>good</b> earnings <b>news</b> announcement is a challenge for firms in the capital market for a positive financial health and future prospect. Earnings management through accretive share buyback plays a role to achieve the <b>good</b> earnings <b>news.</b> This paper contributes on the market behavior or investors reaction on firms that deliver <b>good</b> earnings <b>news</b> through accretive share buyback...|$|R

One of the men was engaging in open-air preaching. Jenner interrupted the man to say that he would listen to the man's <b>good</b> <b>news</b> provided that he was allowed to share some <b>good</b> <b>news</b> first. The man agreed, so Jenner taught the group of Brethren how to play craps there on the pavement. One of the Brethren invited Jenner into his home for tea and told him about the gospel. Jenner converted to Christianity and, when he went home, told Jessie that she was a sinner bound for hell and therefore in need of salvation. According to Wilson's biography of Jenner, Jessie thought that Jenner had become manic or insane. They had a young daughter named Ann by this point and Jenner was gambling so much that he was not providing for his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to work on a farm, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return only when Jenner regained his sanity. On several occasions, he aggressively told Jessie's brothers that they needed to become Christians, which angered them. On one of these occasions, their conversation became physical and they began punching each other. The brothers rejected Jenner and were never reconciled to him. He wrote to his family back in England informing them of his conversion and asking them to become Christians too, but he received no reply.|$|E

5|$|In 1945 Döblin's 18-year-old son Stefan {{was called}} up for {{military}} service in the French army. That spring had brought the <b>good</b> <b>news</b> that Klaus was alive and in Switzerland after a period working for the French resistance, and the grim tidings that Wolfgang was dead, having committed suicide five years earlier. In October 1945 Alfred and Erna arrived in New York, sailing aboard the Argentine back to Europe. They first settled in Baden-Baden, where Döblin worked for the French military government as official representative {{for the office of}} public education; he was tasked with approving manuscripts for publication, and vehemently opposed the approval of any texts by authors who had sympathized with National Socialism, such as Ernst Jünger or Gottfried Benn. In postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate, Döblin was unable to draw on his earlier success as an author, yet continued his literary engagement with a series of publications and journals that aimed to rebuild Germany's intellectual and cultural life, reintroducing the literature banned by the Nazis and fostering the growth of younger writers. Despite these efforts, Döblin was disappointed by the apparent continuity between the Nazi years and the postwar climate. His growing pessimism was fueled by his sense of isolation and marginalization within the postwar German literary scene. In 1953 Alfred and Erna returned to Paris despite the invitation by Brecht and Johannes R. Becher to settle in East Berlin.|$|E

Three major aspects {{are taken into}} consideration: address forms, modality, and directness-indirectness. Theoretical issues are raised and discussed, and questionnaire data collected and analysed. Chapter I shows why it is important and necessary to study crosscultural differences and sets up {{the aims of the}} study. Chapter II deals with address forms in general and the use of address forms in conveying <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> in the Australian and Vietnamese cultural contexts in particular [...] The similarities and differences between the two systems are also discussed. Chapter III dwells on modality and its devices: modals, modality markers, subjunctive mood (in English) and lexico-modal operators for subjunctive mood (in Vietnamese). The use of these devices in communicating <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> in the two cultures is discussed in detail. Chapter IV is concerned theoretically with directness-indirectness, and the relationship between indirectness and politeness. How directness and in-directness are actually used to convey <b>good</b> and bad <b>news</b> in Australian and Vietnamese cultures is also analysed.

5|$|Marshal Augereau's arrival from Brest {{with the}} newly formed VII Corps gave the French one more piece of <b>good</b> <b>news.</b> In the Capitulation of Dornbirn on 13 November, Franjo Jelačić's {{division}} was cornered and forced to surrender. The Russians withdrew to the northeast after Mack's capitulation and Vienna fell on 12 November. The Allies were thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Austerlitz in December and Austria was permanently knocked out of the Third Coalition a few weeks later. The French victory highlighted the effectiveness of la manoeuvre sur les derrières, a special type of strategic envelopment first used by Napoleon in his Italian campaign in 1796. The maneuver called for a pinning force that would occupy a broad front of the enemy line while other supporting units positioned themselves at a specific location in the enemy's flank or rear. As the enemy became more embroiled with the pinning force, the flanking troops would attack at a critical spot and seal the victory. In the Ulm Campaign, Murat's cavalry served as the pinning force that fooled the Austrians into thinking the main French attack would come from the Black Forest. As Murat lulled the Austrians towards Ulm, the main French forces crashed through Central Germany and separated Mack's army from the other theaters of the war.|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the <b>good</b> <b>news,</b> but she has forgotten about Charming.
