5|$|Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books {{solicited}} author Margaret Atwood {{to write}} a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages {{as part of an}} international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey. She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help address <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> project.|$|E

He saw <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> penetrating exactness of a gaze vacant of all direct understanding... Each figure seems to be so perfectly enclosed within its simplified contour, for, however precise and detailed Seurat is, his passion for geometricizing never deserts him—enclosed so completely, so shut off in its partition, that no other relation than a spatial and geometrical one is any longer possible. The syntax of actual life has been broken up and replaced by Seurat's own peculiar syntax with all its strange, remote and unforeseen implications.|$|E

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review published in Esquire, music critic Robert Christgau described The Notorious Byrd Brothers as [...] "simply the best album the Byrds have ever recorded". Christgau grouped it with contemporary releases by Love (Forever Changes) and The Beach Boys (Wild Honey), remarking: [...] "t's {{hard to believe}} that so much good can come out of one place [...]" [...] In the UK, Record Mirror gave the album a rare five-star rating, commenting [...] "Hard though it was for the Byrds to follow-up their near-perfect Younger Than Yesterday album, they've done <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> fantastic disc." [...] Melody Maker was also complimentary about the album, describing it as [...] "A beautiful selection, representing US pop at its finest." [...] Beat Instrumental concluded their review by stating [...] "It's true to say that the Byrds are one of the two best groups in the world. Nobody can say any different with the proof of this album." ...|$|E
500|$|Dan Stapleton for IGN {{described}} it as [...] "a barely serviceable, paint-by-numbers third-person shooter". He wrote that both playable characters were too similar, the combat was [...] "completely generic" [...] and that errors in the animation looked clumsy with [...] "objects clipping through each other; crazy, badly lip-synced dialog (not that syncing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> corny writing would fix it); and general screwups make Star Trek play like a blooper reel." [...] Stapleton was surprised that the game continued to be playable, as he noted that several scripted events during the game failed to start as scheduled. He also felt that the mini-games throughout the game were [...] "so mind-numbingly simple and repetitive and/or frustrating they made me eager {{to get back to}} just being bored." [...] He said that the game seemed unfinished, and gave it an overall score of 4.2 out of ten. Edge magazine said that the game [...] "more bugs crawling on it than a Fear Factor contestant", and mentioned issues such as the characters running through walls, enemies becoming immortal and camera angles showing the inside of Kirk or Spock's skull. Star Trek was otherwise described as bland, even running through to the achievements with boring titles and the co-op system [...] "succumbs to awkward banter and gimmicky co-op puzzles".|$|E

500|$|King Leopold {{decided to}} give {{concessions}} of his territory to private companies who would then collect the rubber tax and export <b>it.</b> <b>With</b> <b>this</b> in mind he approached British Colonel John Thomas North, who had made a fortune through speculating on Chilean nitrates, for capital with which to fund a concession company. North agreed and provided £40,000 of the 250,000 Belgian francs' (fr) initial investment. As a result, the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (informally known as Abir) was established at Antwerp on 6 August 1892. The company was divided into 2,000 shares of 500 fr value each. British investors (including North) held 1880 shares whilst Belgians held the remaining 120 shares. In addition to the 2,000 ordinary shares there were 2,000 [...] "actions" [...] which entitled the holder to {{a share of the}} profits after a 6% dividend was paid to the shareholders. The Congo Free State was the holder of 1,000 of these actions. In return Abir received exclusive rights to all forest products from the Maringa-Lopori basin for 30 years and all land within twenty miles of eight designated posts and had police powers within the limits of the concession. The Free State also had to supply guns, ammunition and soldiers to help establish the posts. In preparation two State employees were ordered to establish a headquarters for Abir at Basankusu but this was barely begun before the local villagers rebelled against State rule and killed both men.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with <b>it.</b> <b>With</b> <b>this,</b> it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Hurricanes' {{regular season}} opener on Boxing Day 2015, Clinkscales added 13 points to help {{overcome}} the Moncton Miracles. He {{went on to}} break the double-digit scoring mark on January 23, 2016, in a victory against the Island Storm, when he had ten points and a game-high seven assists. On January 28, Clinkscales posted his first double-double of the season, with a season-best 18 points and ten assists in a loss to the Saint John Mill Rats. The Hurricanes were unable to rally from a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit. Clinkscales had another double-double on February 14 against the Orangeville A's, recording ten points and ten assists to push Halifax to a 125–89 win. He also notched four steals, {{which would be a}} season high. On March 10, playing point guard, he scored 18 points once again, along with ten assists, as the Hurricanes captured only their second win of the season, over the Mill Rats. Two games later, on March 18, Clinkscales recorded 10 points, 16 assists, and seven rebounds—season bests for the latter two categories. His team won the game in overtime against the A's. Halifax entered the playoffs with a league-best 29–11 record, and they eventually returned to the NBL Canada Finals. On June 14, the Hurricanes won the championship over the London Lightning, prevailing in the series 4–3. Clinkscales scored nine points and passed a team-high nine assists in the victory. His role as a leader within the squad was evidenced by his directing of the crowd at the Scotiabank Centre. He remarked, [...] "It feels great to get <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> group of guys." [...] Clinkscales finished the season averaging 6.9 points, 8.0 assists, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.4 steals per game. In mid-August 2016, he announced through his Twitter account that he would not return to the Hurricanes during the 2016–17 season. He also considered beginning a coaching career.|$|E

2500|$|Stevin's aim was {{to bring}} about a second age of wisdom, in which mankind would have {{recovered}} all of its earlier knowledge.

The other reason was that he wanted his works to be practically useful to people who had not mastered the common scientific language of the time, Latin.
