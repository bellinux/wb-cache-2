5|$|The {{character}} of Khan required five costumes, {{more than any}} other guest star in the entire series. This meant that the staff working on costumes had less time to devote to any one costume. Montalbán's athletic physique was such that when his measurements were passed to them, staff thought there had been a mistake. Costume designer William Ware Theiss found it challenging to produce the outfits in the time allotted, to make the materials seem suitably futuristic and to fit his own preferences in design. Two of Khan's outfits re-used previous costumes, while three were specifically created for Montalbán. The production built two new sets for the episode: the decompression chamber in sickbay, and the set on board Botany Bay. A <b>doorframe</b> from that set was later reused as an overhead unit in McCoy's research lab, which appeared later in the series.|$|E
25|$|The archaic Mauryan Stupas {{discovered}} {{in and around}} Goalpara district are the earliest examples (c. 300BC to c. 100AD) of ancient art and architectural works. The remains {{discovered in}} Daparvatiya (Doporboteeya) archaeological site with a beautiful <b>doorframe</b> in Tezpur are identified as {{the best examples of}} art works in ancient Assam with influence of Sarnath School of Art of the late Gupta period.|$|E
25|$|Styled after how {{airports}} handle passenger services, besides having escalators and lifts, {{the proposed}} facility will have shopping malls, food plazas, entertainment and recreation centres. The plan also includes vertical {{expansion of the}} station by constructing platforms on different floors. This would enable the railways to make maximum benefit of the built up area. Segregation of arriving and departing commuters to minimise conflicting movement, and integration of the proposed integrated bus terminus (IBT) and metro services to facilitate travel of passengers, will be key ingredients in the upgrade. The current security apparatus at the station — CCTVs, <b>doorframe</b> metal detectors, hand-held sensors and other detection equipment-might be overhauled {{to fit into the}} new scheme of things. Centralised lighting, seating areas, waiting rooms, retiring rooms and internet kiosks would be upgraded.|$|E

500|$|Most of the game's {{missions}} {{take place}} in third-person shooting format, combined {{with the use of}} a cover system. When a character is behind a low object like a crate, or at the edge of a corner or <b>doorframe,</b> they can press a button to use the object or edge as cover. Another button will allow the character to peer around and enter a targeting mode, while releasing the button will quickly return them to cover. There is also a stealth mode which has the character stoop, walk silently (unless running), duck behind any low obstacles they can hide behind and be less detectable by sound. A character can sneak up behind an enemy using stealth mode and perform a silent [...] "stealth takedown" [...] by breaking his neck.|$|E
2500|$|For export, Suzuki {{transformed}} the Cervo into the SC100, first introduced in April 1978. The SC100 {{was known in}} the UK by the nickname [...] "Whizzkid". The three-cylinder engine {{was replaced by a}} rear-mounted 970cc four-cylinder F10A engine (later used in the SJ410) developing [...] Top speed was [...] in a contemporary test. The body differed from the Cervo's in that the windshield was not as steeply raked, necessitating a different <b>doorframe</b> and side window as well. Square headlights were used in European markets, with either round or square ones used elsewhere. In European markets the grille incorporated the chunky indicator lenses, which were normally positioned in a space underneath the bumper – these openings were blanked with plastic grilles.|$|E
60|$|He {{led the way}} up {{the narrow}} {{creaking}} stairs to a door on the first landing standing partly open; before it hung a wet chintz curtain, preventing their seeing into the room. Her conductor tapped lightly on the <b>doorframe,</b> and presently the wet curtain was moved aside by Constance, who greeted her visitor with a glad smile while giving him her hand, but the darkness of the small landing, which had no light from above, prevented her from seeing Fan for some moments.|$|E

50|$|Eight days later, {{following}} these two extensive searches by {{a total of}} 26 trained detectives, the pen was found on the <b>doorframe</b> in Ishikawa’s kitchen. Both court decisions, that of the Tokyo High Court and the Supreme Court, state that the first 26 detectives had simply overlooked the <b>doorframe,</b> but their reasons for why this happened differ. The Tokyo High Court said that it was because the location was too obvious, while the Supreme Court maintained that short people would have difficulty seeing the top of the <b>doorframe.</b> The <b>doorframe</b> is approximately 1.83 meters (6 feet) tall; there is a picture of the kitchen taken immediately following the second search that shows a small stepladder in front of the door.|$|E

50|$|A veteran {{police detective}} has testified {{that it is}} unthinkable that trained police {{investigators}} would have overlooked a bright pink pen on a relatively low <b>doorframe,</b> and even more unthinkable that such a thing could happen twice. The investigators called to search Ishikawa’s house were the top professionals from the area. By the time Ishikawa was arrested, the case had already become a scandal, and the police were doing {{whatever it took to}} find the culprit. They spared no cost or personnel in conducting as thorough a search as possible. Furthermore, the <b>doorframe</b> is mentioned in all standard police detective textbooks as a routine location to search.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{tradition}} was that Van Arrsens built {{the core of}} the house, the discovery in 1984 that the Hyrne family seal was impressed into some of the bricks around a <b>doorframe</b> made it clear that Hyrne played a role in building the original house.|$|E
50|$|The Series 9 to Series 11 {{locomotives}} were visually {{indistinguishable from}} each other, {{but could be}} distinguished from all earlier models by the rainwater drainage holes on their lower sides. These holes were usually covered by so-called buckets, but the covers were absent on a few locomotives. Another distinction was the end doors, which were recessed into the <b>doorframes</b> on Series 9 to Series 11 locomotives, compared to earlier models which had their end doors flush with the <b>doorframes.</b> In addition, on Series 9 and later, the split side window on the driver's assistant side {{was replaced by a}} single rectangular side window with rounded corners. Finally, unlike all earlier models, all four doors on Series 9 to Series 11 locomotives had rounded corners.|$|R
50|$|However, this splendour {{was not to}} last. Faults in its constructions and {{inheritance}} problems led to a rapid degradation. By {{the time}} of the French Revolution the castle was already crumbling and many houses in the village today show evidence of plundering of the site for building materials, particularly <b>doorframes</b> and windows.|$|R

5000|$|Among {{the many}} Venetian {{buildings}} {{in the village of}} Amnatos, there is a house with a particularly impressive <b>doorframe.</b> The crown of the gable has the inscription: [...] "INITIUM SAPIENTE TIMOR DOMINI" [...] (in English: [...] "The Beginning of Wisdom is Fear of the Lord").|$|E
50|$|The farm at Ponikve nos. 88 and 89, {{east of the}} village, {{consists}} of a house and outbuildings, including a cellar and a double hayrack, arranged in a cluster. The farmhouse has a partially preserved smoke kitchen and the year 1876 is carved into the <b>doorframe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the walls}} are {{plastered}} and floors are of concrete. The remains of a fireplace, window frames and <b>doorframe</b> heads are evident. Piles of stones {{on the western side}} of the homestead building may be the remains of outbuildings. Evidence also exists of cattle yards approximately seventy-five metres further west.|$|E
50|$|Police locks are {{particularly}} associated with New York City in the 20th century, and are sometimes seen in movies set {{in that place}} and time. Floor-mounted types were designed for use with wooden doors and have been superseded {{with the advent of}} metal doors and <b>doorframes.</b> A copy of the original crossbar type of police lock is still made and imported from China.|$|R
50|$|The Gillioz Theatre is a {{historic}} theatre located at Springfield, Greene County, Missouri. It was built by M. E. Gillioz of Monett, Missouri. Mr. Gillioz was {{in the business of}} building bridges, and the theater was built with steel and concrete. Wood was only used for handrails, doors, and <b>doorframes.</b> The original cost of the building was $300,000. Renovation costs totaled approximately $1.9 million.|$|R
25|$|The letter Shin {{is often}} {{inscribed on the}} case {{containing}} a mezuzah, a scroll of parchment with Biblical text written on it. The text contained in the mezuzah is the Shema Yisrael prayer, which calls the Israelites to love their God with all their heart, soul and strength. The mezuzah is situated upon all the <b>doorframes</b> in a home or establishment. Sometimes the whole word Shaddai will be written.|$|R
50|$|When fitting a {{standard}} door chain featuring a linear slide, {{it is imperative}} that it not allow the door to open sufficiently for a person's hand to reach through the gap between the door and the <b>doorframe,</b> as otherwise the door chain could be quickly opened from the outside by an intruder.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1744 for Ezekiel, by his father Joseph. It is a 2-1/2 story {{building}} with a chimney {{in the center of}} the building, typical of construction of that era. The front <b>doorframe</b> is in the Federal style. The entrance way, and panelled doors were not constructed for this house, but taken from a house in Litchfield.|$|E
50|$|Another type of lock {{also called}} a police lock and also {{formerly}} {{made by the}} Fox Police Lock Company is the crossbar police lock. It features two steel bars across {{the width of the}} door and beyond, held by two brackets set in the <b>doorframe.</b> When the door is unlocked, the bars are moved inwards {{to the point of being}} withdrawn from the brackets.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the ancient shrine was erected over a Swayambhu Lingam (that is the self emanated Shiva Lingam). It can be observed that the Lingam is exactly at {{the centre of the}} floor of the Garbagriham (the Sanctum Sanctorum) of the temple. Intricate carvings of divine beings, interspersed with human figurines adorn the pillars and the <b>doorframes</b> of the temple. Scenes from mythology find themselves captured in these magnificent carvings.|$|R
50|$|The facades are {{a collage}} of planes and lines whose {{components}} are purposely detached from, and seem to glide past, one another. This enabled the provision of several balconies. Like Rietveld's Red and Blue Chair, each component has its own form, position and colour. Colours were chosen as to strengthen the plasticity of the facades; surfaces in white and shades of grey, black window and <b>doorframes,</b> {{and a number of}} linear elements in primary colours.|$|R
2500|$|The building’s main {{entrance}} {{leads to the}} second floor offices. [...] The entrance is the buildings most decorative architectural feature. [...] The wooden <b>doorframes</b> are hand carved. [...] There is a stained glass transom above the entrance with a “Bend Bee” design in the middle. [...] The Bend Bee design is set in blue with a white border. [...] Above the entrance on the outside, there is a plaster cornucopia garland of flowers, fruits, and wheat stocks.|$|R
