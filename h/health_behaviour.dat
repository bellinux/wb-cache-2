40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} a behavioural {{model of}} the relation between social factors and obesity, in which differences in body mass index (BMI) across sociodemographic groups were hypothesized to be attributable to social group differences in <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> affecting energy expenditure (physical activity, diet and alcohol consumption and weight control). METHODS: A total of 8667 adults who participated in the 1995 Australian National Health and Nutrition Surveys provided data on a range of health factors including objectively measured height and weight, <b>health</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and social factors including family status, employment status, housing situation and migration status. RESULTS: Social factors remained significant predictors of BMI after controlling for all <b>health</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Neither social factors alone, nor <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> alone, adequately explained the variance in BMI. Gender-specific interactions were found between social factors and individual <b>health</b> <b>behaviours.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that social factors moderate the relation between BMI and weight-related behaviours, and that the mechanisms underlying sociodemographic group differences in obesity may vary among men and women. Additional factors are likely to act in conjunction with current <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> to explain variation in obesity prevalence across sociodemographic groups. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} Canadian data {{to examine whether}} the {{relationships}} between two <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> (physical activity and smoking) and two measures of health (self-perceived health status and number of chronic health conditions) are conditional on income adequacy. Studies that have investigated {{the manner in which}} socioeconomic circumstances, such as income adequacy, and <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> interact to influence health are few in number and characterized by inconsistent findings. In addition, there is a complete absence of published Canadian research that has explored these relationships. I investigated the relationship between <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and <b>health</b> by income adequacy with a secondary analysis of data from the first cycle of the National Population Health Survey (NPHS), conducted by Statistics Canada in 1994 - 95. The sample consisted of 11, 941 NPHS respondents 20 - 64 years of age who did not have an illness or disability that prevented them from being employed. As a whole, findings from a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses did not provide adequate evidence to conclude that the effects of physical activity and smoking on self-perceived health status and chronic health conditions are conditional on income adequacy. Instead, findings showed that the <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> each had a similar degree of influence on the self-perceived health status and number of chronic health conditions of respondents at all income adequacy levels. Moreover, the magnitude of the relationships between the <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and <b>health</b> measures was very small. By enhancing knowledge about both the nature and magnitude of the relationships among Canadians' income adequacy, <b>health</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and <b>health,</b> this study makes a significant contribution to the small body of research that has explored the possibility that the relationship between <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and <b>health</b> varies by socioeconomic circumstances.

40|$|Abstract Background Variability in <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> is an {{important}} cause of socioeconomic health disparities. Socioeconomic differences in <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> are poorly understood. Previous studies have examined whether (single) stressors or psychosocial resources mediate the relationship between socioeconomic position and health or mortality. This study examined: 1) whether the presence of stressors {{and the absence of}} resources can be represented by a single underlying factor, and co-occur among those with lower education, 2) whether stressors and resources mediated the relation between education and <b>health</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and 3) addressed the question whether an aggregate measure of stressors and resources has an added effect over the use of individual measures. Methods Questionnaire data on sociodemographic variables, stressors, resources, and <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> were collected cross-sectionally among inhabitants (n = 3050) of a medium-sized Dutch city (Utrecht). Descriptive statistics and bootstrap analyses for multiple-mediator effects were used to examine the role of stressors and resources in mediating educational associations with <b>health</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Results Higher levels of stressors and lower levels of resources could be represented by a single underlying factor, and co-occurred among those with lower educational levels. Stressors and resources partially mediated the relationship between education and four health- behaviours (exercise, breakfast frequency, vegetable consumption and smoking). Financial stress and poor perceived health status were mediating stressors, and social support a strong mediating resource. An aggregate measure of the stressors and resources showed similar associations with <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> compared to the summed individual measures. Conclusions Lower educated groups are simultaneously affected by the presence of various stressors and absence of multiple resources, which partially explain socioeconomic differences in <b>health</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Compared to the direct associations of stressors and resources with <b>health</b> <b>behaviours,</b> the association with socioeconomic status was modest. Therefore, besides addressing structural inequalities, interventions promoting financial management, coping with chronic disease, and social skills training have the potential to benefit large parts of the population, most notably the lower educated. Further research is needed to clarify how stressors and resources impact <b>health</b> <b>behaviours,</b> why this differs between behaviours and how these disparities could be alleviated. </p...|$|R
40|$|PhDHealth {{inequality}} {{according to}} socioeconomic status has been established. There is evidence for inequality for self-reported oral health outcomes. There has been interest in exploring {{the factors that}} explain general health inequality such as <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and psychological factors. However, {{few studies have examined}} whether oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and psychological factors explain oral health inequality among adults from industrialised countries. The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and psychological factors explain inequality in self-reported oral health among Iranian adolescents. This study tested four conditions according to the hypothesis of mediation; the final condition is that adjusting for the mediating factors attenuates the relationship between socioeconomic status and oral health. A questionnaire was used to collect data on four sets of variables from 639 males and females aged 15 - 17 studying at secondary schools in Sanandaj, Iran: socioeconomic status, oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviours,</b> psychological factors, and self-reported oral health outcomes. Indicators of socioeconomic status were subjective socioeconomic status, wealth index, motherâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆fs education and fatherâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆fs education. Oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> were toothbrushing, dental flossing, and visiting dentist. Psychological factors were selfesteem, depression, and anxiety. Self-reported oral health outcomes were single item self-rated oral health, and the experience of dental pain. Several regression models were conducted to examine the four conditions of the hypothesis of mediation. This study found a graded relationship between indicators of socioeconomic status and self-reported oral health outcomes, but no strong evidence to support the hypothesis that oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and psychological factors mediate oral health inequality for self-reported oral health outcomes. Adjustment for oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and psychological factors led to only small changes in the associations between socioeconomic status and self-reported oral health outcomes. In conclusion, oral <b>health</b> <b>behaviours</b> and psychological factors explained a little extent of oral health inequality for self-reported oral health outcomes...|$|R

5000|$|A {{concern has}} also been raised that fear appeals serve to {{contribute}} to the widening of health disparities. This is because certain individuals are more likely to develop the maladaptive responses mentioned above. Empirical research suggests that fear appeals work best for individuals with high levels of self-efficacy, and that maladaptive responses are more likely in those with low self-efficacy. This means that fear appeals work best for those who are equipped, both physically and psychologically, to take appropriate action. Individuals who do not have the resources for <b>health</b> <b>behaviour</b> change are often those who already have negative health status. For example, people who regularly engage in behaviours which are damaging to health (e.g. smoking and other drug use) have been found to typically have lower self-efficacy than others. [...] Therefore, it seems that, in addition to having the potential to cause harm, this harm is more likely to affect groups that would most benefit from <b>health</b> <b>behaviour</b> change, therefore contributing to the widen of health disparities.|$|E
