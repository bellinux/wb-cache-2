5000|$|At first, {{there was}} a Jewish prayer room. In 1808, a synagogue was built on Lauergasse. After it grew too small to serve the burgeoning Jewish {{community}} in the 19th century, the community decided in 1860 {{to build a new}} synagogue at the town’s bleachfield on what is now called Saarstraße. From the earliest time during which donations were being gathered comes a report from the magazine Der Israelitische Volkslehrer published in October 1860:Meisenheim. This time, the local community has celebrated a very nice matnat yad. After using considerable sums to expand and beautify the graveyard two years ago, and one year ago, for the rabbi’s maintenance, correspondingly voting for a payrise for him, it granted over the last few festive days the sum of 2,000 Rhenish guilders to build a new synagogue. The one used until now was {{at the time of its}} founding 52 years ago was reckoned on a much smaller membership and even about 12 years ago became bereft of light as its neighbouring properties on all sides were built up; so that, seen from the point of view of the demands for better taste, it lacked light, air and room. Anyone who knows the local community’s circumstances will not consider this willingness to make sacrifices slight and will not refuse the community’s goodwill the fullest approval. Of course, this sum is still not enough and it is hoped all the more that there will be outside help, as people here never stood idly by when a call for help came from outside. The earlier synagogue was torn down a few years later. The new building was to become a representative building. The financing - costs reached 15,200 Rhenish guilders - could be ensured with a bit of effort. On 3 August 1866, the consecration of the new synagogue, designed by architect Heinrich Krausch, took place. It had seating for 160 worshippers. It was equipped with, among other things, six Torah scrolls, elaborate Torah ornamentation, silver candlesticks, an organ and a library. The prayer books were kept in six lecterns. Outwardly, it was a six-axis aisleless building with a three-floor façade with twin towers. On Kristallnacht (9-10 November 1938), the Meisenheim synagogue sustained considerable damage. All doors, windows and great parts of the galleries were reduced to rubble and a fire was set, although this was quickly quenched once the Brownshirt thugs realized that one of the neighbouring buildings was an SA house. The synagogue, however, was not torn down as so many others were, although the upper levels of the twin towers were removed in 1940. In the time of the Second World War, the building was mainly used as an industrial works, quite contrary to its originally intended purpose, and thereafter as a municipal storehouse. From 1951 on, it was a private storehouse for <b>grain,</b> <b>fodder</b> and fertilizer. In a conversion, the remnants of the women’s galleries were torn out, the windows were walled up and upper floors were built inside. In 1982, the building was placed under monumental protection. In 1985, the Meisenheim Synagogue Sponsorship and Promotional Association was founded, which acquired the former synagogue the following year and had it restored. On 9 November 1988 - fifty years to the day after Kristallnacht - the former synagogue building was opened to the public as the Haus der Begegnung (“House of Meeting”). This new name corresponds to the literal meaning of the Hebrew term for “synagogue”: [...] (beyt knesset, literally “house of assembly”). On the upper floor, as a visible reminder of the former synagogue, a glass window by the Israeli artist Ruth van de Garde-Tichauer was installed. The window was created with technical assistance from Karl-Heinz Brust from Kirn. The window’s content is the return of the Twelve Tribes of Israel to Jerusalem based on the text from the Amidah ( [...] ; Tefilat HaAmidah “The Standing Prayer”), also called the Shmoneh Esreh ( [...] ; “The Eighteen”): “Sound the great shofar for our freedom; raise a banner to gather our exiles, and bring us together from the four corners of the earth into our land.” In a decision taken on 21 May 1997, the synagogue building received the protection of the Hague Convention as a cultural property especially worthy of protection. Since 1999, above the entrance, has been a Star of David made of Jerusalem limestone, endowed by the Bad Kreuznach district’s partner town in Israel, Kiryat Motzkin. The former synagogue’s address in Meisenheim is Saarstraße 3.|$|E

The {{study indicated that}} the interactions of sowing date x genotype, fertility x genotype and protection x genotype were important considerations for increased rabi sorghum productivity. This was true since the three genotypes had different response across management treatments in that differences in leaf area index, total dry weight, resource use and use efficiency as well as yield and yield components in M 35 - 1 and Swathi were small at early and normal planting, but these parameters were significantly enhanced in IC 94004 when it was sown early. On the otherhand, yield and yield components in IC 94004 and M 35 - 1 significantly responded to increased fertility levels (to F 3) than in Swathi (to F 2). The response of genotypes to protection when normally sown was significantly greater in IC 94004 than either genotypes, indicating that when sowing was delayed to normal, protection was necessary in IC 94004, but not necessarily so with M 35 - 1 or Swathi.

Juice extract yields from the stems were not significantly related to grain yields. The differences in stover fodder quality traits were significant: nitrogen content ranged from 0. 44 to 0. 72 % in hybrids and from 0. 50 to 0. 89 % in varieties while in vitro digestibility ranged from 43. 8 to 54. 5 % in hybrids and from 48. 8 to 54. 8 % in varieties. Differences in in vitro digestibility of bagasse plus stripped leaves were also substantial, ranging from 39. 3 to 49. 1 % in hybrids and from 42. 0 to 50. 4 % in varieties. The palatability of bagasse and stripped leaves to cattle was investigated by incorporation of the distillery residues of one sweet sorghum variety into a commercial feed block, replacing the traditionally used (non sweet) sorghum stover.

Nearly 35000 landraces collected from 87 countries are being maintained at ICRISAT Asia Center, Hyderabad, India. - Initial attempts to breed sorghum were in understanding inheritance of several morphological traits based on mendelian factors and breeding for specific adaptation. The establishment of All India Coordinated Sorghum Improvement Project in 1970, and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics with sorghum as one of its mandate crop in 1972 and the initiation of conversion program in USA in early part of 1960 s demonstrated that wide adaptability and high yield can be combined and also produced materials which contributed well to several national programs in the SAT. Recurrent selection methods adopted with the help of genetic male sterile genes were not as effective as pedigree/backcross methods to achieve high yield. Discovery of genetic-cytoplasmic male sterility in 1954 enabled hybrid seed production cost effective, and it was established soon that hybrids were superior to varieties across all ranges of environments. Several high yielding hybrids were produced and released. Soon, lack of resistance to various yield constraints was recognized. Current research portfolios involve breeding of male-sterile and restorer lines in diversified cytoplasmic background for resistance to various yield constraints with high <b>grain</b> <b>fodder</b> yield. The goal is to produce high yielding resistant cultivars.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a model fo further consideration and for testing {{by means of}} specific archaeological evidence. Starting from the needs of farming communities in proceeds {{to the definition of}} their settlement areas as consisting not only of dwelling sites and cemeteries (the two kids of "sites" of traditional archaeology) but also of places of storage (<b>grain,</b> <b>fodder</b> for domestic animals, raw materials, fuel etc.) and of agricultural production (fields and fallows, pasture lands, places for collecting fodder, hunting, fishing and gathering). There must have been other areas not directly connected with agriculture (extraction of raw materials, deposition of the dead, other ritual activities etc.) The influence of natural conditions upon the selection of settlement areas is discussed (geomorphological, hydrogeological, pedological factors, climate etc.). It is suggested that the probable way of selecting individual settlement areas in prehistory was based on plant indicators. Dwelling areas were surrounded by the other kinds of areas; this seems to be the basis of the repeatedly observed fact that sites from different periods tend to cluster in a limited number of places. At the same time large tracts of land remain free of easily detectable traces of the presence of prehistoric farmers; these may the places of production areas (fields, fallows etc.). The density of settlement areas in Central Europe, however, is remarkable the average distance to the nearest site of the same archacological age being from two to three kilometers in most instances. Judging from the size of villages and from the average distance among them, individual settlement areas were inhabited by a few families each (several ten persons at most). Thus, they were small but distributed densely. This general pattern of settlement did not change during the greater part of later prehistory (beginning with the Neolithic period). The core of settlement areas (consisting of the village, fields and fallows) must have been almost permanently deforested and the surrounding mixed oak forest reduced by the pasture of domestic animals. Recent rescue excavations in NW Bohemia covering several square kilometers revealed that many settlement areas had been inhabited almost continuosly. Some of the archaeological periods, however, are represented by scarce evidence, a fact usually due to the differing probability of the survival of archacological record. All the areas need not have been exploited at the same time; the temporarily free ones could have been used by neighbouring communities as a reserve either in the case of devastation of their former areas by intensive farming {{or in the case of}} population increase. Also, they could have been used as pasture lands.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Sorghum is {{the fifth}} most {{important}} cereal crop {{in the world and}} ranks third in Africa, and it is potentially the number one cereal for the semi-arid environments in sub-Saharan Africa. Sorghum varieties have been developed specifically for <b>grain,</b> <b>fodder</b> or stem sugar but not for dual-purpose combining grain and stem sugar. Such varieties could be beneficial to the resource-poor farmers by providing grain for food and sugar rich stalks that can be sold for bioethanol production. However, there are no suitable dual-purpose cultivars on the market. There is also limited information about the combining ability, gene action and genetic effects and relationships between stem sugar and grain yield which is required in devising appropriate strategies for developing dual-purpose sorghum varieties. Furthermore, there is also lack of information about the perceptions of resource-poor, small-scale farmers and other important stakeholders on the potential of dual-purpose sorghum production and the value chain. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (i) investigate the awareness of the farmers, industry and other stakeholders on the dual-purpose sorghum varietal development and its feasibility, (ii) screen germplasm for use as source materials useful for grain yield and stem sugar traits, (iii) investigate the inheritance and heterosis levels attainable in grain yield components and stem sugar traits in dual-purpose sorghums, (iv) determine the relationships between stem sugar traits and grain yield components in dual-purpose sorghums, and (v) investigate the fertility restoration capacities of selected male-fertile lines used as male parents through the evaluating seed set in experimental dual-purpose hybrids. Two surveys were conducted to establish stakeholders’ level of awareness and perceptions on the potential and feasibility of developing and utilising dual-purpose sorghums in Southern Africa. One survey was carried out in the semi-arid tropical lowlands in Zimbabwe under the conditions of small-scale and resource-poor farmers while the other, which targeted sugar industries, plant breeders, engineers, political leaders, economists and extension workers, was conducted in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Data were analysed using SPSS computer package. Results showed that both farmers and the non-farmer stakeholders were in agreement on the view that dual-purpose sorghum would be a viable enterprise that could alleviate poverty, enhance food security, create rural employment and boost rural development in southern African countries. Farmers were willing to adopt the cultivars if they were made available. The stakeholders also suggested mechanisms to overcome the infrastructural, economic and technical challenges associated with the technology. Screening of regional and international germplasm collection held at the University of KwaZulu- Natal in South Africa revealed high genetic variability for grain yield, stem brix and stem biomass yield that can be exploited in dual-purpose sorghum cultivar development. Ten lines were selected for inclusion as parents in the dual-purpose sorghum breeding programme. The selections were crossed to eight cytoplasmic male-sterile lines originating from the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in accordance with a North Carolina Design II mating scheme. The 18 parents, together with the 80 experimental hybrids generated and two check varieties were evaluated for grain yield and stem sugar traits in six tropical low- and mid-altitude environments in Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Stem sugar concentration and stem biomass were measured at the hard dough stage of each entry due to maturity differences between the genotypes. Grain yield was measured and adjusted to 12. 5 % moisture content. Data were analysed in GenStat computer package following a fixed effects model. Both additive and non-additive gene effects were important in controlling stem brix, stem biomass, grain yield and the associated traits in dual-purpose sorghum. This showed that breeding progress can be achieved through hybridisation and selection. Cultivars showing high stability, and high standard and better-parent heterosis for the three traits were identified implying that breeding for general adaptation was an option and that productivity could be enhanced by breeding hybrid cultivars. The relationships between traits were estimated using correlation and path-coefficients analysis. Grain yield was found to be negatively and significantly associated with stem brix but was positively and significantly associated with stem biomass. This implied that breeding for high stem brix might compromise grain yield but selection for high stem biomass improved grain yield. Stem biomass and stem brix were not significantly correlated. The general negative relationship between grain and stem brix was attributed to the predominance of entries with contrasting performances for the two traits. However, the relationship between grain yield and stem brix of the top 20 performing entries showed a non-significant relationship between stem brix and grain yield suggesting that the traits were independent of each other. This finding was confirmed by the presence of crosses that combined high performance for both stem brix and grain yield as well as stem biomass among the hybrids. The relationships between stem brix and stem biomass for the top 20 performers remained non-significant while that between stem biomass and grain yield became stronger, positive and significant. Direct selection for stem brix and grain yield was shown to be more important than indirect selection, while selection for stem biomass improves grain yield but had no effect on stem brix. Therefore, it is possible to breed dualpurpose sorghum cultivars and the identification of genotypes combining the desirable traits is prudent in addition to general relationships information. The study on fertility restoration capacities as evaluated through hybrid seed set showed that fertility restoration was under the control of genes with both additive and non-additive action. Since restoration is conferred by a single dominant gene (Rf 1), this could have arisen from the action of the modifier genes that have been previously reported to influence it. This showed that fertility restoration can be improved through breeding. Hybrid combinations showing complete seed set and high performance for grain, stem brix and stem biomass were identified and are potential dual-purpose sorghum cultivars. Overall, the study showed that development of dualpurpose sorghum cultivars would be feasible and genotypes identified as potential cultivars in this study will be forwarded for further testing across many sites and seasons in the target environments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A Zea may is an {{important}} cereal crop. To nourish human and livestock, {{it is very important}} that the quality of maize <b>grain</b> and <b>fodder</b> must be higher. A study was conducted to evaluate maize accessions for <b>grain</b> and <b>fodder</b> quality traits. Results indicated that higher heritability was found for nutrient detergent fiber, fodder cellulose, fodder crude fiber, fodder crude and fodder moisture percentage while genetic advance was higher for fodder cellulose, fodder crude protein and fodder ash percentage. High significant genotypic and phenotypic correlation was found among grain protein, oil and starch percentage, nutrient detergent fiber, fodder cellulose, fodder crude fiber & protein and fodder moisture percentage. The higher cumulative additive effect was recorded for acid detergent fiber, fodder crude fiber; nutrient detergent fiber and fodder cellulose suggested that selections may be made to develop synthetic varieties for better quality. Higher dominance effect and degree of dominance indicated that selection may be useful for the development of good quality maize hybrids through heterosis breeding programme.
