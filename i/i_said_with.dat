60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> {{professional}} gravity {{that given}} a few perfectly quiet nights (rare on that coast) it could certainly be done.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a desperate}} chance," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> an inward tremor {{that was much}} like faint-heartedness, and he replied laughingly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am going}} on to Hornberg,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> mixed {{feminine}} guile and commercial strategy; 'still, if your friend wishes to look----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{prevented}} It; <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that, <b>with</b> {{my knowledge of}} my uncle's intentions, I could never feel justified in consenting to sign the lease." ...|$|R
6000|$|How {{beautiful}} she looked, {{standing there}} with her eyes so near to mine! [...] "Tell me why, Edra?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> still <b>with</b> a lingering apprehension.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{advancing}} <b>with</b> Haberton, [...] "this officer will {{be pleased}} to serve you {{if it is in}} his power. I trust that it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{thought the}} beaten track and wide road were the {{dangerous}} ones,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> more lightness, perhaps, than suited the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't {{look like}} that, Miriam!' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> a little shiver. 'You {{seem to be}} looking at {{something}} a thousand miles away!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> {{the relief}} that one feels in not having put a fellow-creature out of life, even conditionally.|$|E
60|$|Thereupon, his vanity {{being all}} aroused, the Chevalier set himself to {{paraphrase}} all that <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>with</b> a heat that cast mine into a miserable insignificance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> pausing <b>with</b> the brandy-bottle in one hand, and {{the flask}} in the other. [...] "That's my name; I'm Jones. Can I do {{anything}} for you, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beastly hot for scuffling," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> white <b>with</b> anger. [...] "I don't {{know whether}} I'm so keen on kissing you, Sybil, after all. I {{just thought you}} wanted me to." ...|$|R
60|$|This <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> {{a corner}} of my eye in the usual quarter, towards the arts, little dreaming what destiny was to provide.|$|E
6000|$|I {{could stand}} it no longer. 'Mr. Hitchcock,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> dignity, 'I haven't the remotest idea {{what on earth}} you are talking about.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>With</b> the Spirit. As {{the apostle}} saith, [...] "I will pray with the Spirit, and--with the understanding" [...] (1 Cor 14:15).|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see why {{you should}} call it absurd," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> smiling <b>with</b> an air of superiority. [...] "I arrived here in a {{perfectly}} comfortable condition, neither heated nor wearied." ...|$|R

60|$|I believe <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> all <b>I</b> can, and <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> it <b>with</b> {{the deepest}} {{interest}} for your welfare.|$|R
6000|$|... “And you?” <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> sudden solicitude. “You {{must be very}} tired. You {{have worked}} hard and nobly. I am proud of you, Maud.” ...|$|E
60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>With</b> the Spirit. As {{the apostle}} saith, I will pray with the Spirit, {{and with the}} understanding. 1 Cor. xiv. 15.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll {{persuade him}} to come!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> confidence--thinking [...] "it would take all my powers of persuasion to keep him away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jerry!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{speaking}} <b>with</b> difficulty {{because of}} heavy breathing after having run so fast. [...] "The Avenger is close at hand; {{she is the}} craft we saw! Something must have gone wrong!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> it <b>with</b> splendid confidence; for in {{that moment}} the very twin of that grand New Haven dog loafed into the room, and I saw that Irishman's eye light eloquently with pride and affection.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> this <b>with</b> a sort {{of desperate}} resolution, tempted by the opportunity, and the {{direction}} the discourse had taken. When it was uttered, I repented of my temerity, and almost trembled to hear the answer.|$|R
6000|$|It seemed nebulous: it did {{not seem}} to say {{anything}} about the difficulty in hand--how non-existent matter can propagate illusions. <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> some hesitancy: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> a laugh, and {{bounding}} down to {{the front}} gate, where I had left my bicycle, I mounted and rode away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> enthusiasm, [...] "by {{means of}} the {{telephone}} we could talk to anybody, call up anybody, and talk at any distance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Good-bye,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{extending}} my own. 'It is {{not that}} I am displeased with you; {{but there is no}} place in this expedition for--let us say, the Señorita Phoebe.' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> this <b>with</b> a smile, trying to smooth the thing for him. 'May you have better luck, companero.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am again {{thrown on}} your hospitality, sir," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{flushing}} <b>with</b> pleasure at this friendliness. For I admired and respected the man greatly. [...] "And I fear I {{have been a}} burden and trouble {{to you and your}} family." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{named one}} state, Harris named another. We agreed upon one thing, however--that {{the young girl}} with the party was very beautiful, and very tastefully dressed. But we {{disagreed}} as to her age. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> she was eighteen, Harris said she was twenty. The dispute between us waxed warm, and <b>I</b> finally <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> a pretense of being in earnest: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> approval. I hadn't {{expected}} {{such a hot}} {{one from}} such a quarter. [...] "Like a fairy princess. Nice work, Gussie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} we need fret very much if the Britishers have grown frightened," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> a laugh, and Uncle 'Rasmus replied: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> {{a sort of}} reverential respect, [...] "fitting {{yourself}} for a position of choir-master in a Turkish cathedral, no doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{cards were}} brought, and the Chevalier began to fight his battle over again; {{but could not}} satisfy Mr. St. George. [...] "You see, there was the bet with the Governor, and the pips, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>with</b> the Archbishop of Warsaw." ...|$|R
6000|$|Upon {{a certain}} occasion, nine years ago, <b>I</b> had <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> strong feeling, 'If ever I see St. Louis again, I will seek out Mr. Brown, the great grain merchant, and ask of him the {{privilege}} of shaking him by the hand.' ...|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Livermore and Patrick Hynes {{formed the}} Potatomen, a pop band that has {{released}} two albums, Now and Iceland, two EPs, On the Avenue and All My Yesterdays, and a split EP, The Beautiful and Damned/The Day <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> Goodbye, <b>with</b> the Canadian band cub.|$|R
