6000|$|... "How say you, Prince? {{shall we}} cross?" [...] asked Stanley, as they rested on their paddles and cast furtive <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the dark clouds {{and across the}} still quiet bay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said he, {{and settled}} down to his book again, {{but his eyes were}} for ever darting little {{suspicious}} <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the window. I watched it also, but all was quiet outside.|$|E
60|$|The men {{followed}} {{them out on}} the yard, and worked in desperate haste, with occasional <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the mast head. In a couple of minutes the sail was firmly secured in its gaskets, and all made their way below.|$|E
60|$|And Dahlia {{was in the}} drawing-room. She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my entrance.|$|R
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him and waited. Arnold, however, {{had stopped}} short.|$|R
60|$|Elma <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a certain tinge of half-incredulous surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{shall we}} start?" [...] I ask presently, as we return, rather like bashful yokels, to the library, {{and the old}} gentleman reading the Arabian Nights in the {{armchair}} in the corner <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me with a sudden curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|BARBARA [looking at Bill, whose {{attitude}} has never changed, and whose expression of brooding wrath has deepened] Oh, we shall cure him in no time. Just watch. [She {{goes over to}} Bill and waits. He <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her and casts his eyes down again, uneasy, but grimmer than ever]. It {{would be nice to}} just stamp on Mog Habbijam's face, wouldn't it, Bill? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{wind had}} abated {{somewhat}} in violence {{as they walked}} home, and, moreover, they had their backs to it. The walk was slower and more enjoyable in many respects than the walk out. In an unusually soft mood she replied to his remarks and stole little critical <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. When they reached the house she stood a little while at the gate gazing at the starry sky {{and listening to the}} crash of the sea on the beach.|$|E
60|$|Ursula crimsoned. Her {{girls were}} <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her, smirking their accusation.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Raggett started, and <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{somebody}} leaning {{from the}} window.|$|R
60|$|She merely <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his entrance. Her {{eyes were}} still far away.|$|R
60|$|He was silent. His {{silence was}} {{positively}} noisy. He {{wanted her to}} hear it. But {{it is difficult to}} be sulky with a bland, plump woman of thirty who remembers your childhood trick of biting your nails, and <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> you from her embroidery, occasionally patting her brown silk hair or smoothing her brown silk waist in a way which implies a good digestion, a perfect memory of the morning's lesson of her Sunday-school class, and a mild disbelief in men as anything except relatives, providers, card-players, and nurslings. Carl gave up the silence-cure.|$|E
60|$|Coffee is handed. The ladies, {{since the}} gentlemen entered, have become lively as larks; {{conversation}} waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee- cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick Lynn {{has taken a}} seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman {{at the feet of}} Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom will Blanche Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself selects a mate.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts, with rapturous {{admiration of}} him: [...] "Well, Edward, {{you have got}} a brain! I declare, the cook had utterly gone out of my mind. Forgetting that plush bag makes me forget everything. I've got a splendid one--a perfect treasure. She won't do any of the wash, and we'll have to put that out; and she's been used to having a kitchen-maid; but she said we were such a small family that she could shell the pease herself. She's the most respectable-looking old thing you ever saw; and she's been having ten dollars a week from the last family she was in; but she'll come the summer with us for six. I was very {{fortunate}} to get her; all the good girls are snapped up for the sea-side in May, and they won't go into the country for love or money. It was the greatest chance! She's such a neat, quiet, lady-like person, and all the better for being Irish and a Catholic: Catholics do give so much more of a flavor; and I never could associate that Nova Scotia, sunken-cheeked leanness of Maria's with a cook. This one's name is--well, I forget what her name is; Bridget, or Norah, or something like that--and she's a perfect little butter-ball. She's coming {{to go out on the}} same train with us; and she'll get the dinner to-night; and I sha'n't have the mortification of sitting down to a pickup meal with Amy Campbell, the first time she has visited us; she's conceited enough about her house-keeping as it is, I'm sure, and I wouldn't have her patronizing and pitying me for worlds. The cook will be here at half-past three precisely; I had to pretend the train started a little earlier than it does so as to make her punctual; they are such uncertain things! and I don't suppose I shall be back by that time, quite, Edward, and so you must receive her. Let me see!" [...] She <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the clock on the wall. [...] "It's just quarter-past now, and our train goes at ten minutes to four--My goodness! I'll have to hurry." ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a winsome smile, glad to hear his words.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} {{recognise}} it, for <b>at</b> length she <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him sharply.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her abrupt pause, and she {{was looking}} at the house.|$|R

50|$|The {{third season}} begins with Torgeir and Roar visiting Rio de Janeiro {{in order for}} Roar to meet in person a woman he has met online. Roar falls head over heels for the {{beauteous}} dark-haired Alex(andra). The happy couple {{are about to be}} married in Rio when, back in Lillehammer, Johnny gazes out his window at a Norwegian holiday festival with costumed participants walking on the street below. A boy in a tiger costume is one of the participants. Johnny then <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a window across the way and spies a beautiful blonde girl dressed in a cheerleader costume. A man approaches her from behind in {{what appears to be the}} beginnings of a lovemaking session. Suddenly the man strikes the woman brutally.|$|E

5000|$|The video {{consists}} of the band playing at a cabaret bar, with alternate scenes of a man dressed in black (the devil) surrounded by a funnel cloud heading to the bar while causing destruction to a newsstand and a picnic on the way. Towards {{the end of the}} video, the man lays a contract on one of the tables. Lead singer Ben Kowalewicz leaves the stage and walks over to the table. The man holds out a pen, which Ben takes and uses to sign the contract (in essence, selling his soul to the devil). Ben then <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the camera, revealing that his eyes, normally light brown in colour, have become blood-red. During the final chorus, the funnel cloud is now surrounding Ben as he and the band finish the song while the man watches.|$|E
5000|$|This {{painting}} by Hooch was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote; [...] "254. THE CARD-PLAYERS. Sm. 48. de G. 41. [...] In the right-hand {{corner of a}} room with a wooden ceiling and a tiled floor a young lady and a gentleman are playing cards at a table, while two other gentlemen look on. The lady, seated on the right, is about to play a card from her hand. On her right stands a cavalier, holding a pipe in his right hand he wears a plumed hat and a doublet of light grey with pink ribbons a grey cloak hangs upon a peg to the right. To the right of the lady sits another cavalier with cards in his hand, who <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the gentleman. A third young man, bareheaded and seen in full light, sits, with his back half-turned to the spectator, at the right-hand front corner of the table, drinking a glass of wine he wears a black velvet jacket, yellow stockings, and high-heeled shoes. By the wall to the right is a couch with red velvet cushions. The room is flooded with light from a large window, divided into four compartments, behind the group. To the left an open door looks into a courtyard, through which a servant-girl comes with a jug and some pipes. Behind her is a house with a passage leading into a garden. This is one of the finest of the master's works. [...] " [...] The extraordinary luminous effect which pervades this picture renders it the admiration of every beholder. It is painted with singular mastery of hand, and exhibits throughout a consummate knowledge of the principles of art [...] " [...] (Sm.).|$|E
40|$|The year is 1867 in Paris {{during the}} Second Empire. A {{musician}} sets off one day from his flat {{in a building}} several centuries old situated {{on the north side}} of the city. He is mulling over finances, and he feels lucky to have the place. Though the building is six floors tall with a narrow spiral staircase, the ground floor apartment was available when he was looking, and the piano movers were just able to shoehorn in his forty-year- old Erard piano. He has a package under his arm, and he is on a mission, but he pauses upon emerging from his narrow street onto the great boulevard. He <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the magnificent arch dividing the boulevard at Porte St. Denis and then heads west toward the Opéra where he is employed as an opera coach. As he walks, his mind turns to finances. Some calculation in his head divides his monthly salary. Almost three-quarters goes toward food and another quarter to his apartment, fuel, and clothes, leaving little for everything else. The scores that he deeply desires cost around fifteen francs, too much for him to spend in his quest to keep up with the latest operas. A fellow musician is visiting tonight, as he does weekly, so they can play and sing some opera music. They are hoping to work through a piano-vocal score they had seen advertised in a recent edition of Le ménestrel, Mignon by Ambroise Thomas, which had been first performed last November. Some music, some gossip and good fellowship —that is his hope for the evening. He continues down the boulevard, glances in the pâtisserie, passes the butcher, and turns in at his goal, the shop of Léon Grus. Grus has an especially lovely shop, and well-placed. 3 He sells pianos and scores, a few other instruments, and sundries, such as candles and music paper. The musician bypasses the displays, though, and heads to the end of the counter. Here is the abonnement de musique, the music circulating library, where he has been a member since before the old man died and his son took over. Last month he paid his annual subscription of thirty francs, and this enable...|$|E
