40|$|This article criticises H. L. Ho’s {{argument}} that the exclusion of improperly obtained evidence can best {{be understood in terms}} of a ‘political’ rather than ‘epistemic’ conception of the criminal trial. It argues that an epistemic conception of the trial, as an institution primarily concerned with arriving at accurate verdicts on the part of an independent and impartial factfinder, is an important element {{of the rule of law}}. The court also has a duty to uphold other elements of the rule of law. The rule of law should be seen as concerned with upholding moral and political rights, including those of victims as well as defendants. The ‘vindication principle’, requiring <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> <b>exclusion</b> of evidence to take account of both these sets of rights, is defended as being consistent with this understanding of the rule of law and with the epistemic conception of the trial...|$|R

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} {{described}} successful {{experiences with the}} use of telemedicine in acute stroke. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the feasibility, acceptability, and treatment delivery reliability, of telemedicine systems for the clinical and radiological assessment, and management of acute-stroke patients. Summary of Review: A systematic review of the literature was carried out. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) study population included participants with a diagnosis of suspected acute stroke, (2) intervention included the use of telemedicine systems to aid assessment, diagnosis, or treatment in acute stroke, and (3) outcomes measured related to feasibility in clinical practice, acceptability to patients, carers, and staff, reliability of telemedicine systems, and effectiveness in delivering treatment, especially tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Overall, 17 relevant non-randomised studies reported that telemedicine systems were feasible and acceptable. Interrater reliability was excellent for global clinical assessments and <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> radiological <b>exclusion</b> criteria although agreement for individual assessment items was more variable. Telemedicine systems were associated with increased use of tPA. Conclusion: Although there is limited reliable evidence, observational studies have indicated that telemedicine systems can be feasible, acceptable, and reliable in acute-stroke management. In addition, telemedicine consultations were associated with improved delivery of tPA. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the avalanche of claims against attorneys, legal malpractice insurers have sought to limit their exposure. These insurers have followed the lead of insurers that issued directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies containing exclusionary provisions, {{commonly referred to as}} FDIC exclusions or regulatory exclusions. These policy provisions specifically excluded claims made by government regulators such as the FDIC and the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Despite express exclusionary language in the directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies, the FDIC and FSLIC challenged the regulatory exclusions. The regulators claimed that the exclusions were unenforceable because they were contrary to public policy. A number of trial courts have ruled on the validity of regulatory exclusions under directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies. Some courts have been persuaded by the FDIC 2 ̆ 7 s myriad arguments and have declared that the regulatory exclusions are unenforceable because they contravene public policy. Other courts have held that no public policy abrogates the regulatory exclusions. To date, there has been no reported <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> regulatory <b>exclusions</b> in legal malpractice policies. Therefore, the only guidance on the enforceability of such exclusions is the case law <b>on</b> regulatory <b>exclusions</b> in directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies. After discussing the current case law and statutory developments affecting directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies, this article will consider the applicability of public policy arguments to legal malpractice policies. Finally, the article will discuss the consequences of judicial rewriting of the policies to both insured attorneys and their clients...|$|R
40|$|Life-cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) is {{a method}} for evaluating {{the environmental impacts of}} products holistically, including direct and supply chain impacts. The current LCA methodologies and the standards by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) impose practical difficulties for drawing system boundaries; <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> inclusion or <b>exclusion</b> of processes in an analysis (the cutoff criteria) are typically not made on a scientific basis. In particular, the requirement of deciding which processes could be excluded from the inventory can be rather difficult to meet because many excluded processes have often never been assessed by the practitioner, and therefore, their negligibility cannot be guaranteed. LCA studies utilizing economic input−output analysis have shown that, in practice, excluded processes can contribute as much to the product system under study as included processes; thus, the subjective determination of the system boundary may lead to invalid results. System boundaries in LCA are discussed herein with particular attention to outlining hybrid approaches as methods for resolving the boundary selection problem in LCA. An input−output model can be used to describe at least a part of a product system, and an ISO-compatible system boundary selection procedure can be designed by applying hybrid input−output-assisted approaches. There are several hybrid input−output analysis-based LCA methods that can be implemented in practice for broadening system boundary and also for ISO compliance. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} nutritional screening programmes in improving quality of care and patient outcomes compared with usual care. Methods: Searches were performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, the Cochrane database, and Current Controlled Trials. Due to the assumed scarcity of high quality evidence, interventional studies in hospital or primary care settings with adequate reporting and comparisons were considered as eligible. Team members met after reviewing the papers. <b>Decisions</b> <b>on</b> inclusion or <b>exclusion</b> of papers were made when all agreed. Two reviewers independently extracted data from included studies. Results: 705 abstracts were considered and thirty full-text papers were ordered and reviewed. Following further review of the extracted data two papers met the inclusion criteria. One was a clustered randomized study of 26 general practices {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of screening for elderly ailments including malnutrition. It concluded nutritional screening did not improve referral to dieticians, detection of nutritional problems, or patients’ quality of life. This study was underpowered for evaluating the effectiveness of nutritional screening. A non-randomized controlled before-after study of four hospital wards concluded that intervention improved weight recording, but not referral to dieticians or care at the mealtime of at risk patients. Discussion: Very few studies assess the effectiveness of nutritional screening with relevant outcomes and acceptable quality. The available evidence does not support systematic application of screening tools to hospital, or general practice patients. Given the current level of interest and political support for nutritional screening, further studies are urgently required...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a recent initiative in NSW, Australia {{in the state}} government’s “fight against anti-social behaviour”. The Anti-Social Behaviour Pilot Project has developed a surveillance regime that exempts justice and human service public authorities from existing privacy laws so that these agencies can share risk intelligence about targeted young people for a more integrated and multi-agency intensive management of risk. A detailed account of the ensemble of statements that have shaped and made this highly politicised risk governance possible is outlined. The initiative seeks to establish a more flexible mode of surveillance capable of intervening into cases of persistent risks linked {{to the possibility of}} criminal offending and the risks of persistent offending that have both become linked to public safety. Two analytical frames are used {{to make sense of the}} project. Firstly, its nodal technique for integrating case management risk across governmental assemblages (police, health etc) is analysed as an exemplar of a post-panoptical surveillant inter-assemblage designed for the networked control of young people. Secondly, Agamben’s (1988, 2005) account of the state of exception is used to demonstrate how the project’s extra-legal administrative procedures for managing risks linked to “the public interest ” establish a spatial arrangement for the control of young people based <b>on</b> <b>decisions</b> of <b>exclusion</b> that are paradoxically located inside and outside the law...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{financial}} exclusion {{has been the}} subject of increasing interest and debate and is characterised as a situation where a proportion of the population have limited access to mainstream financial services. Previous studies of financial exclusion in the UK have generally focused on a particular financial service, such as bank accounts, and have incorporated differing methods and models of investigation. Thus, comparing and contrasting significant influences <b>on</b> <b>exclusion</b> across a range of financial services proves problematic. The current study uses a common model to test and compare influences <b>on</b> <b>exclusion</b> for a wide range of financial services. Findings show that the most consistent and significant influences <b>on</b> financial <b>exclusion</b> are employment status, household income, and housing tenure, closely followed by marital status, age, and level of academic qualification.

40|$|The Open Content Alliance (OCA) is {{a network}} of {{libraries}} and similar organizations committed to digitizing and providing broadest possible access to books and other materials; over 1. 6 million books are already online under OCA principles. OCA is analyzed in contrast with Google Books (as per the preliminary Google Books Settlement, November 2009), using Castell’s network theory and theories of an emerging global public sphere, {{based on the work}} of Habermas and Fraser. OCA is seen as a superior network to Google Books, with particular strengths in connectedness, consistency (shared goals), flexibility, scalability, survivability, networking (inclusion / exclusion) power, and network-making power, including the ability to form strategic alliances. The lawsuit against Google Books, and the settlement, illustrate some of the limitations of Google Books as a network, for example the lawsuit per se is a challenge to Google Books’ rights to make <b>decisions</b> <b>on</b> inclusion and <b>exclusion,</b> and illustrates poor connectedness and consistency, two attributes Castells points to as essential to the performance of a network. The respectful, law-abiding approach of OCA is a good fit for a global public sphere, while the Google Books Settlement takes a key issue that has traditionally been decided by governments (orphan books), and brings the decision-making power into private contract negotiations, diminishing democracy. The current Google Books Settlement is fractured on a national (geographic) basis; consequences could include decreased understanding of the rest of the world by a leading nation, the U. S. This works against the development of a global public sphere, and has potential negative economic and security implications for the U.
