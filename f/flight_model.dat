5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results of}} tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E
25|$|The Potez-CAMS 160 was a one-off 5/13 scale <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> {{built in}} France, first flown {{in the summer}} of 1938 to test {{aerodynamic}} and hydrodynamic qualities of the Potez-CAMS 161 airliner and mail carrier, which was too large for detailed modelling in existing wind tunnels.|$|E

5000|$|Free <b>flight</b> <b>models</b> may be broadly {{divided into}} four categories: ...|$|R
40|$|Plasma proton and plasma {{electron}} prototype and <b>flight</b> <b>models</b> were designed, fabricated, and tested. Ground {{support equipment}} for the models was also prepared. The <b>flight</b> <b>models</b> were launched aboard {{the first and third}} Orbiting Geophysical Observatories on 4 Sept. 1964 and 6 June 1966. These experiments have generally functioned in accordance with the design specifications and useful data are still being received...|$|R
25|$|I-War was {{notable for}} its use of Newtonian physics; unlike other popular space combat games such as Wing Commander and , the <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> is subject to inertia caused by a ship's mass {{and the absence of}} drag in outer space. In {{addition}} to common flight dynamics, vessels can move and accelerate in all directions: up, down, forward, backwards and sideways.|$|E
25|$|FlightGear {{started as}} an online {{proposal}} in 1996 by David Murr. He proposed a new flight simulator developed by volunteers over the Internet as alternative to proprietary, available simulators like the Microsoft Flight Simulator. The flight simulator was created using custom 3D graphics code. Development of an OpenGL based version was spearheaded by Curtis Olson starting in 1997. FlightGear incorporated other open-source resources, including the LaRCsim <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> from NASA, and freely available elevation data. The first working binaries using OpenGL {{came out in}} 1997.|$|E
25|$|Discussions on {{providing}} a docking module for the Shuttle-Mir programme began in May 1993 and approval was granted on 1 November, with the draft plan {{being developed by}} December. The module consisted of what were essentially two Soyuz TM-16 type Soyuz orbital modules cut in half, with a cylindrical central portion mounted {{in the center of}} the two halves which incorporated docking apparatus (the other two halves were not used). An APAS-89 docking port was mounted on each end. Mounting points were also provided for two boxes (containing new solar arrays) and other external experiments, and the module was provided with its own thermal control, television transmission, and telemetry systems. Rather than being covered in a newly-manufactured white thermal blanket, the module was flown with an unusual orange blanket, which was selected from pre-existing stock for financial reasons. Development of the simplified module was given priority over the more complex Mir-2 type SO-1, and the <b>flight</b> <b>model,</b> the first to make use of NASA's new Space Station Processing Facility, was delivered to Kennedy Space Center on 7 June 1995 alongside the new solar arrays which were to be launched with it.|$|E
50|$|In July 2017, Ariane Group {{reported}} that the first <b>flight</b> <b>models</b> of the combustion chamber had entered production.|$|R
50|$|Boeing {{delivered}} 8 flight vehicles {{under its}} original contract. Under {{terms of a}} follow-on contract, it built 6 additional <b>flight</b> <b>models.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The X-38 program used {{unmanned}} mockups to {{test the}} CRV design. <b>Flight</b> <b>models</b> were indicated with the letter V for [...] "Vehicle" [...] followed by a number.|$|R
500|$|In {{naming the}} {{individual}} stages, MSFC used the stage designation with a suffix indicating its purpose. [...] For example, S-IC-D {{was the first}} stage, S-IC, for dynamic testing, and S-IC-1 was the first <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> of the first stage. [...] Suffixes used were S, for structural, F for facilities, T for all-systems test, and D for dynamic testing.|$|E
500|$|FreeSpace 2s {{gameplay}} {{involves the}} player piloting a starfighter using mounted weapons to destroy enemy starfighters, performing reconnaissance behind enemy lines, or escorting other starships. Its <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> {{is based on}} a looser interpretation of space physics instead of realistic Newtonian physics. Hence, the ships are weightless and feel more responsive, though they require constant application of engine power to move. The result is that the game plays more like a [...] "WWII dogfight simulator" [...] unaffected by gravity. Although joysticks are the recommended controller for this game, the mouse is a viable alternative. Single player mode is executed {{in the form of a}} campaign, which follows a story as a linear sequence of missions are executed.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{compared}} Star Wars: Rogue Squadron {{to one of}} its inspirations, the Battle of Hoth flight combat {{level in}} Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, considered one of that game's best elements. GamePro remarked that Rogue Squadron [...] "enhanced the <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> with true pitch, roll, and bank mechanics". IGN praised its inclusion of [...] "upgrades, more enemies, better sound, and stunning second-generation graphics". The Nintendo 64 version received mostly positive reviews, and received an aggregate score of 85 percent from both GameRankings and Metacritic. GamePro named {{it one of the}} best games released in 1998. In a 2008 retrospective, IGN's Levi Buchanan stated that the game revived the Star Wars license on consoles through well-paced gameplay, a story tied into the Star Wars canon and visuals that made it [...] "one of the generation's top stunners".|$|E
50|$|MSFC {{built the}} first three test stages (S-IC-T, the S-IC-S, and the S-IC-F) and the first two <b>flight</b> <b>models</b> (S-IC-1 and -2). They were built using tools {{produced}} in Wichita.|$|R
50|$|Various Indian {{private sector}} firms are {{involved}} in the programme. National Aerospace Laboratories contributed to the aerodynamic studies of the antenna array, and <b>flight</b> <b>modelling</b> of the entire AEWACS platform.|$|R
5000|$|The {{editors of}} PC Gamer US awarded MiG Alley their 1999 [...] "Best Simulation" [...] prize, and {{highlighted}} its [...] "outstanding <b>flight</b> <b>modeling,</b> butter-smooth graphics, and rich dynamic campaign structure".|$|R
500|$|FreeSpace was Volition's first project {{after the}} split from Parallax Software, which also spawned Outrage Entertainment. It {{is not part}} of the canon of the Descent {{computer}} game series, and contained none of its ideas and only small portions of its code. It was only prefixed with Descent to avoid trademark issues with Mijenix Corporation's [...] "FreeSpace", a disk compression utility. Volition also used the term [...] "FreeSpace" [...] in the game to initially describe what became later known as subspace. The game was conceived by Adam Pletcher, with all the features of space simulator games his team had found to be fun. The games [...] and Wing Commander were their primary inspirations, and those influences made their way into the game's <b>flight</b> <b>model,</b> along with the influence of historical WWII dogfights. Themes from the fiction of Star Wars, , and Ender's Game form a part in shaping the background and story of the FreeSpace world. The chaotic battles between masses of ships commonly found in science-fiction anime became one of the features of FreeSpace.|$|E
500|$|While {{leading the}} team, Blackley adopted a loose style of supervision. According to Opening the Xbox author Dean Takahashi, [...] "Blackley [...] ultra-organized. His idea of good {{management}} was to invite someone {{over for a}} gourmet dinner and have a casual conversation about work". However, Takahashi wrote that [...] "Blackley worked hard to inspire his team", and he described artist James Dollar's belief that, [...] "in contrast to other Looking Glass managers, he didn't take over tasks and make others feel stupid". During {{the first two years}} of production, the team was divided into small groups that worked on the game's elements separately. For example, Blackley programmed the game's physics, while Eric Twietmeyer and Tim Day created the terrain renderer. However, Doug Church later said that, while [...] "the team [...] a bunch of very cool stuff, the FBO, the <b>flight</b> <b>model,</b> the instructor, the renderer, so on", the result [...] "was almost like four separate programs, with no connection". Following the completion of the concurrently-developed System Shock, a significant part of that game's team—including Church, Marc LeBlanc and Rob Fermier—moved to Flight Unlimited to add connective material. At the time, Church said that it was difficult to meld the game's elements, but he later stated that they largely coalesced by the end.|$|E
2500|$|The two Frontier {{games were}} {{significantly}} flawed {{in a number}} of respects. Both games had many bugs, First Encounters in particular, due apparently to being published in an incomplete state. First Encounters was extensively patched, then reissued and finally withdrawn from sale. [...] This was followed by a lawsuit brought by Gametek against David Braben. The two games employed a realistic <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> based on Newtonian mechanics rather than the original arcade-style engine. While this was more realistic, many players also found it frustratingly difficult, particularly in combat. Most space trading games since Elite have stuck to an arcade-style <b>flight</b> <b>model,</b> in which the ships behave as though they are flying in an atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of common}} {{computational}} models are weather forecasting models, earth simulator <b>models,</b> <b>flight</b> simulator <b>models,</b> molecular protein folding models, and neural network models.|$|R
40|$|The use of free <b>flight</b> <b>models</b> for {{transonic}} {{testing at}} high Reynolds numbers is discussed. Several specific examples of experimental investigations are briefly reviewed {{to illustrate the}} scope of research that can be conducted by utilizing the advantages of free <b>flight</b> <b>models.</b> These advantages are primarily the lack of interference or constraints imposed by test facilities and model support systems and the dynamic freedom possessed by free <b>flight</b> <b>models.</b> High Reynolds numbers are obtained by using large models flown at relatively low altitudes. It is shown that models 10 meters or more in length will be required for research at Reynolds numbers sufficiently high to provide representative simulation of flow conditions for large modern aircraft. Several methods for launching models of this size are discussed. These methods include free drops from airplanes or balloons and ground launches {{with the use of}} internal or external rocket motors. All the launching methods discussed have been successfully demonstrated on flight vehicles of the size and weight required to attain the necessary test conditions...|$|R
50|$|Vibration Analysis: During launch, the {{satellite}} undergoes intense vibrations. It {{must be able}} to sustain these. For the same, simulations have been run and validated by performing tests on both the qualification and <b>flight</b> <b>models.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The RQ-11B Raven UAV is {{launched}} by hand, {{thrown into the}} air like a free <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> airplane. The Raven lands itself by auto-piloting to a pre-defined landing point and then performing a 45° slope (1foot down for every 1foot forward) controlled [...] "Autoland" [...] descent. The UAV can provide day or night aerial intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance.|$|E
2500|$|The RQ-11 Raven was {{originally}} introduced as the FQM-151 in 1999, but in 2002 developed into its current form, resembling an enlarged FAI class F1C free <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> aircraft in general appearance. The craft is launched {{by hand and}} powered by a pusher configuration electric motor. The plane can fly up to [...] at altitudes of appx [...] above ground level (AGL), and over [...] {{above mean sea level}} (MSL), at flying speeds of 28–60mph (45–97km/h). The U.S. Army deploys the Raven at company-level.|$|E
2500|$|The Potez-CAMS 161 was one {{of three}} French large, six-engined flying boats {{intended}} as airliners on the North Atlantic route. [...] The others were the Latécoère 631 and the SNCASE SE.200. [...] In the summer of 1938, the 161's aerodynamics had been investigated and refined with the Potez-CAMS 160, a 5/13 scale <b>flight</b> <b>model.</b> [...] Very different dates for the first fight appear in the literature: a contemporary report in Flight gives it as within few weeks before 7 December 1939, with [...] "further flying tests" [...] {{in the first half of}} 1942, whereas Hartmann has 20 March 1942 as the first flight date. In either case the CAMS machine was the first of the three to fly.|$|E
50|$|Free <b>flight</b> <b>models</b> are flown {{without any}} form of {{mechanical}} or radio control over the <b>model</b> in <b>flight.</b> This is the earliest form of aeromodelling, a particular milestone being the first model powered by a rubber band built and flown by Alphonse Pénaud in 1871.|$|R
50|$|Environmental sensors {{will monitor}} {{environmental}} {{conditions at the}} landing site. Various equipment will measure UV rays, oxidising substances, air pressure, air temperature, dust impact, wind velocity, and ground vibration. These sensors will have a combined mass of 130 g. <b>Flight</b> <b>models</b> were previously developed for Britain’s Beagle 2 lander.|$|R
5000|$|Another type of powered free <b>flight</b> <b>models</b> is CO2 (its FAI {{category}} is F1K [...] ). These models fly {{using a small}} engine powered by carbon dioxide. This models are very light. The amount of CO2 is limited to 2 cm³, which is enough for cca. 2 minutes of flight.|$|R
2500|$|The {{simulator}} wizard {{makes use}} of multiple pages of scenario descriptions that are entered by the user in order to compute the possible distress positions and times, subsequent search object drift trajectories, {{and the effect of}} completed searches on the search object probabilities. [...] The simulator captures uncertainty in positions, time environmental inputs and leeway parameters. [...] Upon receiving all of the information pertinent to the case, the simulator, using Markov's Monte Carlo method, simulates the drift of up to 10,000 particles for each scenario. For every 20 minutes of drift, the simulator accounts for changes in water current, wind leeway and leeway divergence. The simulator displays the results as a probability density map that can be animated over the drift duration. Figure 1 depicts this type of map. The ensemble trajectory model, random walk and random <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> governing equations are fully explained in Breivik and Allen (2008) and Spaulding, et al. (2005) that is located within O’Donnell, et al. (2005). In short, the goal of the simulator is to maximize the probability of success.|$|E
2500|$|X-Wing, {{which one}} author later stated [...] "skillfully {{captured}} the feel" [...] of the Star Wars films, was a best-seller in 1993. In its 1992 {{preview of the}} game Computer Gaming World wrote that the developers [...] "are taking aim at Chris Roberts and his megahit Wing Commander series". The magazine said in its 1993 review {{that some of the}} missions were imbalanced, and criticized the need to identify and execute precise [...] "solutions" [...] to them. It praised the <b>flight</b> <b>model</b> as [...] "excellently executed and a joy to play", however, and concluded [...] "I enjoyed the experience tremendously" [...] and looked forward to expansion disks and sequels. Compute! said X-Wing succeeds at being [...] "the first authentic space-combat simulator", comparing it favorably to the contemporaneous Wing Commander, while calling the game's rigid structure, leaving no margin for error, [...] "controversial". A reviewer for Next Generation said X-Wing [...] "was a deserved, runaway hit", and scored the Macintosh conversion four out of five stars. He praised the updating of the graphics with texture mapping, light sourcing, and higher resolution, as well as the inclusion of the Imperial Pursuit and B-Wing expansion packs. He criticized that the game's infamously rigid difficulty had not been fixed in the Macintosh version, but found it an overall welcome port of an outstanding game. In the following month's issue, Next Generation ranked X-Wing and [...] collectively as number 23 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time".|$|E
5000|$|Standard <b>Flight</b> <b>Model</b> (SFM) - A {{data driven}} <b>flight</b> <b>model,</b> with some pre-defined {{scripting}} for some complex aerodynamic events. The only aircraft available to be flown by the player {{that has a}} Standard <b>Flight</b> <b>Model</b> is the Su-33, and all three variants of the MiG-29; however, Eagle Dynamics {{is in the process}} of updating the two.|$|E
50|$|The cockpit, sensor and <b>flight</b> <b>modelling</b> {{aspects of}} the game are a lot simpler {{than those of the}} Comanche series and the Longbow flight simulators. Cockpit renders are not very advanced, and {{instruments}} are difficult to read. This applies to the rendered cockpit and the floating cockpit. The clear cockpit view is the easiest to use, but there are no sensor overlays. The gunner selects the targets most of the time, and players have reported some issues with his/her AI. ECM, radars and lasers cannot be toggled on or off. The <b>flight</b> <b>modelling</b> is not the most accurate on the helicopter sim market. For example, unwise maneuvres that warrant a crash can be performed without a hitch. In addition, hovering is a lot simpler than in the Comanche and Longbow games.|$|R
50|$|Through {{continued}} support, {{additional content}} {{has been added}} via updates. These additions consist of high quality {{six degrees of freedom}} cockpits for the Su-27, A-10A, Su-25, Su-33, and MiG-29, replacing dated cockpits as well as Professional <b>Flight</b> <b>Models</b> (PFM) for the F-15C Eagle, A-10A Thunderbolt II, Su-25 Frogfoot, and Su-27 Flanker.|$|R
