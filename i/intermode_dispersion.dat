40|$|The {{signal to}} noise ratio (SNR) effect upon the maximum {{transmission}} length of a fiberoptic system is discussed. The relationships of different system parameters are discussed. A general formula to obtain the SNR of a single mode fiberoptic system is derived. The SNR attainable with single mode and multimode fiber optics links was calculated from fundamental noise considerations. It was found that for single mode fibers, laser noise dominates the noise contributions for links less than 30 km long, while thermal noise dominates for longer links. Multimode fibers degrade SNR for long links because of <b>intermode</b> <b>dispersion.</b> For frequency standard transmission, as long as the baseband modulation signals are within the bandwidth of the fibers, respectable SNR can be attained with low loss fibers (approximately 1 dB/km) for links as long as 70 km. For wideband transmission SNR is decreased by a factor equal to the ratio of the bandwidth...|$|E
