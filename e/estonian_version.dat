Another major success was the program Su nägu kõlab tuttavalt (Your Face Sounds Familiar), a musical parody show, that premiered in April 2013 on TV3 and became an instant hit with the viewers. In 2014, he created a role in the TV movie The last round, which the cast also took to {{theatrical}} tour in 2015. Sander has often been compared to the American talk show host Conan O'Brien, based on both their physical resemblance as well as their razor sharp wit and wicked sense of humour. To this Sander has characteristically replied that Conan is obviously imitating him, as his career has been lasting twice as long as that of Conan O'Brien (even though Conan O'Brien is older, Sander began his TV career at the age of 7).|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyses}} tale type The Woman as Wolf, {{which is}} one of the most popular folk tales in the Estonian Folklore Archives and is represented there both in the form of a fairy tale and in the form of a legend. The vast majority of the versions of The Woman as Wolf were written down in the first part of the 20 th century within Estonia and where recorded from Estonians. The article introduces the content of the tale, the origin of the first records from the early 19 th century, and the dissemination area of the tale, which remains outside Western Europe: apart from the <b>Estonian</b> <b>versions</b> there are Sami, Karelian, Vepsian, Livonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian versions. While in almost all the <b>Estonian</b> <b>versions</b> the main protagonist is transformed into a wolf, in most of the versions written down in other areas and ethnic groups, another animal or bird replaces the wolf. The author is of the opinion that the Finnic area is central to the distribution of the folk tale The Woman as Wolf. The animal the woman is transformed into in the plot would not have been a wolf in earlier times. The article provides an explanation why the wolf is predominant in Estonian written sources. For that purpose the ways in which the wolf and werewolf were perceived in earlier Estonian folk belief are introduced. At the end of the article interpretation of the folk tale is provided. The author states that the plot and some of the motifs found in this folk tale reflect the difficulties women had in submitting to the norms and values of patriarchal order within their society...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} emotional well-being among patients presenting ninety anorexia nervosa (AN) and healthy age-matched controls using the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule and the Emotional Well-Being Scale together with background health information. The results indicated that AN patients displayed higher levels of negative affect and negative emotions, more stress and depression, greater sleeping problems, pain, and use of analgesics and mood-enhancing drugs, as well as lower levels of positive affect and positive emotions, compared to the age-matched healthy controls. Despite their negative self-report, on the variables pertaining to affect, sleep and pain, the AN patients reported a higher frequency of physical exercise. Regression analysis indicated that the AN condition, from diagnosis, was predicted from negative affect, sleeping problems, use of mood-enhancing drugs and exercise frequency. Hence, suggesting that excessive exercise together with depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, additive behaviors and sleep problems represent AN from a perspective of multiple comorbidities. compared with healthy volunteers, assessed on <b>Estonian</b> <b>versions</b> of the Eating Disorder Inventory- 2, positive affect and negative affect (measured by the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule), and Neuroticism made the largest contribution to Eating Disorder-...|$|R

5000|$|The basic tunes {{noted above}} {{have been in}} use {{virtually}} since the very first records. In some instances, the melody combines elements of both; for instance, the early <b>Estonian</b> and Pomeranian <b>versions</b> are closer to today's [...] "Swiss" [...] tune, while further west the [...] "German" [...] tune seems to have prevailed from the start. Most of the older versions exhibit a more complex harmonic and rhythmic structure than the extant two tunes, though; some demanded a triadic arpeggio or other more complex chords at some points, others covered wider intervals. The gradual simplification of the melody {{may be due to}} the fact that it is after all a children's song; it may have been altered for pedagogical purposes, i.e. to suit the faculties of kindergarten-age children. In any case, the fifth interval that rules both extant tunes is typical for text-oriented songs and thus fits the use of the song as a game.|$|R
40|$|Few Estonian old {{folk songs}} – regilaulud – have been {{translated}} into English. The anthology by Juhan Kurrik published in 1985 under the title Ilomaile is therefore a valuable source for getting acquainted with the wonderful world of Estonian folk songs {{for those who do}} not know Estonian. The anthology embraces a wide range of songs providing a comprehensive overview of the Estonian treasury of regilaul from both a thematic and geographic perspective, and the translator has successfully captured the poetic quality of the old songs. However, ongoing research on these old songs keeps shedding new light on the interpretation and translation of many passages. For the most part, Estonian old folk songs were collected and transcribed in the 19 th century when dialects had formed in different parts of the country that varied as to their vocabulary and grammar. Modern-day Estonians, whose language instinct is mostly based on standard written <b>Estonian,</b> the <b>version</b> which developed in the first half of the 20 th century, and, to a lesser extent, on the dialectal background of their parents and grandparents, often have difficulty interpreting old songs. This may be easier for a linguist specialising in dialects, but even in this case knowledge of dialects is insufficient: the language of the songs is poetic elaboration and governed by different rules than everyday language. From the historical-linguistic point of view the morphology of old folk songs is characterised by old forms and their poetic elaborations, and many 19 th century scholars regarded them as simply incorrect – until linguists discovered the rules behind it. Semantics, however,...|$|R
