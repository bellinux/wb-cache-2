After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice."

5000|$|Over time, however, {{responses}} {{grew more}} favorable. Of {{his performance in}} [...] "Stairmageddon", Joseph Kratzer said [...] " [...] I contend that {{the strength of this}} story was carried most predominantly by Clark Duke. I’ve mentioned on several occasions how talented Duke is at just nailing the odd comedic timing necessary to really reach the full potential of The Office’s writing, and this episode is a perfect example. His reluctance in helping Dwight from the scene in the break room just before Dwight fires off the bull tranquilizers at Stanley (“Can I <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here before whatever comes next?”) to trying to load the bubble-wrapped man into Dwight’s car (“Use the vernacular I’m comfortable with!”) was the exact performance needed to offset the all too familiar ludicrous behavior of Dwight. We all know that the ninth season is the final one of the series, but it’s sort of pleasantly bittersweet to know that if in another world NBC did renew the show for at least one more, it would have a suitable heir to John Krasinski’s deadpan throne." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{writer is}} himself the protagonist. He {{is on his}} way to Puri by train where he gets acquinted with a group of 4 Bengali widows {{accompanying}} their niece, also going to Puri. The writer was going to <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his day to day Kolkata life whereas these ladies were actually going to calm down their niece who had just suffered a breakup with her lover. The rest of the story revolves around these people and their attraction and involvement with the writer. The writer is amused with them and for his part tries to calm the girl. The story guides us around the different relationships the writer develops with each of the character he meets. The movie tries to show the social taboos for widows and teaches the philosophy that life is ahead of us and not behind. There is a pretty good description of Puri, Konark and Rambha. At the time this movie was shot it was possible for Tapan Sinha to shoot inside the Konark sun temple, also the bullock cart way to Konark is an extra for the viewer.|$|E
5000|$|The Cylons {{immediately}} pursue, appearing every 33 minutes, what mathematically {{works out}} to about 5 days days or so, without fail. With Galactica unable to make a normal jump calculation (which Scattered suggests takes 12 hours), it has to instead make a series of rapid-fire microjumps. As long as these jumps are more than 33 light-minutes distant (33 light minutes is 594,000,000 kilometers/4AU, roughly the distance from Earth to Jupiter), {{it means that the}} Cylons can’t visually “see” the fleet and have to rely on other ways of tracking the fleet (it is hinted that they are being given the jump coordinates by an agent on the Olympic Carrier and are doing the 33-minute thing simply to mess with the Colonials). At 33-light minutes per jump it would take Galactica 30.5 FTL jumps, or 3.5 days, <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our solar system beginning from the sun to furthest position of Pluto's orbit. For comparison it took the New Horizons space craft, the fastest object ever launched from Earth, traveling at 50,000 mph or 1-million miles a day, 9.5 years to reach Pluto from Earth. However, between jumps the fleet is traveling at presumably relativistic speeds at roughly 90%-99% of light.|$|E

5000|$|The split of {{the special}} {{features}} between various retailers has attracted criticism from fans. In particular, The Digital Bits' editor Bill Hunt remarked that [...] "taking fully half {{or more of the}} disc-based special features created for a major Blu-ray release and casting them to the winds as retailer exclusives, thus forcing your customers to go on an expensive scavenger hunt is, I’m sorry, absolutely outrageous. Seriously, if Paramount is going to treat its Blu-ray customers like this, they should <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the business altogether. Or better yet, farm all their titles out to third party licensees who will treat these films and Blu-ray customers in general with greater care and respect." [...] Weeks after posting his article, Hunt himself was invited by Paramount to discuss about the issue of giving away the film's special features to different retail partners. He suggested [...] "putting together the true special edition that should have been delivered from the start, with all of the extras that got scattered around to different retailers, including the enhanced audio commentary, plus all-new content just for this release... and to consider offering the IMAX version of the film..." [...] This eventually resulted with the release of Star Trek: The Compendium, a box set that includes all of the previously retailer exclusive special features, plus additional features for such as a gag reel, alongside both the theatrical release of Star Trek (2009) and the IMAX 2D version of Star Trek Into Darkness.|$|E

The two met when Shkreli bought Rickly's guitar that he used to make Thursday's 2001 album Full Collapse for $10,000. Rickly said he was completely shocked by the revelation, and elaborated: [...] "I've seen the guy give away money to schools, charities, and frankly, our bands, who if anyone really knows the industry, is a hard sell. I am struggling to find how this is OK." [...] Due to the controversy the discovery of this relationship angered several bands signed to the label. In a public statement, Collect band Sick Feeling said: [...] "One thing is clear; as long as he has a part in the label, we, Sick Feeling, cannot. Our experience with Geoff, Norm, and Shaun has been nothing but positive, however, we cannot continue to work with Collect as long as Martin Shkreli has any part in it." [...] Domenic Palermo of Nothing, who had just recently signed a two-record deal with Collect, expressed interest in breaking the contract and said: [...] "I'm hoping that we can <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this with someone else and not have to go down whatever ugly road that could lead to." [...] Within two days of the controversy's leak, Rickly put out a press release expressing that the label severed its relationship with Shkreli. Without Shkreli's significant financial contributions to Collect (estimated to be [...] "somewhere around a million dollars"), Rickly said the amount of money he currently had in the bank couldn't cover the label's outstanding invoices, leaving its future uncertain.|$|E

The large gap that happened is caused by three main issues: the legality aspects, human resources aspects, and aspects of less innovative marketing strategies.
