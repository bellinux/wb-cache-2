25|$|The River Wansbeck Valley is {{narrow and}} steep {{and as a}} {{consequence}} has exaggerated amounts of surface runoff. Based on three storm events, a reliable <b>flow</b> <b>gauge</b> located upstream of Morpeth at the confluence of the Wansbeck and Font showed that 56% of rain fall is converted into surface runoff. Because the soil was already saturated {{as a result of the}} wet summer, the effect of surface runoff was greatly enhanced. Furthermore, increased urbanisation since the 1960s in Morpeth meant that most water falling on the town would have drained directly to the river channel. Other tests investigating the catchment lag time (time lapse between the midpoint of storm rainfall and peak river level) indicate that the Wansbeck has a LAG time of only 8 hours. This means that any water falling in the catchment area would have been rapidly converted into channel flow by surface runoff and to a lesser extent by throughflow. This is due to the steepness of the valley and the soil composition.|$|E
25|$|It was {{believed}} that around 23:00 JST, the 4 m long fuel rods in the reactor were fully exposed for the second time. At 00:30 JST on 15 March, NHK ran a live press conference with TEPCO stating that the water level had sunk under the rods once again and pressure in the vessel was raised. The utility said that the hydrogen explosion at Unit 3 might have caused a glitch in the cooling system of Unit 2: Four out of five water pumps being used to cool the Unit 2 reactor had failed after the explosion at Unit 3. In addition, the last pump had briefly stopped working when its fuel ran out. To replenish the water, the contained pressure {{would have to be}} lowered first by opening a valve of the vessel.

40|$|Understanding how {{surface waters}} and groundwaters {{interact}} {{is an integral}} component of managing the influence of nutrient inputs to water quality. Knowledge of the potential nutrient loads from discharging groundwater is essential for meeting the bottom line nutrient concentrations in surface waters. Radon- 222 is an emerging tracer for measuring groundwater-surface water interaction which has been underexploited in New Zealand. The aim {{of this research was}} to establish the potential of using radon for measuring groundwater and river water interaction in the New Zealand environment. Low and high resolution radon surveys were carried out in two gravel-bed rivers, the Hutt and Mangatainoka Rivers, in lower North Island of New Zealand. To provide accurate measurements of radon concentrations in surface waters containing very little radon, the development of a cost and time effective, simple and reproducible high sensitivity radon measurement method was investigated. Furthermore, the study aimed to assess the potential of using radon measurements in combination with concurrent stream <b>flow</b> <b>gauging</b> and other hydrochemistry data for providing more detailed information on groundwater and river water interaction processes. Radon measurements were found very helpful to identify groundwater discharge and recharge locations in both the Hutt and Mangatainoka Rivers. Furthermore, a high sensitivity radon analysis method was developed with a lower limit of detection of 0. 006 BqL- 1, a vast improvement on the direct count method, and offering practical advancements over previously published methods. This high sensitivity method was used to establish radon concentration thresholds to identify locations of groundwater discharge, potential groundwater recharge and hyporheic exchange in NZ gravel-bed rivers. In both studied rivers the groundwater discharge and potential recharge patterns identified by radon were not always matched by the concurrent <b>flow</b> <b>gauging</b> surveys, highlighting the ambiguity surrounding the use of concurrent <b>flow</b> <b>gauging</b> in gravel-bed rivers for mapping river gains and losses. In some sections of the studied rivers the concurrent <b>flow</b> <b>gauging</b> data indicated areas of groundwater recharge or discharge where the radon data showed the opposite process to be occurring. This has led to the conclusion that underflow beneath the gravels and other parafluvial exchange processes can cause the interpretation of concurrent <b>flow</b> <b>gauging</b> results to be misleading. <b>Flow</b> <b>gauging</b> combined with radon sampling gives a more conclusive picture of the groundwater and river water interaction processes in the gravel-bed rivers...|$|R
40|$|Summary Successful {{extension}} of agroforestry to {{areas of the}} semi-arid tropics where deep reserves of water exist re-quires that the tree species be complementary to the associated crops {{in their use of}} water within the crop rooting zone. However, it is difficult to identify trees suitable for dryland agroforestry because most existing techniques for determining water uptake by roots cannot distinguish between absorption by tree and crop roots. We describe a method for measuring sap flow through lateral roots using constant temperature heat balance gauges, and the application of this method in a study of complementarity of water use in agroforestry systems con-taining Grevillea robusta A. Cunn. Sap <b>flow</b> <b>gauges</b> were attached to the trunks and roots of Grevillea with minimum disturbance to the soil. Thermal energy emanating from the soil adversely affected the accuracy of sap <b>flow</b> <b>gauges</b> attached to the roots, with the result that the uncorrected values were up to eightfold greater than the true water uptake determined gravimetrically. This overestimation was eliminated by using a calibration method in which nonconducting excised root segments, with sap <b>flow</b> <b>gauges</b> attached, were placed adjacent to the live roots. The power consumption and temperature differentials of the excised roots were used to correct for external sources and internal losses of heat within the paired live root. The fraction of the total sap flow through individual trees supplied by the lateral roots varied greatly between trees of similar canopy size. Excision of all lateral roots, except for one to which a heat balance gauge was attached, did not significantly increase sap flow through the intact root, suggest-ing that it was functioning at near maximum capacity...|$|R

Under the very high flow rates (e. g., 1500 – 4000 g h 21) of mature grapevines (Vitis spp.), we evaluated two algorithms to control the power applied to heat-balance sap <b>flow</b> <b>gauges,</b> and thus the temperature difference (DT) above and below gauge heaters: (i) a proportional-derivative (PD) algorithm and (ii) an open-loop controller following the theoretical diurnal course of irradiance. The PD algorithm was tuned for expected maximum flow rates and could keep DT within 0. 1 C of its daytime (0800 – 1800 h) target value. Over 21 d, mean daytime DTwas 1. 32 6 0. 001 C (s. e. m.) for an 18 -gauge system.

50|$|If {{the water}} flow at a {{particular}} point, A, in a stream is measured over time with a <b>flow</b> <b>gauge,</b> this information {{can be used to}} create a hydrograph.

40|$|The Hailar River, a first-grade {{tributary}} of the Erguna River that borders China and Russia, is the main water source for the local industry and agriculture. However, because there are only 11 <b>flow</b> <b>gauging</b> stations and those stations cannot monitor all runoff paths, {{it is hard to}} directly use the existing flow data to estimate the annual runoffs from all subbasins of interest although such estimation is needed for utilization and protection of the water resources in the Hailar River.

The study used 51 years (from 1956 to 2006) data. The results indicated a significant correlation (R 2 > 0. 87) between annual runoff and the selected subbasin characteristics and showed the model to be robust because the predicted runoffs for the validation period are compatible with the corresponding observed values.

50|$|In piston {{aircraft}} engines, continuous-flow {{fuel injection}} {{is the most}} common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all mechanical, requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the TCM system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the pressure carburetor. However, instead of having a discharge valve in the barrel, it uses a flow divider mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel injection lines to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no discharge valve. The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure fuel pump. The control unit simply uses a butterfly valve for the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary valve for the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in the control unit controls the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the flow divider. In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel <b>flow</b> <b>gauge</b> that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in gallons per hour or pounds per hour of fuel.|$|E

40|$|The general aim of {{this work}} is to develop and test a preliminaryscreening {{approach}} to assess the level of hydropeaking pressure on a river reach, without explicitly focusing on its impacts. A combination of two indicators is proposed, {{in order to provide}} an easy-to-use methodology which can be applied on commonly available stream-flow data in alpine regions. The two indicators, HP 1 and HP 2, quantify the daily maximum intensity and the velocity of discharge variations, respectively. We analyzed data from two different Alpine areas: 28 <b>flow</b> <b>gauging</b> stations located in the Trentino area (NE Italy, 16 subject to hydropeaking and 12 not impacted reaches) and 37 <b>flow</b> <b>gauging</b> stations located in Switzerland (20 impacted and 17 not impacted reaches). The approach is based on the analysis of statistical properties of time series that can be built with two quantities related with the indicators. In the end every reach is represented by an unique value of HP 1 and HP 2, which reveals a statistically significant difference between impacted and non-impacted reaches, the latter considered as reference group. In particular, higher values of HP 1 and HP 2 are associated with reaches which experience hydropeaking releases. In the space of the indicators we provide a quantitative definition of the “hydropeaking pressure” as a relative distance from not impacted conditions, based on limits for HP 1 and HP 2 calculated on not impacted group. Overall the proposed approach can easily inform on (i) relative distance of impacted reaches from not impacted conditions, (ii) provide thresholds to identify hydropeaking impacted reache...|$|R
