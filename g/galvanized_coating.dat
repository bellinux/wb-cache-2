50|$|A hot-dip <b>galvanized</b> <b>coating</b> is {{relatively}} easier and cheaper to specify than an organic paint coating of equivalent corrosion protection performance. The British, European and International standard for hot-dip galvanizing is BS EN ISO 1461 which specifies a minimum coating thickness {{to be applied}} to steel in relation to the steels section thickness e.g. a steel fabrication with a section size thicker than 6 mm shall have a minimum <b>galvanized</b> <b>coating</b> thickness of 85 µm.|$|E

50|$|Like other {{corrosion}} protection systems, galvanizing protects steel by {{acting as a}} barrier between steel and the atmosphere. However, zinc is a more electropositive (active) metal in comparison to steel. This is a unique characteristic for galvanizing, which means that when a <b>galvanized</b> <b>coating</b> is damaged and steel is exposed to the atmosphere, zinc can continue to protect steel through galvanic corrosion (often within an annulus of 5 mm, above which electron transfer rate decreases).|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} coating has a matte appearance, and is {{hard and}} brittle - under further working such as pressing or bending powder is produced from {{degradation of the}} coating, together with cracks on the surface. In comparison to a zinc (<b>galvanized)</b> <b>coating</b> galvannealed has better spot weldability, and is paintable, Due to iron present in the surface alloy phase galvanneal develops a reddish patina in moist environments - it is generally used painted. Zinc phosphate coating is a common pre-painting surface treatment.|$|E
50|$|Galvalume {{steel sheet}} is carbon steel sheet coated with aluminium-zinc alloy by a {{continuous}} hot-dip process. The nominal coating composition is 55% aluminium and 45% zinc. A small but important addition of silicon {{is included in}} the coating alloy. It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good coating adhesion to the steel substrate when the product is roll-formed, drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume steel sheet combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent protection to steel sheet. Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, Galvalume steel sheet is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a <b>galvanized</b> <b>coating</b> of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated sheet. This cut-edge protection means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make Galvalume steel sheet the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of Galvalume steel sheet is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. Galvalume metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous hot dip process. The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. Galvalume is the trade name for this patented sheet steel product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|E

40|$|Hot-dip {{galvanizing}} {{of steel}} sheets, pipes, and other fabrication items {{is a popular}} method of corrosion protection. Currently, steel articles are immersed in molten zinc at 860 {degrees}F, thereby forming a {open_quotes}frozen{close_quotes} metal (interfacial zinc iron intermetallic layer) on the surface. Drawbacks to the current technology include the expense of heating parts at such a high temperature and the generation of by-products such as zinc alloys, zinc oxides, and smoke.

40|$|Abstract. Due to {{oxidation}} and decarburization during {{heat treatment}} prior to hot stamping, various coating products {{have been developed}} in the last decades. Press-Hardened Steel (PHS) components for passenger cars are generally coated by aluminized or galvanized (GI) coatings. The aluminized coating presents a good formability at high temperature and permits forming and quenching components in the same press tools with a so called direct hot stamping method. Due to a strong cracking in the base material during direct hot stamping induced by liquid-metal embrittlement (LME), <b>galvanized</b> <b>coated</b> products must be pre-formed at low temperature and undergo heat treatment in separate press units. Moreover, the oxide scale formed on GI parts must be removed by abrasive blasting, whereas aluminized parts can be directly painted after hot forming. However, higher performance in corrosion resistance has been observed for galvanized parts, in particular in cosmetic and cut-edge corrosion. This increase {{is linked to the}} sacrificial effect or cathodic protection provided by the layer containing zinc. Daimler AG is investigating the possibility of improving performance of PHS body parts in terms of suitability for direct hot stamping and corrosion protection by developing new coating materials. In the following article, the main particularities and challenges involved in both current coating products will be introduced. The development of specific press tools for this study, as well as the corresponding simulation of hot forming will be presented. Finally, the hot forming behaviour and anticorrosive properties of both current products will be presented...|$|R
