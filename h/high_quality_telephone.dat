VTOA {{is one of}} the most promising ATM applications, which allows network operating companies to provide a less-expensive but relatively <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> <b>telephone</b> service, by employing voice-data compression and the e#cient transmission capabilities of AAL 2. We discuss several technical aspects of VTOA handling system architecture, such as the optimum basis for the node, i. e., STM versus ATM, the appropriate network structure, and suitable signalling. These key points are evaluated from the standpoints of economy, ease of implementation, and extensibility. Our proposed methods should provide the basis for constructing an e#cient and cost-e#ective VTOA handling network...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new spectral/temporal {{method is}} {{described}} for robust pitch tracking for both <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>telephone</b> speech. A previous {{version of this}} algorithm was presented as YAAPT (Kasi and Zahorian, 2002) [10]. In the current paper, a novel method is presented for spectral pitch tracking, using nonlinear processing to partially restore the potentially missing fundamental frequency. A frequency domain modified autocorrelation is {{used to determine the}} spacing between harmonic peaks in the spectrum. The frequency domain spectral track is then used to refine time-domain pitch candidates obtained using the “NCCF or Normalized Cross Correlation” reported by Talkin [1]. Dynamic programming is used to find the “best ” pitch track among all the candidates, using both local and transition costs. The algorithm was evaluated using the Keele pitch extraction reference database. Index Terms: speech analysis, pitch tracking, dynamic programmin...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a pitch detection algorithm that is extremely robust for both <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>telephone</b> speech. The kernel method for this algorithm is the Normalized Cross Correlation (NCCF) reported by David Talkin [16]. Major innovations include: processing {{of the original}} acoustic signal and a nonlinearly processed version of the signal to partially restore very weak F 0 components; intelligent peak picking to select multiple F 0 candidates and assign merit factors; and, incorporation of highly robust pitch contours obtained from smoothed versions of low frequency portions of spectrograms. Dynamic programming is used to find the “best” pitch track among all the candidates, using both local and transition costs. The algorithm has been evaluated using the Keele pitch extraction reference database as “ground truth” for both “high quality ” and “telephone” speech. For both types of speech, the error rates obtained are lower than the lowest reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} investigates if {{and how a}} more digitally centered communication between supervisors and employees satisfies employees’ needs regarding the communication with their supervisors and influences employees’ attitudes toward the supervisor and the job. In a cross-sectional online study, 261 employees rated their supervisors’ actual and ideal use of different communication channels (i. e., telephone, face-to-face, email) regarding quality and quantity. Employees’ job satisfaction and {{their perceptions of their}} supervisors’ effectiveness and team identification were measured as dependent variables. Employees perceived face-to-face communication to be of <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> than <b>telephone</b> and email communication, and they indicated a preference for more face-to-face communication with their supervisors than they actually had. Moreover, the perceived quality of communication, especially via faceto-face, was strongly and positively related to the dependent variables. These results provide insights into potential problems of increasing e-leadership in organizations. We conclude with recommendations to reduce these problems. status: publishe...|$|R

The <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university has often the quality academic programs, quality teaching faculty members, and quality students for establishing high educational standards. The faculty of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> universities engages in <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> research and produce <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> and quantity of new knowledge and publications. The graduates of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> universities usually obtain <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> professional positions.

Those universities that develop these quality characteristics offer a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education. Democratization of the university management practices plays a key role for a university to develop a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education and become a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university. In this study, democratization process includes the ownership, the practice of sharing the authority and responsibility, group decision-making, horizontal network organizational structure and long term employment practices of university management. Those universities utilizing these practices together and acting collectively as a team are able to achieve a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> education and become a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> university.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} voluntary established neighbourhood groups in the dissemination of environmental educational material. It used a participatory case study approach to involve eight neighbourhood groups in an education program disseminating information about wood-smoke pollution and how smoke could be minimised through correct woodheater operation. A primary goal {{of the program was}} {{to determine whether or not}} an environmental issue such as wood-smoke pollution could be linked in and 'piggybacked' on established groups which have other principal interests. An information kit about the problems associated with wood-smoke and clear steps that can be taken to reduce wood-smoke was prepared and given to eight neighbourhood groups in Hobart and Launceston, Tasmania. The information kit comprised of overheads for a seminar, an information booklet, and a pamphlet. The groups were asked to disseminate the information in any way they thought fit. The researcher acted as a facilitator and was available to participate in education efforts and provided support to the groups. The neighbourhood groups were surveyed to see what initiatives they took to distribute and promote the wood-smoke educational material. Observations were also made about the group processes within neighbourhood groups involved in the case study. The outcomes of the case study indicated that a considerable multiplier effect can occur by using established neighbourhood groups and their existing communication networks and interpersonal channels. The education activities carried out by the neighbourhood groups included public seminars on the topic of wood-smoke pollution, a door knocking campaign with wood-smoke pamphlets from the information kit, and education information was published in numerous newsletters. Overall the findings from the thesis indicate that established neighbourhood groups are willing to take environmental issues 'on-board' that are outside their principal interest. Observations of the groups that became more fully involved in the education program were encouraging, and a range of group characteristics were identified which would be useful to target suitable neighbourhood groups for future studies. Assessment of the information kit showed that the pamphlet and seminar materials were of <b>high</b> <b>quality.</b> A <b>telephone</b> survey conducted as part of the assessment of the case study activities revealed that council newsletters may have limited success as a means of disseminating information. This thesis has revealed that there are neighbourhood groups in the wider community that have established infrastructure, communication networks and channels that can benefit the distribution of environmental information. Supplying information to these groups on urban environmental issues such as the wood-smoke issue may provide a double benefit. Environmental education could be spread in an interpersonal manner and public interest and support for neighbourhood groups may increase...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} fitness {{consequences}} of foraging on patchy resources, consumption rates, growth rates and survivorship of Armadillidium vulgare were monitored while feeding in arenas {{in which the}} spatial distribution of patches of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food (powdered dicotyledonous leaf litter) was varied within a matrix of low quality food (powdered grass leaf litter). Predictions from behavioural experiments that these fitness correlates would be lower when <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food is more heterogeneously distributed in space were tested but not supported either by laboratory or field experiments. To investigate whether A. vulgare can develop the ability to relocate <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food patches, changes in foraging behaviour, over a comparable time period to that used in the fitness experiments, were monitored in arenas {{in which there was}} a <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food patch in a low quality matrix. A. vulgare increased its ability to relocate the position of <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> food over time.
