Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.|$|E
5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin <b>in</b> <b>adulthood</b> {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E

40|$|Palkovitz, RobThis {{study used}} data from Waves I, III, and IV of the National Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) {{to test whether}} parental religiousness and parental {{relationship}} quality (RQ) could predict the religiousness of their child during adolescence, emerging adulthood, and early adulthood. Parental data were obtained from either the participant's mother or father during Wave I only. Wave I adolescent participants were subsequently re-interviewed six years later (Wave III) and thirteen years later (Wave IV). This study also tested whether having a religious or spiritual experience that was life changing could predict religiousness <b>in</b> emerging <b>adulthood</b> and early adulthood. Finally, this study also tested whether previous levels of religiousness were predictive of religiousness in the future. The results demonstrate that parental religiousness and RQ have both a concurrent and longitudinal effect on children's religiousness. Mother's and father's religiousness significantly predicted their child's religiousness in adolescence and early adulthood. Neither parent's religiousness predicted their child's religiousness <b>in</b> emerging <b>adulthood.</b> Additionally, father RQ predicted their child's religiousness in adolescence and early <b>adulthood</b> but not <b>in</b> emerging <b>adulthood.</b> Mother RQ predicted their child's religiousness in adolescence only. Having a life changing religious or spiritual experience predicted religiousness <b>in</b> emerging <b>adulthood</b> but not <b>in</b> early <b>adulthood.</b> Religiousness <b>in</b> adolescence predicted religiousness <b>in</b> early <b>adulthood</b> but not <b>in</b> emerging <b>adulthood.</b> Religiousness <b>in</b> emerging <b>adulthood</b> predicted religiousness <b>in</b> early <b>adulthood,</b> but not consistently. These findings suggest that parents strongly influence their child's religious trajectories from adolescence into early adulthood. Although results here demonstrate a loss in the parental effect on religiousness <b>in</b> emerging <b>adulthood,</b> religiousness <b>in</b> early <b>adulthood</b> is once again predicted by and correlated with religiousness in adolescence and parental religiousness. The developmental patterns of religiousness from adolescence to early adulthood seen here are discussed in light of normative identity explorations {{as well as from}} Fowler's (1981) Faith Development Theory framework. Finally, the case for religious institutions serving as potential outlets to promote positive youth development (PYD) is presented.

40|$|Stress and {{inflammation}} are {{two very}} common, but also very complex processes that may affect cognitive decline <b>in</b> late <b>adulthood.</b> This study examined how the self-report of psychological stress and inflammatory biomarkers levels {{may be related to}} differences in trajectories of cognitive performance <b>in</b> late <b>adulthood.</b> We found weak, non-significant association between psychological stress and inflammatory biomarkers levels. Analyses also suggested that the inflammatory pathway may be important to cognition <b>in</b> late <b>adulthood,</b> since dual change growth curve model results suggested that higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and IL- 6) were associated with decrements in some aspects of cognitive performance <b>in</b> late <b>adulthood.</b> Moreover, greater psychological stress was associated with decreases in some aspects of cognitive performance <b>in</b> late <b>adulthood.</b> Greater psychological stress and/or its timing was associated with significant differences in cognitive performance levels or change on a measure of spatial abilities (Block Design), perceptual speed abilities (Symbol Digit), verbal abilities (Synonyms), and episodic recognition memory (Thurstone Picture Memory). Although these findings suggested that both stress and inflammation affect cognitive decline <b>in</b> late <b>adulthood,</b> final analyses that incorporated both psychological stress and inflammatory biomarkers as predictors of cognitive decline <b>in</b> late <b>adulthood</b> suggested limited findings of mediation for a measure of episodic recognition memory (Thurstone Picture Memory) ...|$|R
40|$|Close {{investigation}} of cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> is warranted {{as there is}} a prolongation of the period of risk of initiation beyond adolescence. Few studies have investigated the factors associated with patterns of cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> after the peak age of onset. This is an important period to investigate as risk factors for cannabis use can emerge throughout the life-course and the opportunity to influence adverse developmental pathways can be extended beyond childhood and adolescence. This thesis examined the correlates, predictors and consequences of patterns of cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood,</b> using two successive waves of data from 2, 404 young adults enrolled in the PATH Through Life Project, an Australian longitudinal survey of the influence of lifestyle and social factors on health. The thesis demonstrates that, although cannabis use tends to decline <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood,</b> a notable proportion of young adults remain involved with the drug. Relapse to cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> is not uncommon among former users. Those who first use cannabis <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> generally do not continue or progress to intensive use. A range of factors spanning numerous domains are correlated with cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood.</b> A close connection exists between licit drugs and cannabis use. Early cannabis use and the pattern of cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> are particularly important predictors of subsequent use of the drug. Regular cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> increases the likelihood of later psychosocial and substance use problems including educational underachievement, heavy drinking, tobacco use, cannabis dependence and other illicit drug use. In contrast, ceasing cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> has considerable benefits in terms of reducing several potential harms (mental health problems, cannabis dependence, other illicit drug use) and increasing adult role participation. Risk and protective factors associated with variability and stability of cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> include gender, first use at an early age, dimensions of personality, religiosity, conflict and hostility in friendships and an environment of licit drug use. The results provide a clearer picture of the patterns of cannabis use <b>in</b> young <b>adulthood</b> and the factors that contribute to explaining them. The findings of this thesis make an important contribution to the development of prevention and intervention strategies for young adults by drawing attention to specific areas of vulnerability and resistance...|$|R

5|$|Tourette's {{is defined}} {{as part of a}} {{spectrum}} of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Extreme Tourette's <b>in</b> <b>adulthood,</b> though sensationalized in the media, is a rarity; tics are often unnoticed by casual observers.|$|E
5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes <b>in</b> <b>adulthood</b> are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime <b>in</b> <b>adulthood.</b> Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Polycystic {{kidney disease}} (PKD) is a slowly {{progressive}} disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed {{with a low}} incidence in Maine Coons, PKD {{appears to be a}} misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but gene sequencing of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well <b>in</b> <b>adulthood.</b> Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment.
