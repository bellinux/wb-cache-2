25|$|The {{international}} <b>humanitarian</b> <b>organisation</b> Médecins Sans Frontières {{originated in}} response to the suffering in Biafra. During the crisis, French medical volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. French doctor Bernard Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and, when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.|$|E

This research effort included a review of the current literature on humanitarian logistics and interviews with representatives of <b>humanitarian</b> <b>organisations</b> that intervened in Kosovo during the war period (1998 - 1999). The humanitarian crisis of the Kosovo war revealed the absence of training and guidelines regarding logistics management in the majority of the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>organisations</b> involved in Kosovo. Furthermore, it was also proved {{that there is a need}} for improvements in the field of humanitarian logistics, and aid agencies can learn a great deal regarding supply chain management from the corporate community. Also, there was a lack of cooperation among the above mentioned <b>humanitarian</b> <b>organisations</b> but eventually many of these organisations became conscious of the advantages resulting from logistics alliances. humanitarian crises; logistics management; humanitarian organisations; coordination; knowledge; technology; Kosovo crisis; humanitarian logistics; training; guidelines; supply chain management; SCM; logistics alliances...|$|R

This study explores whether such tools are also effective in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>organisations.</b> Our study indicates that: 1) institutionalised socialisation tactics have a positive effect and individualised socialisation tactics {{have a negative effect on}} employees' organisational commitment; 2) some HRM tools could have the opposite effects than expected from the literature; 3) there seems to be no relation between organisational commitment and turnover intentions.

Furthermore, the results outline the main reasons for organisations to tackle the turnover and bring to light why the issue is so complex. Although for most of the organisations interviewed staff turnover is a concern, there are still improvements to do. Recruitments should be update and broaden while local staff taking more into consideration.
