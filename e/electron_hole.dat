5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an <b>electron</b> <b>hole</b> in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{active region}} of an organic device {{consists}} of two materials, one electron donor and one electron acceptor. When a photon is converted into an <b>electron</b> <b>hole</b> pair, typically in the donor material, the charges tend to remain bound {{in the form of}} an exciton, separating when the exciton diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface, unlike most other solar cell types. The short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices. Nanostructured interfaces, sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions, can improve performance.|$|E
25|$|Photocatalytic {{coatings}} {{are those}} that include components (additives) that catalyze reactions, generally through a free radical mechanism, when excited by light. The photocatalytic activity (PCA) of a material provides a measure of its reactive potential, based {{on the ability of}} the material to create an <b>electron</b> <b>hole</b> pair when exposed to ultra-violet light. Free radicals formed can oxidize and therefore breakdown organic materials, such as latex binders found in waterborne coatings. Antimicrobial coatings systems take advantage of this by including photocatalytically active compounds in their formulations (i.e. titanium dioxide) that cause the coating to “flake” off over time. These flakes carry the microbes along with them, leaving a “clean” coating behind. Systems like this are often described to be self-cleaning.|$|E

40|$|We report here further {{results from}} the {{three-dimensional}} particle-in-cell simulations of the electron-beam driven <b>electron</b> <b>holes.</b> We focus here on (i) the transformation of oscillatory waves driven by the electron-beam instability into <b>electron</b> <b>holes,</b> (ii) the continued evolution and propagation of <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> after their formation, including merging of <b>electron</b> <b>holes,</b> and (iii) {{the effects of the}} evolution on the plasma density and ion velocity distribution function. We find that initially electron-beam modes with perpendicular wave numbers k ^ = 0 and as well as k ^ 0 are driven resonantly below the electron plasma frequency of the target plasma. The modes interact nonlinearly and modulate each other both in space and time, producing wave structures with finite perpendicular scale lengths. Nonlinear evolution of such wave structures generates the <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> in the simulations. Initially, a large number of <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> form in the plasma. Their merging yields continuously a decreasing number of <b>electron</b> <b>holes.</b> The propagation velocity of the <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> evolves dynamically and is affected by their merging. At late times only a few <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> are left in the simulation and they decay by emitting low-frequency electrostatic whistler waves just above the lower hybrid (LH) frequency v lh. These waves, which are long structures parallel to the ambient magnetic field B 0 and quite short transverse to B 0, are associated with similar structures in the plasma density, producing density filaments. It turns out that electron-beam driven plasmas, in general, develop such filaments at some stage of the evolution of the beam-driven waves. In view of the excitation of the LH waves near v lh, which could resonate with the ions, an analysis shows {{that it is possible to}} heat transversely the ions in a time scale of a few seconds in the auroral return current plasma, in which <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> and transversely heated ions have been simultaneously observed...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{acoustic}} (IA) solitons {{are accompanied}} by vortex-shaped nonlinear structures (e. g. hollows, plateaus or humps) in the electron distribution function, called <b>electron</b> <b>holes,</b> portraying trapped <b>electrons.</b> These structures appear as charged flexible clouds (shielded by the background plasma) in the phase space with their own inertia, depending {{on the number of}} trapped electrons. According to simulation studies, <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> tend to merge in pairs until one accumulative hole remains in the simulation box. This tendency has been analytically and qualitatively explained in the frame of the energy conservation principle. However, <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> accompanying IA solitons should not merge due to stability of IA solitons against mutual collisions. In this report based on a fully kinetic simulation approach, detailed study of the collisions of IA solitons reveals the behavior of <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> under these two conflicting predictions, i. e. stability against mutual collisions and merging tendency. Four main results are reported here. Firstly, we find that among the three different types of collisions possible for <b>electron</b> <b>holes,</b> just two of them happen for <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> accompanying IA solitons. We present different collisions, e. g. two large/small and large versus small holes, to cover all the these three different types of collisions. Secondly, we show that although <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> merge during collisions of IA solitons, the stability of IA solitons forces the merged hole to split and form new <b>electron</b> <b>holes.</b> Thirdly, we reveal that holes share their trapped population during collisions. Post-collision holes incorporate some parts of the oppositely propagating before-collision holes. Finally, it is shown that the newly added population of trapped electrons goes through a spiral path inside the after-collision holes hole because of dissipative effects.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Electron</b> {{phase-space}} <b>holes</b> are {{regions of}} de-pleted electron density commonly generated during the non-linear {{stage of the}} two-stream instability. Recently, bipolar electric eld structures | a signature of <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> | have been identied in the acceleration region of the auroral ionosphere. This paper compares the evolution of <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> in 2 -D and 3 -D using massively-parallel PIC simula-tions. In 2 -D, the holes decay after hundreds of plasma periods while emitting electrostatic whistler waves. In the 3 -D simulations, <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> also go unstable and generate whistlers but, due to physical processes not present in 2 -D, energy flows out of the whistlers and into highly perpen-dicular lower hybrid modes. As {{a result of this}} dierence, 3 -D holes do not decay as far as 2 -D holes. The dierences between 2 -D and 3 -D evolution may have important impli-cations for hole longevity and wave generation in the auroral ionosphere...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePrevious multi-dimensional {{particle}} simulations {{have shown}} that electron phase-holes can be formed during the nonlinear evolution of bi-stream instability. In these holes, the parallel cut of the parallel electric field (E∥) has bipolar structures while the parallel cut of the perpendicular electric field (E⊥) has unipolar structures. In this paper, two-dimensional (2 D) electrostatic particle-in-cell simulations are performed to investigate the evolution of E⊥ in such <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> for different plasma conditions, and the generation mechanism of the unipolar structures of E⊥ is also discussed. The electrons trapped in <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> bounce in the parallel direction, which leads to transverse instability (Muschietti et al., 2000). At the same time, they gyrate in the background magnetic field, which tends to stabilize <b>electron</b> <b>holes.</b> In this way, the trapped electrons are forced to accumulate locally, and the charge density has variations along the perpendicular direction inside the <b>electron</b> <b>holes.</b> The balance between these two effects leads to the following results: in weakly magnetized plasma (Ωe ωpe), <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> have one-dimensional structures along the direction perpendicular to the background magnetic field within which a series of islands (with alternate positive and negative E⊥) develop because of the variations of the charge density along the perpendicular direction. Therefore one recovers that a parallel cut of E⊥ has unipolar structures {{at the location of}} the holes. Present results show that the unipolar structure of E⊥ in <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> is attributed to the balance between the electron transverse instability and the stabilization of the background magnetic field. The unipolar structures of E⊥ in <b>electron</b> <b>holes</b> last for hundreds to thousands of electron plasma periods. They are destroyed and the streaked structures are formed in the whole simulation domain after the electrostatic whistler waves are excited and have sufficiently large amplitude. The influences of the initial perpendicular thermal velocity of electrons (via temperature anisotropy) and the drift speed of electron beam on the structures of E⊥ are also analyzed in details. At last, the relevance between our simulation results and the unipolar structures of the parallel cut of E⊥ observed in the auroral region is discussed...|$|R
