He studied his map. By flying across to the {{vicinity}} of Hempstead Harbor and making a long diagonal <b>flight</b> <b>over</b> <b>water,</b> straight over to Stamford, he would increase the factor of danger, but save many miles; and the specifications of the race permitted him to choose any course to New Haven. Thinking only of the new route, taking time only to nod good-by to Martin Dockerill and Hank Odell, he was off, into the air.|$|E

It drinks by making repeated low <b>flights</b> <b>over</b> <b>water,</b> raising its wings and scooping up water with its tongue. It may forage over pastureland, in villages and round streetlights.

50|$|Adult red admirals occur most {{frequently}} during summer. They over-winter as adults, so {{can be seen}} on warm winter days. They are long lived, surviving up to six months in the summer, and perhaps nine months for those which overwinter. The adults feed on nectar from various plant species (native and introduced) and occasionally on seepage of sap. They are strong fliers, but their short flights when feeding and ovipositing are very erratic. <b>Flights</b> <b>over</b> <b>water</b> or mountain ranges are straight and fast, characteristic of a migrating butterfly, but no migration within New Zealand has been reported.|$|R

50|$|Long <b>flights</b> <b>over</b> <b>water</b> may {{occasionally}} be undertaken. A {{young white}} stork ringed at the nest in Denmark subsequently appeared in England, where it spent some days before moving on.

That island is 500 km (320 mi) from Africa, and twice {{as far from the}} European mainland. Migration through the Middle East may be hampered by the khamsin, winds bringing gusty overcast days unsuitable for flying. In these situations, flocks of white storks sit out the adverse weather on the ground, standing and facing into the wind.|$|R
50|$|Sanderson {{returned}} to the United States in March 1920 and was assigned for instruction at Officers Training School within Quantico Base, Virginia. He graduated one year later and was subsequently selected for special flight with De Havilland 4A plane from Washington, D.C. to Santo Domingo. Sandy set a new record in then-longest round-trip <b>flight</b> <b>over</b> <b>water</b> and land and received Distinguished Flying Cross for this feat. He was also commissioned Second lieutenant in the regular Marine Corps on May 2, 1921.|$|E
50|$|As part {{of their}} spring migration, {{portions}} of the population fly from the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico across the Gulf of Mexico, arriving first in Florida and Louisiana. This feat is impressive, as a 800 km, non-stop <b>flight</b> <b>over</b> <b>water</b> would seemingly require a caloric energy that far exceeds an adult hummingbird's body weight of 3 g. However, researchers discovered the tiny birds can double their fat mass in preparation for their Gulf crossing, then expend the entire calorie reserve from fat during the 20-hour non-stop crossing when food and water are unavailable.|$|E
50|$|Each autumn, from August into December, tens of {{thousands}} of hawks, kites, falcons, eagles, vultures, osprey, and harriers are funneled by the peninsular shape of Marin County into the headlands.

Abundant populations of small mammals protected by the park are one resource that helps maintain the large number of visiting raptors in the Headlands during the fall, but the strong onshore winds hitting the hills of the Headlands provide cold updrafts and hot late summer days provide warm thermals that allow these birds to fly more efficiently.|$|E
