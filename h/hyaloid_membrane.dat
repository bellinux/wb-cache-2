40|$|Diabetic cystoid macular oedema (DME) is {{a common}} cause of visual acuity (VA) decrease. Good {{anatomical}} results and VA of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in cases of macular hole internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling leads to usage of this technique in DME. A favorable result even in a case without vitreoretinal traction leads to conclusion that pathogenesis of this disease is different. We analyzed retrospectively 20 eyes from 20 patients with DME that had undergone PPV and ILM peeling. Half of them were laser treated 6 months before surgery. All eyes had an attached posterior <b>hyaloids</b> <b>membrane</b> in the macular region, but without thickening and without traction. Median duration of DME {{at the time of}} PPV was 18 months (range 12 – 24 months). The median preoperative best-corrected VA of 0. 4 (range 0. 01 – 1. 0), improved to a median postoperative VA of 0. 55 (range 0. 01 – 1. 0). Ten eyes without preoperative laser coagulation had a median VA improvement of 77 %, while 10 eyes with preoperative macular laser treatment had a median VA improvement of 14. 8 %. In all 20 eyes DME was no longer visible on microscopic examination after a median period of 3 months after PPV. PPV and ILM peeling resulted in the resolution of oedema, with an improvement in VA in the majority of cases. Eyes without preoperative macular photocoagulation had a significantly higher visual improvement than eyes with preoperative laser treatment. A randomized controlled prospective trial of PPV versus laser is needed to determine the role of PPV as a treatment modality for DME...|$|R

The flakes are widespread. One report suggested that the granular flakes were from abnormalities of the basement membrane in epithelial cells, and that they were distributed widely throughout the body and not just within structures of the eye. There is some research suggesting that the material may be produced in the iris pigment epithelium, ciliary epithelium, or the peripheral anterior lens epithelium.

Methods: We reviewed the clinical records of four consecutive patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy in one eye for the treatment of optic disc pit-associated maculopathy, with an emphasis on the preoperative condition of the posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane.</b> Results: Two of four eyes were confirmed to have an attached posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane,</b> which was subsequently removed during surgery. Following vitrectomy, these two eyes experienced an improvement in visual acuity with complete retinal attachment of the macula.

This article presents both classifications of a PVD by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and of a shallow PVD by optical coherence tomography (OCT). By biomicroscopy, the vitreous condition is determined based on {{the presence or absence}} of a PVD. The PVD then is classified as either a complete posterior vitreous detachment (C-PVD) or a partial posterior vitreous detachment (P-PVD). A C-PVD is further divided into a C-PVD with collapse and a C-PVD without collapse, while a P-PVD is divided into a P-PVD with shrinkage of the posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> (P-PVD with shrinkage) and a P-PVD without shrinkage of the posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> (P-PVD without shrinkage). A P-PVD without shrinkage has a subtype characterized by vitreous gel attachment through the premacular hole in a posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> to the macula (P-PVD without shrinkage [M]). By OCT, a shallow PVD is classified as the absence of a shallow PVD or as a shallow PVD. A shallow PVD is then subclassified as a shallow PVD without shrinkage of the posterior vitreous cortex, a shallow PVD with shrinkage of the posterior vitreous cortex, and a peripheral shallow PVD. A shallow PVD without shrinkage of the posterior vitreous cortex has two subtypes: an age-related shallow PVD and a perifoveal PVD associated with a macular hole.

Since the iH technique uses the phaco tip to intentionally vacuum the intraocular fluid in order to induce the irrigation dynamic pressure for cortical-capsular cleavage, there is {{a reduction in the}} intraocular pressure (IOP) from the bottle-height-dependent hydrostatic pressure. Thus, since the peak irrigation pressure derived from the phaco tip sleeve will be limited by the height of the irrigation fluid bottle, this is advantageous in helping to avoid excessively high IOP during cortical-capsular hydrodissection. Using this technique, we were able to effectively perform phacoemulsification without complications in 607 of 609 cataract eyes.

Current understanding of the anatomy of the zonule and the attachments of the vitreous zonule to the anterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> is incomplete. Recent studies have demonstrated three components of the vitreous zonule: (1) anterior vitreous zonule (previously “hyalocapsular” zonule), which attaches the ciliary plexus in the valleys of the ciliary processes to the anterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> in the region medial to the ciliary body and Weiger’s ligament; (2) intermediate vitreous zonule, which attaches the ciliary plexus to the anterior hyaloid peripherally; and (3) posterior vitreous zonule, which creates a sponge-like ring at the attachment zone that anchors the pars plana zonules. The pars plana zonules attach posteriorly to the elastic choroid above the ora serrata. Analysis of the computer-animated model demonstrates the synchronized movements of the accommodative structures in accommodation and disaccommodation.

40|$|AbstractThere are yet {{no reports}} in the {{literature}} describing the mechanism of macular hole (MH) formation associated with fibrovascular proliferation in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We report four cases of MHs in diabetic retinopathy with fibrovascular proliferation; formation of MHs were studied using sequential pre-MH optical coherence tomography (OCT). In Case 1, initial OCT revealed tractional schisis and cysts with fovea detachment. An MH with bowl-shaped detachment was noted within 6 weeks. In Case 2, initial OCT revealed thickened posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> with vitreomacular traction. Five {{and a half years}} later, OCT showed MH formation with possible vitreomacular separation. Some epiretinal membrane was also noted in the macula area. In Case 3, initial OCT revealed tractional retinal elevation from the superonasal area to the fovea with macular thinning. An MH with detachment developed 7 weeks later. In Case 4, initial OCT revealed macula-involved retinal detachment with traction. An MH was noted 4 weeks later. The analysis of sequential OCT findings in these four cases suggests that strong vitreoretinal adhesion and traction of fibrovascular proliferation may induce an MH without going through the same evolutionary phases as those characteristic of idiopathic MHs...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} OCT retinal mapping in determining the configuration of a vitreomacular adhesion and selecting a meridian for entry into the subhyaloid space in patients with vitreomacular traction syndrome. Methods: Six consecutive patients (6 eyes) with vitreomacular traction syndrome underwent vitrectomy with peeling of posterior hyaloid. Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) retinal mapping was performed preoperatively. Access to the subhyaloid space was made by creating an opening with a 25 gauge needle at a location where the detached posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> was farthest from the retinal surface. The location was selected based on six preoperative meridional OCT scans. The posterior hyaloid was then gently peeled off in a circular fashion around the fovea with a micropick. Visual acuity and foveal thicknesses were measured before the operation and 3 months afterwards. Results: After the operation, visual acuity improved and central macular thicknesses were reduced significantly in all six patients. The best corrected visual acuity improved from 0. 4 to 0. 75 with a mean increase by 3. 5 lines on a Snellen chart 3 months after the operation.

Three eyes showed an epiretinal membrane, and one eye showed traction of a posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> to the fovea. The chronic cystoid space changed into an LMH by rupture of its inner wall due to traction.

We describe four cases of traumatic cataract with posterior capsular rupture and an in vitro model built {{to evaluate the}} optimal infusion pressure during surgery. Results. All patients underwent cataract surgery. By using an anterior chamber maintainer to elevate infusion pressure, we safely performed cataract extraction without phacoemulsification. At 3 days after surgery, visual acuity was greater than 20 / 25 in all patients, without any complications. Phacoemulsification would also be feasible under anterior chamber maintainer infusion in a similar case of traumatic cataract with posterior capsular rupture during intravitreal injection. In addition, an in vitro model that we established using pig’s eyes revealed that the anterior chamber remained stable when the height of infusion bottle was 50 – 90 [*]mmHg, whereas shallowing of the anterior chamber occurred when the height of infusion bottle was reduced to 40 [*]mmHg, and corneal edema occurred when the height of infusion bottle was raised to 100 [*]mmHg. Conclusions. During management of traumatic cataract with posterior capsular rupture, using an anterior chamber maintainer to maintain optimal infusion pressure may {{reduce the risk of}} anterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> breakup and vitreous loss...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{detail the}} {{clinical}} findings in a British family with molecularly characterised Wagner syndrome. Background: Only {{in the last}} year has the specific genetic defect in Wagner syndrome been identified, and the background literature of the molecular genetics is outlined. Clinical and laboratory findings in a second case of Wagner syndrome are included to highlight difficulties that can be encountered when identifying pathogenic mutations for disorders arising in complex genes. Methods: Mutation screening was performed using PCR and RT-PCR. Results: A heterozygous mutation was found converting the donor splice site of exon 8 of the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 2 (CSPG 2). This is the same mutation that has been reported in the original Wagner pedigree. The main clinical features of Wagner syndrome are vitreous syneresis, thickening and incomplete separation of the posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane,</b> chorioretinal changes accompanied by subnormal electroretinographic responses, an ectopic fovea and early-onset cataract. A clinical feature present in this family, but previously undescribed, is anterior uveitis without formation of synechiae. Wagner syndrome has a progressive course, resulting in loss of vision {{even in the absence of}} retinal detachment. Conclusion: On a background of considerable confusion regarding the distinction between Wagner syndrome and predominantly ocular Stickler syndrome, it is now apparent the that two conditions are bot...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{report a}} case of {{successful}} drainage of a large pre-macular haemorrhage using laser photo-disruption of the posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case report. RESULTS: A 47 -year-old man presented acutely to our emergency department complaining of a 24 -h history of sudden onset, painless and persistent loss of vision in his left eye. Immediately before noticing this loss of vision, he had been vomiting violently from excessive alcohol intake. The left visual acuity was counting fingers. Dilated fundoscopy of the left eye revealed a large pre-macular haemorrhage which was 14 disc diametres in size. Clotting investigations were normal. A diagnosis of valsalva retinopathy was made and the patient elected to receive a prompt neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser posterior hyaloidotomy as an outpatient. At 1 week follow-up, the haemorrhage had drained completely into the vitreous space revealing a healthy macula and the visual acuity had improved to 6 / 12 unaided. At 6 -month follow-up the left visual acuity stabilised at 6 / 9 unaided. CONCLUSION: Nd:YAG laser posterior hyaloidotomy is a useful outpatient procedure for successful clearance of large pre-macular haemorrhages that offers patients rapid recovery of visual acuity and the avoidance of more invasive intraocular surgery...|$|E
40|$|A b s t r a c t Diabetic cystoid macular oedema (DME) is {{a common}} cause of visual acuity decrease. Good {{anatomical}} results and visual acuity (VA) of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) {{in a case of}} a macular hole with internal limiting membrane peeling leads to the use of this technique in DME. A favourable result even in a case without vitreoretinal traction leads to the conclusion that pathogenesis of this disease is different. We analysed retrospectively 20 eyes from 20 patients with DME that had undergone PPV and peeling ILM. Half of them were laser treated before surgery. All eyes had an attached posterior <b>hyaloid</b> <b>membrane</b> in the macular region, but without thickening and without traction. We examined parts of excised tissues by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Median duration of DME at the time of PPV was approximately 18. 0 months (range 12 – 24 months). The median preoperative best corrected VA of 0. 4 (range 0, 01 – 1, 0), improved to a median postoperative VA of 0. 55 (range 0, 01 – 1, 0). Ten eyes without preoperative laser coagulation had a median VA improvement of 112 %, while 10 eyes with preoperative focal macular laser treatment had a median VA improvement of 17 %. In all 20 eyes, DME was no longer visible on microscopic examination after a median period of 3. 0 month...|$|E
