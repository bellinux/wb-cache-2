5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant <b>families</b> <b>are</b> eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} the tiny mouse lemurs to the {{relatively}} large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant <b>families</b> <b>are</b> targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{families}} in Liverpool, the McCartney and Mohan <b>families</b> <b>are</b> of Irish descent. Jim worked {{for most of}} his life in the cotton trade, as well as playing in ragtime and jazz bands in Liverpool, while Mary was a trained nurse and midwife.|$|E

50|$|Each Serer {{family has}} a totem ("Taana"). Totems are {{prohibitions}} as well as guardians. They can be animals, plants etc. For example, the totem of the Joof <b>family</b> <b>is</b> the antelope. Any brutality against this animal by the Joof <b>family</b> <b>is</b> prohibited. This respect gives the Joof family holy protection. The totem of the Njie <b>family</b> <b>is</b> the lion; the totem of the Sène <b>family</b> <b>is</b> the hare and for the Sarr <b>family</b> <b>is</b> the giraffe and the camel.|$|R
5000|$|Members of this <b>family</b> <b>are</b> {{recognised}} {{by their}} wing-venation, where the areola postica is fused to the M-vein, {{giving rise to}} the so-called discoidal cell.

5|$|The various fish groups {{account for}} more than half of {{vertebrate}} species. There are almost 28,000 known extant species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 sharks, rays, and chimeras and about 108 hagfish and lampreys. A third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these <b>families</b> <b>are</b> Cyprinidae, Gobiidae, Cichlidae, Characidae, Loricariidae, Balitoridae, Serranidae, Labridae, and Scorpaenidae. About 64 <b>families</b> <b>are</b> monotypic, containing only one species. The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.|$|E
5|$|Within {{protease}} superfamilies {{that contain}} {{a mixture of}} nucleophiles (e.g. the PA clan), <b>families</b> <b>are</b> designated by their catalytic nucleophile (C=cysteine proteases, S=serine proteases).|$|E
5|$|All the {{families}} were formerly treated {{as part of}} a single order, Mecoptera. The relationships between the <b>families</b> <b>are</b> however a matter of debate. The cladogram, from Cracraft and Donoghue 2004, places the Nannochoristidae as a separate order, with the Boreidae, sister to the Siphonaptera, also as its own order. The Eomeropidae is suggested to be sister {{to the rest of the}} Mecoptera, with the position of the Bittacidae unclear. Of those other families, the Meropeidae is the most basal, and the relationships of the rest not completely clear.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{abundant}} {{throughout the world}} and live {{in a wide range}} of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five <b>families</b> <b>are</b> found throughout the continent. 450 species are found in Australia. Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests.|$|E
5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan <b>families</b> <b>are</b> much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia. In compiling this, the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 <b>families</b> <b>are</b> recognized as valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, with or without a fossil record.

5|$|In the Book of Nehemiah, the Ashdodites seem to {{represent}} the whole nation of the Philistines in the sixth century BCE, the speech of Ashdod (which half of the children from mixed <b>families</b> <b>are</b> described as adopting) would simply be the general Philistine dialect.

5|$|Siphonaptera is a {{relatively}} small order of insects: members of the order undergo complete metamorphosis and are secondarily wingless (their ancestors had wings which modern forms have lost). In 2005, Medvedev listed 2005 species in 242 genera, and despite subsequent descriptions of new species, bringing the total up to around 2500 species, {{this is the most}} complete database available. The order is divided into four infraorders and eighteen families. Some <b>families</b> <b>are</b> exclusive to a single host group; these include the Malacopsyllidae (armadillos), Ischnopsyllidae (bats) and Chimaeropsyllidae (elephant shrews).|$|E

5|$|The Kačić family {{originated}} in the Zadar hinterland near the Krka river, and when King Petar Krešimir IV mastered the Pagania, {{some members of the}} family likely relocated to the area between the Cetina and Neretva rivers. The social distinction between noble Kačićs in the Zadar-Biograd hinterland and the princely (knezes) Kačićs from Omiš remains uncertain, but the two <b>families</b> <b>are</b> considered to be related. The clearest established connection is the noble Hodimir, mentioned in 1207 in a charter of St. Peter's Church in Bubnjani near Tinj, whose son Nikola was an Omiš knez.|$|E
