5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Two skull bones, the {{lacrimal}} and postorbital bones, projected {{into the}} <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> {{from the front}} and back, nearly dividing it into two compartments. The eye would have been located in the upper compartment, which was tilted slightly outwards in Carnotaurus, perhaps providing some degree of binocular vision. The lacrimal and postorbital also met above the <b>eye</b> <b>socket,</b> to form a ridge or brow above the eye.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the rear}} {{part of the}} skull is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout {{equipped}} with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the external naris (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half of the skull, diagonally above the <b>eye</b> <b>socket,</b> which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The infratemporal fenestra, located below the <b>eye</b> <b>socket,</b> was long and narrow. Behind the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> was the supratemporal fenestra, which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been located {{in front of the}} <b>eye</b> <b>socket,</b> although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull, the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with Dicraeosaurus but absent in other sauropods included the fused frontal bones and the notably long basipterygoid processes, bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate.|$|E
25|$|Mongoloids {{have the}} {{smallest}} eyeballs, Negroids have eyeballs of medium size, and Caucasoids {{have the largest}} eyeballs. This eyeball size pattern is different for {{the size of the}} <b>eye</b> <b>sockets</b> in which the eyeballs reside, however, since Negroids have the smallest <b>eye</b> <b>sockets,</b> Caucasoids have <b>eye</b> <b>sockets</b> of medium size, and Mongoloids have the largest <b>eye</b> <b>sockets.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{vertical}} {{distances of}} the openings of the <b>eye</b> <b>sockets</b> of Mongoloids are the longest, the vertical distances of the openings of the <b>eye</b> <b>sockets</b> of Europeans are intermediate, and the vertical distances of the openings of the <b>eye</b> <b>sockets</b> of aboriginal Australians and Melanesians are the shortest.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{abnormal}} forehead, {{there is}} less space for the normal facial features to develop. This results in shallow <b>eye</b> <b>sockets</b> and flat cheekbones. The shallow <b>eye</b> <b>sockets</b> make the <b>eyes</b> more prominent or bulging and cause the eyes to be more separated than normal (hypertelorism). The underdeveloped <b>eye</b> <b>sockets,</b> cheekbones, and lower jaw cause the face to appear flat. Furthermore, the minor downward slant of the eyes along with the drooping eyelids (ptosis) adds to the overall unevenness of the face.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the oval-shaped <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> of Tanystropheus, the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> of Dinocephalosaurus {{appears to}} be peach-shaped, with a narrow {{anterior}} end. On {{the top of the}} skull, the parietal is broad and flattened, bearing no trace of the midline crest found in Tanystropheus. The jugal only has two processes, missing the third backward-projecting process present in most other reptiles. Also missing are the retroarticular process of the posterior (rear) lower jaw (another point of distinction from Tanystropheus), as well as additional teeth and a cavity between the pterygoid bones on the palate.|$|E
5|$|Maxillae and a {{lacrimal}} (the main tooth-bearing {{bones of}} the upper jaw, and the bone that forms the anterior margin of the <b>eye</b> <b>socket,</b> respectively) recovered in 1999 by the Sino-Belgian Dinosaur Expeditions were found to pertain to Velociraptor, {{but not to the}} type species V. mongoliensis. Pascal Godefroit and colleagues named these bones V. osmolskae (for Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska) in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (<b>eye</b> <b>socket).</b> The eyes were large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E

5|$|The head of Scelidosaurus was small, {{about twenty}} {{centimetres}} long, and elongated. The skull was low {{in side view}} and triangular in top view, longer than it was wide, {{similar to that of}} earlier ornithischians. The snout, largely formed by the nasal bones, was flat on top. Scelidosaurus still had the five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) seen in basal ornithischians: apart from the nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs, the fenestra antorbitalis and the upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown, as with many later armoured forms. In fact, the upper temporal fenestrae were very large, forming conspicuous round openings {{in the top of the}} rear skull, serving as attachment areas for the powerful muscles that closed the lower jaws. The <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> was slightly overshadowed in its front part by the prefrontal bone. Behind it, the upper rim of the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> was formed by the supraorbital bone. A study by Susannah Maidment e.a. concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of three elements, one in front, the next in rear, and the third at the inner side.|$|E
5|$|The {{lacrimal}} fossa, {{a depression}} in the skull, {{is located on the}} upper surface of the skull in most lorisids, but Schwartz found that it was further to the back, inside the orbit (<b>eye</b> <b>socket)</b> in the false potto and the slow loris. Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 pottos examined. The coronoid process of the mandible is said to be more hooked in the false potto than in the potto and slow loris.|$|E
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E

5|$|The false potto {{generally}} {{resembles a}} small potto, {{but according to}} Schwartz it differs in having a longer tail, shorter spines on its neck and chest vertebrae, a smaller, less complex spine on the second neck vertebra, an entepicondylar foramen (an opening in the humerus, or upper arm bone), a lacrimal fossa (a depression in the skull) that is located inside the <b>eye</b> <b>socket,</b> a smaller upper third premolar and molar, and higher-crowned cheekteeth, among other traits. However, many of these traits are variable among pottos; for example, one researcher found entepicondylar foramina in {{almost half of the}} specimens in his sample of pottos.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself was {{probably}} not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, {{an opening in the}} skull between the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the <b>eye</b> <b>socket,</b> then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E

5|$|The {{main body}} of the {{lacrimal}} is a rounded square with both faces of the bone are concave. Its contact with the nasal is rather limited in both species. The oval-shaped antorbital fenestra is small, being only 9% the length of the eye socket; its presence is unique to both species of the genus among atoposaurids. Meanwhile, the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> is large and oval, being 54% longer than it is tall. The drop-shaped palpebrals project out from the tops of the eye sockets. In both species, the back two-thirds of the inner surface of the palpebral is slightly concave. Both species have a squamosal in which the back third is bevelled; in K. langenbergensis, the outer margin is somewhat convex.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{is low and}} narrow, with a long premaxilla and maxilla {{compared}} to those of Tanystropheus. Both the premaxilla and the maxilla meet at the anteroventral (front bottom) corner {{and contribute to the}} border of the nostril, which is located at the anterior (front) end of a long recess that extends along the snout in front of the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> (the antorbital depression). The bottom margins of the two snout bones are respectively lined with five and twelve long and nail-like teeth; the third premaxillary and fourth and fifth maxillary teeth are distinctly fang-like. The lower jaw has fifteen preserved teeth, with three of them being fang-like. By comparison, the teeth in adult Tanystropheus are sharp pegs, while they are tricuspid (bearing three cusps) in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could reach more than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the eyes on the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (<b>eye</b> <b>socket)</b> was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E

5|$|Like Probactrosaurus {{and other}} hadrosauroids, {{the back of}} the maxilla connects to the jugal – which borders the bottom of the <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> and infratemporal fenestra – through a finger-like {{projection}} that fits into a recess. The bottom margin of the jugal bears a strong flange beneath the level of the infratemporal fenestra; this is also seen in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and several other hadrosauroids. Connecting to the jugal from above is the postorbital, which has a roughened surface where it borders the eye sockets (like Protohadros), but the side of the bone is otherwise smooth. At {{the back of the}} skull, the quadrate articulates with the squamosal with a joint that is D-shaped when viewed from the top. The left and right squamosals would have contacted each other extensively, being only separated at the back by a small process of the parietal. The supraoccipital bone, which forms the top portion {{of the back of the}} skull, is flat and nearly vertical, as is the case in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids.|$|E
5|$|One month later, Jupiter {{visits the}} narrator and asks him to come immediately, fearing that Legrand has been bitten by the bug and gone insane. Once they arrive on the island, Legrand insists that the bug will {{be the key to}} {{restoring}} his lost fortune. He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed {{at the end of one}} branch. At Legrand's direction, Jupiter drops the bug through one <b>eye</b> <b>socket</b> and Legrand paces out to a spot where the group begins to dig. Finding nothing there, Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop the bug through the skull's other eye; they choose a different spot to dig, this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry. They estimate the total value at $1.5 million, but even that figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (<b>eye</b> <b>socket),</b> the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E
