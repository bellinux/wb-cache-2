5|$|The {{most obvious}} technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project.

5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect <b>for</b> <b>others.</b> It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. <b>For</b> <b>others,</b> the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at least initially, they simply did not have the motivation to leave.|$|E

In his later years, after fleeing to America, he works at a gas station. He dies from cancer in 1987, shortly after Amir and Soraya's wedding.|$|E

5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion <b>for</b> <b>others,</b> and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E

5|$|Lucius and {{his army}} were spared, {{due to his}} kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon. Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman {{senators}} and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius. Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning <b>for</b> <b>others.</b> This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet Sextus Propertius.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard <b>for</b> <b>others</b> when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
