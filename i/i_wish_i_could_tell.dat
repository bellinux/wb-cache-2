But I’m thinking there will be something made public very soon. It's going to get made shortly after the new year. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you about it right now, because…I mean, it's amazing. It's going to be amazing. It think it first got leaked four years ago or so that the movie was going to be made, and ever since then it's just been stalling and stalling. So I'm really ready for this to happen. But I’m not kidding: It's very imminent." ...|$|E
