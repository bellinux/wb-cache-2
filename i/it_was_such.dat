5|$|Individuals {{interviewed by}} a New York Times {{reporter}} in February 2017 were skeptical that any measures would {{be successful in}} significantly impacting illegal alcohol sales, given that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> {{a high percentage of}} the total market for alcohol. Still, Rospotrebnadzor announced at the end of January that the country had seen its first decline in monthly alcohol poisoning deaths in five years.|$|E
5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|James Nesbitt and {{his agent}} {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of Murphy's Law. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, she offered him a script for Jekyll, suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde {{to be able to walk}} around in public without attracting attention.|$|E

5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a high-risk assignment.|$|E

25|$|When {{the base}} opened in 1992, the {{hospital}} had only a helipad, while the helicopter was based at Førde Airport, Bringeland.

25|$|When John Nathan-Turner {{became the}} show's {{producer}} in Baker's last year, the Fourth Doctor {{was the first}} to sport an item of clothing adorned with question marks as a motif, in this case, above the points on his shirt collars. His overall costume was redesigned, changing the colour focus from brown to red. Designer June Hudson later revealed in an interview that Nathan-Turner had even given her permission to remove the scarf altogether if she wanted to. Hudson opted to keep the scarf, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an iconic part of the character.|$|E

Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

25|$|Fireforce was an {{operational}} assault or response usually {{composed of a}} first wave of 32 soldiers carried to the scene by three Alouette III helicopters and one Dakota transport aircraft, with another Alouette III helicopter as a command/gunship aircraft and a light attack aircraft in support. One {{of the advantages of}} the Fireforce was its flexibility as all that was needed was a reasonable airstrip. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a successful tactic that some Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) soldiers reputedly made as many as three parachute combat jumps in one day.|$|E
25|$|When {{scoring the}} opening goal {{in a home}} match against Middlesbrough on August 18, 2007, McBride dislocated his kneecap.

McBride scored his first goal since his injury against Everton at Craven Cottage on March 16, 2008, in a 1–0 victory for Fulham. The then-Fulham manager Chris Coleman commented <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a shame that McBride hadn't been 'discovered' earlier in his career, and played more in England.|$|E
25|$|A two part text, On the Binding of Contracts, {{deals with}} when {{contracts}} are binding {{and when they}} are not. The first section deals with general rules regarding when contracts are binding, including an analogy to the fact that Adam's trade of an apple for access to the Garden of Eden was valid even though it was an uneven contract because Adam knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such.</b> The second half deals with cases in which a contract may be overturned. The tract is also interesting because it is a collection of material from varying dates and places and as such much more uneven in content than other tracts.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, NBC {{commissioned}} Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti {{to compose}} the first opera ever written for television; Menotti {{came up with}} Amahl and the Night Visitors, a 45-minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto, about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the Three Wise Men and is miraculously cured when he offers his crutch to the newborn Christ Child. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966, when a dispute between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts. However, by 1978, Menotti and NBC had patched things up, and an all-new production of the opera, filmed partly on location in the Middle East, was telecast that year.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of June, 1927, Ulbrich sent out advertising for the Choirboys of the Protestant Church of Basel-City, institutionalized in May. On June 15, 1927, the first informational meeting took place with 33 interested boys; this date is taken to be the KKB's founding date. The first rehearsal took place on August 19, 1927 in the Bishop's residence of the Basel Münster; soon, though, they moved due the heating problems in the Katharine Chapel of the cloister. The first public appearance occurred on October 30, 1927, {{as a part of}} a church service in the Martinskirche, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a fiasco (the 19 boys who did show up sang very poorly) that Ulbrich threatened to resign. Lipp encouraged him to continue, however, and on Christmas, 1927, the choir enthralled the congregation of a church service in the Theodorskirche.|$|E
25|$|One evening late in 1919, {{after moving}} to Michigan, Smith was baby-sitting (presumably for Roderick) while his wife {{attended}} a movie; he resumed work on The Skylark of Space, finishing it {{in the spring of}} 1920. He submitted it to many book publishers and magazines, spending more in postage than he would eventually receive for its publication. Bob Davis, editor of Argosy, sent an encouraging rejection letter in 1922, saying that he liked the novel personally, but that it was too far out for his readers. (According to , but no other source, Smith began work on the sequel, Skylark III, before the first book was accepted.) Finally, upon seeing the April 1927 issue of Amazing Stories, he submitted it to that magazine; it was accepted, initially for $75, later raised to $125. It was published as a three-part serial in the August to October 1928 issues and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a success that managing editor Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published.|$|E
