5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, {{it was too}} small to test Zeus at its maximum range. Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could fly out over the Pacific. Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from Cape Canaveral, but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic Test Range, to the northeast of Canaveral, had a high population density and little land available for building accurate <b>downrange</b> tracking stations, Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|E
5|$|The Tycho impact, which {{occurred}} between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed secondary crater clusters in various {{locations of the}} Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest that the central crater cluster in the valley formed {{as a result of}} said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority of them have a <b>downrange</b> ejecta blanket, or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central crater cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed {{as a result of an}} avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater. If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 2015, General Atomics’ Electromagnetic Systems {{announced}} that projectiles with on-board electronics survived the whole railgun launch environment and performed their intended functions in four consecutive tests on June 9 and 10 June at the U.S. Army’s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The on-board electronics successfully measured in-bore accelerations and projectile dynamics, for several kilometers <b>downrange,</b> with the integral data link continuing to operate after the projectiles impacted the desert floor, which {{is essential for}} precision guidance.|$|E
25|$|The first {{launch of}} an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) {{occurred}} on 15 May 1957. A fire {{began in the}} Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400km <b>downrange.</b> Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10–11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch. The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July. An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted {{in all of the}} strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7km from the pad.|$|E
25|$|On September 24, 2005, the {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at the}} Kennedy Space Center on board a C-17 Globemaster III for launch preparations. The launch of New Horizons was originally scheduled for January 11, 2006, but was initially delayed until January 17, 2006 to allow for borescope inspections of the Atlas V's kerosene tank. Further delays related to low cloud ceiling conditions <b>downrange,</b> and high winds and technical difficulties—unrelated to the rocket itself—prevented launch for a further two days. Although there were backup launch opportunities in February 2006 and February 2007, only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the Jupiter flyby. Any launch outside that period would have forced {{the spacecraft}} to fly a slower trajectory directly to Pluto, delaying its encounter by 2–4 years. The probe finally lifted off from Pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, directly south of Space Shuttle Launch Complex 39, at 19:00UTC on January 19, 2006.|$|E

500|$|The team {{designed}} {{a much larger}} missile with a greatly enlarged upper fuselage and three stages, more than doubling the launch weight. This version extended range, with interceptions taking place as far as [...] <b>downrange</b> and over [...] in altitude. An even larger booster took the missile to hypersonic speeds while still in the lower atmosphere, so the missile fuselage had to be covered over completely with a phenolic ablative heat shield to protect the airframe from melting. Another change was to combine the aerodynamic controls used for control in the lower atmosphere with the thrust vectoring engines, using a single set of movable jet vanes for both roles.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the flight}} of Mercury-Atlas 7, Kraft had objected to the choice of Scott Carpenter as the {{astronaut}} for the mission, telling Walt Williams that Carpenter's lack of engineering skills might put the mission or his own life in danger. The mission suffered from problems including an unusually high rate of fuel usage, a malfunctioning horizon indicator, a delayed retrofire for re-entry, and a splashdown that was [...] <b>downrange</b> from the target area. Throughout the mission, Kraft found himself frustrated by the vagueness of Carpenter's communications with Mission Control, and what he perceived as Carpenter's inattention to his duties.

2500|$|In November 1999 it was {{announced}} that Japan's National Space Development Agency planned to lease land on Kiritimati (Christmas Island) for 20 years, on which to build a spaceport. The agreement stipulated that Japan was to pay US$840,000 per year and would also pay for any damage to roads and the environment. A Japanese-built <b>downrange</b> tracking station operates on Kiritimati and an abandoned airfield on the island was designated as the landing strip for a proposed reusable unmanned space shuttle called HOPE-X. HOPE-X, however, was eventually cancelled by Japan in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|The Beethoven Basin (–20°, 124°), partly {{exposed in}} the Michelangelo quadrangle, {{consists}} of one ring 660km in diameter. The exact age of Beethoven is uncertain; {{the density of}} superposed primary impact craters suggests a post-Caloris, late c3 age, {{but it may be}} as old as early c2 age due to the large range of error in the crater age estimate. The ejecta from Beethoven are very extensive east and southeast of the basin rim and are mappable as far as 600km <b>downrange</b> from the rim. However, ejecta appear to be almost absent {{on the west side of}} the basin. The reason for this asymmetry is unclear; possibly Beethoven is the result of an oblique impact that produced an asymmetric ejecta distribution (Gault and Wedekind, 1978), or possibly basin radial texture in the western rim area has been obliterated by ejecta from Valmiki.|$|E

2500|$|Railguns {{are being}} {{researched}} as weapons with projectiles {{that do not}} contain explosives or propellants, but are given extremely high velocities: [...] (approximately Mach 7 at sea level) or more. For comparison, the M16 rifle has a muzzle speed of , and the 16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun [...] that armed World War II American battleships has a muzzle speed of [...] ), which because of its much greater projectile mass (up to 2,700 pounds) generated a muzzle energy of 360 MJ and a <b>downrange</b> kinetic impact of energy of over 160 MJ (see also Project HARP). By firing smaller projectiles at extremely high velocities, railguns may yield kinetic energy impacts equal or superior to the destructive energy of 5"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun Naval guns, (which achieve up to 10MJ at the muzzle), but with much greater range. This decreases ammunition size and weight, allowing more ammunition to be carried and eliminating the hazards of carrying explosives or propellants in a tank or naval weapons platform. [...] Also, by firing more aerodynamically streamlined projectiles at greater velocities, railguns may achieve greater range, less time to target, and at shorter ranges less wind drift, bypassing the physical limitations of conventional firearms: [...] "the limits of gas expansion prohibit launching an unassisted projectile to velocities greater than about 1.5km/s and ranges of more than [...] from a practical conventional gun system." ...|$|E
