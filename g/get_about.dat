25|$|When Benaud won the toss on a {{pitch that}} looked rather inanimate {{most of us}} thought that Australia would {{probably}} <b>get</b> <b>about</b> 500 runs against an English attack which {{for the most part}} was devoid of fire, venom and guile. Previous matches had shown that the off-spinners might toil and spin but that they could not turn. Knight, always short of a length, should not on a good pitch worry any batsmen of even average class. Statham had seemed rather lethargic: certainly not the Statham of other years... Thinking over the game later on, one wondered how this bowling on a dead pitch succeeded in dismissing Australia for 404 runs.|$|E

On a smaller scale, PHEVs have been sold as commercial passenger vans, utility trucks, general and school buses, motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles.

They were to stand behind screens and he claimed that their auras would be visible above the screens, which were numbered 1 through 10, and the subjects were told by the astrologer behind which screen to stand. He was to tell whether or not a person was standing behind each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to <b>get</b> <b>about</b> five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right.

500|$|On {{their way}} back to the beach they sighted a German patrol of about seven or eight men coming from the {{direction}} of the houses so they took cover. They were discovered by the patrol's guard dog at about 00:50. The patrol opened fire on them with machine guns and hand grenades. The SSRF managed to disperse the German patrol with return fire and reach the Goatley boat. Captain Lord Howard, who had been left to guard the boat, was wounded trying to re-float the boat, and the others managed to get him aboard. The fight lasted for about 30 minutes. When the German patrol moved forward onto the beach, Lieutenant Hall tried to capture one of the Germans but was himself hit over the head and captured. The SSRF left him behind, presuming he was dead.

Winter was fired on again when he reached the beach and was captured. He was taken to the German headquarters where he was put into a room with Captain Lord Howard and Desgranges, who had also been captured.|$|E

Gerald notices this and knowing his brother, warns him to let the girl alone. Marja is infatuated with the well-dressed visitor and is easily influenced. She consents to a secret marriage and Claude returns to England, promising to come back and claim her. Some months later Gerald proposes marriage to the girl and she sobbingly tells him she has married Claude. Gerald remains silent and does not denounce his brother. Marja does not hear from Claude but Gerald receives a paper from London announcing the marriage of Claude to a society woman, and he is furious with rage.
