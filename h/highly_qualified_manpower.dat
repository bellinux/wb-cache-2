5000|$|On the {{retirement}} of Professor Salimuzzaman Siddiqui (FRS) as Chairman PCSIR, his services were {{taken up by the}} University of Karachi and a [...] "Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry" [...] was established under his Directorship in 1967 in a wing of the Department of Chemistry. PCSIR provided the services of some of its staff (including Dr. Viqar Uddin Ahmad and Dr. Zafar H. Zaidi) and furniture during the initial phase of the establishment of this institute. Dr. Atta ur Rahman joined the Institute in March 1969 after obtaining Ph.D. from the Kings College, Cambridge University, later he accepted a 4-year assignment as a Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge University. He was then sent by Cambridge University to the University of Karachi during 1971-74 to assist in the setting up of a modern postgraduate institute of chemistry, and he brought with him donations of gas chromatograph, balances and a combustion microanalyser from Cambridge University.Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman succeeded in obtaining grants to acquire a new mass and NMR spectrometers, both of which were installed in 1973, within a year of his return to Pakistan. He was appointed as the Co-Director in 1977. He succeeded in winning several major projects for the institute from the West, which have transformed the institute into the finest center in Asia {{and one of the best}} in the world in the field of Natural Product Chemistry. A generous donation was offered to the University for the Institute by the leading philanthropist/industrialist Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal on behalf of the Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation in 1976, the largest donation at that time in the history of the country. The Institute was accordingly named as [...] "Husein Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry", in the memory of late Mr. Husein Ebrahim Jamal.The efforts of Professor Dr. W. Voelter of Tuebingen University, Germany, deserve a special praise since the initial grant of 2.3 million DM from the Republic of Germany was largely due to his untiring efforts, and collaborative researches continue with his group till today.Professor Atta-ur-Rahman was appointed as the Director in January 1990, while Professor Viqar Uddin Ahmad took over as Co-Director in 1990. In 2000, Professor Bina S. Siddiqui was appointed as the Co-Director on {{the retirement}} of Professor Ahmad, while in 2002 Professor Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary was given the responsibilities of the Director (Acting) of ICCBS and Co-Director of Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research. In September 2008, he was appointed as the Director of the ICCBS institutions. During last ten years, the institute has gone through a rapid and unprecedented expansion, both in terms of infrastructure development and academic programs, while maintaining the highest quality in research and student training.The institute has organized a number of major international conferences and symposia on various aspects of Natural Product Chemistry, Spectroscopy and Protein Chemistry. The institute had the distinction of hosting the 19th IUPAC Symposium on Natural Product Chemistry in January 1994 in which over 500 scientists from 52 countries, including 4 Nobel Laureates participated.Additionally the Institute has also been selected as one of the three library centers of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). The H.E.J. Institute has been designated as the W.H.O. Center for Pesticide Analysis for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The institute is also a member of the IUCN-International, WAITRO, and COMSATS. More recently the institute is designated as the OIC Center of Excellence in Chemical Sciences. In 2001, the H.E.J. Research Institute became a constituent institution of the International Center for Chemical Sciences (later named as International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences).In 2004, the H.E.J. Research Institute received the most prestigious IDB (Islamic Development Bank) prize for the best science institution in the entire Islamic world. Recently, the IDB awarded the best science institution again to the H.E.J. Research Institute (second time), an unprecedented honor to any science institution in OIC region.In August 2003, an Industrial Analytical Center was established as the service wing of H. E. J. Institute. Third World Center (TWC) Laboratory complex was formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2005 as an extension of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry. The building of TWC was renamed as Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman Laboratories by the Executive Board in 2011, in recognition of the outstanding services of Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman (FRS) who is now serving the ICCBS institution as the Patron-in-chief.Molecular medicine is an emerging new field, which deals with the understanding of the molecular basis of diseases and then developing appropriate strategies for their early diagnosis, management and elimination. Knowledge of human biology and disease mechanism at molecular level is the most important step in developing effective disease prevention and treatment. In the year 2004, the Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD) was established through a generous donation and patronage of Ms. Nadira Panjwani (Chairperson, Dr. Panjwani Memorial Trust) in the memory of her beloved father, Dr. Mohammad Hussain Panjwani, a leading scholar and philanthropist. The main objective of the center is to train <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>manpower</b> in the emerging new fields of molecular medicine and drug development. The academicians, clinicians and pharmaceutical researchers are brought together to translate basic scientific discoveries into new therapies, vaccines and diagnostic tests. Late Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal, Chairman Ebrahim Jamal Foundation, continuing his patronage to the Institute, established the Latif Ebrahim Jamal National Science Information Center in 2005. The beautiful building of this one of the largest paperless libraries of the region was constructed under the direct supervision of Mr. Aziz Latif Jamal S.I. (Current Chairman Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation), able and committed son of (Late) Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{two groups}} of barriers encountered by economies of the developing countries in processes of technical progress transfer and absorption i. e. brain dram and export as well as import restrictions. Migration of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>manpower</b> from the developing countries to the developed capitalist countries represents a vital factor hampering and impeding socio-economic development in those countries. Main suppliers of highly qualified cadres to the developed countries are the developing countries of Asia with the United States being one of destinations for their emigrants. The causes of migration must be sought both in the policy pursued in this sphere by the developed capitalist countries and in not fully effective performance of the Third World countries. Export and import restrictions are imposed on the developing countries while concluding transactions on purchases of new technologies and know-how by them. The world market of new technologies is controlled, to a vast extent, by highly developed capitalist countries while the main suppliers of new technologies from these countries are big multinational corporations. As a rule, the developing countries do not have adequate knowledge about this market, which does {{not allow them to}} choose technologies that might be suitable for them or negotiate the most favorable terms of purchasing these technologies. The restrictions encountered by the developing countries in the process of technology transfer for several years now are countered by specific measures undertaken by these countries and by the United Nations Organization. The UNCTAD Secretariat elaborated a draft of the international Technology Transfer Code in 1975, which envisages an improvement in the terms on which new technologies are to be purchased by the developing countries This drat has not been approved, however, by the main exporters of technologies i. e. by the developed countries, which makes it impossible to introduce the Code into practice. Consequently, in the seventies some countries of the Third World began to introduce a legal regulation of technology import on an individual basis eliminating in this way, at least in part, the unfavorable or detrimental for their economies clauses in agreements on import of technologies. These processes producing advantageous results were initiated only in a small group of the economically stronger countries of the Third World, and as a result the issue of restrictions in import of new technologies continues to be faced by majority of the developing countries.

40|$|Cet article présente une analyse {{descriptive}} de certaines caractéristiques de la main-d'oeuvre hautement qualifiée au Canada. Une comparaison est également établie entre les diverses provinces canadiennes et plus particulièrement entre le Québec et l’Ontario. In 1973, Statistics Canada {{in cooperation}} with the Ministry for Science and Technology surveyed 138, 000 persons who reported possessing a university degree in the 1971 Census. This Post-Censal Survey is completed and its data has been used for the computation of matrices which provide significant information on the <b>Highly</b> <b>Qualified</b> <b>Manpower</b> (HQM) supply in Canada. The author analyses the various educational and employment characteristics, and compares the HQM of the provinces, particularly that of Québec and Ontario. The article points out the difficulties met by theresearcher who embarks on the study of education-employment complex and the way it works. Difficulties met in manpower forecasting are also emphasized. Summary of results. The derived ratio HQM/population per province of residence places Ontario first among the provinces, Alberta second, British Columbia third, Manitoba fourth, Nova-Scotia fifth, Québec sixth, etc. It means that these provinces have a larger ratio of HQM per population and the benefit of a relatively more valuable economic resource. Education is the major activity field of university graduates (33. 5 %). This occupational sector being saturated, graduates will face more difficulties in finding jobs. While agriculture provides only 1 % of HQM occupations, and mining and industry, 10. 9 %, the services, excluding teaching, represent 42. 5 % of occupations. There are no major differences in these proportions among the provinces, though variations exist in certain industries. It is worth noting that the percentage of graduates at the three levels of public administration is about 10 %, which is representative of the welfare state in which we live. About 12 % of graduates mention "no occupation" as their job of longest duration in the twelve months preceding the Survey. Five to ten years after graduation, the occupational mobility is far-reaching. It is evident that different trainings give access to a plurality of occupations, and that a certain occupation may be fulfilled by individuals coming from a variety of trainings. This underlines the existence of complementarity and substitution in any human capital. Moreover, the occupational mobility suggests that mathematicians, economists, geographers, historians, etc. describe an individual who acquired certain skills in disciplines which could be considered as specific professions, but these skills are transferable from function to function in a large number of occupations. This contributes to the complexity in the education-employment links and to the difficulties in manpower forecasting. The article does not give any recommendation, but underlines the situation of the Québec HMQ and the need to diversify it...|$|E

40|$|Cet article montre comment les Canadiens-français occupent une {{fonction}} d'infériorité à l'intérieur de l'entreprise. Can French Canadians {{expect a}} career {{similar to that}} of their English-speaking compatriots in large industrial corporations controlled by foreign or canadian capital? Based on empirical analysis, {{the answer to this question}} is "no". The career pat-tern of French Canadians places them in a state of formal subordination to the organization, while, on the contrary, English Canadians occupy a dominant position. We explain this major finding by developing the three following points: the hypothesis of our research, the sample and the results obtained. 1 -The hypothesisTwo hypotheses prevail in the scientific literature concerning the position of subordination which French Canadians occupy in the socio-economic structure of Québec society. The older of these proposes that the cultural heritage of French Canadians, based on social values such as family, authoritarianism, Catholicism and ethnocentricity are incompatible with the values of the business world such as economic rationality, competition, achievement and leadership and that this incompatibility underlies the social division of labour between French and English ethnic groups in the large industrial corporation. The more recent proposes that the social division of labour can be explained by structural factors such as ethnicity. In this regard, the so-called "Quiet Revolution" did not engender a significant change in either the socio-economic structure, or the traditional social division of labour. Some studies have shown that Francophones were still, at the beginning of the six-ties, one of the lesser paid linguistic groups in the province of Québec; furthermore, recent research shows that among <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>manpower,</b> bilinguals of English Canadian origin earned more in 1973, in the province of Québec, than bilinguals of French Canadian origin. In other words, bilinguism is more favourable to English Canadians from an economic point of view. In line with these findings, other research shows that, at the upper levels of administrative hierarchy, the social cleavage between these two ethnic groups becomes complete and is explained by ethnicity. Our study consists of describing and analysing some mechanisms that lead to this social division of labour. More precisely, the hypothesis that career patterns, as well as attitudes that originate from them (such as leadership and interest in work) vary according to ethnicity, is supported by our data. 2 -The sampleAll the selected organizations (ten) are either Canadian corporations or divisions or branch plants of multinational corporations controlled by foreign management, except one which recently became French Canadian. In all cases, the personnel is ethnically heterogeneous. English Canadians, French Canadians, naturalized Canadians, foreign nationals are to be found among their management personnel. From the point of view of size, half the organizations of our sample range between one thousand (1 000) and fifteen hundred (1 500) employees, and the others have no less than three hundred (300). All of them were located in the metropolitan region of Montréal, during the period of this survey: 1974. The individuals who are the objects of this study were chosen among the managerial personnel of the industrial establishments. The study was restricted to the managers of various departments, and to personnel located at the hierarchical level immediately below them, viz: the superintendents. In general, the level of education, the social origins and the occupational rank are identical for both ethnic groups. Age and seniority, however, differ according to ethnicity. 3 -The resultsEthnicity appears as the major constraint leading the French Canadians as a group to career failure. The language factor certainly cannot be eliminated, but does not constitute a sufficient explanation of the observed differences between both ethnic groups. Career, and leadership that is related to it, favour exclusively the integration of the English Canadians to the organization. Two career models determine two leadership styles that result in locating the English Canadians in a position of domination and the French Canadians in a position of subordination. Career progress for the French Canadians is a function of seniority in the organization, while the English Canadians are coopted by management by virtue of their social origins; the French Canadians move slowly, step by step, up the administrative rungs, while the English Canadians may sidestep them totally by lateral entrance into the organization, or very quickly move up the same rungs. On the other hand, the French Canadians try to protect their career by means of bureaucratic formalism, and the English Canadians by recognition of their personality. In summary, the career pat-tern of the French Canadians is quite uniform in the sense that it follows a near-perfect administrative rationality; by contrast, the career pattern of the English Canadians is individualized and not subject to this rationality...|$|E
40|$|Skripsie (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1988 This {{study had}} a dual objective. The first was to {{determine}} which factors influenced the career choice of girls and the second whether• their• actual choices coincided with their aptitudes. Socialization has a direct influence on the identification of girls with their careers. From an early age their behaviour {{is in line with}} the traditional roles (femininity, attractiveness, etc.) which society holds up to them. This is also true about occupations regarded as being suitable for girls. Girls therefore tend to choose their careers from a limited sphere. The style of parents' upbringing of their children also has an influence on the development of a girl's sex role identity, and therefore her career orientation. The peer group, especially male friends, has a tremendous influence during adolescence on the formation of a girl's sex role identity and career orientation. Pressure from the peer group tends to make girls feel that popularity and attractiveness are more important than academic achievement and high professional aspirations. It also appears that teachers do not {{play a significant role in}} the career orientation of girls. The influence of television on the career orientation of girls can be traced back to the influence on the patterns of interest of television viewers. It emerges that television programmes represent sex roles in a stereotyped manner. Through that, patterns of interest in the fields of "Social work" and "Practical-female" (19 -Field Interest Questionnaire) are reinforced. School counsellors do not have a big influence on the career choices of girls. Boys and girls both regard the aspects of interest highly in making a choice of career. Girls tend, however, to give high credence to the rendering of service and to welfare. Boys tend to look more strongly at good income and good opportunities for promotion. The training of girls is directed more at the development of aptitudes in a field in the Humanities, in secretarial and clerking positions. The result of this is that girls mostly follow a domestic, caring and administrative course of study. The career values of girls and their self-image have a negative influence on their career orientation. This leads to the situation that fear of success inhibits them from developing their full professional potential. Other factors, such as manpower shortages, economic and political conditions, the improvement of the level of education and professional knowledge separately or in conjunction, have an influence on girls' career preferences and expectations. For the purposes of this study the Senior Aptitude Test, professional profiles identified with the aid of the Senior Aptitude Test and a questionnaire were used. Three aspects are covered by the questionnaire: * Field of study * Career expectations * Choice of career All the Afrikaans-speaking matriculants of four Afrikaans-medium high schools in a particular metropolitan area participated in the project. The data were statistically processed with an SAS computer programme. Fields of study and aptitudes of the study group do not correlate. Most respondents' strongest aptitudes are in the Humanities, while they are in fact following courses in the field of Economics. Most respondents are of the opinion that there are adequate work opportunities for white girls in the RSA, but feel that career counselling did not make adequate provision for girls. The study group are of the opinion that girls can do traditionally male jobs. There is a fair amount of uncertainty, however, about the professional future of white girls in a changing RSA. Professional training is thus regarded as being very important. More than half of the group (67, 2 %) expert to marry and still to have a career. Most of the respondents (176 out of 277) have made a fin 3 l career choice. The reason why the rest have not made career choices could largely be attributed to too little knowledge about careers. Five careers, viz. secretarial, teaching, nursing, social work and clerking, represent the largest percentage (35, 4 %) of the study group's career choices. The study group mainly made their choices on their own volition, and most parents are satisfied with their daughters' choices of career. Training is essential for most careers, mainly at universities and technikons. Too little knowledge of careers and financial considerations gave rise to the fact that some respondents (71 out of 277) planned to study later. In the consideration of the results of the investigation, the following conclusions could be reached: The process of socialization still holds up the caring role, service and femininity to girls as the ideal. In that way girls' aptitudes in the fields of the Humanities and in medicine are reinforced. In spite of that, the greatest percentage of girls followed a commercial course. The conclusion that is reached is that they feel "safe" in this field of study, because the traditional expectation is that they will go and work as a typist or a secretary. Girls therefore choose a field of study in Standard seven which is not in line with their aptitudes. It emerges that girls do not receive adequate counselling in Standard seven, and that being a secretary or a teacher is still held up to them by die Guidance teacher. The career choices of the study group therefore correlate with their fields of study, but not with their aptitudes. The conclusion that can be reached is that a large percentage of the study group would seem to have made an unrealistic choice of career, probably because they did this from a limited professional awareness. This can probably be ascribed to the traditional values and roles held for girls. Other conclusions which emerge from this study: * The respondents are not properly informed about the changes occurring in the RSA. * The study group dispose of too little information about professional training, although they seem to be aware of its importance. * Girls want to move away from the traditional sex role of wife and mother, and want to reconcile career and marriage. * Most respondents do not dispose of adequate self- knowledge to come to a realistic choice of career without some supportive action. * The female work force in South Africa is very valuable and an important source of executive and <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>manpower</b> which should not be neglected. The place which women fill in the career world and its implications should enjoy special attention in school guidance. It is especially necessary that girls be made aware of their career potential but also of career options and problems. A school guidance teacher should take note of the fact that girls' career orientation is different from that of boys, and should adjust the counselling programme accordingly. One cannot, therefore, have the same programme for boys and girls. If it should be accepted that the role of woman in the business world is important, it is essential that career and course guidance in school be improved on an ongoing basis. Such improvement can only take place if the process of career counselling makes provision for the dynamic as well as the scientific dimensions of career choice and career development of girls in particular. The career orientation of girls is a lifelong process. It goes much further than mere career counselling. It is comprehensive, encompassing the girl in her totality. It also points to co-ordinated planning by all persons and institutions involved. It is only in this way that the optimal utilization of available manpower in its full implications can be attained.

Parham, Department of Counseling, 					Higher Education and Special Education 	This study {{examined}} the relationship between the percentage of classes taught by <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) and students' academic achievement, as measured by students' passing rates on Maryland's High School Assessment (HSA), and graduation rates among secondary students for three academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013) in the State of Maryland. All data relating to <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers and students' academic achievement and graduation rates was collected from the Maryland's Annual Report Cards, published by Maryland State Department of Education for all 24 school systems in the State of Maryland during three consecutive academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). The individuals in this sample were 10 th, 11 th and 12 th grade students from Maryland School System who participated in the Spring Maryland High School Assessment (HSA) for academic school years 2011, 2012 and 2013. A linear regression method was used to answer the question of possible relationships between the dependent variables, academic achievement test scores and graduation rates, and the independent variable, percent of courses taught by <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers. System level performance data were analyzed in a descriptive fashion in order to show the percent of students passing each of the Maryland High School Assessments (HSA) in Math, Biology and English, and the percent of students graduating from high school. In addition to the descriptive statistics, Hierarchical Linear Modeling analyses were conducted in order to determine if (1) students performed better on High School Assessments (HSA) in counties having more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (noted as Between Counties) and (2) if students performed better in years when there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) in a county, than in those years when there were fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (noted as Within-Counties or Between Years). 	Results of the data indicated that between-county or counties with more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) than counties with fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers had a higher percentage of students who passed the Biology 10, 11 and 12, English 10, 11 and 12, and Math 10, 11, and 12 High School Assessments (HSA), over three consecutive academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). Within-counties, between-years or years when there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) in a county compared to years when there were fewer (HQT) teachers, there was no significant relationships between the percentage of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers and students passing rates on the Biology 11 and 12, the Math 10 and 12, and the English 10 and 11 High School Assessments (HSA). However, for Biology 10, Math 11 and English 12 there was a significant relationship between the percentage of HQT in a county in a year, and the percentage of students passing the test that year. Counties where there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT), a higher proportion of students graduated than in counties where there were fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT), over three academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). There was no relationship between the percentage of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) within a county in a particular school year and the percentage of students graduating in that year...|$|R
