5000|$|A Rotovator is a {{rotating}} tether where the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> {{is moving in}} the opposite direction to the tether's orbital velocity, reducing the difference in velocity relative to the ground, and hence reducing the velocity of rendezvous; the upper tip is likewise moving at greater than orbital velocity, allowing propellantless transfer between orbits. Around an airless world, such as the moon, the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> can actually touch the ground with zero horizontal velocity. As with any momentum exchange tether, orbital energy is gained or lost in the transfer.|$|R

5000|$|Their shells {{are light}} {{yellow-brown}} to red-brown in color. The <b>lower</b> <b>tips</b> of the claws are blue. The two spikes {{on each side}} of their shells are not as long as in blue crabs. They {{can be found in the}} western Atlantic Ocean, as well the Caribbean coastlines. Their diet consists of small crustaceans and small fish. They are also scavengers.|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} modes for two low {{tip speed}} propulsion fans were measured {{to examine the}} effects of fan tip speed, at constant pressure ratio. A continuously rotating microphone method was used that provided the complete modal structure (circumferential and radial order) at the fundamental and second harmonic of the blade passing tone as well as most of the third harmonic modes. The fans are compared in terms of their rotor/stator interaction modal power, and total tone power. It was hoped that the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> speed might produce less noise. This was not the case. The higher tip speed fan, at both takeoff and cutback speeds, had lower tone and interaction levels. This could be an indication that the higher aerodynamic loading required to produce the same pressure ratio for the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> speed fan resulted in a greater velocity deficit in the blade wakes and thus more noise. Results consistent with expected rotor transmission effects were noted in the inlet modal structures of both fans...|$|R
50|$|These {{artists were}} {{among a group}} of intellectuals, writers, filmmakers, and poets who lived and worked in the old seaport at the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> of Manhattan called the Coenties Slip. Distinguished by its views of the Brooklyn Bridge and its {{position}} between land and sea, the slip served as an important inspiration for the artists, who frequently incorporated aquatic themes into their early work.|$|R

5000|$|... α-Cobratoxin forms three hairpin type loops {{with its}} {{polypeptide}} chain. The two minor loops are loop I (amino acids 1-17) and loop III (amino acids 43-57). Loop II (amino acids 18-42) {{is the major}} one. Following these loops, α-cobratoxin has a tail (amino acids 58-71). The loops are knotted together by four disulfide bonds (Cys3-Cys20, Cys14-Cys41, Cys45-Cys56, and Cys57-Cys62). Loop II contains another disulfide bridge at the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> (Cys26-Cys30).|$|R
50|$|Named for {{the area}} on the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> of Manhattan Island, the Bowling Green was raced at Aqueduct Race Track from 1963 to 1967 before moving to Belmont Park. The 2008 edition was {{replaced}} in its summer spot by the Man o' War Stakes. The Man o' War was moved from a fall schedule to improve turf scheduling competition. In 2015 the New York Racing Association moved the Bowling Green to Saratoga.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960, {{in part because}} it is the oldest public building in continuous use in New York City. The chapel survived the Great New York City Fire of 1776 when a quarter of New York City (then confined to the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> of Manhattan), including Trinity Church, burned following the British capture of the city after the Battle of Long Island during the American Revolutionary War.|$|R
50|$|The {{color pattern}} {{consists}} of a tan, light brown or gray ground color that is overlaid {{with a series of}} around 20 dark brown or black rhomboid blotches.

The hindwings are light silvery fuscous, darker along the costa and toward the tip.|$|R
50|$|Southern Maryland was {{originally}} inhabited by Piscataway Indians. Captain John Smith explored {{the area in}} 1608 and 1609. In 1634 St. Mary's City, at southern Maryland's <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> {{was the site of}} Maryland's first colonial settlement. It was also the first Roman Catholic English settlement in North America. Today, two thirds of the original site is now a large living history museum complex and archeological research area and the other third is now the campus of St. Mary's College of Maryland.|$|R
5000|$|Ten Aermacchi MB-339 PAN jets {{from the}} Italian Air Force display team, Frecce Tricolori, were {{performing}} their [...] "pierced heart" [...] (Italian: Cardioide, German: Durchstoßenes Herz) formation. In this formation, {{two groups of}} aircraft create a heart shape {{in front of the}} audience along the runway. In the completion of the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> of the heart, the two groups pass each other parallel to the runway. The heart is then pierced, {{in the direction of the}} audience, by a lone aircraft.|$|R
50|$|During {{experimental}} evaluation, cyclorotors produced little aerodynamic noise. This {{likely due to}} the <b>lower</b> blade <b>tip</b> speeds, {{which produce}} lower intensity turbulence following the blades.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{perennial}} plant with short spreading roots, erect to decumbent stems 15-90 cm high, with fine, threadlike, glaucous blue-green leaves 2-6 cm long and 1-5 mm broad. The flowers {{are similar to}} those of the snapdragon, 25-33 mm long, pale yellow except for the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> which is orange, borne in dense terminal racemes from mid summer to mid autumn. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees. The fruit is a globose capsule 5-11 mm long and 5-7 mm broad, containing numerous small seeds.|$|R

30|$|These two {{scenarios}} {{were based}} on the average lifetime risk of developing breast cancer for a woman at high risk (50 %) and for a woman at moderate risk (20 %). The “tipping-point”, the risk reduction required to make taking SERMs worthwhile, was computed for each participant for both the 50 % and 20 % risk scenarios by subtracting the percentage where the woman crossed from not taking SERMs to taking SERMs from the corresponding baseline risk. Thus, a <b>lower</b> <b>tipping</b> point represents a lower degree of risk reduction required to intend to take SERMs.|$|R
5000|$|German-language {{versions}} of the Mac OS, {{as well as all}} language version of Mac OS 9, had a different rendering of the 12-point version of Chicago. The letter W had two dips instead of one {{at the bottom of the}} letter, the letter V had its <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> at the centre instead of veering left, and the letter I (capital “i”) had serifs at the top and bottom, distinguishing it from l (lowercase [...] "L"). A mix of this and the original Chicago was used in the original iPod.|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} circulation-controlled rotors are examined by comparing data from three full-scale rotors: a conventional rotor, the X-Wing rotor, and the Circulations Control Rotor. Both the X-Wing rotor and Circulation Control Rotor had higher sound levels than the conventional rotor at identical advancing-tip Mach numbers. There is excess noise {{due to the}} compressor on the X-Wing rotor and excess broadband noise on the Circulation Control Rotor. The X-Wing rotor had lower sound levels than the conventional rotor at identical forward speeds because of the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> speed feasible {{with the use of}} circulation control...|$|R

40|$|Time-of-Flight Diffraction (ToFD) {{technique}} {{has been part}} of nondestructive testing (NDT) for over 30 years and provides a useful role in flaw detection and flaw sizing. This paper reviews the principles of ToFD and presents a photoelastic technique for visualization of the waves generated during a ToFD measurement. A sample made of optically fused glass with an embedded target is used in the experiments. The results show the waves which are diffracted from the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> of the target as well as the lateral and backwall waves. These results also provide {{a better understanding of the}} diffraction phenomenon that takes place during a ToFD measurement...|$|R
40|$|Studies of tipping {{behavior}} {{indicate that}} black customers tend to leave <b>lower</b> <b>tips</b> than do white customers. Rather than unnecessarily demean a customer group, however, the industry {{should try to}} understand and address the underlying cause of this ethnic difference in tipping. The {{results of the study}} reported here suggest that differences in tipping between African American and Caucasian customers may reflect differences in the groups 2 ̆ 7 familiarity with the 15 to 20 percent restaurant-tipping norm. This explanation suggests that one solution to the problems posed by differences in the groups 2 ̆ 7 tipping is to publicize the 15 to 20 percent tipping norm in minority communities...|$|R

50|$|In females, the pelvic {{part of the}} UG sinus {{gives rise}} to the sinovaginal bulbs, {{structures}} that will eventually form the inferior two thirds of the vagina. This process begins when the <b>lower</b> <b>tip</b> of the paramesonephric ducts, the structures that will eventually form the uterus and vaginal fornices, come in contact with the UG sinus. Shortly afterwards, the sinovaginal bulbs form as two solid evaginations of the UG sinus. Cells in these bulbs divide to form a solid vaginal plate, which extends and then canalizes (hollows) to form the inferior portion of the vagina. The female urogenital sinus also {{gives rise to the}} urethra and vestibule of the vagina.|$|R
