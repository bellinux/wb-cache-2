60|$|Although Darius {{was thus}} the {{instrument}} of divine Providence {{in the destruction of}} Babylon, he was unintentionally and unconsciously so. In the terrible scenes connected with the siege and the storming of the ill-fated city, it was the impulse of his own hatred and revenge that he was directly obeying; he was not at all aware that he was, at the same time, the messenger of the divine displeasure. The wretched Babylonians, in the storming and destruction of their city, were expiating a <b>double</b> <b>criminality.</b> Their pride, their wickedness, their wanton cruelty toward the Jews, had brought upon them the condemnation of God, while their political treason and rebellion, or, at least, what was considered treason and rebellion aroused the implacable resentment of their king.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{begins with}} the premise that, despite {{political}} rhetoric and occasional prosecutions to the contrary, police brutality has been effectively decriminalized in this country. The Article adopts the Rodney King case as the paradigm for examining this phenomenon. Scrutinizing the culture and semantics of police brutality, the author concludes that a <b>double</b> standard of <b>criminality</b> exists in the United States, under which different rules apply to a police than to everyone else. This double standard is socially dysfunctional. Particularly among minorities, it leads {{to a sense of}} cynicism about our legal system that can result in civil disorder when properly fueled. More importantly, this double standard is morally wrong. Because existing measures, including civil suits and civilian review boards, have failed to deter police misconduct, the author suggests that only the realistic threat of criminal prosecution will actually deter police violence. Unfortunately, the close working relationship between the place and prosecutors continues to make it extremely unlikely that many prosecutors will ever mount a credible challenge to systemic police brutality. Although, at first glance, traditional judicial deference to prosecutorial discretion may appear to preclude other avenues for undertaking criminal prosecution of officers who engage in police brutality, the author suggests there is another approach-citizen access to the grand jury- that could help current imbalance. This Article examines the avenues available under current law by which victimized citizens may bring their cases before the grand jury, either directly or through the impaneling judge, even when such action is opposed by the public prosecutor. The author concludes that he only reason that citizens have pursued this option so infrequently is that neither the bar nor the general public is aware of it. Thus, the goal of the Article is to analyze the pertinent law and provide practicing attorneys- and their clients- with information on procedures for gaining access to the grand jury in their jurisdictions...|$|R
50|$|Under the EAW Framework Decision, the {{requirement}} for <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> is removed {{for a wide range}} of categories of crimes, and made a discretionary rather than a compulsory ground for a refusal to extradite for offences not falling within those categories.|$|E
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>criminality,</b> or dual criminality, is a {{requirement}} in the extradition law of many countries. It states that a suspect can be extradited {{from one country to}} stand trial for breaking a second country's laws only if a similar law exists in the extraditing country.|$|E

50|$|In January 2007 the Italian {{government}} {{requested the}} extradition of Palazzolo after the nine-year sentence was handed {{down by the}} Italian court for collusion with the Mafia. This was the sixth request from the Italians since 1992. In June 2010, the High Court of South Africa blocked the extradition of Palazzolo {{due to lack of}} <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> requirement as South Africa does not recognize the crime of Mafia association as conceived in Italy. Moreover, the Court also found double jeopardy as Palazzolo had already been acquitted of Mafia association in 1992 by a court in Rome. For the Italian authorities Palazzolo remains a fugitive from justice.|$|E
50|$|Bounty hunters Timm Johnsen and Daniel Kear {{attempted}} to argue at their extradition hearings {{that they should}} not be extradited because they were acting on behalf of the state of Florida, and presented evidence that the State Attorney's office was aware of their plan to seize Jaffe from Canada and had even provided Johnsen and Kear with Jaffe's address in Toronto. However, in April 1982, Judge Paul Dietrich ruled that Johnsen's extradition would be legal. Kear also {{attempted to}} argue that he could not be extradited due to the requirement of <b>double</b> <b>criminality,</b> claiming that his actions were not criminal under U.S. law on bounty hunters. However, it had previously been ruled in the Supreme Court case Reese v. United States that bounty hunters could not exercise their powers across international borders, and so Kear was found extraditable as well.|$|E
5000|$|Long {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of advanced education for practicing lawyers, Botting completed his Master of Laws in 1999 and a second PhD, in law, in 2004 at the University of British Columbia, {{and went on to}} publish a number of scholarly works on Canadian and international law. He was recognized as [...] "Canada's leading legal scholar on extradition law" [...] by Larry Rousseau, {{executive vice president of the}} Public Service Alliance of Canada. His U.S.-published Extradition between Canada and the United States, cited by the Supreme Court of Canada, criticized Canada's level of cooperation with the United States in international criminal matters, arguing that Canada's policy of placing international comity over individual rights had dangerously expanded executive discretion and damaged human rights protections. The book received favourable reviews in the Law & Politics Book Review and the Revue québécoise de droit international. Another of his works on extradition law, Canadian Extradition Law Practice, which has gone through five editions, contains broader criticisms of Canada's network of extradition treaties, in particular of the erosion of the <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> requirement. His Extradition: Individual Rights vs. International Obligations, published in Stuttgart, Germany, was released in 2010, and Halbury's Laws of Canada: Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance the following year. His Wrongful Conviction in Canadian Law (2010) examines Canadian commissions of inquiry into miscarriage of justice. The book's foreword was written by David Milgaard, who was convicted of a murder he did not commit and spent 23 years in prison. Botting spent four years as a visiting scholar and post-doctoral fellow at University of Washington School of Law in Seattle and another year as research associate at the University of British Columbia - where he is a Paetzold Fellow - before returning to private practice in British Columbia in 2009. In April 2015 he was granted a Trent University Distinguished Alumnus lifetime achievement award for his legal scholarship and literary skills. The citation noted that Botting [...] "is recognized as one of the most prolific legal scholars in Canada, the 'go to' expert in Canada on extradition, and a writer of immense talent." [...] In 2016 and again in 2017 he was invited to join an exclusive Oxford think-tank deliberating on the future of extradition and the European arrest warrant in the wake of [...] "Brexit". He proposed [...] "a single, simple multilateral extradition treaty to replace the European arrest warrant and the thousands of variable, and mostly unworkable, bilateral treaties now in existence." [...] He called the proposed treaty the “Unified Multilateral Extradition Treaty” or UMET, and stated that half the countries of the world would already qualify to [...] "sign on" [...] by virtue of being signatories to current treaty arrangements. [...] "The other half could sign onto the new UMET in due course, once they met specific minimal standards of justice, including protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms." ...|$|E
40|$|Judicial {{cooperation}} and approximation {{play a central}} role in this contribu-tion. Approximation is interpreted in a very broad manner, encompassing both EU and non-EU instruments. Because judicial cooperation in itself is too vague and too abstract to be analysed, the scope was narrowed to two specific case studies. Both mutual recognition and Eurojust are considered to have a symbolic value in the field of judicial {{cooperation and}} have a clear link with approximation: the <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> requirement and the delineation of competence scope. Analysis reveals that approximation is not used to its full potential when it comes to facilitating judicial cooperation even though this is the main function of approximation. Besides arguments relating to a common sense and logic reasoning, there are valid legal and policy arguments to improve the use of approximation to facilitate judicial cooperation...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{observation}} that criminal law is different {{in each of the}} member states as a result of which (1) what constitutes an offence in one member state does not necessarily constitute an offence in another member state, (2) even where offences are equally criminalised in all member states, the sanction levels may still vary and (3) more generally, the position of the offences in the entirety of the justice system may vary, the question arises to what extent those so-called offence diversities are an obstacle for EU policy making and to what extent it is feasible to overcome those obstacles. The doctoral research underpinned the need for the development of an EU offence policy, using the common criminalisation acquis as a centre piece. The common criminalisation acquis can help (1) to ensure comparability of crime statistics, (2) to avoid redundant <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> testing, (3) to overcome evidence gathering difficulties, (4) to clarify the mandates of the EU level actors, (5) to identify the equivalent national sentence and (6) to scope the taking account of prior convictions. The only condition: the development of an EU offence policy...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{will show}} that the term “extraordinary rendition” is of short legal history and that its {{conception}} perverts a number of basic international law principles. In doing so, it will be shown that this process is a method counter-productive to long terms goals in the War on Terrorism. We can conclude therefore that both “rendition to justice” and “extraordinary rendition” bear {{little resemblance to the}} traditional use of the terms rendition or extradition - the recognised, legal methods of transferring a suspect of a criminal offence from one State to another. [T]he protections of an extradition Treaty and the rights it affords an accused can be seen as inherent justiciable. The use of the extradition process is an expression of State sovereignty, yet the guiding principles of <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> and specialty ensure that the rights of the transferred person are also subject to protection and judicial scrutiny. It is clear that the nature of enforced disappearances is such as to attempt to avoid any legal process and human rights protection. In addition, it is noted that official denial of this practise as part of counter-terrorist policy and a lack of judicial oversight contribute to the view that U. S. intelligence agencies are aware of the illegality of the practise at international la...|$|E
40|$|The chapter revisits the {{innovations}} {{introduced by the}} Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) {{and the establishment of}} an EU-wide system of free movement of judicial decisions in criminal matters, covering both pre-sentence and final decisions, within an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. It focuses upon the functionality of the principle of mutual recognition and identifies certain problem areas that limit the substantive scope of the EAW. The chapter first examines the two major reforms introduced by the Framework Decision, namely the abolition of the ‘double criminality’ test and the limited grounds for refusal of execution, especially the rule against surrendering nationals. It is argued that such a refusal cannot now rest on any human rights considerations, despite its constitutional premise in a number of cases. The chapter also provides a commentary on the paradox that, while the Framework Decision dispenses with verification of the <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> test for the categories of listed offences, it leaves the definition of those offences (and the penalties applicable in each case) to the issuing Member State. And in accordance with the Framework Decision, the Member State must respect fundamental rights as enshrined in Article 6 TEU as well as the principle of legality. Konstadinides argues that ‘mutual recognition’ does not necessarily imply mutual trust...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} drawn from a dissertation, {{entitled}} “The Politics of Law in the Recognition of Papua Customary Court After the Enactment of Special Autonomy Act. ” It discusses the formula of how the state legal system can recognize the institution, authority and verdict of a customary court {{so that it can}} respond to the indigenous people’s needs. This article belongs to a doctrinal legal research. It incorporates several approaches including statute approach, historical approach, conceptual approach and philosophical approach. To analyze the legal sources used as the source of data in this research, interpretative methods are used. After a thorough analysis, this research finds some following formulas to create the politics of law of customary court recognition that can respond to the needs of indigenous society. (1) The customary court should be recognized as a non-state legal system. The customary court is established under peace principals among indigenous people and therefore it should be kept independent and autonomous. (2) The state should acknowledge the customary court’s jurisdiction to settle criminal and civil customary disputes among indigenous society. However, it should be emphasized that the customary court can only adjudge pure customary crimes and <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> cases. In addition, the customary court should be authorized to hand a maximum sentence of five-year jail term to a convict. (3) The verdict of a customary court has to be final and binding. Therefore, i...|$|E
40|$|M. PhilJudicial {{cooperation}} {{is in the}} fore of European Union (hereinafter referred to as EU) integration in criminal matters. In the past decade we have witnessed revolutionary efforts to introduce new mechanisms in this field that have reshaped EU criminal cooperation and have promisingly declared to develop the EU into an area of freedom, security and justice. The pioneer initiative in this area has, without doubt, been the principle of Mutual Recognition, which has been famously pronounced as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation and has become the centerpiece of EU judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The adoption of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant signified {{the introduction of the}} first concrete measure in the field of EU criminal law implementing the principle of Mutual Recognition. To date, it has been implemented by all Member States and has had more than seven years of testing ground. In the context therefore of exploring the impact of the application of the principle of Mutual Recognition in criminal matters on State Sovereignty this thesis takes the European Arrest Warrant as a case study. The hypothesis of this thesis is that the European Arrest Warrant, in theory and practice, challenges essential functions and prerogatives of Member States that are defining features of their State Sovereignty. The discussion that follows is dedicated to exploring whether State Sovereignty is challenged. To do so, it focuses on three axons around the European Arrest Warrant a) the <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> requirement and its partial abolition b) the removal of the bar to surrender of own nationals and c) the â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cdepoliticisationâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆d of the surrender procedure...|$|E
40|$|While {{lacking the}} raw {{excitement}} of the live 'penalty shoot-out' that was {{the announcement of the}} decision of the House of Lords in Reg. v. Bow Street Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet, 1 the initial impression of the decision in Reg. v. Bow Street Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet (No. 3) 2 was of a solid majority support for the position that Pinochet was not entitled to immunity in the United Kingdom in respect of the criminal acts he is alleged to have committed. Even as Lord Browne-Wilkinson attempted to explain the intricacies of the decision, the matter of immunity appeared settled and of secondary consideration to the 'new' requirement of <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> which alone, it seemed, had resulted in the considerable reduction in the list of crimes for which Pinochet could be extradited to Spain. Closer examination of the reasoning of their Lordships, however, quickly dispels that impression and reveals a range of opinions across a wide spectrum. What agreement there was between their Lordships on the matter of Pinochet's immunity from jurisdiction is diverse and often contradictory. In particular, the Lordships who formed the majority were equally divided on the question as to whether Pinochet was acting within his official capacity when carrying out the acts of which he is accused. Given that immunity rationae materiae appears to be available only in respect of official acts, {{it is difficult to see}} how the six could have agreed on the fact that Pinochet was not entitled to such immunity. Indeed, given the fact that Lord Goff (dissenting) was of the opinion that the alleged acts were performed in the course of Pinochet's functions as head of state, there was in fact a majority in favour of the prima facie existence of immunity rationae materiae...|$|E
40|$|The {{institution}} of extradition dates {{back from the}} thousands of years, during which the institution mentioned above has become in permanent evolving, with social relations getting complicated. Globalization, as a socio-political phenomenon, has {{the greatest impact on}} extradition having complicated and modified the process making it responds to current challenges on the part of society. And, despite the fact that eventually positive attitude toward human rights has come to characterize the {{institution of}} extradition, such legal acts as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Convention on the Protection of the Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Convention against Torture and many others have become an important stage on its way, which ultimately have brought about changes in usual perception of the institution, having adopted the necessity of securing individual rights in it in connection with extradition through transnational cooperation. Intensive discussion of extradition questions in legal literature, abundance of legal acts by no means approaching emerging issues repetitively, constantly arising empirical evidence of lack of clearly defined methods of international cooperation on extradition questions lead to the need to address the deep causes of the problem, to determine the place of extradition in the system of international law, to work out effective legal standards that would enable the institution of extradition to realize its full potential in the fight against world crime. In the post-Soviet space a set of regulations and principles, concerning extradition issues, appeared. It determined the process of getting out offenders: the rule of <b>double</b> <b>criminality,</b> the rule of specialization, the principle to extradite or prosecute and others. The article is ted to study of the institution of extradition and is focused on the analysis of its past, changes, which it endured during its formation, and problems that the institution faces nowadays. This subject is quite sensitive strictly because it is regulated not only by rules of a particular state, but by rules of international law. Contemporary international law can be characterized as a vector directed to protect human rights that undoubtedly affected the nature of the institution. Inaccuracies in contemporary legislation, penal problems of extradition are often complicated by interference of a political factor. In other words, relations between states on the world stage often have a huge influence on the process of extradition. At the same time, current political situation and political motives of subjects have a great impact on the institution of extradition. In this work the authors consider the political aspect of the institution of extradition (giving the offenders out) in modern legislation. The study of these issues, connected with exclusion of political crimes from the scope of extradition, should be further developed in both international contract law and national legislation. </p...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{examines}} extradition and {{jurisdiction over}} extraterritorial crime, {{focusing on the}} relationship between jurisdiction and extradition in the broader context of human rights law. The authors challenge what they argue are chimerical, although strongly held beliefs in the incompatibility of European and United States criminal justice systems and extradition practices. They argue that cooperation in matters of international criminal law may be enhanced, while protection of human rights is promoted. The authors establish this possibility by breaking down the barriers to understanding that stem from the divergent European versus Anglo-American modes of analysis. The authors first analyze the five traditional bases of prescriptive jurisdiction in the United States. Next, these principles are compared to their counterparts in French and German law. The authors then focus their discussion on the German principle of ubiquity and its United States parallel, which is a combination of both the objective territoriality theory (the effects doctrine) and the subjective territoriality theory, which arises when an element of the crime occurs in the United States. The objective and subjective territoriality theories have expanded to mitigate conflicts resulting from a traditional strict application of territoriality principles. Next, the authors discuss the question of what jurisdictional principles allow extradition when an offense has no specific territorial basis. The protective principle, the passive personality principle, the nationality principle, and the universality principle are analyzed in this context. The authors compare United States application of these principles to that of European states and suggest that the differences are less than usually is purported. The authors also examine the special use of <b>double</b> <b>criminality</b> in extradition cases, which requires simultaneous jurisdiction in two states for an individual to be extraditable. They question its viability in each system. The authors next suggest that the United States Government ought to consider the application of vicarious administration of justice, which is common in European states. The authors then apply these principles to mutual assistance in criminal matters, especially extradition, and discuss two possible situations: first, when only one state proscribes the conduct in question; second, when two or more states proscribe the conduct and one state enlarges the proscription. Theoretical principles, policy perspectives, and contrasting modes of analysis are compared in the context of extradition and mutual assistance. Theoretical problems are indicated and solutions are proposed. The authors conclude that if a strict doctrine of territoriality were the only basis of extraterritorial jurisdiction, then competing jurisdiction would not be a problem although a strict territorial approach would make both the domestic and the internal systems dysfunctional. The recognition and application of active and passive personality principles, along with the protective and universality principles are needed to make criminal law viable in the modern world. Their application, however, causes problems in matters of jurisdiction and cooperation. The authors propose several new ideas to resolve the jurisdictional and substantive problems, including the application of vicarious administration of justice when extradition is not possible...|$|E
