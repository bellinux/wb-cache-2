In the first part, we briefly review the long run process of growth and institutional change, emphasizing the reforms leading to the “opening” of the two economies. Then, we focus on key structural features and we compare the recent development processes of the two countries. At the end, there are some hints about certain persisting imbalances and the sustainability of the <b>growth</b> <b>processe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the {{phenomenology}} of ageing in certain many-particle systems which are at a critical point of their non-equilibrium steady-states, are reviewed. Examples include the contact process, the parity-conserving branching-annihilating random walk, two exactly solvable particle-reaction models and kinetic growth models. While the generic scaling descriptions known from magnetic system can be taken over, some of the scaling relations between the ageing exponents are no longer valid. In particular, there is no obvious generalization of the universal limit fluctuation-dissipation ratio. The form of the scaling function of the two-time response function is compared with the prediction {{of the theory of}} local scale-invariance.

40|$|Flowering is {{the main}} process that determines yield in fruit trees, and a {{negative}} relationship between crop load and floral induction has been observed in many species. In apple tree, hormonal signals coming from seeds, mainly gibberellins, which can be transported over long distances within the tree, are suspected to inhibit floral induction. Apple trees display a complex architecture with large genotypic variability. This genotypic variability results in differences in organ morphology and topology (succession of shoots and branching pattern) that can directly modify the amount of “inhibiting” signal reaching each meristem. To analyze the intertwined effects of plant architecture, crop load and inhibiting signal on floral induction we developed a model based on the L-system formalism. In the model, the plant is represented {{as a set of}} interconnected metamers and organs, in which the amount of inhibiting signal coming from each fruit is transferred to the next metamer depending on its length and on a constant proportion of the incoming flux of inhibiting signal. The model assumes that the amount of inhibiting signal produced every day depends on the stage of fruit development. The model simulates both the basipetal and acropetal movement of the signal as well as its partitioning at each branching point. An iterative procedure was used to reach model convergence in order to partition the total amount of inhibiting signals in the whole tree structure. Simulations were performed on sub-tree structures (shoot and branch) to analyze the response of the model to three main parameters (α: the transfer rate, proportion of signal moved to the next metamer, σ: the parameter driving the partition of the signal into acropetal and basipetal fluxes, and L: the internode length). Then, simulations were performed during one growth season on 4 -year-old trees simulated using the MappleT model with a range of crop loads. The model reveals its accuracy to simulate well-known results at the tree scale (e. g. higher amount of inhibiting signal when crop load increases) and at the shoot scale (e. g. higher amount of inhibiting signal in reproductive shoots than in vegetative ones). More interestingly, if we assumed thresholds for signals that inhibit floral induction, we observed that changing α values and the crop load led to contrasted floral induction patterns that can be related to genotype bearing behavior (regular vs alternate). So far, the model has been only compared to qualitative results from literature. But it gives new insights into interactions between plant development, architecture and floral induction in a context of genotypic variability. Experiments are currently being performed to validate this model at different scales of plant organization. Furthermore, the model developed in this study seems to be generic enough to be easily adapted to other plants for simulating moving signals that can affect <b>growth</b> and developmental <b>processe...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The main {{angiotensin}} (Ang) II subtype receptors (AT 1 R and AT 2 R) {{are involved}} in cellular growth processes and exert functionally antagonistic effects. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the mechanisms by which Ang II receptors influence growth, by investigating the interactions between Ang II subtype receptors and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation. DESIGN AND METHODS: The experiments were performed using a mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH 3 T 3, by transient co-transfection with rat AT 1 R or AT 2 R expression vectors, or both. Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2 phosphorylation was analysed by western blot and the ERK activity was evaluated using PathDetect, an in-vivo signal transduction pathway trans-reporting system. Selective Ang II receptor antagonists (losartan for AT 1 R and PD 123319 for AT 2 R) were used to investigate the contributions of each receptor to the response observed. RESULTS: Our data show that, in this cellular model, both Ang II receptors phosphorylate ERK 1 / 2. However, in the cells expressing AT 1 R, the EGF-induced MAPK pathway was enhanced {{in the presence of}} Ang II in a synergistic fashion. In contrast, a reduction of EGF-induced MAPK activation was observed in the cells expressing AT 2 R. In cells expressing both Ang II subtype receptors, Ang II promoted an enhancement of EGF-induced MAPK activation. However, {{in the presence of the}} AT 1 R antagonist, losartan, the effect of EGF was reduced. CONCLUSION: These data indicate the existence of an opposite cross-talk of AT 1 R and AT 2 R with EGF receptors, and suggest a complex functional interaction between these pathways in the regulation of cellular <b>growth</b> <b>processe...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chronic volume {{overload}} {{leads to}} excentric hypertrophy, myocardial dysfunction, activation of neurohumoral factors, accumulation of collagen and cardiac remodelling. Matrix reorganisation and collagen formation {{have been suggested}} {{to be responsible for}} cardiac remodeling. Prolyl- 4 hydroxylase (P 4 H) is a key enzyme in collagen synthesis, which built thermally stable triple helix collagen. Inhibition of Collagen-P 4 H (C-P 4 HI) favors production of unstable collagen, which is quickly degraded. FG 0041 a K-P 4 HI and FG 2216, which inhibits the HIF-P 4 H are orally available. FG 0041 {{has been shown to be}} effective in preventing LV remodeling after acute myocardial infarction. Aim of this study to determine wheter administration of P 4 HI leads to beneficial effects on myocardial remodeling in aortocaval shunt. Methods: Induction auf aortocaval shunt (ACS) in 28 day old male Sprague Dawley rats. Sham-operated rats served as control. From day 2 to 28, ACS animals were treated with either FG 0041, FG 2216 or vehicle. Echocardiographie two day before sacrifice. Activity of the metalloproteinase (MMP 2, MMP 9) and there inhibitors (TIMP 1 - 4), mRNA and proteins levels of transforming growth factor ß (TGFß), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), integrin ß (ITGß), osteopontin (OPN) and collagen I and III, MMP 1, MMP 2, TIMP 1 - 4 were measured. Results: Characterization of aortocaval shunt heart weigt (HW), interventricular septum (IVS), porsterior wall (PW), the weight of the lung, left ventricular enddiastolic and end systolic diameter (LVEDD, LVESDD) were increased. LV- Ejection (LV-EF) and LV- fractional- shortening (LV-FS) were degreased. Endothelin- 1, endothelin receptor alpha and beta (ETRa and ETRß), Growth factors like TGFß 1, CTGF, ITGß and OPN mRNA Expression were increased by induction of shunt. Collagen, MMP 2, TIMP 1 and TIMP 2 mRNA were upregulated in the shunt group. FG 0041 increased LV-EF and LV-FS without significant alterations in LVEDD and LVESD. Treatment with FG 2216 significantly reduced the enlargement of the right and left ventricle, reduced LVEDD and LVESD and increased LV-FS and LV-EF. No changes under FG 0041 and FG 2216 in the endothelin system. Growth factors TGFß, CTGFß and OPN, Collagen I and III mRNA Expression were reduced with FG 0041. Under treatment with FG 2216 merely the mRNA Expression of TGFß, activity of MMP 9 were reduced and TIMP 4 Genexpression increased. Conclusion: Induction of aortocaval shunt leads to increased left ventricular remodelling, induced hypertrophy- related growth factors, stress related mediators, collagen production and MMP and TIMP mRNA levels. Changes in mRNA and protein accompanying left ventricular remodelling can be reversed by FG 0041. Changes in cardiac remodelling can be reversed by FG 2216, but not the changes in mRNA and protein levels of growth factors, collagen and extracellular matrix protein. FG 0041 and FG 2216 could therefore be a new therapeutic option in the treatment of pathological myocardial <b>growth</b> <b>processe...</b>|$|E
