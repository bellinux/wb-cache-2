50|$|Financial Reinsurance (or fin re), {{is a form}} of {{reinsurance}} {{which is}} focused more on capital management than on risk transfer. In the non-life segment of the insurance industry this class of transactions {{is often referred to as}} <b>finite</b> <b>reinsurance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over the 2004-2006 {{period a}} number of {{financial}} or <b>finite</b> <b>reinsurance</b> transactions attracted regulatory scrutiny, notably from New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, due to the concern that their primary result was to distort and manage accounting presentation rather than to transfer risk. In particular, a transaction between AIG and General Re through which the former buttressed its reserves was identified as transferring insufficient risk, and this review led to management changes at both companies. Accountants, regulators and other constituencies proposed a variety of tests for such transactions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Finite</b> <b>reinsurance</b> {{transactions}} {{attracted the}} attention of insurance supervisors and beyond recently. This paper considers the resulting and ongoing discussion concerning the regulatory environment for <b>finite</b> <b>reinsurance</b> transactions. Consumer protection and financial stability are reflected in the light of cost–benefit considerations as criteria for the further design of finite reinsurance-related regulation and supervision. At the same time, some of the forces that influence the shaping of regulation and supervision are described. This article concludes that few, concise and, in an ideal case, worldwide applicable rules and principles are best suited to guide the development within the field of <b>finite</b> <b>reinsurance.</b> Such rules and principles would most probably {{have a positive impact on}} consumer protection and financial stability. This article therefore supports the IAIS intention to consider the topic of <b>finite</b> <b>reinsurance</b> further.

40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of the <b>finite</b> risk <b>reinsurance</b> is the existence of an found of experience, which is constituted by the premiums charged by the reinsurer, together with his financial incomes, and his objective is to finance the claims to be satisfied to the insurer in the specified period. The objective of this work is to design a model that allows us to determinate the reserve that the found of experience should have in every annual period in order to guarantee its dynamic solvency, taking into the experience of the claims of the reinsurer"s portfolio and of each insurance company...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{calculate}} the renewal premium of <b>finite</b> risk <b>reinsurance</b> under the assumption that the interest rate shows a stochastic evolution. The problem of the convolution of the random variables involved in the calculation of the premium has been solved by simulating claim paths using the Monte-Carlo method and applying three financial decision criteria: the expected value, the variance and the standard deviation. In the last two criteria we propose to use a stochastic recurrence equation to avoid the problem of dependence between stochastic capitalization factors. The application of the variance criterion and of the standard deviation criterion has allowed us to obtain the reinsurance premium depending on the level of risk aversion of the reinsurer and the volatility of the interest rat...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into six chapters. The {{introduction}} reminds the appendages of traditional reinsurance. Definition, functions and clear generalization of both types and common provisions of <b>finite</b> <b>reinsurance</b> contracts is summarized in the second chapter. The third chapter is engaged in the available regulatory rules which relates with <b>finite</b> <b>reinsurance.</b> There is a preparatory act of the Czech Insurance law, the American standard FAS 113 and the European standard IFRS 4 described. Text is concentrates in different requirements on risk transfer of these standards. The fourth chapter describes risk transfer methods, which have been used until recently. Next, there is made a proposal of a new method, method of partial risk transfer, which eliminates significant shortcomings of the currently used methods. Features of partial risk transfer methods, comparing to other methods are described on two practical examples. There is a possible way of partial risk transfer accounting delineated in the fifth chapter. The conclusion is the summary of benefits of the new method...|$|E
5000|$|When Greenberg was {{terminated}} from AIG at {{the insistence of}} New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, five employees of General Re and AIG were also indicted in connection with an accounting fraud at AIG that overstated reserves in this and subsequent quarters, the accounting rules violated were those Schroeder oversaw as an FASB project manager. Schroeder testified as an expert witness about accounting for <b>finite</b> risk <b>reinsurance</b> at this Federal criminal conspiracy trial in Hartford, Connecticut. Warren Buffett was never named in the case. Former AIG CEO Greenberg and CFO Howie Smith disputed in court whether the New York AG had the power to pursue a civil fraud case against them. [...] The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned the convictions of all five Gen Re and AIG employees. In mid-2012 they signed deferred prosecution agreements with the Department of Justice that acknowledged mistakes and misjudgments but not criminal wrongdoing.|$|R
