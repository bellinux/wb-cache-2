500|$|Lady Gaga {{collaborated with}} RedOne and Space Cowboy {{in writing and}} {{producing}} [...] "So Happy I Could Die". All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E
2500|$|Palin voiced her {{opposition}} to Measure 4, which, {{according to the}} Alaska constitution, {{could be construed as}} being unconstitutional, since a governor is not by law allowed to advocate either for or against any ballot measure. [...] "Let me take my governor's hat off <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> here and tell you, personally, Prop 4- I vote no on that", she said. [...] "I have all the confidence in the world that (the Department of Environmental Conservation) and our (Department of Natural Resources) have great, very stringent regulations and policies in place. We're {{going to make sure that}} mines only operate safely, soundly." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was some}} time later {{when they came back}} to the store, and <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> Grant saw Hetty alone. She was dressed very plainly in new garments, and blushed when he looked gravely down on her.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little <b>minute</b> Danny Meadow Mouse {{wanted to}} cry. Then he remembered old Mr. Toad and instead began to laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} an anxious day, but this makes up for everything," [...] he said. [...] "Now--and it is so long since I have seen you--can't we, <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> forget our troubles?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... Defense Minister Naoki Tanaka said [...] "We have {{confirmed}} that a certain flying object has been launched and fell after flying <b>for</b> <b>just</b> over <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> {{and there was no}} impact on Japanese territory".|$|R
60|$|Then old Mr. Toad {{once more}} opened his big mouth {{and began to}} laugh harder than ever. Jimmy Skunk looked at him <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and he looked so funny that Jimmy Skunk began to laugh too.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit yawned again. Then {{he closed}} his eyes <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> When he opened them there was Striped Chipmunk on the old log just as before, and the pockets in both cheeks were so full that it seemed as if they would burst.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Blacksnake kept {{right on}} through the old post {{and out the other}} end, for he was sure that that was the way Danny had gone. He {{kept right on}} along the little path. Now Danny knew that he wouldn't go very far before he found out that he had been fooled, and of course he would come back. So Danny waited only long enough to get his breath and then ran back along the path to where another little path {{branched}} off. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> he paused.|$|E
5000|$|... "Most mobile TV viewing is <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> To be commercially successful, {{you have}} to provide a {{combination}} of live news, sports updates and video-on-demand made-for-mobile content which is instantly engaging. Simply broadcasting linear TV to mobiles is not the answer," [...] he said.|$|R
50|$|The most used sound {{structure}} is the open form, since {{the public can}} decide to experience <b>a</b> sound installation <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> or <b>for</b> <b>a</b> longer period of time. This obliges the artist to construct a sound organization {{that is capable of}} working well in both of the two cases.|$|R
60|$|Johnny Chuck {{opened his}} eyes. Then {{he sat up}} and rubbed them. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few, few <b>minutes</b> he couldn't {{remember}} where he was at all.|$|R
60|$|Up {{the middle}} of the Big River, flying just above the water, swept the flock with Dusky at its head. How swiftly they flew, those nine big birds! Blacky envied them their swift wings. On past the hidden hunter but far out over the Big River they swept. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> Blacky thought they were going on up the river and not coming in to eat, after all. Then they turned toward the other shore, swept around in a circle and headed {{straight}} in toward that hidden hunter. Blacky glanced at him and saw that he was ready to shoot.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was lucky}} I had sense {{enough to stay}} there. You know the moon was very bright last night. It made that open place in front of where I was hiding almost as light as day. Once I closed my eyes <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> When I opened them, there was Yowler sneaking across that open place. Where he had come from, I don't know. He hadn't made a sound. Not a leaf rustled under his big feet. Right {{in the middle of}} that open place, where the {{moonlight}} was brightest, he stopped to listen, and I simply held my breath." ...|$|E
60|$|An angry {{light came}} {{into the eyes of}} Reddy Fox and made them an ugly yellow <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> But he felt too sick to quarrel. Unc' Billy Possum saw this. He saw how Reddy was really suffering, and down deep in his heart Unc' Billy was truly sorry for him. But he didn't let Reddy know it. No, indeed! He just pretended to be tickled to death to see Reddy Fox so helpless. He didn't dare stay long, for fear Granny Fox would return. So, after saying a few more things to make Reddy feel uncomfortable, Unc' Billy started off up the Lone Little Path toward the Green Forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two," [...] pleaded the smith, who, {{with his}} assistant, was {{by this time}} {{standing}} nearly knee-deep in water.|$|R
50|$|Sonay {{occurs at}} autumnal equinox {{when the day}} and night are equal. So when the full moon of Sonay rises the sun is to set. That is the time that these eternal lovers could see each other face to face, of course, <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> That night the Sonay's look is full of love.|$|R
6000|$|MABEL. Will {{you wait}} <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> please? Returning. It's De Levis--to see you. [In a low voice] Let me see him alone first. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute!</b> Do! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly Mr. Toad {{remembered that}} he had on his working clothes, which were very old, very dirty and very ragged. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> he didn't know what to do. Then he dived under a cabbage leaf and began to pull off his old suit. But the old suit stuck! He {{was in such a}} hurry and so excited that he couldn't find the buttons. Finally he got his {{trousers}} off. Then he reached over and got hold of the back of his coat and tugged and hauled until finally he pulled his old coat off right over his head just {{as if it were a}} shirt.|$|E
60|$|At last he so {{lost his}} temper {{that when he}} found another of those eggs he angrily kicked {{it out of the}} nest. Now it {{happened}} that Jimmy Skunk was just underneath. Down fell that hard china egg squarely on Jimmy Skunk's head. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> Jimmy saw stars. At least, he thought he did. Then he saw the egg, and knew that Unc' Billy had knocked it down, and that it was this that had hit him. Jimmy was sore at heart because he had found no eggs, and now he had a bump on the head that also was sore. Jimmy Skunk lost his temper, a thing he rarely does.|$|E
60|$|So {{very early}} the next morning Little Joe Otter went to the best fishing pool he knew of in the Laughing Brook, and there he caught the biggest trout he could find. It was so big and fat that it made Little Joe's mouth water, for you know fat trout are his {{favorite}} food. But he didn't take so much as one bite. Instead he carefully laid it on an old log where Buster Bear would be sure to see it if he should come along that way. Then he hid near by, where he could watch. Buster was late that morning. It seemed to Little Joe that he never would come. Once he nearly lost the fish. He had turned his head <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and when he looked back again, the trout was nowhere to be seen. Buster couldn't have stolen up and taken it, because such a big fellow couldn't possibly have gotten out of sight again.|$|E
50|$|The {{lanterns}} {{were hung}} <b>for</b> <b>just</b> under <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to avoid catching {{the eyes of}} the British troops occupying Boston, but this was long enough for the message to be received in Charlestown. The militia waiting across the river had been told to look for the signal lanterns, and were prepared to act as soon as they saw them.|$|R
6000|$|Joy, darling! It's so awful, you 'll make {{yourself}} ill, {{and it is}} n't worth it, really. I 'd do anything to save you pain--won't you stop <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're going. Harry's outside. I {{told him}} you didn't want to see him, so he's kept out of your way. But {{he wants to know}} if he can come in <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to say good-bye to you." ...|$|R
60|$|That night, after jolly, round, red Mr. Sun {{had gone}} to bed behind the Purple Hills, and the Black Shadows had crept over the Green Meadows, Old Man Coyote started for the Old Pasture, Now, he had never been there before, but he had asked so many {{questions}} of Tommy Tit, and he is so smart anyway, that it didn't take him long to go all through the Old Pasture and to find the bull-briar castle of Old Jed Thumper, who was making life so miserable for Peter Rabbit, He wasn't at home, but Old Man Coyote's wonderful nose soon found his tracks, and he followed them swiftly, without making a sound. Pretty soon he came to a bramble-bush, and under it he could see Old Jed Thumper. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> he chuckled, a noiseless chuckle, to himself. Then he opened his mouth and out came that terrible sound which had so frightened all the little people on the Green Meadows when Old Man Coyote had first come there to live.|$|E
60|$|Now in {{his great}} fright Chatterer had run and jumped {{so hard that}} he was {{beginning}} to grow very tired. Presently he found that he must make a very long jump to reach the next tree. He had often made as long a jump as this and thought nothing of it, but now he was so tired that the distance looked twice as great as it really was. He didn't dare stop to run down the tree and scamper across. So he took a long breath, ran swiftly along the branch, and leaped. His hands just touched the tip of the nearest branch of the other tree. He tried his very best to hold on, but he couldn't. Then down, down, down he fell. He spread himself out as flat as he could, and that saved him a little, but still it was a dreadful fall, and when he landed, it seemed <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> as if all the breath was gone from his body. But it wasn't quite, and in another minute he was scrambling up the tree.|$|E
6000|$|Escaping {{from these}} forlorn splendors, {{we went into}} the sculpture-gallery, where I was able to enjoy, in some small degree, two or three {{wonderful}} works of art; and had a perception that there were a thousand other wonders around me. It is as if the statues kept, for the most part, a veil about them, which they sometimes withdraw, and let their beauty gleam upon my sight; only a glimpse, or two or three glimpses, or a little space of calm enjoyment, and then I see nothing but a discolored marble image again. The Minerva Medica revealed herself to-day. I wonder whether other people are more fortunate than myself, and can invariably find their way to the inner soul of a work of art. I doubt it; they look at these things <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and pass on, without any pang of remorse, such as I feel, for quitting them so soon and so willingly. I am partly sensible that some unwritten rules of taste are making their way into my mind; that all this Greek beauty has done something towards refining me, though I am still, however, a very sturdy Goth. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "'What's the matter, Mr. Turtle?' I asked, {{for even}} though I don't {{like the old}} fellow any too well it pays to be polite, and really, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> I was afraid he'd {{make up his mind}} to die.|$|R
40|$|Good morning. It is my {{very great}} {{pleasure}} to be here with you today, and to have this opportunity to visit with you about the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources. I’m going to talk <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> about issues and highlights for the Institute, and then I’ve asked Dan Cotton, director of IANR’s Communications and Information Technology unit to illustrate some of the fine and innovative work being done in the Institute to benefit Nebraska...|$|R
40|$|Revised March 2009. "Missouri's {{geographical}} location midway between {{northern and southern}} weather systems often means surprise amounts of ice and snow accumulations in the winter. They are a cold reminder of the difficulties involved in running a modern farm when the power goes out, even <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> or hours. <b>A</b> standby power generator can be good insurance to keep critical facilities running. But several critical factors need consideration when buying, installing and using a generator...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} Jimmy Skunk had {{recovered}} himself. You {{know he is}} not afraid of anybody or anything. He sprang {{out from behind the}} stump, looking a wee bit shame-faced, and started for old Granny Fox. [...] "You let Peter Rabbit go!" [...] he commanded in a very threatening way. Now the reason Jimmy Skunk is afraid of nobody is because he carries with him a little bag of very strong perfume which makes everybody sick but himself. Granny Fox knows all about this. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> she hesitated. Then she thought that if Jimmy used it, it would be as bad for Peter as for her, and she didn't believe Jimmy would use it. So she kept on backing away, dragging Peter with her. Then Unc' Billy Possum took a hand, and his was the bravest deed of all, for he knew that Granny was more than a match for him in a fight. He slipped down from the tree where he had sought safety, crept around behind Granny, and bit her sharply on one heel. Granny let go of Peter to turn and snap at Unc' Billy. This was Peter's chance. He slipped out from under Granny's paws and in a flash was behind Prickly Porky.|$|E
5000|$|... "A Spanish Piece" [...] {{is a short}} track from Pink Floyd's Soundtrack {{from the}} Film More album, running <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and four seconds. It is the first Pink Floyd song to be {{credited}} solely to guitarist David Gilmour. It features a short piece on a Flamenco guitar, while Gilmour says stereotypical phrases in a poorly exaggerated Spanish accent through a lisp.|$|E

40|$|The spindle {{checkpoint}} delays anaphase onset in {{the presence}} of defective kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Such delays can last <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> or several hours, but very shortly after all chromosomes achieve bi-orientation, a remarkably synchronous anaphase ensues. We are beginning to understand the pathways involved in silencing spindle checkpoint signals and subsequent activation of the anaphase-promoting complex. Here, we review recent advances made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating this critical cell cycle transition...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! What was that?" [...] Reddy's sharp ears {{had caught}} a sound {{up near the}} top of the hill. He stopped short and looked up. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little wee <b>minute</b> Reddy couldn't believe that his eyes saw right. Coming down the hill {{straight}} towards him was the strangest thing he ever had seen. He couldn't see any legs. He couldn't see any head. He couldn't see any tail. It was round like a ball, but it was the strangest looking ball that ever was. It was covered with old leaves. Reddy wouldn't have believed that it was alive but for the noises it was making. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> wee <b>minute</b> he stared, and then, what do you think he did? Why, he gave a frightened yelp, put his tail between his legs, and ran just as fast as he could make his legs go. Yes, Sir, that's just what Reddy Fox did.|$|R
5000|$|Back in 2002, Jimmy calls Hamlin to {{tell him}} that Chuck has decided against his resignation. He helps Chuck remove the foil from his walls and reminiscences over a book they read {{together}} during their youth. Chuck is quick to sever the nostalgia and remind him that his actions will neither be forgotten nor forgiven. When Jimmy returns to the office, he shares with Kim and confides to her on how refreshing it is to not be hated by Chuck even <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
