However, groundwater level data {{held at the}} British Geological Survey is varied in detail. Information is not <b>evenly</b> <b>distributed</b> to <b>cover</b> major aquifers, but is often concentrated in limited areas, that have been mapped in detail or where boreholes have been drilled. The current water level database “Wellmaster”, includes rest water level data for more than 40 000 boreholes across the UK. The data ranges from high frequency measurements over long time periods (ca. 5...|$|R
40|$|Background The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) is an {{important}} insect pest of wheat. It has tractable genetics, polytene chromosomes, and a small genome (158 Mb). Investigation of the Hessian fly presents excellent opportunities to study plant-insect interactions and the molecular mechanisms underlying genome imprinting and chromosome elimination. A physical map is needed to improve the ability to perform both positional cloning and comparative genomic analyses with the fully sequenced genomes of other dipteran species. Results An FPC-based genome wide physical map of the Hessian fly was constructed and anchored to the insect 2 ̆ 7 s polytene chromosomes. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones corresponding to 12 -fold coverage of the Hessian fly genome were fingerprinted, using high information content fingerprinting (HIFC) methodology, and end-sequenced. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) co-localized two BAC clones {{from each of the}} 196 longest contigs on the polytene chromosomes. An additional 70 contigs were positioned using a single FISH probe. The 266 FISH mapped contigs were <b>evenly</b> <b>distributed</b> and <b>covered</b> 60...|$|R
30|$|Microscopic {{study of}} wounds on day 21 after CrHFC with AuNP {{application}} showed a complete epithelization of burns. Lymphoid infiltration was not detected. Wound defect was completely replaced by young connective tissue {{in which the}} collagen and elastic fibers were oriented orderly with {{a significant number of}} fibroblast-like cells between them. It {{should be noted that the}} newly formed connective tissue was penetrated by microvessels which is very important for wound healing due to the activation of metabolic processes. Over the area of the wound defect, a newly formed epithelial layer was slightly thinner than in the area surrounding the wound. This could be due to the stretching of the epithelium as the newly formed connective tissue grew up under it. Immune fluorescence of type I and III collagens was clear, regular, <b>evenly</b> <b>distributed,</b> and <b>covered</b> 30.36 [*]±[*] 8.2  % and 13.91 [*]±[*] 5.2  % of the area, respectively. The ratio of collagen type I/III was 2.18. These results showed an active course of regenerative processes as well as in the group with CrHFC application.|$|R
30|$|In this section, it {{is assumed}} that the target’s azimuth angle in the cover {{corridor}} is θa[*]=[*] 90 °, the radar half-power beam width is θi 0.5 [*]=[*] 2 °, the target’s initial coordinates are (10  km, 17.32  km), the flying speed is (−[*] 200  m/s, 0  m/s), and the azimuth difference is θi[*]=[*]θi 0.5 [*]=[*] 2 °.

Because the effect of time-cooperative jamming on the two detectors is similar, taking into account the length of the paper, the simulation only uses the detection results of the OS-CFAR detector for illustration.|$|R
