40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review {{successful}} models for school reform with a focus on the efficacy of the <b>High</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work model in vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> in Massachusetts. This study compared and analyzed the results of learner outcomes in Massachusetts vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> by using the results in the Failing category from the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, which is a high-stakes test based on increased standards (The Massachusetts Frameworks). The study compared an equal number of Massachusetts vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> <b>that</b> are members of the <b>High</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work network with an equal number of those that are nonmembers. The study compared the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System Failing category results in English Language Arts and Mathematics from 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 between <b>High</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> in Massachusetts and non-High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> in Massachusetts. Students not in the Failing category for English Language Arts and Mathematics would be eligible to receive a <b>high</b> <b>school</b> diploma, while those students in the Failing categories would not be eligible to receive diplomas. The study also compared dropout rates between 1999, 2000, and 2001 to learn if increased standards and highstakes testing have led to a significant increase in the dropout rate in <b>High</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> in Massachusetts when compared to dropout rates in non-High <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> in Massachusetts. ^ Based on the comparative results of the dropout rates, this study has concluded <b>that</b> implementing the <b>High</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work model in vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> in Massachusetts has done no harm in terms of significant increases in the dropout rates. ^ Based on these results, this study has concluded <b>that</b> implementing the <b>High</b> <b>Schools</b> <b>That</b> Work model in Massachusetts vocational-technical <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> has done some significant good in effectively increasing learner outcomes on high-standards, high-stakes testing.

5|$|On November 30, at a Draffenville, Kentucky tournament {{game against}} Oak Hill Academy, Alexander scored 26 of his teams 39 points on 12–14 field goal {{shooting}} in a 72–39 defeat. On December 29, Curie again faced Parker and Simeon in the Pontiac Holiday Tournament (this {{time in the}} semifinals). Alexander posted 21 points on 9–10 field goal shooting, but Simeon still prevailed 62–57. Notably, Parker assumed Alexander as a defensive assignment after Alexander gave Curie a 48–47 lead with 4:58 time remaining and Alexander went scoreless {{the rest of the}} game. Despite 11 points, 9 rebounds and 8 blocked shots from Alexander, Curie was eliminated from the CPL playoffs in a February 11 quarterfinals 60–58 loss to the Billy Garrett, Jr.-led Morgan Park <b>High</b> <b>School</b> <b>that</b> went on to become 2013 IHSA Class 3A state champion. On February 26, the Associated Press Illinois Class 4A basketball rankings showed Whitney Young at number 1, and it was also expected that Young's road to the sectional finals would include a March 6 meeting with Curie. According to Henricksen, the March 6 state playoff meeting between Young and Curie was anticipated because it would pit Okafor against Alexander, making it the most highly touted IHSA playoff matchup of centers since 1988 when LaPhonso Ellis led East Saint Louis' Lincoln High School against Eric Anderson's St. Francis de Sales High School. Mike Helfgot of the Chicago Tribune said that there have not been many matchups between big men this good with so much at stake. On March 2, Alexander attended Senior night at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Assembly Hall. The February 2013 Great Plains blizzard caused controversial postponements of several IHSA games including the March 6 Young-Curie game, which was delayed one day. Young defeated Curie 62–58 as the supporting cast made up for Alexander's 14–13 scoring edge over Okafor.|$|E
5|$|Once {{he began}} to play football, as a junior, he {{achieved}} instant success as a running back, running 65 {{yards for a touchdown}} on his first high school carry.

Jefferson High School was integrated with neighboring Columbia <b>High</b> <b>School</b> <b>that</b> year; Payton and his teammates were upset that their head coach, Charles L. Boston, had become an assistant and Payton boycotted some of the spring practices in protest, but returned during the fall season. He then earned statewide honors as a member of Mississippi's all-state team, leading Columbia to an unexpected 8–2 season. His performance helped ease the local tensions surrounding desegregation. Tommy Davis, Columbia’s football coach, claimed that he could always count on Payton when the team needed to score. Payton’s statistics proved that was no exaggeration: he scored in every game during his junior and senior years. He was named to the all-conference team two years in a row. Payton also led the Little Dixie Conference in scoring his senior year and made the all-state team. In addition to excelling at football, Payton averaged 18 points a game for Columbia’s basketball team, leaped three-quarters of an inch short of 23 feet in the long jump, played baseball, and continued to drum in the school band.|$|E
