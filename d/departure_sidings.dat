50|$|The {{arrival and}} <b>departure</b> <b>sidings</b> contain two {{connections}} to the West Coast main line onto the up slow. At {{the east end of}} the depot, there is a trailing crossover to permit access onto the down slow when coming off depot.|$|E
5000|$|With a {{total length}} of over 1¼ miles, between Wath Central railway station and Elsecar Junction, and with over 36 miles of track this was two yards in one: Eastbound traffic was {{received}} in 8 reception sidings feeding 31 <b>departure</b> <b>sidings</b> {{and controlled by}} [...] "B" [...] Box, whilst for westbound traffic there was a fan of 9 reception sidings, again feeding 31 <b>departure</b> <b>sidings</b> and controlled by [...] "A" [...] Box. The western entry/exit to the yard was {{under the control of}} Elsecar Junction signal box whilst the eastern end was controlled by Moor Road signal box, with additional control from the Wath Central signal box, which controlled the main lines through the yard and was situated by the station. The yard could handle as many as 5,000 wagons per day.|$|E
50|$|The {{marshalling}} yard takes up {{an area of}} 280 hectares, has a length of 7,000 metres and a maximum width of 700 metres. When it opened it had a total track length of 300 kilometres and there were six signal boxes, 825 sets of points, 100 home, 115 distant and 688 shunting signals. As a two-sided shunting facility, Maschen has two train formation yards. The north-south system has a set of 48 <b>departure</b> <b>sidings</b> {{and a set of}} 16 reception sidings; the south-north system consists of a set of 64 <b>departure</b> <b>sidings</b> and a set of 17 reception sidings. Both systems are supplemented by storage and marshalling sidings. In addition, there is an eight-road main repair shop for the repair of goods wagons and an engine shed for the maintenance of electric and diesel-driven goods train locomotives with a two-road inspection hall and numerous open-air storage sidings.Two signal boxes are responsible for the yard, one for each system. Separate signal boxes that had been built for the marshalling sidings were closed again in 1983.|$|E

50|$|In the 1930s, {{there were}} plans for {{passenger}} {{traffic on the}} northern section of the Ring Railway, but these were thwarted by the Second World War. Only the section from Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof via Nuremberg East to Nuremberg Northeast had passenger services, but only in 1911 and 1912. Another service was established in 1904 for staff traffic between Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof and Nürnberg Rbf Ausfahrt (Nuremberg marshalling yard <b>departure</b> <b>sidings)</b> station. After {{the establishment of the}} Verkehrsverbund Großraum Nürnberg (Greater Nuremberg Transport Association) on 27 September 1987, this could be used by normal passengers, but in 1992 it returned to being a staff-only service.|$|E
5000|$|The depot was {{designed}} in the 1960s, to service electric locomotive classes AL1 to AL6 (TOPS classes 81 to 86) and subsequently class 87s, and consists of six parallel shed roads (each holding four locomotives inside the shed) and several arrivals and <b>departure</b> <b>sidings</b> externally. There is also a road that runs round {{to the north of}} the shed and this provides access to the fuel siding, (which for many years was used only for the occasional fueling of diesel shunters), and also to the DC lines of Willesden Junction Low Level station, which is used to move multiple units from the shed onto the North London Line after servicing.|$|E
