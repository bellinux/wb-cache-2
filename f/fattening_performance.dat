40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of a diet containing non-conventional (i. e. alternative to soybean meal) vegetable protein sources on <b>fattening</b> <b>performance,</b> and meat and dry-cured ham quality of heavy pigs. Fifty-six (Landrace x Large White) castrated males with an initial average body weight of 50 kg were allocated to two experimental groups: a control group in which pigs received a traditional soybean meal-based diet, and a treatment group in which soybean meal was replaced by vegetable protein sources (i. e. sunflower meal, potato protein, corn gluten feed, faba beans and dehydrated alfalfa meal), mainly locally grown and not genetically modified. Pigs were slaughtered at approximately 160 kg body weight. Dietary treatment had no significant effect on <b>fattening</b> <b>performance,</b> or meat, fat or dry-cured ham properties.

40|$|The {{effects of}} four protein sources (soybean meal, {{sunflower}} meal, pea and fish meal {{as the main}} protein source) were investigated on <b>fattening</b> <b>performance,</b> carcass and meat quality traits and body composition of pigs. Eight animals per treatment received the diets from 30 to 105 kg live weight {{at a level of}} 3. 0 times maintenance requirement of energy. Diets were formulated on the basis of ileal digestible protein and amino acid content of feedstuffs. Protein sources resulted similar <b>fattening</b> <b>performance</b> from 30 - 105 kg body weight. From 30 to 60 kg soybean treatment had lowest performance. The protein source treatments did not alter the body composition, lean meat percentage, liver weight and meat quality (intramuscular fat content, pH 45 min and 24 hours after slaughter, drip loss, meat lightness and hue measured 24 hours and 4 days after slaughter). It can be concluded that protein sources can be replaced without affecting overall <b>fattening</b> <b>performance,</b> carcass and meat quality and body composition if diet formulation is based on the ileal digestible amino acid contents of feedstuffs. However the lower performance of the soybean treatment in the first phase may indicate that ileal digestible Lys content of heat treated protein sources may not characterise the feedstuffs well enough.

Data were collected in the test stations “Schöndorf”/Thuringia and in “Grub”/Bavaria as well as in stud book farms in Thuringia and Bavaria. <b>Fattening</b> <b>performance</b> and carcass quality were measured on 4, 397 and 2, 264 lambs, respectively, in Schöndorf and 1, 292 lambs in Grub. The genetic correlation between feed efficiency and the number of lambs born alive (LGL) was in Thuringia r A = − 0. 35, but in Bavaria − 0. 03 only. Further, the genetic correlations between daily feed intake and LGL were different with 0. 29 in Thuringia and − 0. 20 in Bavaria. But the standard errors of the estimates were high due to an insufficient genetic linkage between data from station testing (<b>fattening</b> <b>performance,</b> carcass quality) and from field testing (fertility). Therefore, the results have to be considered as tendencies. A high feed intake during the whole test period led to better daily gain.

40|$|The {{effects of}} using high fatty acids forages on Maramures Brown <b>fattening</b> steer <b>performance</b> were studied on 30 {{finishing}} steers assigned uniformly to 3 groups: control group (no fatty acids-rich feed), E 1 (24 % full fat soybean {{in the compound}} feed) and E 2 (32 % rapeseeds in the compound feed). The diets consisted of Sudan grass as bulk forage (free access) and of limited amounts of compound feeds. The use of fatty acids-rich forages did not influence the ingesta of compound feeds and of the complete diet. Weight gain in the experimental groups were {{higher than in the}} control group (1393 and 1113 g/steer/day in groups E 1 and E 2, respectively, compared to 1053 g/steer/day in group C) a significant difference being noticed between groups C and E 1 (P ≤ 0. 05). The meat of steers from the experimental groups had a higher level of crude fat (18 and 24 g in groups E 1 and E 2, respectively, versus 13 g in group C), while meat protein was lower in group E 1 (211 g), intermediary in group C (226 g) and higher in group E 2 (240 g). Crude fat linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) level increased from 8. 33 % (group C) to 9. 46 % (group E 1), which is beneficial to human health. A higher level of saturated fatty acids was noticed in the meat of animals from group E 2, a higher level of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids was noticed in the meat of animals from group E 1, as well as a higher level of medium-chain fatty acids to the detriment of long-chain fatty acids...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to test an organic feed for chicken production. Different feed {{mixtures}} with reduced dietary energy level (< 12 MJ AME/kg) and reduced content of essential amino acids were investigated. In case of reduction a constant ratio of amino acids to energy was considered. Under the future European law for organic products all raw materials used for the feed were of organic origin. The feed consumption of the different feeding groups ran conversely proportional to the diets energy level. The obtained <b>fattening</b> <b>performance</b> and carcass yield reached a high level under the circumstances of organic production. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{determine}} <b>fattening</b> and slaughter <b>performance</b> {{as well as physical}} properties of meat in Pulawska pigs fed mixtures containing faba beans and corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Thirty animals were divided into three equal groups: control (I) and two experimental (II and III). Pigs were kept in pens and fed the same mixtures collectively ad libitum thro-ughout the fattening. The only high-protein component of the mixture of the control group was soybean meal, while in mixtures fed to experimental groups, 1 / 3 of extrac-ted soybean meal protein was replaced by faba bean (group II) or DDGS (group III). Introduction of 10 % low-tannin faba bean in the mixtures for pigs did not affect the daily weight gains, while the use of the same amount of corn distillers dried grains with solubles in the diet significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) reduced daily gains and, consequ-ently, the final body weight of the finishers. No effects of the nutrition on lean and fat content in the carcass were noticed. Longissimus muscle of pigs fed DDGS wa...|$|R

Fatty acid {{pattern of the}} adipose tissues back fat, leaf fat and intermuscular fat and of the total- and phospholipids of the M. long, dorsi In this investigation the fatty acid pattern of the adipose tissues back fat (devided in dorsal and ventral compartment), leaf fat and intermuscular and the total and phospholipids of the M. long, dorsi of different MHSgenotypes and sexes of the Piétrain race have been compared. There were available 60 animals with equal numbers of the three MHS-genotypes (NN, Np, pp) and both sexes (castrates, gilts) (liveweight {{at the end of}} fattening: 150 kg). The decreasing presence of the stress allele p (pp > Np > NN) as well the castrates compared with the gilts were combined with increasing content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and decreasing content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in all adipose tissues and in the total and phospholipids of the M. long, dorsi and thus with better technological quality. The results should additionally cause the selection stress resistent pigs of the Piétrain race...|$|R
40|$|LCA {{has been}} used in many studies to {{evaluate}} the effect of feeding strategy on the environmental impact of pig production. However, because most studies have been conducted in Europe the question of the possible interactions with the context of production is still in debate. The objective of this study was then to evaluate these effects in two contrasted geographic contexts of production, Brazil and France. The LCA considered the process of pig fattening, including production and transport of feed ingredients, feed production and transport to the farm, raising of fattening pigs, and manure storage, transport and spreading. Impacts were calculated at the farm gate and the functional unit considered was one kg of body weight gain over the <b>fattening</b> period. <b>Performances</b> of pigs were simulated for each scenario using InraPorc® population model (2000 pigs for each scenario considering between animal variability). The LCA calculations were performed for each pig according to its own performance and excretion, and the results were subjected to variance analysis. The results indicate that for some impacts there are clear interactions between effects of feeding program, origin of soybean and location of production. For climate change, the interest of phase feeding and incorporation of feed-use amino acids (FU-AA) is very limited and even counterproductive in Brazil with soybean from South, whereas it appears to be an efficient strategy with soybean from Center West, especially in Europe. Rather similar effects are observed for cumulative energy demand. Conversely, eutrophication and acidification potential impacts are reduced by phase feeding and FU-AA addition in a rather similar way in all situations. In all situations, precision feeding, the only strategy that takes account for the between animal variability, is the most effective approach for reducing life cycle impact of pig fattening, whereas the potential of phase feeding program and FU-AA is dependent of soybean origin and geographical context of pig production, contrasting with many published results...|$|R
