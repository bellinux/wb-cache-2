40|$|LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) {{directly}} measures canopy vertical structures, {{and provides}} an effective remote sensing solution to accurate and spatiallyexplicit mapping of forest characteristics, such as canopy height and Leaf Area Index. However, many factors, such as large data volume and high costs for data acquisition, precludes the operational and practical use of most currently available LiDARs for frequent and large-scale mapping. At the same time, a growing need is arising for realtime remote sensing platforms, e. g., to provide timely information for urgent applications. This study aims {{to develop an}} airborne profiling LiDAR system, featured with on-the-fly data processing, for near real- or real- time <b>forest</b> <b>inventory.</b> The development of such a system involves implementing the on-board data processing and analysis as well as building useful regression-based models to relate LiDAR measurements with forest biophysical parameters. This work established a paradigm for an on-the-fly airborne profiling LiDAR system to <b>inventory</b> regional <b>forest</b> resources in real- or near real- time. The system was developed based on an existing portable airborne laser system (PALS) that has been previously assembled at NASA by Dr. Ross Nelson. Key issues in automating PALS as an on-the-fly system were addressed, including the design of an archetype for the system workflow, the development of efficient and robust algorithms for automatic data processing and analysis, the development of effective regression models to predict forest biophysical parameters from LiDAR measurements, and the implementation of an integrated software package to incorporate all the above development. This work exploited the untouched potential of airborne laser profilers for realtime <b>forest</b> <b>inventory,</b> and therefore, <b>documented</b> an initial step toward developing airborne-laser-based, on-the-fly, real-time, <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> systems. Results from this work demonstrated the utility and effectiveness of airborne scanning or profiling laser systems for remotely measuring various forest structural attributes at a range of scales, i. e., from individual tree, plot, stand and up to regional levels. The system not only provides a regional assessment tool, {{one that can be}} used to repeatedly, remotely measure hundreds or thousands of square kilometers with little/no analyst interaction or interpretation, but also serves as a paradigm for future efforts in building more advanced airborne laser systems such as real-time laser scanners...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable forest {{management}} requires timely, detailed <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> data across large areas, which {{is difficult to}} obtain via traditional <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> techniques. This study evaluated k-nearest neighbor imputation models incorporating LiDAR data to predict tree-level inventory data (individual tree height, diameter at breast height, and species) across a 12 100 ha study area in northeastern Oregon, USA. The primary objective was to provide spatially explicit data to parameterize the Forest Vegetation Simulator, a tree-level forest growth model. The final imputation model utilized LiDAR-derived height measurements and topographic variables to spatially predict tree-level <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> data. When compared with an independent data set, the accuracy of <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> metrics was high; the root mean square difference of imputed basal area and stem volume estimates were 5 m 2 • ha– 1 and 16 m 3 • ha– 1, respectively. However, the error of imputed <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> metrics incorporating small trees (e. g., quadratic mean diameter, tree density) was considerably higher. Forest Vegetation Simulator growth projections based upon imputed <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> data follow trends similar to growth projections based upon independent inventory data.

The book does not contain reliable data on areas of forests, for which <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> materials either do not exist or have been lost, {{as well as on}} details and accuracy of presented <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> data. The published information about temporal remoteness of <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> data are in contradiction with those that were reported in presentations of official representatives of the Federal Forestry Agency and Roslesinforg, which have been done at different conferences and meetings devoted to <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> problems. Four methods of <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> and planning, which are used in the State Forest Register (SFR) do not cover all diversity of the methods, which have been used in the Russian forests. There is a clear inconsistency in information on the application of different methods of <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> in the country. It follows from the lack of any guidance materials about the account for areas inventoried by aerial survey, rational combination of ground inventory with office deciphering of aerial photographs, and <b>inventory</b> of reserve <b>forests</b> based on remote sensing products.

40|$|Forest {{management}} is {{the management of}} private or public forest resources to achieve their conservation, social services, and economic values, concerned with the administrative, economic, legal and social aspects. All decision-making, operations-scheduling, and policy-planning require information of high quality. In forest management, this information is acquired by means of forest inventory: the systematic collection of data and information derived from forest measurements. A <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> is not only used for estimating the current growing stock, also conducted at several points of {{time in order to}} analyse temporal changes and yield forecasting. When conducting a <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> several <b>forest</b> parameters need to be taken into account, including individual tree heights, site quality, diameter at breast height, basal area, stocking, and timber volume. The main purpose of <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> is to measure these forest characteristics for estimating means and totals of timber products and planning harvest over a defined area (Kangas and Maltamo, 2006). However, it is infeasible to measure all individual trees (whole forest) in a large-scale region; therefore the acquisition of forest attributes is based on sampling. Typically, <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> is usually implemented by measuring the sample plots in the field, a proportion of the whole population of trees, to estimate the extent, quantity and condition of the whole <b>forest.</b> Thus, <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> in a large-scale plantation based on sampling involves time consuming and labour intensive field data collection. The development of remote sensing techniques makes it possible to conduct large-scale forest surveys with three-dimensional information at various scales from the forest stand level to individual tree level. Particularly, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), an active remote sensing technique, emerges as rapid and efficient tool for <b>forest</b> <b>inventories.</b> It offers the ability to measure forest attributes at the individual tree level. This thesis aims to explore the potential of LiDAR data for automated <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> estimates. An integrated GIS tool was developed for constructing a <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> system for Pinus radiata plantations in Victoria, Australia. The tool was built as a set of tools running on the desktop GIS software package ArcGIS by integrating spatial analysis, LiDAR data analysis and image segmentation techniques as well as empirical tree models to support <b>forest</b> <b>inventories</b> of Pinus radiata on an individual tree basis. It provides functions for selecting forest plots to extract LiDAR data, building canopy height models (CHM) from the extracted LiDAR data, delineating individual trees on the CHMs by applying the marker controlled watershed segmentation technique, and deriving <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> estimates based on the CHMs and identified individual trees through spatial analysis and tree modelling using the empirical models. The integrated GIS tool was applied to a <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> of Pinus radiata plantations in Mt. Worth, Victoria, managed by HVP Pty Limited. The inventory results were validated using the field survey data. The tool not only provides a practical means of <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> of Pinus radiata plantations in southern Australia, but also a new approach {{to the development of a}} fully automated <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> system through the integration of advanced GIS and LiDAR technology...|$|R

The study area is a cerrado (Brazilian savannas) patch of 355. 23 ha located in the Papagaios county Minas Gerais, Brazil. The first method was implemented during the field campaign of the <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> whereas the second method was a stratification of the area based on visual interpretation of a Landsat TM image. The parameters analyzed were: the mean of the volume, the standard deviation and the <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> error.

40|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>inventory</b> data {{often provide}} the {{required}} base data {{to enable the}} largearea mapping of biomass over a range of scales. However, spatially explicit estimates ofabove-ground biomass (AGB) over large areas may be limited by the spatial extent of theforest inventory relative {{to the area of}} interest (i. e., inventories not spatially exhaustive), orby the omission of inventory attributes required for biomass estimation. These spatial andattributional gaps in the <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> may result in an underestimation of large areaAGB. The continuous nature and synoptic coverage of remotely sensed data have led totheir increased application for AGB estimation over large areas, although the use of thesedata remains challenging in complex forest environments. In this paper, we present anapproach to generating spatially explicit estimates of large area AGB by integrating AGBestimates from multiple data sources; 1. using a lookup table of conversion factors appliedto a non-spatially exhaustive <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> dataset (R 2 = 0. 64; RMSE = 16. 95 t/ha), 2. applying a lookup table to unique combinations of land cover and vegetation densityoutputs derived from remotely sensed data (R 2 = 0. 52; RMSE = 19. 97 t/ha), and 3. hybridmapping by augmenting <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> AGB estimates with remotely sensed AGB estimates where there are spatial or attributional gaps in the <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> data.
