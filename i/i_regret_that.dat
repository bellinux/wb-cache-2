25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E

But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{friend of}} mine {{returning}} from Italy had talked with a lady there who {{did not like the}} book. <b>I</b> <b>regretted</b> <b>that,</b> of course, but what surprised me was the ground of her dislike. 'You know,' she said, 'it is all so morbid.' ...|$|R
500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should be ashamed of yourself, mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that.</b> However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

Steele later confirmed the story but expressed his sadness that it was now public knowledge, saying [...] "I swore never to divulge publicly what took place and <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> it has found some way of 'getting into the light'." ...|$|E

Why should <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that?</b> What I accomplished was approved by Congress— which represents our people. All of you live in safety from domestic enemies because of security from the police. Likewise, you live in safety from foreign enemies because our military keeps them from attacking us. Nuclear technology was already under development in other countries. My assigned responsibility was to develop our nuclear navy. I managed to accomplish this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bose's {{correspondence}} (prior to 1939) {{reflects his}} deep disapproval of the racist practices of, and annulment of democratic institutions in Nazi Germany: [...] "Today <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> I {{have to return}} to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish but arrogant". [...] However, he expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods (though not the racial ideologies) which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s, and thought they could be used in building an independent India.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 July 2011, in {{delivering}} the European Commission's final assessment on the measures taken by Italy and France, the Home Affairs Commissioner said, [...] "rom a formal {{point of view}} steps taken by Italian and French authorities have been in compliance with EU law. However, <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> {{the spirit of the}} Schengen rules has not been fully respected". Ms. Malmström also called for a more coherent interpretation of the Schengen rules and a stronger evaluation and monitoring system for the Schengen Area.|$|E
2500|$|I would {{certainly}} {{never do anything}} to diminish {{the horror of the}} Nazi Holocaust as I revere and respect the history of my people. [...] I sponsored legislation which created one of the first state Holocaust Commissions in America and actively served as a Commission member for over 20 years. [...] <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> anyone in the Jewish Community, my Republican colleagues or anyone else was offended by the portrayal of my comments. [...] My comments were not directed toward any group or people but at the false message and, specifically, the method by which it has been delivered.|$|E

I have never participated in acts of violence nor of bloodshed, nor have I killed anyone. And what I would like to clarify here is that I know that my mere participation, {{even though it was}} secondary in one incident, if it contributed to the violence in society, I am deeply sorry and I regret it ... I was in prison for almost 15 years. I have reflected a great deal over it, and I understand that violence did harm to society; I understand it and <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> I participated in it.

2500|$|The {{scene and}} song [...] "Life Support" [...] were {{also based on}} Friends in Deed, {{as well as on}} Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the [...] "forget regret" [...] refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV {{positive}} friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this [...] "credo...my T-cells are low, <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> news, okay?" [...] Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, [...] "Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?" [...] Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, [...] "Then why choose fear?" [...] Gordon says, [...] "I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{donated the}} maximum {{allowable}} amount to John McCain's {{campaign in the}} summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing [...] "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his [...] "style and substance." [...] He additionally referred to Obama as a [...] "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that {{despite the fact that she}} is admired, [...] "now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." [...] He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was [...] "troubled" [...] by the [...] "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." [...] Powell stated that [...] " [...] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." [...] Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, [...] "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me." [...] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, [...] "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and <b>I</b> <b>regret</b> <b>that</b> [...] I think we need a transformational figure. I think we need a president who is a generational change and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain." [...] Later in a December 12, 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.|$|E
