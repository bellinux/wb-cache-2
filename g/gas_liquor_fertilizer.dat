5000|$|Scrubbers which {{utilized}} {{water were}} {{designed in the}} 25 years after {{the foundation of the}} industry. It was discovered that the removal of ammonia from the gas depended upon {{the way in which the}} gas to be purified was contacted by water. This was found to be best performed by the Tower Scrubber. This scrubber consisted of a tall cylindrical vessel, which contained trays or bricks which were supported on grids. The water, or weak <b>gas</b> <b>liquor,</b> trickled over these trays, thereby keeping the exposed surfaces thoroughly wetted. The gas to be purified was run through the tower to be contacted with the liquid. In 1846 George Lowe patented a device with revolving perforated pipes for supplying water or purifying liquor. At a later date, the Rotary Washer Scrubber was introduced by Paddon, who used it at Brighton about 1870. This prototype machine was followed by others of improved construction notably by Kirkham, Hulett, and Chandler, who introduced the well-known Standard Washer Scrubber, Holmes, of Huddersfield, and others. The Tower Scrubber and the Rotary Washer Scrubber made it possible to completely remove ammonia from the gas.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Microbiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Sasol plants gasify {{more than}} 30 million {{tons per annum}} of coal via the Fischer- Tropsch process {{resulting}} {{in the production of}} synthesis gas and a condensate stream. After gravimetric separation of the tar products, the solvent extraction of phenolics and the steam stripping of ammonia from the condensate stream, a complex effluent referred to as stripped <b>gas</b> <b>liquor</b> (SGL) is generated. SGL {{has the potential to be}} used as process cooling water. Micro-organisms, scale deposit and corrosion are three major problems associated with the operation of cooling water systems. Parameters that have an influence on the fouling, scaling and corrosion of industrial cooling towers include cycles of concentration (COC), flow velocity (FV) and pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water. Stripped <b>gas</b> <b>liquor</b> contains hydrocarbons which can interfere with PLFA analysis. There was, therefore, a need to optimise the selective extraction of hydrocarbons so as to eliminate their interference with PLFA analysis. The method used for the extraction of hydrocarbons before silicic acid fractionation succeeded in removing the hydrocarbons and their interference and was, therefore, determined to be appropriate method to use in subsequent analyses. Even though the two lab-scale cooling towers were of identical design their similarity or dissimilarity needed investigation. Physico-chemical analysis results confirmed that the two cooling towers were operated under identical operational conditions. The two cooling towers were found to be similar in terms of the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates as well as microbial community structure. The two cooling towers could be operated in parallel using different operational conditions with any differences in results being a reflection of the effects of operational conditions. The effects of pH, FV and COC on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as microbial community dynamics were evaluated with the aid of a 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design. Cycles of concentration was found to have the most profound effect on the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates followed by pH. Cycles of concentration and pH were found to have the most profound effect on microbial community dynamics. The use of the 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design also allowed the determination of optimal conditions for the operation of,the cooling towers using SGE as feed water. These conditions were found to be 5 COC, a pH of 7. 5 and a FV of 0. 6 m/s. In conclusion, the use of a 2 ³ factorial experimental design, physico-chemical, PLFA and DGGE analyses were instrumental in the successful determination of the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in the cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water.

30|$|Monocalcium {{phosphate}} anhydrous [Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2; the IUPAC name is calcium dihydrogen orthophosphate anhydrous] is the anhydrous form of MCPM. Although MCPM {{has been}} known since 1807 (Dorozhkin 2012 a, 2013 a), MCPA was differentiated as “tetra-hydrogen calcium phosphate, H 4 Ca(PO 4) 2 ” by 1879 (Roscoe and Schorlemmer 1879). It crystallizes under the same conditions as MCPM but at temperatures above ~ 100  °C (e.g., from concentrated hot mother <b>liquors</b> during <b>fertilizer</b> production). In addition, MCPA might be prepared from MCPM by dehydration. Furthermore, it might be also prepared at ambient temperatures by crystallization in water-restricted or non-aqueous systems. Like MCPM, MCPA never appears in calcified tissues and is not biocompatible due to its acidity. There is no current application of MCPA in medicine. Due to the similarity with MCPM, in many cases, MCPA might be used instead of MCPM; however, highly hydroscopic properties of MCPA reduce its commercial applications (Becker 1989; Budavari et al. 1996).|$|R

Sponsorship: Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (UK) /Grant Agency of the Czech Republic project number 203 / 97 /P 130 /The Royal SocietyThis work investigated {{the potential to}} use measurement of the concentration of certain gases in the rumen headspace to gain information about rumen processes and as a potential diagnostic tool. We used new equipment (selected-ion-flow-tube mass spectrometer) that allows rapid and precise analysis {{of many of the}} gases present in a sample. Samples of rumen headspace gas and corresponding samples of rumen liquor were taken from three lactating cows, prepared with rumen fistulae, at intervals after receiving their morning feed allocation (grass silage and concentrates). Hydrogen sulfide, methyl sulfide, and dimethyl sulfide, were the predominant gases that were measured in the rumen headspace by this technique. The concentrations of these sulfur compounds declined over the interval after feeding, mirroring ammonia concentrations measured in rumen liquor, reflecting their common dependence on the fermentation of sulfur amino acids. Ammonia concentrations in rumen headspace gas varied in the opposite direction to the concentration of ammonia in rumen liquor and likely depend more on the pH of rumen liquor. Consideration of the pKa of ammonia suggests that ammonia concentrations in rumen gas will be very low below pH 6, representing a useful diagnostic for subacute ruminal acidosis. Low concentrations of volatile fatty acids were detected in rumen gas. The molar proportions of volatile fatty acids were similar in <b>gas</b> and <b>liquor</b> samples, with rumen gas containing slightly less acetic acid and disproportionately more valeric and caproic acids.

40|$|Black liquor is a {{byproduct}} of the chemical pulping process and a critical source of energy for the pulp and paper industry. It contains the spent caustic cooking chemicals and the organic content from the wood liberated during the cooking process. Conventionally, black liquor is incinerated in recovery boilers to recover {{energy in the form}} of steam and the cooking chemicals in the form of molten salt. The steam can be used in the mill for heating and drying; it can also be used in a steam turbine to generate electricity. However, recovery boilers are not thermally efficient in comparison with coal or gas fired power generation boilers. Clearly, improvements in efficiency will result in considerable cost savings. Therefore, alternative technologies have attracted increasing interest recently. One such technology is fluidized bed gasification, which has significant advantages over conventional recovery boilers. The product <b>gas</b> of black <b>liquor</b> gasification is a mixture of CO, H 2, CO 2 and H 2 O, which can be cleaned and burned in a gas turbine or fuel cell to produce electricity, or fired in a boiler to produce process steam for the mill.

40|$|Now day {{scientists}} {{focus the}} research {{to develop the}} novel cough suppressant therapies of herbomineral formulation because in respiratory disease cough is an important defensive pulmonary reflex. It removes fluids, irritants, or foreign substances. When cough becomes non-productive and require suppression and opioid receptor agonists which do not have respiratory suppressant activity but opoids produce side effects such as sedation, addiction potential and constipation, and also compromise the respiratory function. The present study was carried out to evaluate the antitussive activity of polyherbomineral formulation on cough reflex induced by different cough induced models in mice. Healthy albino mice of either sex, weighing 25 - 30 g were divided into seven groups, (n = 6). Group I considered as control, Group II and III received lab prepared herbomineral formulation (LPHF) (250 and 500 mg/kg, p. o.), Group VI and VII treated with marketed formulation (MF) (250 and 500 mg/kg, p. o.), Group IV and V were positive control and treated with standard (10 and 20 mg/kg, p. o.) at a dose of 0. 3 ml/mice, orally. Antitussive activity of LPHF and MF were studied by sulphur dioxide <b>gas</b> and Ammonium <b>liquor</b> induced cough in mice.

40|$|Chinese liquors can be {{classified}} according to their flavor types. Accurate identification of Chinese liquor flavors is not always possible through professional sommeliers’ subjective assessment. A novel polymer piezoelectric sensor electric nose (e-nose) {{can be applied to}} distinguish Chinese liquors because of its excellent ability in imitating human senses by using sensor arrays and pattern recognition systems. The sensor, based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) principle is comprised of a quartz piezoelectric crystal plate sandwiched between two specific gas-sensitive polymer coatings. Chinese liquors are identified by obtaining the resonance frequency value changes of each sensor using the e-nose. However, the QCM principle failed to completely account for a particular phenomenon: we found that the resonance frequency values fluctuated in the stable state. For better understanding the phenomenon, a 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation using the finite volume method is employed to study the influence of the flow-induced forces to the resonance frequency fluctuation of each sensor in the sensor box. A dedicated procedure was developed for modeling the flow of volatile <b>gas</b> from Chinese <b>liquors</b> in a realistic scenario to give reasonably good results with fair accuracy. The flow-induced forces on the sensors are displayed from the perspective of their spatial-temporal and probability density distributions. To evaluate the influence of the fluctuation of the flow-induced forces on each sensor and ensure the serviceability of the e-nose, the standard deviation of resonance frequency value (SDF) and the standard deviation of resultant forces (SDFy) in y-direction (Fy) are compared. Results show that the fluctuations of Fy are bound up with the resonance frequency values fluctuations. To ensure that the sensor's resonance frequency values are steady and only fluctuate slightly, in order to improve the identification accuracy of Chinese liquors using the e-nose, the sensors in the sensor box should be in the proper place, i. e., where the fluctuations of the flow-induced forces is relatively small. This plays a significant reference role in determining the optimum design of the e-nose for accurately identifying Chinese liquors...|$|R
40|$|Gasification using entrained flow {{reactors}} generates syngas {{that can}} be upgraded tochemicals with little <b>gas</b> cleaning. Black <b>liquor</b> (BL) is a by-product from pulping industrythat consists of residual wood constituents and spent pulping chemicals. Currently, it iscombusted to recycle the pulping chemicals {{and at the same}} time generate steam and power. Alternatively, BL is one of the most attractive fuels for entrained flow gasification due to thecatalytic activity of alkali compounds inherent in BL, possibility for pressurized feeding andthe shared logistics with the pulping plant. However, the high content of ash in BL is also anenergy penalty. Therefore the efficiency of BL gasification can be improved by co-gasifyingit with more energy rich fuels. The current work investigates the gasification characteristics of BL and pyrolysis oil(PO) blends by means of laboratory experiments. Experiments with varying BL/PO blendingratios were conducted using three different devices. An isothermal thermogravimetric reactorwas used to measure the reactivity of char under varying temperature and gas compositions. Asingle particle reactor was used to investigate the conversion of single droplets when exposedto high temperature reactive gas flow using lean, stoichiometric and rich CH 4 -air flames. Finally, a drop tube furnace was used to study the effect of temperature, gas composition andparticle size on gas, tar, and gasification residues at high temperature (800 - 1400 °C). Char reactivity of mixture samples was more than 30 times that of PO and comparableto that of pure BL, thereby indicating that catalytic activity was still very high after theaddition of PO. High temperatures enhanced alkali release in the gas phase; however, theconcentration of alkali left in the particles remained high at any temperature and for anymixing ratio. Additionally the blends showed better carbon conversion than pure BL. Theconversion rate of large particles (500 - 630 μm) was controlled by mass diffusion and completecarbon conversion was never reached even at T = 1400 °C. In comparison with pine-wood thatwas used as a reference, BL-based samples showed much lower tar concentrations in thesyngas. The difference was attributed to alkali elements. Remarkably, the addition of PO toBL further promoted tar reforming in the presence of CO 2. The addition of PO alsosignificantly increased the yields of CH 4 and CO...|$|R
40|$|The {{particle}} size or crystal size distribution (PSD or CSD) {{of a solid}} product from a crystallizer is important in handling the solid. CSD related properties might be improved with larger {{particle size}}. The principle of particle size increase in continuous crystallization processes is to remove fine particles {{at a faster rate}} than large ones. Two technologies based on this principle are the Double Draw-Off (DDO) and the Fines Dissolving (FD) crystallizer configurations. Design charts were developed for the Fines Dissolving crystallizer. It was found that the particle size increase passes through a maximum value as the fines classification cut size is increased. Based on this information a design protocol was suggested for the FD crystallizer. A limited amount of data are required for this method of design. The modified DDO crystallizer configuration was developed in order to obtain particle size increase in processes with high natural slurry density for which a build-up of solid is impractical. This involved a recycle of a part of the overflow (in DDO operation) after further classification of particles to remove fines in a size range L(F 1) to L(F 2), thus controling the slurry density in the crystallizer. Design equations and design charts for this configuration were developed. Analysis showed that a stream with some fines in it might be more effective in decreasing the slurry density than a clear filtered liquor. Particle size increase was demonstrated for sodium chloride crystallization in caustic liquor using the FD, DDO and modified DDO crystallizers. A fines/feed flow modification as well as actual fines dissolution was used in the FD experiments. Significant size increase was observed in both cases. These experiments indicated that appreciable dissolution cost would be involved in FD operation. The DDO experiments produced large crystal particles with associated increase in slurry density. Slurry density information from large scale operations indicated that DDO operation would be possible for DDO ratios upto about 2. 5. The modified DDO configuration also produced larger particles. However, size increases were less than expected. Loss of supersaturation outside the crystallizer might be the reason. Appreciable reduction of crystallizer vessel fouling was observed in the DDO and modified DDO experiments. Randolph et al. (1990) demonstrated significant particle size increase for calcium sulfite precipitation in flue <b>gas</b> desulfurization (FGD) <b>liquor</b> using a DDO crystallizer. Experimental particle sizes were appreciably larger than predicted values. A partial fines dissolving model was proposed to explain this behavior. It was shown that dissolution of particles smaller than 8 μm in only about 2. 8 % of the recycle stream was enough for the additional size increase...|$|R
