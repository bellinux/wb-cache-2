50|$|The I Legislature {{started with}} the UCD victory in the 1979 election, in which it {{received}} an increased plurality of 168 seats, but still short of an absolute majority. In his <b>investiture</b> <b>speech</b> as Prime Minister on March 30, Adolfo Suárez outlined the main areas of his policy, including the constitutional development involving the implementation and structuring of the State of Autonomies. Subsequently, in April 1979, the first municipal elections since the Second Spanish Republic were held, in which UCD won in the overall vote tally, but {{lost control of the}} main urban centers to PSOE-PCE alliances.|$|E

At the moment of the vote, the confidence is awarded if the candidate receives a majority of votes in the first poll (currently 23 out of 45 deputies), but if the confidence is not awarded, a second vote is scheduled two days later in which a simple majority of votes cast (i.e., more [...] "yes" [...] than [...] "no" [...] votes) is required.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{from the}} time the king {{nominated}} José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero for a second term as prime minister immediately following the 2008 general election, almost a month passed before Zapatero was able to present his <b>Investiture</b> <b>Speech</b> before the Congress and stand for a Vote of Confidence. If no overall majority was obtained on the first Vote of the Confidence, then the same nominee and program is resubmitted for a second vote within forty-eight hours. Following the second vote, if confidence by the Congress is still unreached, then the monarch again meets with political leaders and the Speaker, and submits a new nominee for a vote of confidence. If, within two months, no candidate has won the confidence of the Congress then the King dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new general election. The King's royal decree is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress.|$|E

40|$|Con el discurso de investidura, los {{president}}es construyen la imagen de la nación y su propia imagen, en un ritual que tiene carácter performativo. El discurso en sí, además de la juramentación, es importante tanto por su fuerza elocutiva como por ser el primer pronunciamiento de un presidente o jefe de Estado. Dicho discurso se caracteriza por estar dirigido a un amplísimo y complejo auditorio que incluye a la comunidad internacional. En el presente trabajo se definen las características del discurso de investidura a partir del análisis de los textos de toma de posesión, para un nuevo mandato consecutivo, de dos presidentes latinoamericanos: Álvaro Uribe Vélez, posesionado el 7 de agosto del 2006, y Hugo Chávez, quien reasumió la presidencia de su país el 10 {{de enero}} del 2007. Igualmente se estudia, en cada discurso, la utilización del concepto de nación y los límites semánticos de esta palabra, con miras a determinar las consecuencias pragmáticas que derivan de su empleo. El método empleado fue el del análisis crítico del discurso, es decir el análisis del discurso con una intención crítica, como ha sido definido por Fairclough (1995), Van Dijk (1999), Wodak y Meyer (2003). Asimismo, el análisis de ambos discursos permite establecer sus diferencias estructurales y de estilo, así como la manera disímil en que construyen la identidad del orador y del auditorio. With the <b>investiture</b> <b>speech,</b> a president shapes {{the image of}} a nation as well as their personal image in a ritual bearing a performative feature. An act of oath, the discourse is important because of its eloquent force and because it constitutes the first statement of a president or Head of State. An inaugural address targets a broad and complex audience, even an international community. This article analyzes the features of inauguration speech from the analysis of the text of the take of possession for the consecutive term of two Latin American presidents: Álvaro Uribe Vélez, sworn on the 7 th of August of 2006, and Hugo Chávez, who resumed the presidency of his country on the 10 th of January of 2007. The article also studies, in each discourse, the use of the concept of a nation and the semantic boundaries of this word to determine the pragmatic outcomes as the result of its use. The method employed in the study was Critical Discourse Analysis, one with a critical intent, as defined by Fairclough (1995), Van Dijk (1999), Wodak & Meyer (2003). Throughout the analysis of both discourses, it was possible to establish the structural stylistic differences as well as the different ways in which they construct the identity of both the speaker and the audience...|$|E
