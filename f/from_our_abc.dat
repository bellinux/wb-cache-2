It’s always been my belief that, once the people who work here believed in their own greatness, there was virtually nothing we couldn’t accomplish. And they have proven me right time and time again. Given our track record of achievement and the incredibly dynamic times we live in, I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic or enthusiastic about what lies ahead for The Walt Disney Company. We just delivered the best results {{in the history of this}} legendary company, marking our fourth fiscal year of record performance in a row, and our stock price has recently been trading higher than ever, which speaks to our sustained success as well as our optimism and belief in Disney’s potential to keep growing and creating value over the long term. Our Studio delivered some of the biggest movies of 2014, and surpassed $ 4 billion in global box office for the second year in a row. Our Parks and Resorts continued to push the boundaries of creativity and innovation to take the guest experience to a whole new level of excellence, achieving record worldwide attendance and delivering double-digit earnings growth.

40|$|Background: When {{conducting}} a meta-analysis of a continuous outcome, estimated {{means and standard}} deviations from the selected studies are required in order to obtain an overall estimate of the mean effect and its confidence interval. If these quantities are not directly reported in the publications, they need to must be estimated from other reported summary statistics, such as the median, the minimum, the maximum, and quartiles. Methods: We propose a simulation-based estimation approach using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) technique for estimating mean and standard deviation based on various sets of summary statistics found in published studies. We conduct a simulation study to compare the proposed ABC method with the existing methods of Hozo et al. (2005), Bland (2015), and Wan et al. (2014). Results: In the estimation of the standard deviation, <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> method performs best in skewed or heavy-tailed distributions. The average relative error (ARE) approaches zero as sample size increases. In the normal distribution, <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> performs well. However, the Wan et al. method is best since {{it is based on the}} normal distribution assumption. When the distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed, the ARE of Wan et al. moves away from zero even as sample size increases. In the estimation of the mean, <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> method is best since the AREs converge to zero. Conclusion: ABC is a flexible method for estimating the study-specific mean and standard deviation for meta-analysis, especially with underlying skewed or heavy-tailed distributions. The ABC method can be applied using other reported summary statistics such as the posterior mean and 95 % credible interval when Bayesian analysis has been employed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Challenge {{of finding}} the {{shortest}} route visiting each member {{of a collection of}} locations and returning to starting point is an NP-hard problem. It is also known as Traveling salesman problem, TSP is specific problem of combinatorial optimization studied in computer science and mathematical applications. In our work we present a solution for TSP problem using ABC with SPV rule. In this method we extend Artificial Bee Colony algorithm using SPV rule. Artificial bee colony algorithm solves real coded optimization problems but travelling salesman problem is a discrete optimization problem for converting the ABC algorithm to solve TSP problem SPV rule is used. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent behavior of honey bee swarm. In the proposed method we extend ABC with SPV rule for local search strategy. The experimental results show that <b>our</b> proposed <b>ABC</b> with SPV performs better than GA (Genetic Algorithm), <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> with SPV model can reach broader domains in the search space and show improvements in both precision and computational time...|$|R

40|$|Phylogenetic {{inference}} is {{an attractive}} means to reconstruct transmission histories and epidemics. However, {{there is not a}} perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. <b>Our</b> <b>ABC</b> framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV- 1 epidemic...|$|R

40|$|Introduction We {{consider}} the controllability method, which is proposed by Bristeau-GlowinskiP eriaux [BGP 98], for computing numerical solutions of the exterior {{problem for the}} Helmholtz equation. In the controllability method, we need to introduce an artificial boundary {{in order to reduce}} the computational domain to a bounded domain, and need to solve, in the bounded computational domain, the wave equation and an elliptic problem iteratively. We first introduce a new artificial boundary condition (ABC) for the wave equation, which is suitable for the controllability method. <b>Our</b> <b>ABC</b> is constructed by using the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator associated with the Helmholtz equation. We next discuss uniqueness for semi-discrete solution of the controllability method in the case when the artificial boundary is a circle.

Given an input sentence, we seek the optimal way {{to lay out}} word icons such that the resulting picture best conveys {{the meaning of the}} input sentence. To this end, we propose a family of intuitive “ABC ” layouts, which organize icons in three groups. We formalize layout optimization as a sequence labeling problem, employing conditional random fields as our machine learning method. Enabled by novel applications of semantic role labeling and syntactic parsing, our trained model makes layout predictions that agree well with human annotators. In addition, we conduct a user study to compare <b>our</b> <b>ABC</b> layout versus the standard linear layout. The study shows that our semantically enhanced layout is preferred by non-native speakers, suggesting {{it has the potential to}} be useful for people with other forms of limited literacy, too. ...|$|R

CHARM features a hardware structure called the accelerator block composer (ABC), which can dynamically compose a set of accelerator building blocks (ABBs) into a loosely coupled accelerator (LCA) to provide orders of magnitude improvement in performance and power efficiency. Our software infrastructure provides a data flow graph to describe the composition, and our hardware components dynamically map available resources to the data flow graph to compose the accelerator from components that may be physically distributed across the CMP. <b>Our</b> <b>ABC</b> is also capable of providing load balancing among available compute resources to increase accelerator utilization. Running medical imaging benchmarks, our experimental results show an average speedup of 2. 1 X (best case 3. 7 X) compared to approaches that use LCAs together with a hardware resource manager.

40|$|Determining {{the routes}} of {{introduction}} provides not only {{information about the}} history of an invasion process, but also information about the origin and construction of the genetic composition of the invading population. It remains difficult, however, to infer introduction routes from molecular data {{because of a lack of}} appropriate methods. We evaluate here the use of an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method for estimating the probabilities of introduction routes of invasive populations based on microsatellite data. We considered the crucial case of a single source population from which two invasive populations originated either serially from a single introduction event or from two independent introduction events. Using simulated datasets, we found that the method gave correct inferences and was robust to many erroneous beliefs. The method was also more efficient than traditional methods based on raw values of statistics such as assignment likelihood or pairwise F(ST).
