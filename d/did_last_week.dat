500|$|The {{game was}} the poorest {{performance}} of the season by the Longhorns, both offensively and defensively. On offense, Vince Young had only 162yards of offense, his lowest output of the season. The Associated Press remarked on the poor performance and said that Young, {{considered one of the}} nations best quarterbacks and a Heisman trophy candidate coming into the game, was [...] "not even the best quarterback on the field that day". The Daily Texan predicted that the game could hurt Young's chances for the Heisman, but they also quoted UT head coach Mack Brown as saying [...] "Looking at the numbers from what Reggie Bush <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> and Vince did today, Reggie probably leads, but next week, Vince plays at noon, and Reggie at 3, so I think voters will wait and watch to see what happens." ...|$|E

40|$|How does memory {{retrieval}} {{depend on}} time scale? One strong {{hypothesis is that}} such retrieval is scale-invariant (i. e., invariant across different time scales).

In line with scale invariance, retrieval performance was indistinguishable across time scales, for both retrospective and prospective memory. An additional finding was that significantly more prospective memories were recalled than retrospective memories, confirming previous observations of the "intention-superiority effect" (Goschke & Kuhl, 1993). ...|$|R

She tries her best to answer all the emails immediately. She states “If I don’t, I’m spending my time twice. Once when I see the email, and again when I reply to it later on. And then in between, it’s occupying mental space.” Every Monday morning her office starts with a “scrum meeting” which she says is like a “rugby huddle everyone in a circle.

Jon places a stuffed cow {{in the center of the}} huddle. Whoever the cow is facing goes first. The scrum lasts 10 to 15 minutes, tops and gives me a good overview of what everyone is working on.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to design and {{implement}} a prototype of the episodic memory for virtual humans. The memory is inspired by up to date research on function of human memory for personal events (episodes) and human time perception. We design a model of memory based on this theoretical knowledge. We took as the point of departure episodic memory system and decision making system of Peskova. The decision making system {{is based on the}} BDI, theory of affordances and AND-OR trees. The former episodic memory suffered deficiencies in the recall for time-cued questions. Thus proposed model is working with a unique subsystem for the time perception which allows for more realistic storage and recall of past events. The agent enhanced by this model can reply to questions like "What <b>did</b> you <b>do</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> afternoons?". The prototype is programmed in Java using the framework Pogamut 2. Pogamut 2 is connected to the complex continuous 3 D world of Unreal Tournament 2004 which allows us to verify the design in the challenging environment. We have conducted several experiments. The results show that the model extends agents cognitive abilities with a capability to understand socially established temporal patterns. That allows him to answer to the questions with a vaguely specified time information. Moreover, the memory [...] ...|$|R

On being drawn against Bayern Munich in the Champions League round of 16, he said, [...] "We will face a good team in Germany. They are top of their league and went through to the knockout stage in a phenomenal way. They only conceded seven goals {{in the first half}} of the season. But they have a little break now and can rest a bit. Maybe it's a good opportunity for us to face them in February because we will be in our rhythm. We will hopefully go through the Christmas period in a strong way. We can do that." [...] Mertesacker captained Arsenal for the first time in the FA Cup win over Brighton & Hove Albion in January, and appeared in every game save for the draw at Southampton on New Year's Day. [...] "We are always looking to win something and we can achieve something with this group," [...] he told Arsenal. [...] "We have a lively group so our thoughts are now on the next match. That's the most important thing for us, not what's going to happen in May. We have a few targets in our team that are possible this year. We won't talk about it, we'll just see what happens in the next few important weeks on the pitch." [...] Mertesacker started four games in February, missing only the FA Cup loss to Blackburn at the Emirates. [...] "It's always special to face a German team," [...] the defender said ahead of the Champions League tie against Bayern. [...] "and Lukas Podolski are looking forward to it because Bayern are a great team and are so consistent this year. It's a special game for German players to play against a team from their home country."Mertesacker was a mainstay in March, playing every single minute of Arsenal's four games. The centre back was on target in the defeat at Tottenham and was a key component in the defence that kept clean sheets against both Bayern Munich and Swansea City. [...] "It rained cats and dogs, especially in the second half," [...] he said after the win in south Wales, in Swansea. [...] "It was very slippery but it was a vital win." [...] In April, Mertesacker was shown a red card at West Bromwich Albion for the first game of the month. The defender returned to the team after suspension and was named man of the match against Fulham after scoring the only goal away at Craven Cottage. [...] "I think they've been terrific - not only defending very well but also creating goals for us at the other end like they <b>did</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> against Fulham," [...] said goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny on the partnership between Mertesacker and Koscielny.

5000|$|Writing in {{his diary}} two days after Noli's death, Albanian leader Enver Hoxha gave his {{analysis}} of Noli's work: As we are informed, Fan S. Noli died from an operation <b>done</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> in which, because of his age, he did not survive. A cerebral hemorrhage caused a quick death. Noli {{was one of the}} prominent political and literary figures of the beginning of this century. The balance sheet of his life was positive ... Fan Noli today enjoys a great popularity in our country, deserved as a literary translator and music critic. He was a prominent promoter of the Albanian language. His original works and translations, especially of Shakespeare, of Omar Khayyám and Blasco Ibáñez, are immortal. But especially his anti-Zogist, anti-feudal elegies and poems are beautiful jewels that have inspired and will inspire our youth, especially in creativity. He was also respected as a realistic politician, as a revolutionary democrat in ideology and politics. The Partyhas assessed the figure of Noli. As is deserved, we have had a patriotic duty to point out the really great merits of his in literature, the history of the arts, and his merits and weaknesses in politics. I think we will do our best in bringing his body to Albania, as this distinguished son of the people, the revolutionary patriot, deserves to bask in his homeland, which he loved and fought for his entire life.

40|$|In 'Physical Bar Charts', {{viewers are}} {{presented}} with tall see-through tubes containing button badges of five colours, each colour with a specific message on. Visitors are prompted to help themselves to badges {{in response to a}} question. As they do so, the levels in the tubes drop, presenting an inverse bar chart showing the popularity of the badges. Installed over some weeks in a public space or gallery, the Physical Bar Charts are an example of social data gathering, inventive research, real-time reporting, and experiential inquiry. At the version of 'Physical Bar Charts' in the exhibition 'Future Knowledge' at Modern Art Oxford in 2017, visitors were invited to respond to the question 'What actions <b>did</b> you <b>do</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> to contribute to a sustainable future?' The badges they could pick suggested diverse responses to this question. They read: "I helped someone; I did nothing; I consumed less; I invested in my place; I spoke up. " The 'Physical Bar Charts' offer a strikingly simple way of gathering and visualising data. And yet the statements on the badges, which refer to events in the past, once selected and worn on jackets make public commitments about everyday practices which are far from simple. The Physical Bar Charts materialise participation not just in data-gathering but also everyday life. 'Physical Bar Charts' has been shown over 10 times in UK and international galleries. The first version of the installation {{was the result of a}} collaboration between Lucy Kimbell and sociologist Andrew Barry, shown in 'Making Things Public' at ZKM Karlsruhe, 2005, curated by Bruno Latour and Peter Weibel...|$|R
