25|$|The OA1 mutants were {{classified}} into two major {{groups based on}} glycosylation and localization patterns.

5000|$|Dáin I ( [...] − 2589), {{the son of}} Náin II, was {{the last}} King of Durin's Folk united.

25|$|Once a 16:0 carbon {{fatty acid}} has been formed, it can undergo {{a number of}} modifications, {{resulting}} in desaturation and/or elongation. Elongation, starting with stearate (18:0), is performed mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> by several membrane-bound enzymes. The enzymatic steps involved in the elongation process are principally {{the same as those}} carried out by FAS, but the four principal successive steps of the elongation are performed by individual proteins, which may be physically associated.|$|E
25|$|Another {{key event}} {{that takes place}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> is N-linked glycosylation. In this process, polypeptides that have a unique stretch of 3 amino acids (asparagine - X - serine/threonine, where X {{represents}} any amino acid except proline) are modified with a complex sugar moiety on the amide group of asparagine. Other types of glycosylations include S-linked (via cysteine residues), C-linked (via tryptophan) and O-linked (via serine or threonine). By far, N-linked glycosylation is the most abundant post-translational modification found in eukaryotic cells.|$|E

50|$|In eukaryotes, most of {{the newly}} {{synthesized}} secretory proteins are transported from <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> to <b>the</b> Golgi apparatus.

25|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and {{the transport of}} synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several {{endoplasmic reticulum}} chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus – unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ER.</b> Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection or the over-expression of proteins can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading {{to an increase in}} unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.|$|E
25|$|SHH {{undergoes}} {{a series of}} processing steps before it is secreted from the cell. Newly synthesised SHH weighs 45kDa and {{is referred to as}} the preproprotein. As a secreted protein it contains a short signal sequence at its N-terminus, which is recognised by the signal recognition particle during the translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the first step in protein secretion. Once translocation is complete, the signal sequence is removed by signal peptidase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ER.</b> There SHH {{undergoes a}}utoprocessing to generate a 20kDa N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a 25kDa C-terminal domain with no known signaling role. The cleavage is catalysed by a protease within the C-terminal domain. During the reaction, a cholesterol molecule is added to the N-terminus of SHH-N. Thus the C-terminal domain acts as an intein and a cholesterol transferase. Another hydrophobic moiety, a palmitate, is added to the alpha-amine of N-terminal cysteine of SHH-N. This modification is required for efficient signaling, resulting in a 30-fold increase in potency over the non-palmitylated form, and is carried out by a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family, Protein-cysteine N-palmitoyltransferase, HHAT.|$|E
25|$|For ricin to {{function}} cytotoxically, RTA must be reductively cleaved from RTB {{in order to}} release a steric block of the RTA active site. This process is catalysed by the protein PDI (protein disulphide isomerase) that resides in the lumen of the ER. Free RTA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> lumen then partially unfolds and partially buries into the ER membrane, where it is thought to mimic a misfolded membrane-associated protein. Roles for the ER chaperones GRP94, EDEM and BiP have been proposed prior to the 'dislocation' of RTA from the ER lumen to the cytosol {{in a manner that}} utilizes components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. ERAD normally removes misfolded ER proteins to the cytosol for their destruction by cytosolic proteasomes. Dislocation of RTA requires ER membrane-integral E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, but RTA avoids the ubiquitination that usually occurs with ERAD substrates because of its low content of lysine residues, which are the usual attachment sites for ubiquitin. Thus, RTA avoids the usual fate of dislocated proteins (destruction that is mediated by targeting ubiquitinylated proteins to the cytosolic proteasomes). In the mammalian cell cytosol, RTA then undergoes triage by the cytosolic molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 and their co-chaperones, as well as by one subunit (RPT5) of the proteasome itself, that results in its folding to a catalytic conformation, which de-purinates ribosomes, thus halting protein synthesis.|$|E

40|$|Following synthesis, {{integral}} membrane proteins dwell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (<b>ER)</b> for variable periods that are typically rate limiting for plasma membrane delivery. <b>In</b> neurons, <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> extends {{for hundreds of}} microns as an anastomosing network throughout highly branched dendrites. However, {{little is known about}} the mobility, spatial scales, or dynamic regulation of cargo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dendritic <b>ER.</b> Here, we show that membrane proteins, including AMPA-type glutamate receptors, rapidly diffuse within the continuous network of dendritic ER but are confined by increased ER complexity at dendritic branch points and near dendritic spines. The spatial range of receptor mobility is rapidly restricted by type I mGluR signaling through a mechanism involving protein kinase C (PKC) and <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> protein CLIMP 63. Moreover, local zones of ER complexity compartmentalize ER export and correspond to sites of new dendritic branches. Thus, local control of ER complexity spatially scales secretory trafficking within elaborate dendritic arbors. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{surface of}} the rough {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (often abbreviated RER or Rough ER) (also called granular endoplasmic reticulum) is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a [...] "rough" [...] appearance (hence its name). The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon. However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. [...] This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway. The first 5–30 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> lumen by an enzyme (a signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{proteins}} have {{folded and}} {{are ready to}} be transported out of the ER {{it is thought that}} they assemble at specific site within the ER called [...] "ER exit sites". These sites can be transient but are most likely situated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ER</b> where the ER is close to the next transport compartment, the vesicular-tubular cluster (VTC) (also referred to as the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC)). The details of how proteins are concentrated or localized to the exit site is unclear (some aspects are emerging!) but the actual process of budding a vesicle containing these proteins start with a protein called Sec12. This protein recruits a small GTPase called Sar1 (think of Sar1 as a switch, it is active when bound to GTP and inactive when it hydrolyses the GTP to GDP). This in turn leads to the recruitment of a protein complex, the Sec23/Sec24 and the Sec13/Sec31 complex (also known as the COPII coat). In a nutshell what these proteins do is form a mesh at the ER exit site and the mesh through mechanical curvature forms a little [...] "blob" [...] that pinches off from the ER with proteins inside (think, playdough as the ER and your hand as the Sec complex pinching off little bits). The mesh disassembles off the budded vesicle when Sar1 hydrolyses the GTP to GDP. Interestingly, this activity of Sar1 is enhanced by Sec23/24.|$|E
2500|$|In most cells {{the smooth}} {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (abbreviated SER) is scarce. Instead there are {{areas where the}} ER is partly smooth and partly rough, this area is called the transitional ER. The transitional ER gets its name because it contains ER exit sites. These are areas where the transport vesicles that contain lipids and proteins made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ER,</b> detach from the ER and start moving to the Golgi apparatus. Specialized cells can {{have a lot of}} smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions. It synthesizes lipids, phospholipids, and steroids. Cells which secrete these products, such as those in the testes, ovaries, and sebaceous glands have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. It also carries out the metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of natural metabolism products and of alcohol and drugs, attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins, and steroid metabolism. In muscle cells, it regulates calcium ion concentration. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types (both animal and plant), and it serves different functions in each. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, a step in gluconeogenesis. It is connected to the nuclear envelope and [...] consists of tubules that are located near the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is reticular in appearance. In some cells, there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.|$|E
