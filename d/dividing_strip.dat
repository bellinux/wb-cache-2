Pouches designated to hold ammunition initially contained a <b>dividing</b> <b>strip</b> to hold two magazines in separate compartments and eliminate rattle. Some soldiers, especially infantry soldiers, often removed these dividing strips {{to make it easier}} to insert and remove magazines. They also found that three magazines would then fit comfortably and without excessive noise, giving a total capacity of twelve magazines per person in a standard fighting configuration. Later issue ammunition pouches were manufactured without dividers, as eight magazines was not thought to be sufficient for sustained firefights with the enemy. Without dividers, each pouch can now alternatively contain one grenade.|$|E

5000|$|Motorways are {{designed}} to carry heavy traffic at high speed with the lowest possible number of accidents. They {{are also designed to}} collect long-distance traffic from other roads, so that conflicts between long-distance traffic and local traffic are avoided. According to the common European definition, a motorway is defined as [...] "a road, specially designed and built for motor traffic, which does not serve properties bordering on it, and which: (a) is provided, except at special points or temporarily, with separate carriageways for the two directions of traffic, separated from each other, either by a <b>dividing</b> <b>strip</b> not intended for traffic, or exceptionally by other means; (b) does not cross at level with any road, railway or tramway track, or footpath; (c) is specially sign-posted as a motorway and is reserved for specific categories of road motor vehicles. Urban motorways are also included in this definition. However, the respective national definitions and the type of roads covered may present slight differences in different EU countries.|$|E

40|$|The current {{development}} of transport involves lots of pros, but also lots of cons includ-ing real risks. On one hand, {{there is a}} need to transport many people at reduced time and costs and on the other hand there is a risk of incidents. New and modern motorways and I. class roads plus using most updated means of transportation allow us transport more people more quickly, in even more convenient and safe way. Car accidents interventions are considered as routine procedures of the integrated rescue system in domestically as well as worldwide and their coordination is not a big deal for emergency teams. However, complications may occur when performing the intervention on the road with more lanes and with a center <b>dividing</b> <b>strip</b> as well as when there is a higher number of injured or a greater area of intervention, such as in the case of a chain accident. Sections of the integrated rescue systems are trained to handle such extraordinary events and follow new methodology, which is step by step put into practice. Within the process of its application, a major role plays the synergy trainings of the integrated rescue sys-tem, which require the approach to the actual conditions simulation. This thesis was produced to serve the needs of the intervention commander and pro-vides a comprehensive view on the issue of managing interventions where a higher number of casualties and injured occurs and related rescue systems on motorways and I. class roads. The thesis also brings information on new trends in training rescue teams for this type of events.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the condition of the}} Picea pungens Engelm. plants at various distances from urban highways with high traffic intensity. The objects of the study were the trees P. pungens, whose age was about 35 years. The plants grow on four plots. The control plot is located in the conditionally clean zone; the plot 1 – 120 m from the road, plot 2 – at a distance of 10 m and plot 3 – on the median <b>dividing</b> <b>strip</b> of the road. It is established that in plants growing at a distance of 120 m from the highway and in the control plot, {{there was no difference in}} the parameters of the annual growth of shoots. In plants growing at a distance of 10 m from the road, a decrease in the length and mass of the shoot was determined. In the immediate vicinity of the highrway (on the median strip of the road), the growth rates of shoots decreased most significantly. A similar pattern was observed in the effect of distance from the road on the number of needles per unit length of shoot. The highest amount of chlorophyll a in the needles of spruce, regardless of the variant, was found in May, later it decreased in the summer months, and then increased slightly in September in all variants of the experiment. A similar pattern is also characteristic of changes in the chlorophyll content. The concentration of chlorophyll a in the needles of trees growing at a distance of 120 m from the highway, almost did not differ from plants in the clean zone. At a distance of 10 m its content was less, and for plants growing on the median strip of the highway, the amount of this form of green pigment decreased by 35 % of the reference values. The content of chlorophyll b, like a, is not statistically different in the needles of the trees in the control plot and in plot  1. In plants of plots 2 and 3 its concentration decreased with respect to control. The sum of the green pigments a + b was the same in the needles of the control plot plants and those 120 m from the road. In the experimental plots 2 and 3 the amount of chlorophyll a + b in the needles of the P. pungens was smaller than in the control and in plot 1. Depending on the sampling month, the difference with the control ranged from 14. 7 % to 21. 0 %. The content of carotenoids in the needles was spiny, low in plants at a distance of 120 m from the road, and the highest in specimens that growing in the immediate vicinity of the road...|$|E
