500|$|With the {{financial}} backing of several Jewish investors, {{including one of}} the owners, Abraham Bankier, Schindler signed an <b>informal</b> <b>lease</b> agreement on the factory on 13 November 1939 and formalised the arrangement on 15 January 1940. He renamed it Deutsche Emaillewaren-Fabrik (German Enamelware Factory) or DEF, and it soon became known by the nickname [...] "Emalia". He initially acquired a staff of seven Jewish workers (including Abraham Bankier, who helped him manage the company) and 250 non-Jewish Poles. At its peak in 1944, the business employed around 1,750 workers, a thousand of whom were Jews. Schindler also helped run Schlomo Wiener Ltd, a wholesale outfit that sold his enamelware, and was leaseholder of Prokosziner Glashütte, a glass factory.|$|E
50|$|Wadsworth and {{his wife}} Jessie, had {{acquired}} land adjacent to the Signal Station in 1952. Following {{the closure of the}} Signal Station, the Wadsworths sought to acquire the use of part of the signal station building, and were granted an <b>Informal</b> <b>Lease</b> over the former Signal Station site in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Each of {{the four}} CFR {{divisions}} have their own locomotives, and these are generally not interchanged. For example, a CFR Marfǎ locomotive {{should not be used}} to pull a CFR Cǎlǎtori train. In practice however, this rule does not hold, and frequently the companies use other rolling stock through <b>informal</b> <b>lease</b> agreements. Moreover, private companies' rolling stock is used at times, usually because of emergencies (such as a locomotive breaking down and requiring a replacement to keep the line open, and an unused private locomotive being closer).|$|E
40|$|This article studies how {{rent-seeking}} behavior induces an <b>informal</b> <b>leasing</b> {{market for}} fishing licenses that leads harvesters {{in a common}} pool to circumvent rules set by themanager to conserve the resource, {{as well as how}} the vulnerability of the resource to such behavior depends on themanagement approach adopted. License leasing reduces fleet heterogeneity in terms of catch per unit effort as demonstrated by the outward shift in the stochastic production frontier. While aggregate harvest is invariant to alternative profiles of fleet heterogeneity in quota-managed fisheries, the productivity of the restricted variable–total effort–increases with the number of leasing contracts in input-controlled fisheries. If unanticipated by the regulator, the additional pressure on the resource may lead to overfishing and compromise the long-term viability of the industry...|$|R

They've made a verbal rental agreement. Many agricultural leases are formed thIs way. Unfortunately, <b>informal</b> verbal <b>leases</b> do not cover the problems and possible conflicts that may arise under leases.

5000|$|The lease {{will either}} provide {{specific}} provisions regarding the responsibilities and {{rights of the}} lessee and lessor, or there will be automatic provisions {{as a result of}} local law. In general, by paying the negotiated fee to the lessor, the lessee (also called a tenant) has possession and use (the rental) of the leased property to the exclusion of the lessor and all others except with the invitation of the tenant. The most common form of real property lease is a residential rental agreement between landlord and tenant. As the relationship between the tenant and the landlord is called a tenancy, this term generally is also used for <b>informal</b> and shorter <b>leases.</b> The right to possession by the tenant is sometimes called a leasehold interest. A lease can be for a fixed period of time (called the term of the lease). A lease may be terminated sooner than its end date by: ...|$|R
50|$|Recognising {{the need}} for a formal meeting place for unionists, the Bundaberg Eight Hour Day {{committee}} approached the Lands Department in July 1919 for a site for a Trades Hall. At the time, union meetings were held outdoors on the corner opposite the School of Arts. An <b>informal</b> <b>lease</b> (No. 453) was drawn up by the Lands Department to the union trustees, for the northern half of the allotment on the western corner of Quay and Maryborough Streets, allowing a building to be erected on the site. In March 1922 the Eight Hour Day Anniversary Committee was granted a three-year lease on the property.|$|E
5000|$|White's Island {{currently}} {{belongs to}} the Bermuda Government, assigned to its Department of Youth, Sport and Recreation, which has permitted its use for many years by youth charities. The Bermuda Sailing Association (BSA) had an <b>informal</b> <b>lease,</b> which it lost on September 28, 2010, when a minister of the Progressive Labour Party government granted a 21-year lease to a new charity, CARTEL (Challenging and Reclaiming the True Essence of Life), for use in its youth rehabilitation programme. The government of Bermuda closed the Training School, its last facility for juvenile delinquents (a youth prison that had been located on Paget Island, Bermuda, in St. George's Harbour), two decades before. [...] Leases of government land for twenty-one years or longer require parliamentary approval. The PLP government avoided this by granting a lease for one day short of twenty-one years. The BSA was forced to relocate its youth sailing programme to Darrell's Island. The Bermuda Amateur Swimming Association (BASA), which had also long had free use of White's Island for its own youth programme, was advised {{it would have to}} pay CARTEL $10 per child per week for its continued use of the island. The Bermuda Rowing Association was permitted to continue its use of the island for its youth programme at no charge. The granting of a lease to CARTEL, which is controlled by PLP party officers, is tied to wider accusations of the misappropriation of government revenues and assets by the PLP, which was defeated in the parliamentary election of 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Schindler {{first arrived}} in Kraków in October 1939 on Abwehr {{business}} and took an apartment the following month. Emilie maintained the apartment in Ostrava and visited Oskar in Kraków {{at least once a}} week. In November 1939, he contacted interior decorator Mila Pfefferberg to decorate his new apartment. Her son, Leopold [...] "Poldek" [...] Pfefferberg, soon became one of his contacts for black market trading. They eventually became lifelong friends. Also that November, Schindler was introduced to Itzhak Stern, an accountant for Schindler's fellow Abwehr agent Josef [...] "Sepp" [...] Aue, who had taken over Stern's formerly Jewish-owned place of employment as a Treuhander (trustee). Property belonging to Polish Jews, including their possessions, places of business, and homes were seized by the Germans beginning immediately after the invasion, and Jewish citizens were stripped of their civil rights. Schindler showed Stern the balance sheet of a company he was thinking of acquiring, an enamelware factory called Rekord Ltd owned by a consortium of Jewish businessmen that had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year. Stern advised him that rather than running the company as a trusteeship {{under the auspices of the}} Haupttreuhandstelle Ost (Main Trustee Office for the East), he should buy or lease the business, as that would give him more freedom from the dictates of the Nazis, including the freedom to hire more Jews. With the financial backing of several Jewish investors, including one of the owners, Abraham Bankier, Schindler signed an <b>informal</b> <b>lease</b> agreement on the factory on 13 November 1939 and formalised the arrangement on 15 January 1940. He renamed it Deutsche Emaillewaren-Fabrik (German Enamelware Factory) or DEF, and it soon became known by the nickname [...] "Emalia".

5000|$|From about 1859, {{the quarry}} {{appears to have}} been worked by a group of men under an <b>informal</b> arrangement. They <b>leased</b> a wharf at Porthmadog harbour in 1860, until the Cwmorthin Slate Company was formed in January 1861. This had an {{authorised}} capital of £100,000, and the company bought the Cwmorthin Isaf estate and part of Tanygrisiau village on 25 July 1861. Work began on underground mining. At some point, the [...] Cwmorthin Tramway was constructed to connect the quarry with the nearby Ffestiniog Railway at Tanygrisiau. Isherwood states that it was soon after the new company took over in 1861 but Boyd suggests that a survey was carried out in the mid-1840s, and that it was completed in 1850. It was mentioned in the 1850 edition of Cliffe's The Book of North Wales, and the Ffestiniog Railway accounts recorded the first passage of loaded slate wagons down the line in that year. An existing siding at Tanygrisiau, which had served horse-drawn wagons from the quarry, was removed shortly afterwards.|$|R
