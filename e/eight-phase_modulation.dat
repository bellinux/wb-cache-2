As measured by the bit rate per unit bandwidth achieved at a given received E(b) /N(o), quadriphase outperforms biphase, but by less than a factor two, in contrast to behavior in a linear channel. Eight phase modulation appears to offer only a marginal improvement over quadriphase, and only for E(b) /N(o) > 15 db...|$|E
