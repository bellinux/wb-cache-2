50|$|The museum {{dates to}} 1905 when the Musée des Arts Décoratifs started {{collecting}} outstanding examples of silks, <b>embroidery,</b> printed <b>cotton,</b> costumes, lace, and tapestry. In 1948, another collection of fashion and textiles was begun by the Union Française des Arts du Costume on an initiative by costume historian François Boucher.

50|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, wearing of {{traditional}} smock-frocks by country laborers was dying out, although Gertrude Jekyll noticed them in Sussex during her youth, and smocks were still worn {{by some people}} in rural Buckinghamshire into the 1920s. As the authentic tradition was fading away, a romantic nostalgia for England's rural past, as epitomized by the illustrations of Kate Greenaway, led to a fashion for women's and children's dresses and blouses loosely styled after smock-frocks. These garments are generally of very fine linen or cotton and feature delicate smocking <b>embroidery</b> done in <b>cotton</b> floss in contrasting colors; smocked garments with pastel-colored embroidery remain popular for babies.|$|R
50|$|A woman's thob (loose fitting robe with sleeves), from Kafr Ana, {{from the}} 1930s, {{is in the}} Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) {{collection}} at Santa Fe, United States. The dress is of white commercial <b>cotton</b> and the <b>embroidery</b> is multicolored <b>cotton,</b> mainly in red and blue. The qabbeh (the square chest panel) is not a separate panel, but instead executed directly on the dress. The embroidery on the skirt and sleeves is also done directly on the dress. There is some machine embroidery, but most is by hand. The dress has an uncommon round neckline, which was an innovation and was only used here and {{in the village of}} Salama, near Jaffa.|$|R
50|$|Kaitag {{textiles}} are {{an unusual}} embroidered textile art form from the Kaitag district of southwest Daghestan, Russia, inhabited mainly by Dargins and Kumyks. Kaitag textiles are of simple construction, being laid and couched silk-floss <b>embroidery</b> on a <b>cotton</b> ground. The designs {{are often in}} the style of classical Safavid Persian art, sometimes illustrating horsemen and hunting scenes. Abstract Kaitag designs have been compared to those of Matisse and Paul Klee, though it is unlikely that either artist ever saw a Kaitag textile. Surviving examples are mostly from the 17th and 18th centuries. These embroideries were apparently made for local use in weddings, funerals, and for cradle trappings.The traditional Kaitag art of embroidery was reportedly stamped out under Soviet rule.|$|R
5000|$|Coal mining {{was added}} in 1912, after a major strike. In 1913, five {{additional}} wage boards {{were set up}} that covered hollow ware making, shirt making, sugar confectionery and food preserving, tin box making, and linen and <b>cotton</b> <b>embroidery,</b> along with {{a portion of the}} laundry industry. These extensions led to an additional 140,000 being covered by minimum wage legislation. Unions pushed for the 1918 Act to greatly extend the coverage of minimum wages [...] In 1917, Whitley councils or Joint Industrial Councils were established in 41 industries with over 2 million employees to bring together unions and management to discuss not only wages and conditions but also a wide range of related issues such as jobs, security, benefits and technical education.|$|R
5000|$|Shaphee Lamphee {{embroidery}} is {{done over}} a black coloured cloth with red border. The motifs embroidered on the fabric consists of several designs, {{and some of}} the common designs adopted are: of animals such as [...] "shamu" [...] (elephant), [...] "shagol" [...] (horse), [...] "iroichi" [...] (buffalo horn), [...] "wahong" [...] (peacock), and [...] "Nga" [...] (fish); planets such as [...] "numit" [...] (sun), tha (moon); Thawanmichak (star) and also phantup (magical seat, ta (spear) [...] - [...] these designs are done in a set pattern and sequence of operation. The embroidery is done by hand using needle and yarns of cotton. It has a width of 110-132 cm and length of 225-230 cm and generally weighs 1854 grams. The yarn used are 2/20S cotton and 2/34S acrylic with wrap made with 2/20S cotton and weft woven from 2/20S cotton. The yarn used in <b>embroidery</b> is 2/20S <b>cotton,</b> mercerized and 2/40S.|$|R
40|$|A {{frequent}} problem {{within the}} textile conservation field {{is the need}} to wash artefacts which are not made for washing. This thesis identifies the problems often encountered during wet cleaning in regard to dyes and colours with poor wash-fastness. A literature study pinpoints which dyes and dyeing techniques frequently yields poor wash-fastness results and looks at some possible techniques used currently and in the past to solve the problem. The properties and history of cyklododecane is presented, and its possible use in textile conservation in a melted state as a single isolating agent is explored, as well as in combination with Paraloid B 72 in the dual-layer technique designed by Salvador Muñoz- Viñas for paper conservation. The workings of ultra clean water is explained. Different dye techniques were used to produce yarn with intentional poor wash-fastness; reactive dye, water soluble ink, saffron and vat dye. Samples were prepared, <b>embroidery</b> on <b>cotton,</b> and then subjected to different treatments: a) water (control), b) water + detergent (Berol 784) (control), c) cyclododecane + water + detergent, d) cyclododecane + paraloid b 72 + water + detergent and e) ultra clean water, with one set of samples left untreated. Blotting papers were used to control the bleeding. The results were analysed in a microscope, and documented via photography. The outcomes were compared to one another and the results considered. No method worked to produce a 100 % satisfactory result, but the best of them were the dual layer technique with several layers of both CDD and PB 72, which yielded none to minimal bleeding. The ultra clean water gave interesting results which need to be explored further, as well as its possible use in future conservation measures.

These extensions led to an additional 140,000 being covered by minimum wage legislation. The Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act 1913 empowered local authorities to formulate tuberculosis schemes, while a Trade Union passed that same year clarified the legal position of trade unions while also restoring their political power, together with the financial position of the Labour Party. In 1914, Local Authorities received grants from the government to provide maternal and child welfare services. while the Criminal Justice Administration Act passed that same year compelled magistrates to allow for sufficient time to be made for paying fines. As noted by the historian C. P. Hill, this legislation was both merciful and economical, as it helped to reduce the prison population. The budget of 1914 brought greater progressivity into the taxation system by increasing levels of direct taxation on the wealthy while also investing more money in social services. The educational grant was increased, with money allocated towards the training of specialist teachers, schools for the deformed, grants for open-air schools for victims of tuberculosis, and further state provision for school-meal services. In addition, new provisions for maternity centres, sanitoria, and ancillary health services under the 1911 insurance bill were introduced, together with £4million in loans for local authority house-building.|$|R

Language: another system within the vessel, and of which I demand much and have no control over. Detachment: the experience of having no control over the body or language.

40|$|I Think I Saw Your Shadow Once..., made of <b>embroidery</b> floss on <b>cotton,</b> {{measures}} 15 {{inches by}} 22 inches. The {{full text of}} the poem reads: i think i saw your shadow once in the grass up on a hill, but when i stepped towards you. God you left; was it your will that i should stand out there alone and ask if it was you? {{you said you would}} not speak to all my God can this be true? if i had not but moved an inch would you have stayed with me? i think forever of those steps as i could nearly see. i almost had a friend in you, what was it i did wrong? what could i have done differently to be with you ever long? i tried to send some words to you but i don 2 ̆ 7 t know your address i 2 ̆ 7 ll set them down right here instead And hope you 2 ̆ 7 ll read the rest. it 2 ̆ 7 s just that i don 2 ̆ 7 t know what to say that could bring me any peace, for i am cut to ribbons by Regret 2 ̆ 7 s serrated teeth. Artist 2 ̆ 7 s StatementDear Reader, I’ve heard it said that speech connects the mind and body. I speak seldom. Perhaps this separation explains why my words don’t work. Hemingway might be right that words exist in the blood ant that writing is but bleeding on to the page because I have small veins and low blood pressure and when the doctor finally finds a vein, my blood crawls out; I write at a similar speed and with as much ease. But were Hemingway’s theory of language true, surely I would feel words stirring, instead they fizzle out before I can grab hold – I lose them before they are mine to lose. Then I think that they could live externally, maybe floating in the air, and like a whale I wander with my mouth agape hoping some verbal plankton will get caught in my baleen. So out of frustration and with a touch of good-natured spite I invert my letters, make them impotent. I know of no better way to show them how it feels to have something to say and fail to say it. You may say, “As these are your words you only stifle your own expression. ” To which I respond: The evidence that I am the origin of my language has proven inconclusive (see paragraph 1). Supposing I don’t snatch them from the atmosphere, I couldn’t rightly arrange them so they didn’t further my expression in the first place. Tangled and tumbled, the letters mirror how I feel they change on the path from brainstem to fingertips. Should they object to my treatment, I would argue that I am doing them a service. Once unable to convey their message, we can appreciate them for the splendid series of lines they are. And they needn’t worry about seeming hollow scratchings, for their meaning doesn’t disappear with readability, only becomes obscured. With their form foregrounded they acquire an air of mystery. If, in the future, my relationship to words changes and one of us becomes more pliable to the other’s will, I may be able to place them upright. Until that time, I am more precise when illegible.
