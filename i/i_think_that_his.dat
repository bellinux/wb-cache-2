2500|$|You can't {{categorize}} him. He's one {{of those}} singers that's not in one track. And yet and still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> records had more excitement and life into it. And I think that was his big selling point, {{that he was so}} full of energy. You know when you hear his records it was dynamite energy. — Herb Jeffries ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{production}} by Wilson, the Beach Boys covered Bacharach's [...] "My Little Red Book" [...] and [...] "Walk On By" [...] in 1967 and 1968 but left the recordings unreleased. Wilson {{has said that}} Bacharach was a direct influence on his [...] "She Knows Me Too Well", [...] "Let's Go Away for Awhile", and [...] "Love and Mercy". Writers have variously attributed Bacharach influence on Wilson's [...] "Guess I'm Dumb", [...] "Let Him Run Wild, and [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew". Discussing [...] "Let's Go Away", Wilson said: [...] "there {{were a lot of}} chord changes similar to the way he would put something together. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> music had such a profound thing on my head; he got me going in a direction." [...] He mentions [...] "minor seventh chords" [...] as a specific point of influence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] he gasped. [...] "Impossible. She {{who never}} dies--dead, {{how can it}} be?" [...] and then, perceiving, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> face was being watched by the mutes who had come running up, he checked himself, and motioned to them to carry us to the camp, which they did.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{defiance}} in Paul's answer. His manner {{was quite}} subdued. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> both <b>his</b> words and his tone surprised me.|$|R
6000|$|... "EL ADREA {{has been}} here. From the signs, though, <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> prey escaped him. With a little start {{they would be}} safe enough from him in the open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless it was Mr. Urbain. You say he {{was walking}} up and down, outside the room. Perhaps he looked through the keyhole. But no; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> with <b>his</b> mother he would take it on trust." ...|$|R
60|$|I am not {{disposed}} {{to say that}} Thackeray will hold a high place among English poets. He {{would have been the}} first to ridicule such an assumption made on his behalf. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> verses will be more popular than those of many highly reputed poets, and that as years roll on they will gain rather than lose in public estimation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nicolaes, father dear," [...] {{she broke}} in quietly, [...] "is very dear to us both. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{momentary}} weakness will endear him to us even more. But {{he was a}} tool {{in the hands of}} that unscrupulous Stoutenburg--and but for that nameless and penniless soldier whose hand you were proud to grasp just now, I would not be here in your arms at this moment." ...|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. Truly, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> master {{served him}} right; for, in doing as he did, he showed him plainly, as he said, {{that he had}} not so much {{government}} of himself as his horse had of himself; and, consequently, that his beast did live more according to the law of his nature by far than did his man. But, pray, go on with what you have further to say.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then you and I {{will wear}} the shields {{when we come}} near the place where Procrustes meets {{travellers}} by the way, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> to-night <b>his</b> own bed will be too long for him,' said Theseus.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the verses}} Hine added was the current third verse:And when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God, <b>His</b> Son not sparing, Sent Him to die, I scarce {{can take it}} in; That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was always}} looking for a gag — {{sometimes}} {{to the point where the}} gags involving Richard Pryor went over the top. I mean, <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> going off the top of a building, on skis with a pink tablecloth around his shoulders, was particularly funny.|$|R
60|$|Atten. Truly <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Master {{served him}} right; for in doing as he did, he shewed him plainly, as he said, {{that he had}} not so much {{government}} of himself as his horse had of himself, and consequently that his beast did live more according to the Law of his nature by far, than did his man. But pray go on with what you have further to say.|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} words came. I can hardly {{say that they}} were the product of any fixed resolve made before he {{commenced}} the writing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> mind worked more fully when the pen was in his hands than it had done during the hour through which he sat listless, doing nothing, struggling to have a will of his own, but failing. The letter when it was written was as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not, sir; {{although}} I {{have not}} as yet sounded him. Cacama {{has been very}} badly treated by Montezuma, and he by no means approves of the emperor's conduct throughout this matter, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> patriotism would overcome his sense of private wrong. I can tell you more farther on. Cacama has invited me to stay with him, for the present, and I think I might be of more use to you there than here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything,--to him. My {{idea is to}} tell {{everything}} to him, and to leave it to him to decide what should be done. Should he refuse to repeat the story any further, and then bid us go away from Bowick, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> conduct had been altogether straightforward and not uncharitable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} how I felt about it just now," [...] Helen {{reminded}} her. [...] "Your going is like a great black cloud that I have seen growing larger and larger, day by day. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>his</b> way, Dick will suffer {{just as much as}} Henry. We shall all be utterly miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The candle {{would be}} short that I should burn with Swart Piet," [...] {{answered}} Suzanne, stamping her foot; [...] "he is an evil man, full of dark words and ways, and I fear him, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> since <b>his</b> father's death {{he has become}} worse, and {{the most of the}} company he keeps is with those Kaffir witch-doctors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose all Parliament {{people make}} asses of {{themselves}} sometimes, Lords {{as well as}} Commons. I don't see how a man is to go on talking for ever about laws and landleagues, and those sort of things without doing so. It is all bosh to me. And so I should think it must be to you, as you don't do it. But I {{do not think that}} father is worse than anybody else; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> words are sometimes very beautiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{think this}} will happen to you, Bangu,' he said. 'If you spare this boy he will grow into a man who will kill you and many others one day. But {{if you do not}} spare him <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> spirit, working as spirits can do, will kill you to-morrow. Therefore the {{question}} is, will you live a while or will you die at once, taking me with you as your companion? For you must not leave me behind, brother Bangu.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{never really}} {{determined}} whether my uncle regarded Tono-Bungay as a fraud, {{or whether he}} didn't come to believe in it {{in a kind of}} way by the mere reiteration of his own assertions. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> average attitude was one of kindly, almost parental, toleration. I remember saying on one occasion, [...] "But you don't suppose this stuff ever did a human being the slightest good all?" [...] and how his face assumed a look of protest, as of one reproving harshness and dogmatism.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was annoyed, but I couldn't {{see that}} he had lost <b>his</b> appetite. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even <b>his</b> worriment is the first thing to be considered, though." ...|$|R
60|$|It was Raja--the jalok {{whose life}} I had saved, and whom I then had tamed! There {{was no doubt}} that he was glad to see me. <b>I</b> now <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> seeming {{desertion}} of me had been but due to a desire to search out his ferocious mate and bring her, too, to live with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whether {{we accept}} the miraculous {{explanation}} of Christ's birth," [...] continued Mr. Simson, in his best street-corner voice, [...] "or whether, with the great French writer whose name for the moment escapes me, we regard Him merely as a man inspired, we must, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> admit <b>that</b> <b>His</b> teaching has been of help: especially to the poor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Mr. Hawtrey,--I enclose Hampton's letter, which {{speaks for}} itself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{conjecture}} {{as to the}} author of the attempt on his life is likely to be correct, and much as I should be glad to hear that your daughter was finally and satisfactorily cleared from these charges, I cannot but regret that Hampton should have undertaken so dangerous a business as that upon which he has embarked. I think it better to send you his letter, especially as we are not likely to hear again from him for a long time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was," [...] {{returned}} the chief, {{with a faint}} smile, [...] "and from that day I hated him and resolved to kill him, till I {{met him at the}} Hot Swamp, where I got this fatal wound. He nursed me there, and did his best to save my life, but it was not to be. Yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> tenderness, as well as your sweet voice, {{had something to do with}} turning my angry spirit round. I would see my mother now. The world is darkening, and the time is getting short." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anah. [...] I {{should have}} loved [...] Azaziel not less were he mortal; yet [...] I am glad he is not. I cannot outlive him. [...] 20 [...] And when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> immortal wings [...] Will one day hover o'er the sepulchre [...] Of the poor child of clay[139] which so adored him, [...] As he adores the Highest, death becomes [...] Less terrible; but yet I pity him: [...] His grief {{will be of}} ages, or at least [...] Mine would be such for him, were I the Seraph, [...] And he the perishable.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{well aware}} that he didn't do it himself," [...] {{continued}} Mr Optimist; [...] "but <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>his</b> position, he should have kept himself out of any such encounter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, smiling, [...] "it isn't that I fancy myself {{any better}} than my fellows. I was at Magdalen, you know, under Heysey. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it was <b>his</b> {{influence}} which shaped our ideas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never had we more need of trust, husband, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God turns <b>His</b> {{face from}} {{us because of}} the lies we told to the Englishmen, for now the {{punishment}} which you foresaw has fallen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I doubt it," [...] he said. [...] "Gentlemen {{have run}} away with young ladies before, and {{generally}} have behaved very badly when they have done so. He behaved very badly indeed, because {{he had come to}} my house, with my sanction, with the express purpose of expressing his affection for another young lady. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> folly in this special running away was worse even than his conduct. How did he come to think that he could get himself married merely by crossing over the sea to Ostend? I should be utterly ashamed of him as a son-in-law,--chiefly because he has shown himself to be an idiot." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{developing}} {{his views}} upon this subject, Professor Haeckel introduces qualifications which disarm {{some of the}} criticisms I should have been disposed to offer; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> method of stating the case has the inconvenience of tending to leave out of sight the important fact--which is a cardinal point in the Darwinian hypothesis--that the tendency to vary, in a given organism, may {{have nothing to do}} with the external conditions to which that individual organism is exposed, but may depend wholly upon internal conditions. No one, I imagine, would dream of seeking for the cause of the development of the sixth finger and toe in the famous Maltese, in the direct influence of the external conditions of his life.|$|E
60|$|His rich income ceased {{when the}} State {{government}} came into power. He was without an occupation. Something {{had to be}} done. He put up his sign as attorney-at-law, but he got no clients. It was strange. It was difficult to account for. I cannot account for it--but if I were going to guess at a solution I should guess that by the make of him he would examine {{both sides of a}} case so diligently and so conscientiously that when he got through with his argument neither he nor a jury would know which side he was on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> client would find out his make in laying his case before him, and would take warning and withdraw it in time to save himself from probable disaster.|$|E
60|$|I incline to {{hold that}} Satchells was {{occasionally}} reminiscent of a ballad for the reasons and traces given, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Scott when <b>his</b> and Satchells' versions coincide, did not borrow direct from Satchells, but that both men had a ballad source.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take comfort, Vrouw van Goorl," [...] he said presently, [...] "your son is not dead, for {{his heart}} beats, nor has his friend Martin injured {{him in any}} way by the {{exercise}} of <b>his</b> strength, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> fury he has burst a blood-vessel, for he bleeds fast. My counsel is {{that he should be}} put to bed and his head cooled with cold water till the surgeon can be fetched to treat him. Lift him in your arms, Martin." ...|$|R
60|$|Not once yet had we sighted land, {{nor could}} I {{understand}} it, {{since so many}} of the seas I had seen before were thickly dotted with islands. Our plight was anything but pleasant, yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Hooja and <b>his</b> forces were even worse off than we, for they had no food nor water at all.|$|R
