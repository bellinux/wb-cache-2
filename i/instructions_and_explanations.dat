60|$|We {{rejoice in}} the ardent, pure and confiding affection {{of these two}} angelic beings: but our feeling is changed and made more poignant, when {{we think that the}} inexorable hand of Destiny is already lifted to smite their world with {{blackness}} and desolation. Thekla has enjoyed 'two little hours of heavenly beauty;' but her native gaiety gives place to serious anticipations and alarms; she feels that the camp of Wallenstein is not a place for hope to dwell in. The <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations</b> of her aunt disclose the secret: she is not to love Max; a higher, it may be a royal, fate awaits her; but she is to tempt him from his duty, and make him lend his influence to her father, whose daring projects she {{now for the first time}} discovers. From that moment her hopes of happiness have vanished, never more to return. Yet her own sorrows touch her less than the ruin which she sees about to overwhelm her tender and affectionate mother. For herself, she waits with gloomy patience the stroke that is to crush her. She is meek, and soft, and maiden-like; but she is Friedland's daughter, and does not shrink from what is unavoidable. There is often a rectitude, and quick inflexibility of resolution about Thekla, which contrasts beautifully with her inexperience and timorous acuteness of feeling: on discovering her father's treason, she herself decides that Max 'shall obey his first impulse,' and forsake her.|$|E

50|$|While the {{education}} of civilian populations was an admirable and necessary aim of the Union forces, a more pressing need was the instruction of former slaves who actually enlisted. Almost immediately, officers recognized the problems that resulted from illiteracy: verbal <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations</b> cost valuable time, and despite the courage of these new troops, advancement without some degree of education was impossible, and {{this led to a}} loss of morale. Numerous regiments, including the 33rd, 55th, 67th, 73rd, 76th, 78th, 83rd, 88th, 89th, and the 128th received instruction from chaplains and Northern teachers. Not only was this training designed to improve the soldiers’ wartime efficacy, but by learning trades like bricklaying and carpentry, they felt more secure about their long-term stability.|$|E

50|$|The Cynic epistles {{deal with}} ethical matters rather than {{religious}} ones: their purpose {{is not to}} seek the divine, but rather to seek the ethically pure life by breaking away from social norms and conventions via ascetic practices. The content of the epistles are not especially original, but probably served {{as a means to}} propagate Cynic ideology. The letters discuss different aspects of the Cynic way of life, as part of a rigorous training (askesis). Thus <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations</b> are given on whom (and whom not) to emulate and how different aspects of wisdom are acquired and demonstrated, mixed in with polemics directed against people who oppose these ideals. The moral anecdotes contained in the epistles are probably examples of those used by Cynic street preachers of the time. As with much Cynic thought in the time of the Roman empire, the content of the epistles show influences from Stoicism and other philosophies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} we propose a {{decision-making}} system that efficiently learns {{behaviors in the}} form of rules using natural human instructions about cause-effect relations in currently observed situations, avoiding complicated <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations</b> of long-run action sequences and complete world dynamics. The learned rules are represented in a way suitable to both reactive and deliberative approaches, which are thus smoothly integrated. Simple and repetitive tasks are resolved reactively, while complex tasks would be faced in a more deliberative manner using a planner module. Human interaction is only required if the system fails to obtain the expected results when applying a rule, or fails to resolve the task with the knowledge acquired so far. I I...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{modeling}} {{has become}} a widely used tool for unraveling the mechanisms of higher level cooperative cell behavior during vascular morphogenesis. However, experimenting with published simulation models or adding new assumptions to those models can be daunting for novice and even for experienced computational scientists. Here, we present a step-by-step, practical tutorial for building cell-based simulations of vascular morphogenesis using the Tissue Simulation Toolkit (TST). The TST is a freely available, open-source C++ library for developing simulations with the two-dimensional cellular Potts model, a stochastic, agent-based framework to simulate collective cell behavior. We will show the basic use of the TST to simulate and experiment with published simulations of vascular network formation. Then, we will present step-by-step <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations</b> for building a recent simulation model of tumor angiogenesis. Demonstrated mechanisms include cell-cell adhesion, chemotaxis, cell elongation, haptotaxis, and haptokinesis...|$|E

40|$|The present {{case study}} {{discusses}} some difficulties in applying survey methodology to {{the observation of}} elections by international observers. In election missions data collected through observation forms should justify general statements on the freedom and {{the fairness of the}} election observed. The paper focuses on observations of the voting during visits to polling stations and the observation forms used to collect the information gained in these visits. Important differences between election observation surveys and regular self-administered surveys are, to varying degrees, lack of control over (a) sampling, (b) what is to be observed and reported, and (c) data processing and analysis due to time pressure and logistic circumstances. It is shown what progress has been made on points (b) and (c) between the 1995 Russian State Duma Elections and the 1996 Russian Presidential Elections. The whole statistical process was reviewed, various experts were consulted, and redesigned forms were tested. The resulting new forms in general conformed to the Jenkins and Dillman (1997) principles referring to (o) form content, (1) <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations,</b> (2) form compositon, and (3) guidance through the form. Theoretical and empirical evidence asserts that professional form design helps to optimize response rates, increase reporting accuracy, and decrease processing times. In our study, form return rates increased from ca. 50 percent to ca. 90 percent, data quality improved, and preliminary results were available within 48 hours...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to improve the English writing skill of the tenth grade students at MAN Yogyakarta III by using the mind mapping technique. The study was action research. In conducting the study, the researcher involved the English teacher, the school principal and the students of Grade XE. The subjects of the study were 32 students of Grade XE of MAN Yogyakarta III in the academic year of 2012 / 2013. The data of this study were qualitative. The qualitative data were obtained by observing the teaching-learning process during the implementation of the actions and interviewing the students and the collaborator about the implemented actions. The qualitative data were in the form of field notes and interview transcripts. The results of this study showed that the use of the mind mapping was effective to improve the students’ writing skill. The use of colorful pictures of mind mapping in the BKOF and MOT stages was effective to make the students more enthusiastic in the writing activities. All students could understand and respond to the researcher’ <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations.</b> The activities in the JCOT stage for using the mind mapping as a pre-writing planning strategy were successful to help the students generate or organize their ideas.

40|$|Introduction: Operations {{cancellation}} at {{the last}} minute {{is one of the main}} reasons of inefficiency and waste of resources in Hospitals. This study aims to investigate the reasons and the frequency of operations cancellations in Khatam-al-Anbia Eye Hospital (Mashhad-Iran) in 2013. Materials and Methods:In this descriptive and cross-sectional study, all canceled scheduled operations in 2013 in Khatam-al-Anbiya Eye Hospital were investigated and the data were recorded in a checklist. Study variables included: 1) the number of planned operations, 2) the number of canceled operations, 3) age, 4) gender and 5) the reason of operation cancellation. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and SPSS 16. Results: Of 16512 operations scheduled during 2013, 329 cases (1. 99 percent) were canceled. The reason of cancellation was not mentioned in (28. 6 percent) of cases. Other reasons of operations cancellation included, in the order of importance, high-risk underlying disease (22. 5 %),  medical advice ignorance  from the patient's behalf (10. 6 %), change in clinical status (7. 9 %), prolongation of previous operations (7 %), patient’s dissatisfaction (5. 8 %), Patients' incomplete Nil Per Os (NPO) time (5. 5 %), inadequate equipment (4. 6 %), lack of lab tests and consultations (2. 7 %), diagnosis change (2. 4 %), surgeon's absence (1. 8 %), and incomplete admission documents (0. 6 %). Conclusion: In a high percentage of canceled cases, the reasons of operation cancellations had not been mentioned in the patient’s file. A significant portion of theses cancellations can be attributed to the patients' incomplete cooperation.   Cancellations can be significantly reduced through providing the patient with enough <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations...</b>|$|E
