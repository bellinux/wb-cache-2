25|$|Maxwell House's 'hug-a-mug' 80's TV {{commercials}} sometimes featured cartoon Dick Tracy cameos, {{including one}} {{where he is}} sitting at a live action diner counter along with some live action cops. As Tracy raises his coffee mug, his wrist radio sounds. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> wrist to listen, {{only to have the}} coffee spill to the amusement of the cops.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Merton. 'Then let us talk {{as between}} man and man.' <b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> chair backwards, and crossed his legs. 'By the way, as I have no Aaron and Hur to help me to hold up my hands, may I drop them? The attitude, though reassuring, is fatiguing.' ...|$|E

50|$|J.D.'s most {{prominently}} featured quirk is his habit of daydreaming. When this happens, <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> {{head back and}} to his left, blankly looking upwards. The sequences played out in his daydreams are of surreal scenarios and situations that have just been mentioned or wondered about, often in an exaggerated manner. Many of these are followed by a comment from him which, although {{in keeping with his}} daydream, sounds strange and is often highly unrelated to the initial topic, very often earning him odd looks from nearby characters in the scene.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Eadweard Muybridge, pioneer of early action photography, 1872 - 1878. The portrait, taken fifteen years after Muybridge had successfully taken the famous photographic action series of Leland Stanford's horse, depicts the artist {{seated in a}} chair with his hands folded in his lap. He wears a suit and gazes to the left. His long white hair and beard are in disarray, his intense eyes set deep into his head and veiled in shadow. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> head to the side, making him look partially infirm or deranged. A note on the picture file card reads: "(Griffin?) "...|$|R
60|$|Corny Kelleher {{closed his}} long daybook and glanced with his {{drooping}} eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning {{it on its}} axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by {{and came to the}} doorway. There <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.|$|E

I am glad to {{perceive}} that the plateau itself has actually obtruded itself upon your intelligence." [...] He glanced up at it, and then, to our amazement, he sprang from his rock, and, seizing Summerlee by the neck, <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> face into the air. [...] "Now sir!" [...] he shouted, hoarse with excitement. [...] "Do I help you {{to realize that the}} plateau contains some animal life?" ...|$|E
60|$|The house {{seemed too}} little for Marcia's happiness, and after dinner {{she did not}} let Bartley forget his last night's engagement. She sent him off to get his horse at the hotel, and ran up to her room to put on her wraps for the drive. Her mother cleared away the dinner things; she pushed the table {{to the side of}} the room, and then sat down in her feather-cushioned chair and waited her husband's {{pleasure}} to speak. He ordinarily rose from the Sunday dinner and went back to his office; to-day he had taken a chair before the stove. But he had mechanically put his hat on, and he wore it pushed off his forehead as <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> chair back on its hind legs, and braced himself against the hearth of the stove with his feet.|$|E
5000|$|On-stage Strummer wires {{himself up}} into an inhuman dynamo of sweaty, {{trembling}} flesh, fearful {{enough to have}} one wondering when the ambulance brigade will rush to his rescue with a straight-jacket. While <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> bullet head at acute angles, his agonising face screwed into an open wound, he wields his Telecaster like a chain saw. His magnetism is totally original - more like an Olympic strong man imploding all his energy into a final record-breaking lift than anything seen on a rock'n'roll stage before. Off-stage, he's the Clash member with the lowest profile. â€”Caroline Coon ...|$|R
6000|$|It amused Bartley to hear Kinney bragging already of a {{town that}} he had never seen. He winked a good-natured disdain over the rim of the goblet which <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> on <b>his</b> lips. [...] "And give up my chances here?" [...] he said, as he set the goblet down.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Miss Haldin got up abruptly. I was glad. He did not evidently expect {{anything}} so decisive and, at first, throwing <b>his</b> head back, <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> up <b>his</b> dark glasses with bland curiosity. At last, recollecting himself, {{he stood up}} hastily, seizing his hat off his knees with great adroitness.|$|R
60|$|Archibald was now {{preparing}} to drive {{off from the}} first tee. He did this with great care. Everyone who has seen Archibald Mealing play golf knows that his teeing off {{is one of the}} most impressive sights ever witnessed on the links. <b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> cap over his eyes, waggled his club a little, shifted his feet, waggled his club some more, gazed keenly towards the horizon for a moment, waggled his club again, and finally, with the air of a Strong Man lifting a bar of iron, raised it slowly above his head. Then, bringing it down with a sweep, he drove the ball with a lofty slice some fifty yards. It was rarely that he failed either to slice or pull his ball. His progress from hole to hole was generally a majestic zigzag.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{presently}} almost cool, and {{his eyes}} got more used to the rush of air, but he was getting very high, very high. <b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> head forwards and surveyed the country, blinking. He could see all over Buffalo, a place with three great blackened scars of ruin, and hills and stretches beyond. He {{wondered if he was}} half a mile high, or more. There were some people among some houses near a railway station between Niagara and Buffalo, and then more people. They went like ants busily {{in and out of the}} houses. He saw two motor cars gliding along the road towards Niagara city. Then far away in the south he saw a great Asiatic airship going eastward. [...] "Oh, Gord!" [...] he said, and became earnest in his ineffectual attempts to alter his direction. But that airship took no notice of him, and he continued to ascend convulsively. The world got more and more extensive and maplike. Click, clock, clitter-clock. Above him and very near to him now was a hazy stratum of cloud.|$|E
60|$|Captain Baumgarten {{was an old}} campaigner. In the Eastern provinces, {{and before}} that in Bohemia, he had learned the art of {{quartering}} himself upon the enemy. While the butler brought his supper he occupied himself in making his preparations for a comfortable night. He lit the candelabrum of ten candles upon the centre table. The fire was already burning up, crackling merrily, and sending spurts of blue, pungent smoke into the room. The captain {{walked to the window}} and looked out. The moon had gone in again, and it was raining heavily. He could hear the deep sough of the wind, and see the dark loom of the trees, all swaying in the one direction. It was a sight which gave a zest to his comfortable quarters, and to the cold fowl and the bottle of wine which the butler had brought up for him. He was tired and hungry after his long tramp, so he threw his sword, his helmet, and his revolver-belt down upon a chair, and fell to eagerly upon his supper. Then, with his glass of wine before him and his cigar between his lips, <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> chair back and looked about him.|$|E
6000|$|Withdrawing {{from the}} throng, the Count shared a little {{table in front}} of the cafe with a young man of just such a type. Our friend had some lemonade. The young man was sitting moodily before an empty glass. He looked up once, and then looked down again. <b>He</b> also <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> hat forward. Like this-- ...|$|R
500|$|The male {{bog turtle}} is {{territorial}} and will attack other males if they venture within [...] of his position. An aggressive male will crawl toward an intruder with his neck extended. As he approaches <b>his</b> foe, <b>he</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> carapace by withdrawing {{his head and}} raising his hind limbs. If the other male does not retreat, a fight of pushing and biting can follow. The bouts typically last just a few minutes, with the larger and older male usually winning. The female is also aggressive when threatened. She will defend the area around her nest, usually up to a radius of , from encroaching females, but when a juvenile approaches, she ignores it, and when a male appears she surrenders her area (except during mating season).|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> back <b>his</b> {{head with}} a grunt that slid swiftly into a gurgle, and {{the shadow of a}} man's torso, monstrous beneath a huge {{inverted}} bottle, wavered and danced on the frown of the cliff at our backs. Palitlum released his lips from the glass with a caressing suck and glanced regretfully up into the ghostly vault of the sky where played the wan white light of the summer borealis.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thought it out, yes. And then done it. You {{should see}} her dance--ah! You should see her dance round the bear, when I bring him in! Ah, a {{beautiful}} thing, you know. She claps her hand--" [...] And Ciccio stood {{still in the}} street, with his hat cocked a little on one side, rather common-looking, and he smiled along his fine nose at Alvina, and he clapped his hands lightly, and <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> eyebrows and his eyelids as if facially he were imitating a dance, {{and all the time}} his lips smiled stupidly. As he gave a little assertive shake of his head, finishing, there came a great yell of laughter from the opposite pavement, where a gang of pottery lasses, in aprons all spattered with grey clay, and hair and boots and skin spattered with pallid spots, had stood to watch. The girls opposite shrieked again, {{for all the world like}} a gang of grey baboons. Ciccio turned round and looked at them with a sneer along his nose. They yelled the louder. And he was horribly uncomfortable, walking there beside Alvina with his rather small and effeminately-shod feet.|$|E
6000|$|The night wore {{away and}} when the red sunrise began to pierce the dusk of the Temple, where some had fallen asleep, and others drowsed as they walked to and fro to keep {{themselves}} awake, Redfield conferred with his lieutenants. Then they pulled their captive to his feet, not roughly, and moved with him {{down the aisle and}} out of the door. They left some of the slumberers still sleeping; of the others not all followed them on their way to Matthew Braile's, up through the woods and past the cornfields and tobacco patches; but with those of the Little Flock who had hung night-long about the Temple, singing and praying to their idol, they arrived, some before and some after the prisoner, at the log cabin of the magistrate. He was sitting after his habit in his splint-bottomed chair tilted against the porch wall, waiting for the breakfast which his wife was getting within. As the crowd straggled up to the porch, <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> chair down, and came forward with a frown of puzzle. [...] "What's this?" [...] he demanded; then, catching sight of a woman's eager face among the foremost, his frown relaxed and he said, [...] "Don't all speak at once, Sally." ...|$|E
6000|$|A few spectators, {{scattered}} {{about on the}} rows of benching, {{turned to look at}} them as they walked up the aisle, where the cocoa matting, soaked and dried, and soaked again, with perpetual libations of tobacco-juice, mercifully silenced their footsteps; most of the faces turned upon them showed a slow and thoughtful movement of the jaws, and, as they were dropped or averted, a general discharge of tobacco-juice seemed to express the general adoption of the new-comers, whoever they were, as a necessary element of the scene, which it was useless to oppose, and about which it was idle to speculate. Before the Squire had found his party seats on one of the benches next the bar, the spectators had again given their languid attention to the administration of justice, which is everywhere informal with us, and is only a little more informal in the West than in the East. An effect of serene disoccupation pervaded the place, such as comes at the termination of an interesting affair; and no one seemed to care for what the clerk was reading aloud in a set, mechanical tone. The judge was busy with his docket; the lawyers, at their several little tables within the bar, lounged in their chairs, or stalked about laughing and whispering to each other; the prosecuting attorney leaned upon the shoulder of a jolly-looking man, who lifted his face to joke up at him, as <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> chair back; a very stout, youngish person, who sat next him, kept his face dropped while the clerk proceeded:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Jimmy's {{skin was}} brown, {{his mouth was}} firm, and his look alert. His hands were {{blistered}} and his back was sore, {{but this was not}} important. He could now pull a big saw through gummy logs and, as a rule, drive the shining ax-head where he wanted it to go. A belt held his overalls tight at <b>his</b> waist; when <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> back <b>his</b> head to get his breath his balance and pose were good.|$|R
60|$|Presently <b>he</b> brought <b>his</b> <b>tilted</b> chair {{down with}} a sharp thud. Gabe Foley had paused in his {{manipulation}} of a king to hurl a question at the Greenvale men.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Fecundo Reyes holding a horse-blanket, standing {{to the side}} of a shanty barn, [s. d]. Fecundo, the son of Clara Cota and Antonio Reyes, {{can be seen from the}} knees up standing at center. He holds a long swaddle of material which may be either a horse-blanket or cured animal skin. He wears a lightly-colored button-down shirt over which a dark vest is pulled. <b>He</b> <b>tilts</b> <b>his</b> head slightly to the right, the brim of his hat tipped-up enough to expose his round, bearded face. He appears to be in late middle-life, possibly his late fifties or early sixties. Behind him, an unhitched horse-drawn carriage can be seen to the left, while farther back and to the right, a woman of similar age to Fecundo can be seen in a prairie dress. Behind her, the broad side of the ramshackle barn can be seen. Fecundo was also the grandson of Juan Francisco Reyes, the first grantee of the San Fernando Valley...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} just how I can account for a strain of {{compassion}} which mingled with this sense of irresponsibility in me; perhaps it was my feeling of security that attuned me to pity; but certainly I {{did not look at}} this young girl long without beginning to grieve for her, and to weave about her a web of possibilities, which grew closer and firmer in texture when she was joined by a couple who had apparently not left her a great while before, and who spoke, without otherwise saluting her, as they sat down on either side of her. I instantly interpreted her friends to be the young wife and middle- aged husband of a second marriage; for they were evidently man and wife, and he must have been nearly twice as old as she. In person he tended to the weight which expresses settled prosperity, and a certain solidification of temperament and character; as to his face, it was kind, and it was rather humorous, in spite of being a little slow in the cast of mind it suggested. He wore an iron-grey beard on his cheeks and chin, but he had his strong upper lip clean shaven; some drops of perspiration stood upon it, and upon his forehead, which showed itself well up toward his crown under the damp strings of his scanty hair. He looked at the young goddess in white duck with a sort of trouble in his friendly countenance, and his wife (if it was his wife) seemed to share his concern, though she smiled, while he let the corners of his straight mouth droop. She was smaller than the young girl, and I thought almost as young; and she had the air of being somehow responsible for her, and cowed by her, though the word says rather more than I mean. She was not so well dressed; that is, not so stylishly, though doubtless her costume was more expensive. It seemed the inspiration of a village dressmaker; and her husband's low-cut waistcoat, and his expanse of plaited shirt-front, betrayed a provincial ideal which she would never decry--which she would perhaps never find different from the most worldly. He had probably, I swiftly imagined, been wearing just that kind of clothes for twenty years, and telling his tailor to make each new suit like the last; he had been buying for the same period the same shape of Panama hat, regardless of the continually changing type of straw hats on other heads. I cannot say just why, as <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> chair back on its hind-legs, I felt that he was either the cashier of the village bank at home, or one of the principal business men of the place. Village people I was quite resolute to have them all; but I left them free to have come from some small manufacturing centre in western Massachusetts or southern Vermont or central New York. It was easy to see that they were not in the habit of coming away from their place, wherever it was; and I wondered whether they were finding their account in the present excursion.|$|E
50|$|One study {{described}} {{a patient with}} astasis as lying {{in bed with a}} normal body posture. When the patient was sitting, <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> body to the left. When he was asked to stand up, the patient rotated his trunk axis to the left (left shoulder going backwards), and tilted his body to that same side, showing resistance to passive correction of posture in both of these planes. He was unable to stand and fell backwards and towards the left.|$|E
60|$|During {{all this}} time Hunky Ben had stood with his rifle ready, {{listening}} with the feelings {{of a man in}} a dream. He watched the robber and his victim ride quietly away until they were out of sight. Then <b>he</b> stood up, <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> cap on one side, and scratched his head in great perplexity.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Peter J. Horsch {{standing on the}} roof of a building, ca. 1930. Horsch is shown in full figure at center, dressed in a pinstripe suit. <b>He</b> has <b>tilted</b> <b>his</b> head slightly towards the left, and his hips are angled slightly to the right. His left hand is partly clenched, while the other hangs open. The brick walls of the building's roof are visible in the background, while a drain is visible near Horsch's feet. He retired from the Title Insurance Company in 1950. He appears to be in his early fifties...|$|R
6000|$|Manston {{played the}} same game, but more palpably. The meal was nearly over when he seemed {{possessed of a}} new idea of how his object might be accomplished. <b>He</b> <b>tilted</b> back <b>his</b> chair with a {{reflective}} air, and looked steadily at the clock standing against the wall opposite to him. He said sententiously, 'Few faces are capable of expressing more by dumb show than {{the face of a}} clock. You may see in it every variety of incentive--from the softest seductions to negligence to the strongest hints for action.' ...|$|R
60|$|For a {{while he}} WAS satisfied. Everybody made much of him, and <b>he</b> <b>tilted</b> up <b>his</b> nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it. Some called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up fit to bust. You see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we only went down the river on a raft and came back by the {{steamboat}}, but Tom went by the steamboat both ways. The boys envied me and Jim a good deal, but land! they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM.|$|R
