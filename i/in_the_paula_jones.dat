2500|$|The Lewinsky scandal was an American {{political}} {{sex scandal}} that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

[...] Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.

2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E

The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v.

40|$|<b>The</b> work of <b>Paula</b> Rego {{develops}} {{an intense}} and constant dialogue with <b>the</b> arts, and <b>in</b> particular with literature.

After revisiting The crime of Father Amaro, <b>Paula</b> Rego revisited <b>the</b> novel The relic and pro­duced eight subversive paintings that, while relating to the original narrative, propose alternative versions of <b>the</b> plot, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> painter exercises her violent and iconoclastic view over contemporary society.
