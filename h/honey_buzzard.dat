5|$|Some large broad-winged birds rely on thermal {{columns of}} rising hot air {{to enable them}} to soar. These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great {{difficulty}} crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European <b>honey</b> <b>buzzard</b> Pernis apivorus, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi, Georgia. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.|$|E

40|$|Billions {{of birds}} migrate across entire continents each year. Yet {{we know very}} little about how weather {{conditions}} shape the epic journeys of long-distance migrants. In this dissertation, Wouter Vansteelant combines classic field observations and cutting-edge animal tracking technology in order to unravel how European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> Pernis apivorus negotiate the weather from thermal to flyway. Migrating birds are often thought to maximize their migration speed when adjusting flight behaviour to variable weather conditions. However, <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> seem to compromise between time-optimal and risk-averse strategies across multiple scales of migratory movement, ranging from the speed at which they glide between thermals to the migration routes they choose during each season. The birds effectively allow themselves to be pushed by the weather during most of their journeys, travelling along detours in anticipation of large-scale wind regimes between Europe and Africa. Weather conditions thus greatly affect the routes and timing of individual migrants. However, by going-with-the-flow <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> avoid the risk of exhausting their energy reserves along the way, and they manage to arrive on time to breed almost every year...|$|R

Ring 27, 2 : 215 - 220. In this paper we analyse the spatial migration patterns {{and the water}} crossing tendency of adult <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> during spring and autumn migration in the Central Mediterranean re-gion. In this area, during spring, these long-distance migrants wintering in western-central Equatorial Africa, concentrate crossing the sea between Africa and Europe through the Channel of Sicily, about 150 km wide, {{at least part of}} them via the islands of Pantelleria and Marettimo. When they reach western Sicily most of them fly east, along the mountain chain of northern Sicily, towards the Strait of Messina. Nevertheless, thousands of birds use a more direct route to reach the continental mainland undertaking the crossing of the Tyrrhenian Sea via Ustica and the Lipari Islands. During autumn the migration of adult <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> is less consistent.

40|$|Given that soaring birds travel faster with {{supportive}} winds or in good {{thermal soaring}} conditions, we expect weather conditions en route of migration to explain commonly observed regional and seasonal {{patterns in the}} performance of soaring migrants. We used GPS-loggers to track 13 <b>honey</b> <b>buzzards</b> and four Montagu's harriers for two to six migrations each. We determined how tailwinds, crosswinds, boundary layer height (a proxy for thermal convection) and precipitation affected hourly speeds, daily distances and daily mean speeds with linear regression models. <b>Honey</b> <b>buzzards</b> mostly travel by soaring while Montagu's harriers supplement soaring with flapping. Therefore, we expect that performance of harriers will be less affected by weather than for buzzards. Weather conditions explained between 30 and 50 % of variation in migration performance of both species. Tailwind had the largest effect on hourly speeds, daily mean speeds and daily travel distances. <b>Honey</b> <b>buzzards</b> travelled significantly faster and farther, and Montagu's harriers non-significantly faster, under better convective conditions. <b>Honey</b> <b>buzzards</b> travelled at slower speeds and shorter distances in crosswinds, whereas harriers maintained high speeds in crosswinds. Weather conditions varied between regions and seasons, and this variation accounted for nearly all regional and seasonal variation in flight performance. Hourly performance was higher than predicted at times when we suspect birds had switched to intermittent or continuous flapping flight, for example during sea-crossings. The daily travel distance of Montagu's harriers was determined to a significant extent by their daily travel time, which differed between regions, possibly also due to weather conditions. We conclude with the implications of our work for studies on migration phenology and we suggest an important role for high-resolution telemetry in understanding migratory behavior across entire migratory journeys...|$|R

Immature European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> Pernis apivorus {{are believed to}} remain in tropical Africa during {{the first years of}} their lives. We studied their movements during this period with the aid of satellite telemetry. After crossing the Sahara Desert on autumn migration, all six tracked young buzzards stopped at relatively northerly latitudes, between 9. 9 - 13. 6 degrees N. Of the five individuals that continued transmitting, four made south-directed movements, mainly in November, to areas located further south or east within latitudes 1. 7 - 9. 8 degrees N. Three young buzzards were tracked for more than three months in tropical Africa, and these individuals continued to perform extensive movements within the tropics throughout the tracking period. They travelled between 2, 430 and 3, 990 km (minimum distances) during 13 to 14 months, in which they visited several sites. In contrast, adult birds migrate directly to their wintering sites where they remain stationary within restricted territories.

We set out {{to explore}} whether changes in {{fecundity}} and survival (or both) of European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> were associated with trends observed in The Netherlands. We used standardized monitoring data on numbers and reproduction from several study plots in The Netherlands over the period of 1974 - 2005. Survival estimates were based on recoveries of <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> ringed throughout Europe (collated by EURING and individual ringing stations). Based on these values we computed the annual population growth rate with a time invariant population model, and used elasticity analysis to detect the parameter with the strongest influence on growth rate.

Elasticity of adult survival was much higher than of any other life history parameter, indicating that adult survival has potentially {{the greatest impact on}} annual population growth. Because data on reproduction varied strongly we estimated a 95 % confidence interval for annual population growth by bootstrapping the reproduction data. Furthermore, we analysed the influence of stochastic food availability (i. e. wasp abundance) on reproduction, and through this demographic factor, on the population trend. The stochastic model suggests a clear population decline, which is consistent with observed declines across much of northern and western Europe (including The Netherlands).

To {{find out how}} soaring migrants adjust their flight behaviour to dynamic atmospheric conditions across entire migration routes, we combined optimal soaring migration theory with high-resolution GPS tracking data of migrating <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> Pernis apivorus and wind data from a global numerical atmospheric model. We compared measurements of gliding air speeds to predictions based on two distinct behavioural benchmarks for thermal soaring flight. The first being a time-optimal strategy whereby birds alter their gliding air speeds {{as a function of}} climb rates to maximize cross-country air speed over a full climb-glide cycle (Vopt). The second a risk-averse energy-efficient strategy at which birds alter their gliding air speed in response to tailwinds/headwinds to maximize the distance travelled in the intended direction during each glide phase (Vbgw). <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> were gliding on average 2. 05 ms- 1 slower than Vopt and 3. 42 ms- 1 faster than Vbgw while they increased air speeds with climb rates and reduced air speeds in tailwinds.
