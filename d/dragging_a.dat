5|$|Conventions with {{significant}} numbers of fursuiters may offer an event known as the furry games, furry races, or critterlympics. These focus on feats of dexterity suited to multiple players in teams, such as <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> sled filled with plush toys or other fursuiters around a marked track, or racing back and forth while tethered to one another with a hula hoop.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} {{centered}} on Maroon 5 playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a {{dilapidated}} train engine {{in the middle of}} the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time to see two men <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E
50|$|Vis5D {{provides}} other visualization techniques. Users can <b>drag</b> <b>a</b> 3D cursor to {{a selected}} time and location, then trigger {{the calculation of}} a forward and backward wind trajectory from that point. Users can <b>drag</b> <b>a</b> vertical bar cursor and see, in another window, a thermodynamic diagram for the selected vertical column of atmosphere. And users can <b>drag</b> <b>a</b> 3D cursor to a selected time and location and read out individual values for parameters at that point. These examples all involve direct manipulation interfaces, as does the placement of plane slices through 3D grids.|$|R

25|$|The only fatal {{accident}} in {{connection to the}} U-Bahn happened on 20 September 1994, when the ceiling of a tunnel under construction collapsed near today's Trudering station, <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> public bus into the ensuing hole in Truderinger Straße. Two passengers were killed, {{as well as the}} construction worker, who tried to warn the bus driver.|$|E
25|$|Helicopters <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> plow to {{overturn}} or detonate mines. This has {{the problem of}} bringing down the helicopter when the plow snags onto objects such as large rocks, but has been corrected by use of pressure-sensitive plow rakes which release when over-pressured. This does, however, affect its effectiveness as mines planted in hard ground or near rocks will not be detonated.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, USB {{flash drive}} {{installations}} {{can be used}} to boot Ubuntu and Kubuntu in a way that allows permanent saving of user settings and portability of the USB-installed system between physical machines (however, the computers' BIOS must support booting from USB). In newer versions of Ubuntu, the Ubuntu Live USB creator {{can be used to}} install Ubuntu on a USB drive (with or without a live CD or DVD). Creating a bootable USB drive with persistence is as simple as <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> slider to determine how much space to reserve for persistence; for this, Ubuntu employs casper.|$|E

25|$|Tendulkar was {{dismissed}} seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that {{he struggles to}} cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings. Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career. In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali, and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> delivery from Gul on to his stumps.|$|E
25|$|However, West Indies fought back. Ramdin {{took care}} of both spinners and seamers in style, driving his way to 56 before <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> {{delivery}} from Test debutant Gayan Wijekoon onto his own stumps, but he had lifted West Indies to a respectable 192 for 6. Chanderpaul and spinner Omari Banks saw them through to stumps on day one, with an unbeaten partnership of 79. However, the second day opened with a nightmare for West Indies. Malinga and Chaminda Vaas {{took care of}} the remaining four wickets in 40 deliveries in the morning, for only fourteen runs, as the tail rolled over for 285.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{while still}} in Sacramento, the {{gigantic}} engine {{was used as an}} advertising tool by the railroad, to spectacular effect. According to author Guy L. Dunscomb, the engine was kept under steam near the Central Pacific's passenger depot, where it would await the arrival of passenger trains coming in from the east. As the train arrived, El Gobernador would steam past the depot <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> long line of empty freight cars behind it and causing quite a stir in the process. The engine would then be uncoupled and placed on adjacent trackage, where the passengers could {{get a good look at}} the monster up close.|$|E

25|$|On the Mexico-United States border, a drifter, {{wearing a}} Union uniform and <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> coffin, {{witnesses}} María, a mixed-race prostitute, being {{tied to a}} bridge and whipped by Mexican bandits. The bandits are dispatched by henchmen of Major Jackson – a racist ex-Confederate officer – who prepare to kill María by crucifying her atop a burning cross. The drifter, who identifies himself as Django, easily shoots the men, and offers María protection. The pair arrive in a ghost town, populated by Nathaniel, a bartender, and five prostitutes. Nathaniel explains that the town is a neutral zone in a conflict between Jackson’s Red Shirts and General Hugo Rodríguez’s revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|In January and April 1899, two old pier signal cannon, used to {{identify}} the pier to shipping in fog, were recovered from {{near the end of}} the pier by divers. These were eventually installed on the steps of Herne Bay Clock Tower sometime after 1900. The Duke of Cambridge arrived at the pier in Herne Bay Steam Boat Company's PS City of Canterbury under the Royal Standard in 1837. There were two serious accidents on the first pier: in 1840 a woman with a wooden leg was knocked down and killed by the trolley which again in 1844 hit a porter who lost his arm. In that year, possibly in response to the second accident, Captain Charles Cornelius Gardiner was appointed pier master. On 16 July 1901 the electric tram went through the railings of the third pier, <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> tram car with it and killing a woman.|$|E
25|$|However, India quickly {{showed their}} intent. As Andre Adams pitched it short outside the off stump, Virender Sehwag feasted, smashing sixteen off one over, and taking only 34 balls for his 45 before <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> ball from Oram {{into his own}} stumps. With the other opener, Sourav Ganguly, having made 19, India had made a solid start, with 75 runs coming off 50 deliveries. Rahul Dravid and Mohammad Kaif came to the crease, and the pair slowed down the run rate somewhat, but still hit plenty of {{boundaries}} when opportunities arose, keeping the required rate around 5. New Zealand's bowlers tried to apply pressure, but only Scott Styris managed to do so with any consistency, bowling nine overs in a spell before his last over yielded 10 runs – which prompted Fleming to bring on spinner Jeetan Patel. Dhoni came on a few overs earlier as Yuvraj was out for 22, and the big-hitting wicket-keeper punished Patel with two straight sixes to bring the equation from 19 off 22 to 7 off 20. Dhoni then ended the match with six runs off the balls from Andre Adams, who conceded 67 runs in total, to see India into the final and make the last match with Zimbabwe academic.|$|E

500|$|In 1851 French {{explorer}} Joseph René Bellot mounted another {{expedition to}} find Franklin, sponsored by Franklin's wife. Bellot took a Halkett boat-cloak on the journey, noting {{in his journal}} that it was [...] "of immense value {{in a country where}} the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft". Bellot's expedition was unable to locate Franklin, and it was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae (equipped with [...] "two beautiful Halkett boats") located a group of Inuit who recounted seeing men <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> boat four years earlier, and later finding their bodies.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna {{stretching}} {{in front of}} a wall-mirror, while traffic noise is heard. During the first verse, Madonna is shown in a chic Chanel black dress with retro makeup. As the bridge of the song builds up, she is shown dancing {{in front of a}} white screen, wearing a French cap, and standing on a sofa. When the chorus of the song plays, she dances while holding an archlight, and fondles with long black fur. The second verse shows Madonna and Williams trading shots, with Williams wearing sunglasses in some scenes. At the [...] "Get stupid" [...] interlude, Williams is shown <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> bag along the floor behind Madonna. The video concludes with an exhausted Madonna, falling asleep on the studio floor.|$|E
500|$|Gittings recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} a man {{said to his}} kids, 'Hold your noses— it's dirty here.' And {{there was a woman}} <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> string of kids who said, very angrily, 'You should all be married and have children like me.'" [...] Leaflets were distributed to passersby that described their reasons for picketing, surprising some recipients who were unaware gays and lesbians could be fired so easily, and disgusting others. Gittings remembered, [...] "It was risky and we were scared. Picketing was not a popular tactic at the time. And our cause seemed outlandish even to most gay people." [...] The evening prior to the group's picketing the State Department, Secretary of State Dean Rusk announced the pickets at a press conference. Gittings connected the high-profile visibility with a [...] "breakthrough into mainstream publicity." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, John Myles, who had {{replaced}} Salt {{and who now}} led the Canningites, had been gathering witnesses who could claim they had seen Mary Squires {{in the vicinity of}} Enfield Wash. [...] One said he had seen two men <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> woman towards Enfield early in January. [...] Others told him they had on 29January seen [...] "a miserable poor wretch" [...] travelling toward London. [...] Myles found witnesses who claimed they had seen Squires at Enfield Wash in December and January. [...] Myles unwittingly made Gascoyne aware of his investigation when he asked a John Cooper of Salisbury his opinion of seven of Gascoyne's witnesses, who claimed they had seen Squires in Coombe. [...] Cooper wrote back affirming the good character of Thomas Greville (who had testified for Squires at her trial), but later sent the same information to Gascoyne, offering his support.|$|E
500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{understands that}} co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. [...] "You often write songs with {{collaborators}} {{that you would}} never write by yourself. It's a way of <b>dragging</b> <b>a</b> song out of you that you wouldn't have come up with". One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. [...] "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness {{out of it and}} make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have [...] ". Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, Songs from the South, with [...] " [...] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?" [...] In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.|$|E
