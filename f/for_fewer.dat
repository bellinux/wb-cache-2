5|$|Stankonia is {{the fourth}} studio album by American hip hop duo OutKast. It was {{released}} on October 31, 2000, by La Face Records. The album was recorded in the duo's recently purchased Atlanta recording facility Stankonia Studios, which allowed <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> time and recording constraints, and featured production work from Earthtone III (a production team consisting of Outkast and Mr. DJ) and Organized Noise.|$|E
5|$|Anup Rubens was {{selected}} to compose the film's music and background score in mid March 2013 marking his second collaboration with both Kumar and Chaitanya after Ishq (2012) and Autonagar Surya (2014) respectively. Kumar read the script to Rubens without revealing the film's cast. After Rubens accepted {{a role in the}} film, both met Nagarjuna. Rubens {{said in an interview that}} he worked <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> days when compared to his previous works and added that Kumar had a small story to tell within every song in the film. Due to Nageswara Rao's death, a song's tune was replaced with another tune and a few lines of the song Nenu Puttanu from the film Prem Nagar (1971).|$|E

5|$|Bowling as a {{participation}} sport {{flourished in}} the early 1960s, but its popularity was diluted due to overbuilding; the number of bowling alleys sanctioned by the then-American Bowling Congress peaked at about 11,000 by mid-decade, and Kona was {{one of more than}} 30 in southern California alone. A decline in league bowling starting in the 1980s was also blamed for the downturn, but an AMF Bowling official argued that the customer base remained steady because an increase in open bowling made up <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> league bowlers.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 2009, the Government {{announced}} that it would refine the size and number of GRCs. This could be achieved without amending either the Constitution or the Parliamentary Elections Act. Instead, when the next EBRC was appointed, its terms of reference would instruct the Committee to plan <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> six-member GRCs than at present, and to reduce the average size of each GRC. The average size of GRCs at that time was 5.4 MPs because there were only five-member and six-member GRCs. The new average, however, would not exceed five MPs.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored research, with the 1943–1944 budget being the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state appropriation). Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> incoming contracts as the state had cut the station's appropriation by 40 percent, but increased support from industry and government eventually counteracted low state support. The electronics and communications research that Directors Gerald Rosselot and James E. Boyd attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were {{a study on the}} propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy-sponsored radar research.|$|E

5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E
5|$|An Octopus card may be {{returned}} to any MTR Customer Service Centre for a refund of the remaining credit stored on it. A handling fee may be charged for the refund — HK$7 for an anonymous On-Loan card {{that had been in}} use <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> than three months, and HK$10 for a Personalised On-Loan card that was issued on or after 1 November 2004. A refund is immediately provided at the time an anonymous On Loan card is returned, unless it has more than HK$500 stored on it. A Personalised On-Loan card or an anonymous On-Loan card with more than HK$500 stored on it needs to be sent back to Octopus Cards Limited for refund processing, in which case, the refund for a Personalised On-Loan card would be available in eight days, and that of an anonymous On-Loan card would be available in five days. If a damaged card is returned for refund, a HK$30 levy would be charged to the cardholder.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, Pohl, along with Georg von Müller, the Chief of the Imperial Naval Cabinet, and Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{the commander of the}} High Seas Fleet, believed that since the war would be over quickly, the fleet should be preserved intact. Together, they agreed that the fleet should be restrained to provide local defense of the German coast, rather than seek a decisive battle against the numerically superior British Grand Fleet. Pohl argued that U-boats should be used to attack British merchant shipping. He pushed <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> restrictions on the conduct of the commerce war beginning in late 1914; he further advocated abandoning the cruiser rules that handicapped the German effort, in favor of unrestricted submarine warfare. He presented his first plans for an unlimited commerce war in November 1914, but these were rejected by the Kaiser and Bethmann-Hollweg so as not to antagonize neutral nations, in particular the United States.|$|E

5|$|Eva Anna Paula Hitler (née Braun; 6 February 1912– 30 April 1945) was the {{longtime}} companion of Adolf Hitler and, <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> than 40 hours, his wife. Braun met Hitler in Munich {{when she was}} a 17-year-old assistant and model for his personal photographer; she began seeing him often about two years later. She attempted suicide twice during their early relationship. By 1936, she was a part of his household at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden and lived a sheltered life throughout World War II. Braun was a photographer, and many of the surviving colour photographs and films of Hitler were taken by her. She was a key figure within Hitler's inner social circle, but did not attend public events with him until mid-1944, when her sister Gretl married Hermann Fegelein, the SS liaison officer on his staff.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was moved}} to Maindiff Court Hospital on 26 June 1942, where he {{remained}} {{for the next three}} years. The facility was chosen for its added security and the need <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> guards. Hess was allowed walks on the grounds and car trips into the surrounding countryside. He had access to newspapers and other reading materials; he wrote letters and journals. His mental health remained under the care of Dr Rees. Hess continued to complain on and off of memory loss and made a second suicide attempt on 4 February 1945, when he stabbed himself with a bread knife. The wound was not serious, requiring two stitches. Despondent that Germany was losing the war, he took no food for the next week, only resuming eating when he was threatened with being force-fed.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} value of {{contracts}} coming to the station significantly increased during World War II; the 1943–1944 budget {{was the first in}} which industry and government contracts exceeded the station's other income, most notably, its state appropriation. Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station's appropriation by 40%, but increased support from industry and government eventually compensated for lower state funding. World War II is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially telecommunications and electronic warfare; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were a study on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, and United States Navy–sponsored radar research.|$|E

5|$|The stadium {{has four}} stands. The Main Stand (renamed the Garrison Lane Stand from 2010 to 2012), a {{free-standing}} structure {{on the north}} side of the playing area, was completed in 1954 and has seating <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> than 5,000 spectators. The upper tier contains the media area and an area of corporate seats as well as standard seating. The lower tier, known as the Paddocks, consists of a few rows of seats placed on the uncovered terraced area in front of the stand; the view from this area can be obstructed by the central tunnel and the dugouts. A row of executive boxes was added at the back of the Paddocks in the 1970s. The family area is divided between the eastern end of the Main Stand and the Paddock beneath. The club planned £1.3million worth of restructuring and refurbishment work on the stand, which contained hospitality areas and offices, during the 2009 closed season, and seating was replaced in 2010. The broadcasting gantry is situated in the roof of this stand.|$|E
5|$|A Standard Ticket {{contactless}} {{smart card}} for single or return journeys {{may also be purchased}} at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used <b>for</b> <b>fewer</b> than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and {{does not need to be}} returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E
