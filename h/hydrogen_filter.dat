40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} fabrication of a Microwave Regenerative Sorbent-based Hydrogen Purifier (MRSHP). This unique microwave powered technology was developed for the purification of a hydrogen stream produced by the Plasma Pyrolysis Assembly (PPA). The PPA is a hydrogen recovery (from methane) post processor for NASA's Sabatier-based carbon dioxide reduction process. Embodied in the Carbon dioxide Reduction Assembly (CRA), currently aboard the International Space Station (ISS), the Sabatier reaction employs hydrogen to catalytically recover oxygen, {{in the form of}} water, from respiratory carbon dioxide produced by the crew. This same approach is base-lined for future service in the Air Revitalization system on extended missions into deep space where resupply is not practical. Accordingly, manned exploration to Mars may only become feasible with further closure of the air loop as afforded by the greater hydrogen recovery permitted by the PPA with subsequent hydrogen purification. By utilizing the well-known high sorbate loading capacity of molecular sieve 13 x, coupled with microwave dielectric heating phenomenon, MRSHP technology is employed as a regenerative filter for a contaminated hydrogen gas stream. By design, freshly regenerated molecular sieve 13 x contained in the MRSHP will remove contaminants from the effluent of a 1 -CM scale PPA for several hours prior to breakthrough. By reversing flow and pulling a relative vacuum the MRSHP prototype then uses 2. 45 GHz microwave power, applied through a novel coaxial antenna array, to rapidly heat the sorbent bed and drive off the contaminants in a short duration vacuum/thermal contaminant desorption step. Finally, following rapid cooling via room temperature cold plates, the MRSHP is again ready to serve as a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>filter...</b>|$|E

Multilayer film filters can provide very precise control of the frequencies transmitted and blocked, so that, for example, objects can be viewed at a particular frequency emitted only by excited <b>hydrogen</b> atoms. <b>Filters</b> {{can also be used}} to partially compensate for the effects of light pollution by blocking out unwanted light.

40|$|We {{obtained}} J-, H- and JH-band photometry {{of known}} extrasolar planet transiting systems at the 2. 1 -m Kitt Peak National Observatory Telescope using the FLAMINGOS infrared camera between October 2008 and October 2011. From the derived lightcurves we have extracted the mid-transit times, transit depths and transit durations for these events. The precise mid-transit times obtained help improve the orbital periods and also constrain transit-time {{variations of the}} systems. For most cases the published system parameters successfully accounted for our observed lightcurves, but in some instances we derive improved planetary radii and orbital periods. We complemented our 2. 1 -m infrared observations using CCD z'-band and B-band photometry (plus two <b>Hydrogen</b> Alpha <b>filter</b> observations) obtained with the Kitt Peak Visitor's Center telescope, and with four H-band transits observed in October 2007 with the NSO's 1. 6 -m McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope. The principal highlights of our results are: 1) our ensemble of J-band planetary radii agree with optical radii, with the best-fit relation being: (Rp/R*) J = 0. 0017 + 0. 979 (Rp/R*) optical, 2) We observe star spot crossings during the transit of WASP- 11 /HAT-P- 10, 3) we detect star spot crossings by HAT-P- 11 b (Kepler- 3 b), thus confirming that the magnetic evolution of the stellar active regions can be monitored even after the Kepler mission has ended, and 4) we confirm a grazing transit for HAT-P- 27 /WASP- 40. In total we present 57 individual transits of 32 known exoplanet systems. Comment: 33 pages, 6 figures, accepted in Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacifi...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis reports an experimental investigation concerned with the optimisation of mechanical properties in investment cast LM 25 aluminium alloy. The effects of melt <b>hydrogen</b> content, <b>filter</b> usage, grain refinement, eutectic silicon modification, heat treatment, pouring and shell preheat temperatures on the structure and tensile properties of LM 25 investment cast tensile test specimens were studied. Four series of experiments were conducted to assess {{the effects of the}} parameters studied on the structure and tensile properties. The first series established the effect of melt hydrogen content, pouring temperature and shell preheat temperature on the casting porosity, pore morphology and tensile properties. The second series investigated the effect of using a ceramic foam filter on the tensile properties. Pouring temperature and shell preheat temperature were variable parameters {{in this part of the}} investigation. The objective of the third series of experiments was to investigate the effect of grain refinement and eutectic silicon modification on the structure and tensile properties. The interaction of these melt treatments with shell preheat temperature and filtration was also studied. In the final series of experiments the effect of heat treatment cycles on the samples produced in the third series of experiments was evaluated in terms of structure and tensile properties. The principal findings of the research were that: shell preheat temperature and hydrogen content are the most important process variables determining the total porosity content; shell temperature affects the structure and, hence, the tensile properties; grain refinement is enhanced as the titanium content increases to about 0. 28...|$|R
40|$|For the {{containment}} post accident {{monitoring and control}} system, the applicant stated that the stainless steel <b>hydrogen</b> monitor pumps, <b>filter</b> housings, valves, piping, tubing, fittings, and orifices; carbon steel tubing and fittings; aluminum pump casings; brass piping and fittings and copper tubing and fittings are exposed to air/gas. As discussed in Table 3. 3 - 7 of the LRA, for these items exposed to air/gas there is no aging effect. For the post accident sampling system stainless steel cooler shells, covers and tube coils exposed only to treated water, loss of material is the applicable aging effect. There are no aging effects for containment post accident monitoring and control system components exposed to external environments on stainless steel, aluminum, brass or copper. For valves, piping, fittings, and tubing made of carbon steel, which are exposed to an "indoor not air-conditioned, " containment air environment, or borated water leaks, the applicable aging effect is loss of material. For carbon steel bolting that is exposed to borated water leaks, the aging effect is loss of mechanical closure integrity.

2500|$|Tabun {{was made}} on an {{industrial}} scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader. In the chemical agent factory in Dyhernfurth an der Oder, codenamed [...] "Hochwerk", at least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. The manufacturing process consisted of two steps, the first being reaction of gaseous dimethylamine (1) with an excess of phosphoryl chloride (2), yielding dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride (3, codenamed [...] "Produkt 39" [...] or [...] "D 4") and dimethylammonium chloride (4). The dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride thus obtained was purified by vacuum distillation and thereafter transferred to the main Tabun production line. Here it was reacted with an excess of sodium cyanide (5), dispersed in dry chlorobenzene, yielding the intermediate dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide (not depicted in the scheme) and sodium chloride (8); then, absolute ethanol (6) was added, reacting with the dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide to yield tabun (7) and hydrogen cyanide (9). After the reaction, the mixture (consisting of about 75% chlorobenzene and 25% tabun, along with insoluble salts {{and the rest of}} the <b>hydrogen</b> cyanide) was <b>filtered</b> to remove the insoluble salts and vacuum-distilled to remove hydrogen cyanide and excess chlorobenzene, so yielding the technical product, consisting either of 95% tabun with 5% chlorobenzene (Tabun A) or (later in the war) of 80% tabun with 20% chlorobenzene (Tabun B).|$|R
40|$|Arsenic is {{naturally}} found in surface and ground waters and the inorganic forms of arsenic {{are the most}} toxic forms. The adverse health effects of arsenic may involve the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, nervous, and haematopoietic systems. Arsenic contamination in drinking water is a global problem widely seen in Bangladesh and West Bengal of the Indian sub continent. As {{there is a great}} demand for field test kits due to the anticipated reduction of the US EPA arsenic standard from 50 ppb to 10 ppb a field kit which offers rapid, simple and safe method for precise estimation of arsenic at 10 ppb in drinking water samples is developed. Field methods, based on the mercuric-bromide-stain, consist of three different major parts, which are carried out stepwise. The first part of the procedure is to remove serious interference caused by hydrogen sulphide. In commercially available kits either the sulphide is oxidized to sulphate and the excess oxidizing reagent removed prior to the hydride generation step or, the <b>hydrogen</b> sulphide is <b>filtered</b> out by passing the gas stream through a filter impregnated with lead acetate during the hydride generation step. The present method employs cupric chloride in combination with ferric chloride or FentonÃ¢Â€Â™s reagent for the removal of hydrogen sulphide, which is rapid, simple and more efficient. Other interferences at this step of the analyses are normally not expected for drinking water analysis. In the second step, the generation of the arsine gas involves the classical way of using zinc metal and hydrochloric acid, which produce the Ã¢Â€Â˜nascentÃ¢Â€Â™ hydrogen, which is the actual reducing agent. Hydrochloric acid can be replaced by sulfamic acid, which is solid and avoids a major disadvantage of having to handle a corrosive liquid in the field. The arsine gas produces a yellowish spot on the reagent paper. Depending on the arsenic content, either, Yellow Ã¢Â€Â“ H (HgBr) 2 As (10 - 50 ppb), Brown Ã¢Â€Â“ (HgBr) 3 As (50 - 100 ppb) or Black Ã¢Â€Â“ Hg 3 As 2 (> 100 ppb) are formed which can be precisely estimated by visual comparison with standard color chart. The results obtained by field kits agree well with the data obtained through I. C. P. AES methods. The most important characteristic for field measurement is that analytical results can be obtained on the site where the sample is taken with high precision and can be conveniently utilized for monitoring arsenic rapidly in a highly contaminated large geographical area...|$|R
