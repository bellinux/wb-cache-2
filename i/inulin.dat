5|$|The {{light energy}} {{captured}} by chlorophyll a is initially {{in the form}} of electrons (and later a proton gradient) that's used to make molecules of ATP and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while <b>inulin,</b> a polymer of fructose is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the glucose is converted to sucrose (common table sugar) for export {{to the rest of the}} plant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inulin</b> is {{advantageous}} {{because it}} contains 25–30% the food energy of sugar or other carbohydrates and 10–15% the food energy of fat. As a prebiotic fermentable fiber, its metabolism by gut flora yields short-chain fatty acids (see below) which increase absorption of calcium, magnesium, and iron, resulting from upregulation of mineral-transporting genes and their membrane transport proteins within the colon wall. Among other potential beneficial effects noted above, <b>inulin</b> promotes {{an increase in the}} mass and health of intestinal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium populations.|$|E
25|$|Inulin's primary {{disadvantage}} is its tolerance. As a soluble fermentable fiber, it {{is quickly}} and easily fermented within the intestinal tract, which may cause gas and digestive distress at doses higher than 15 grams/day in most people. Individuals with digestive diseases have benefited from removing fructose and <b>inulin</b> from their diet. While clinical studies have shown changes in the microbiota at lower levels of <b>inulin</b> intake, some of the health effects require higher than 15 grams per day to achieve the benefits.|$|E

50|$|<b>Inulins</b> are {{polymers}} composed {{mainly of}} fructose units, and typically have a terminal glucose. The fructose units in <b>inulins</b> {{are joined by}} a β(2→1) glycosidic bond. In general, plant <b>inulins</b> contain between 20 and several thousand fructose units.

40|$|Sugars play an {{important}} role in the desiccation tolerance of most anhydrobiotic organisms. It has been shown in previous studies that different structural families of oligosaccharides have different efficacies to interact with phospholipid headgroups and protect membranes from solute leakage during drying. Here, we have compared three families of linear oligosaccharides (fructans (<b>inulins),</b> malto-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides) for their chain-length dependent protection of egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes against membrane fusion. We found increased protection with chain length up to a degree of polymerization (DP) of 5 for malto-oligosaccharides, and a decrease for <b>inulins</b> and manno-oligosaccharides. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed that for all sugars the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased with DP, although to different degrees for the different oligosaccharide families. Higher Tg values resulted in reduced membrane fusion only for malto-oligosaccharides below DP 5. Contrary to expectation, for <b>inulins,</b> manno-oligosaccharides and malto-oligosaccharides of a DP above five, fusion increased with increasing Tg, indicating that other physical parameters are more important in determining the ability of different sugars to protect membranes against fusion during drying.

25|$|The {{university}} {{has been involved}} in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir Norman Haworth was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on carbohydrate chemistry in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the glucoside ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, <b>inulin</b> and xylan molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E
500|$|Biopolymers of sugars {{are common}} in nature.

40|$|Although fructans occur {{widely in}} several plant {{families}} {{and they have}} been a subject of investigation for decennia, the mechanism of their biosynthesis is not completely elucidated. We succeeded in purifying a fructan: fructan 1 -fructosyl transferase (1 -FFT; EC 2. 4. 1. 100) from chicory roots (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum cv. Flash). In combination with the purified chicory root sucrose: sucrose 1 -fructosyl transferase (1 -SST; EC 2. 4. 1. 99), this enzyme synthesized a range of naturally occurring chicory fructans (<b>inulins)</b> from sucrose as the sole substrate. Starting from physiologically relevant sucrose concentrations, <b>inulins</b> up to a degree of polymerization (DP) of about 20 were synthesized in vitro after 96 h at 0 degrees C.

The initiation of (DP > 3) -fructan synthesis was found to be correlated with a certain ratio of 1 -kestose to sucrose.

50|$|Because of the {{configuration}} of their glycosidic bonds, fructooligosaccharides resist hydrolysis by salivary and intestinal digestive enzymes. In the colon they are fermented by anaerobic bacteria. In other words, they have a lower caloric value, while contributing to the dietary fiber fraction of the diet.

In the proposed method, <b>inulins</b> were externally prepared by dissolving them in pure formamide (2. 5 : 7. 5, w/w).

Another advantage of this new method is its applicability for the water content determination of other polysaccharides that are not readily soluble in the working medium.

Tomato plants responded to moderate Cd concentration by decreasing yield and crop growth parameters due to the accumulation of Cd in leaf tissue, inhibition of the PS II activity, reduced nutrients translocation, and also to the oxidative stress as evidenced by enhanced hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) generation, ion leakage and lipid peroxidation. AM inoculation significantly enhanced the metal concentration in shoots and reduced growth and yield. The Ikram/Maxifort combination induced higher antioxidant enzymes, higher accumulation of proline and reduction of lipid peroxidation products.

The higher crop performance of Ikram/Maxifort in comparison to Ikram/Ikram combination was also due to the improved nutritional status (higher P, K, Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn) and increased availability of metabolites involved in cadmium tolerance (phytochelatin PC 2 and fructans <b>inulins).</b> The up-regulation of LeNRAMP 3 gene in leaf of Ikram/Maxifort could explain the better nutritional status of interspecific grafting combination (higher Fe, Mn, and Zn) ...|$|R
