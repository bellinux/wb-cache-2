5000|$|Super Hi-Res Chess was {{a novelty}} {{computer}} {{program for the}} Apple II written by (then) Apple Computer applications programmer Bruce Tognazzini in 1978, early {{in the history of}} Apple computer. It was a practical <b>joke</b> <b>program</b> purporting to be a chess game in high-resolution (hi-res) graphics, but which actually contained no chess or graphics. When the unsuspecting user tried to run the program, it promptly crashed with a syntax error, appearing to return the user to the Applesoft BASIC command line input mode. However, when the user attempted to use any BASIC or Apple DOS commands, there would be humorous results, since the program was actually still running and only pretending to be the Apple's command line processor. Many different commands were [...] "parodied", with silly error messages resulting.|$|E
50|$|Active Virus Shield {{includes}} numerous features {{found in}} Kaspersky Anti-Virus. The software's main feature is malware scanning, which uses Kaspersky's underlying engine and detects {{a variety of}} malware such as viruses, spyware, and even <b>joke</b> <b>programs.</b> It also offers real-time file and e-mail scanning and protection.|$|R
50|$|It {{describes}} {{applications that}} behave in an annoying or undesirable manner, and yet are less serious or troublesome than malware. Grayware encompasses spyware, adware, fraudulent dialers, <b>joke</b> <b>programs,</b> remote access tools and other unwanted programs that harm {{the performance of}} computers or cause inconvenience. The term came into use around 2004.|$|R
5000|$|With {{a pretty}} comic English accent, Hermes & Renato crew <b>jokes</b> <b>programs</b> like [...] "The Best Police Pursuits", {{but instead of}} being law {{enduring}} officers, they play slack ones, the kind that seeing a murder in front of them, tells the murderer {{that if he does}} so again he may receive an advertence.|$|R
50|$|Norman Stiles is a {{television}} writer, born in 1942, {{best known for}} his work on the show Sesame Street. Stiles worked on the show from 1971 until approximately 1995. As part of the Sesame Street writing team, he received eight Daytime Emmy Awards. He also wrote for NBCs 1976-1977 situation comedy The Practice.

5000|$|More {{sophisticated}} computer <b>joke</b> <b>programs</b> {{have yet}} to be developed. Based on our understanding of the SSTH / GTVH humour theories, {{it is easy to see}} why. The linguistic scripts (a.k.a. frames) referenced in these theories include, for any given word, a [...] "large chunk of semantic information surrounding the word and evoked by it ... a cognitive structure internalized by the native speaker". These scripts extend much further than the lexical definition of a word; they contain the speaker's complete knowledge of the concept as it exists in his world. As insentient machines, computers lack the encyclopaedic scripts which humans gain through life experience. They also lack the ability to gather the experiences needed to build wide-ranging semantic scripts and understand language in a broader context, a context that any child picks up in daily interaction with his environment.|$|R
5000|$|Home viewers mailed their <b>jokes</b> to the <b>program,</b> {{during which}} they were read {{by a panel of}} four celebrities [...] - [...] two of them Laugh-In regulars. Each joke was rated on a scale of minus-100 to plus-100 by a {{randomly}} selected audience panel.|$|R

50|$|Computational humour is a {{new field}} of study which uses {{computers}} to model humour; it bridges the disciplines of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. A primary ambition of this field is to develop computer programs which can both generate a joke and recognise a text snippet as a <b>joke.</b> Early <b>programming</b> attempts have dealt almost exclusively with punning because this lends itself to simple straightforward rules. These primitive programs display no intelligence; instead they work off a template with a finite set of pre-defined punning options upon which to build.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{similarities}} in their call letters, WKRC {{was not the}} inspiration behind the television show WKRP in Cincinnati. The show was inspired by show creator Hugh Wilson's experiences at WQXI in Atlanta. The similarity of {{the two sets of}} call letters was used as a <b>joke</b> on the <b>program.</b>|$|R

He was a frequent guest of early television programs during the 1950s.|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} and constructed {{a mechanism for}} using caption text from broadcast television programs to analyze their content. In this paper, we describe the method by which captions are captured and translated from the raw video signal into text on the ViewStation. We also describe our Caption Parser, which analyzes the text and extracts information {{about the content of}} broadcast television programs. A specialized version of the parser is used by our <b>Joke</b> Markup <b>program</b> to index captioned monologues of late-night talk shows. The output of the markup program can be viewed through our Joke Browser, enabling selection and replay of jokes based on their content...|$|R
50|$|The show is {{available}} immediately after airing via podcast on iTunes. Previously, between May 27, 2011 and March 20, 2015, the show {{had to wait}} 24-hours to distribute the podcast due to contract restrictions, which was ridiculed by Kornheiser’s loyal listeners, and was a frequent <b>joke</b> on his <b>program.</b> Fans started a #FreeMrTony hashtag and complained frequently to the station.|$|R
5000|$|One {{particularly}} notable <b>joke</b> {{from the}} <b>program</b> asked the question, [...] "What's {{the difference between}} a sigh, a car, and a jackass?" [...] When the other person answered that he did not know, the questioner said, [...] "A sigh is 'oh dear,' and a car is 'too dear.'" [...] When pressed what's a jackass, the questioner responded, [...] "You dear." ...|$|R
25|$|During {{his time}} on The Don Lane Show, Lane also hosted a morning radio program with Bert Newton on radio station 3UZ in Melbourne. Newton tells a story of how he and the {{producer}} pretended to be on-air and gave out Lane's home address to the listeners. Newton claims that the joke was worth it to see Lane's reaction but that Lane repaid him for the practical <b>joke.</b> The <b>program</b> on 3UZ had many guests who had also appeared on the television show the night before. When moving to Sydney in 1987, Lane hosted a morning show on 2UE for two years. After ending his affiliation with 2UE, he moved to 2KY and hosted a competing breakfast program in 1989. His radio programs usually involved music and interviews with visiting entertainers.|$|R
50|$|Later on in 1980, Herger {{produced}} and hosted a game show, La Pirámide, complete with an Egyptian-themed set and imagery, tons of bad pyramid puns and <b>jokes</b> in the <b>program's</b> scripts, and his entire family {{involved in the}} show. Herger's oldest son Alfredo and daughter Grace Marie went on to be successful teen show hosts in Puerto Rico on WAPA-TV's show Party Time. Grace Marie later became a part-time model and Alfredo attempted {{a career as a}} solo singer.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{the fruit}} cake {{has become a}} {{ridiculed}} dessert, {{in part due to}} the mass-produced inexpensive cakes of questionable age. Some attribute the beginning of this trend with The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson. He would joke that there really is only one fruitcake in the world, passed from family to family. After Carson's death, the tradition continued with [...] "The Fruitcake Lady" [...] (Marie Rudisill), who made appearances on the show and offered her [...] "fruitcake" [...] opinions. In fact, the fruitcake had been a butt of <b>jokes</b> on television <b>programs</b> such as Father Knows Best and The Donna Reed Show years before The Tonight Show debuted and appears to have first become a vilified confection in the early 20th century, as evidenced by Warner Brothers cartoons.|$|R
50|$|Whether on {{television}} or radio, {{the format of the}} Jack Benny Program never wavered. The program utilized a loose show-within-a-show format, wherein the main characters were playing versions of themselves. There was not really a fourth wall, per se. The show would usually open with a song by the orchestra or banter between Benny and Don Wilson. There would then be banter between Benny and the regulars about {{the news of the day}} or about one of the running <b>jokes</b> on the <b>program,</b> such as Benny's age, Day's stupidity or Mary's letters from her mother. There would then be a song by the tenor followed by situation comedy involving an event of the week, a mini-play, or a satire of a current movie. Some shows were entire domestic sitcoms revolving around some aspect of Benny's life (spring cleaning, or a violin lesson).|$|R
