The {{current study}} {{is focused on}} AMD-precipitates that compose the typical {{magnesium}} and aluminum sulfate assemblages in the Spanish sector of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW Spain). The main objectives are identify and describe the composition, morphology and paragenetic relationships of these sulfate phases. From the methodological pint of view, sampling procedure covered the entire metallogenetic province, including five selected representative mines and eight river basins, which are the main receptors of the acid mine drainage discharges. The mineralogical analyses were performed by X-Ray diffraction and electron microscopy. The obtained results showed the extraordinary abundance of aluminum sulfates with acicular habit, from the series pickeringite-apjhonite-halotrichite. They form typical assemblages with other aluminum sulfates, such as alunogen and tamarugite, and with the Mg sulfates: epsomite and hexahydrite. Moreover, the paragenetic relationships indicate the late occurrence of acicular Alsulfates from the halotrichite <b>group.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>support</b> for this research {{was provided by the}} Andalusian Autonomous Government Excellence Project, code P 06 -RNM- 02167.

40|$|Waterborne {{polyurethane}} urea dispersions (WPUUs) {{intended for}} coatings and adhesives were synthesized with mixtures of polyester polyol (PE) and polycarbonate diol (PCD) for combining {{the advantages of}} the polyurethane ureas made with pure polyols. WPUUs made with mixtures of polyols had higher mean particle size and lower viscosity than the ones made with one polyol only. Two types of hard segments totally separated (i. e. −(IPDI-DMPA/TEA-IPDI) - and −(IPDI-HZ-IPDI) -) and two types of soft segments (i. e. −(IPDI-PCD-IPDI) - and −(IPDI-PE-IPDI) -) were produced in polyurethane ureas made with PE + PCD mixtures. The segmented structure and phase separation of the polyurethane ureas made with PE + PCD mixtures differed depending on their PCD content, affecting the thermal, rheological and crystallinity properties. The adhesion of chlorinated vulcanized styrene-butadiene rubber/WPUU/roughened leather joints made with WPUUs prepared with PE + PCD mixtures was very similar to the ones made with PCD and PE only. After ageing in water at 70 °C for 1 - 2 days, the adhesive strength of joints made with WPUUs containing more than 50 wt% PCD is excellent. The properties of the polyurethane ureas made with mixtures of polyols containing 50 wt% or more PCD were determined by lower degree of phase separation and interactions between hard and soft domains via carbonate <b>groups.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>support</b> by UBE CHEMICAL EUROPE is acknowledged...|$|R

40|$|Four carbon blacks with {{different}} specific surface areas and surface chemistries (C 32, C 71, C 159 and C 178) {{were analyzed by}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K. Their surface chemistries were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermal gravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) and inverse gas chromatography (IGC). The carbon blacks contained 2. 7 – 5. 8 wt% volatiles corresponding to single bondOH, Csingle bondO, Cdouble bond; length as m-dashO and COO groups. The surface chemistry parameters obtained with the different experimental techniques were inter-related by using chemometric statistical analysis tools. The application of this methodology showed that the carbon blacks with lower specific surface area (C 32 and C 71) had basic character (electron donor) mainly due to Cdouble bond; length as m-dashO and Csingle bondO groups, whereas the carbon black with the highest specific surface area (C 178) showed acidic character (acceptor electron) due to its high content of OH groups. Moreover, the total surface energy and the dispersive component of the surface energy of the carbon blacks increased {{with the increase of}} their specific surface area. In general the specific interactions of the carbon blacks also increased with the increase of their specific surface area although C 71 is exceptional due to higher oxygen content corresponding to Csingle bondO <b>groups.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>support</b> by Spanish Research Agency (Grant number:MAT 2010 - 19904) is acknowledged.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} conformational {{preferences of}} a new nonproteinogenic amino acid have been explored by computational methods. This tailored molecule, named (βPro) Arg, is conceived {{as a replacement for}} arginine in bioactive peptides when the stabilization of folded turn-like conformations is required. The new residue features a proline skeleton that bears the guanidilated side chain of arginine at the Cβ position of the five-membered pyrrolidine ring, in either a cis or a trans orientation with respect to the carboxylic acid. The conformational profiles of the N-acetyl-N′-methylamide derivatives of the cis and trans isomers of (βPro) Arg have been examined in the gas phase and in solution by B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d,p) calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The main conformational features of both isomers represent a balance between geometric restrictions imposed by the five-membered pyrrolidine ring and the ability of the guanidilated side chain to interact with the backbone through hydrogen bonds. Thus, both cis- and trans-(βPro) Arg exhibit a preference for the αL conformation {{as a consequence of the}} interactions established between the guanidinium moiety and the main-chain amide <b>groups.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>support</b> from the Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (Ramon y Cajal contract for D.
