Foley, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> a high-level aide to Aristide, asking if the U.S. could protect Aristide and help facilitate his departure if he resigned.

He traveled voluntarily via motorcade to the airport with his own retinue of security guards, including some contracted Americans. Before takeoff, Aristide gave a copy of his resignation letter to Foley's aide.|$|E

The Girl, written by Gwyneth Hughes, would star Toby Jones as Hitchcock and Sienna Miller as Hedren. In a post-production BBC press release about the film in November 2012, Hughes described her enthusiasm when she was approached about the project while on holiday: [...] " [...] <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> producer Amanda Jenks. She only managed {{to get out the}} words 'Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren' before I was already shouting 'yes yes yes!' to this seductive, sinister, deeply touching story of love and obsession among Hollywood royalty." [...] Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock's crew before preparing a script. She described her discussions with Hedren: [...] "Her wisdom and insights have helped me to put her real life ordeal on to the screen. I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled, as I am, with the casting of Sienna Miller to play her." [...] The film's title was inspired by the name Hitchcock used for Hedren after she stopped working for him.|$|E

500|$|Toronto rock {{promoters}} John Brower and Kenny Walker organised {{a festival}} held at Varsity Stadium on 13 September 1969, around {{the notion of}} a revival of rock and roll stars from the 1950s, booking Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Bo Diddley, and Gene Vincent. They also booked more modern acts such as Alice Cooper, Chicago, and The Doors. On 12 September, Brower contacted Lennon to see if {{he would be willing to}} be the master of ceremonies. Lennon offered instead to perform at the festival, bringing his own band, the Plastic Ono Band." [...] Brower agreed, and Lennon quickly assembled a band. He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison turned him down, so Eric Clapton (who had played guitar in Lennon's earlier live group, the Dirty Mac) was chosen instead. Lennon hastily assembled the rest of the band, consisting of Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White, as well as their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter, to accompany himself and Ono. White <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Lennon, and assumed it was a friend prank calling him, only realising it was actually Lennon after a second call.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E
