25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|E
25|$|The D type was {{modified}} {{for use on}} unarmed, long-range photo-reconnaissance versions of the Spitfire, such as the P.R. Mk Id (P.R. versions {{described in more detail}} below), with weapon bays left empty, and the relatively heavy-skinned leading edge wing structure ahead of the main spar converted to integral auxiliary fuel tanks capable of carrying 66½ Imperial gallons (300 l) in addition to that stored in the fuselage tanks ahead of the cockpit. The <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> were well outboard, between ribs 19 and 20 on the leading edge, because the wing tips were higher {{than the rest of the}} wing due to dihedral, and thus the only place a fuel filler cap could be located. An expansion and overflow vent was fitted to protect the tanks from bursting as the fuel vaporized and expanded from the hot sun beating directly on the thin metal wing skin (which doubled as the walls of the tank). This vent was fitted further outboard, between ribs 20 and 21, in the highest space in the tank, where vapor would naturally collect.|$|E
500|$|Bulleid {{designed}} a new [...] tender which could carry 5 tons (5.1 t) of coal on a six-wheel chassis. [...] It featured BFB wheels and streamlined panels, or [...] "raves", {{that gave the}} top of the tender a similar cross-sectional outline to the carriages hauled by the locomotive. [...] The water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp-type similar to that used on the locomotive. [...] Three train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space. [...] Unusually for a British locomotive, two extra water <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> were incorporated into the tender front, for access from the footplate. [...] The original tender design proved to be inadequately braced and subject to serious leakage if even slightly damaged, or when water surges caused the welded joints to split. [...] The problem was not solved until 1944 when additional baffling was fitted.|$|E

50|$|The early Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman {{cars had}} an {{internal}} fuel tank {{located on the}} left hand side of the rear load area. This is identifiable by the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> being on the left hand {{side of the car}} just below the rear window.In October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car - the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.|$|R

5000|$|Hudson dealers {{also sold}} Rambler and Metropolitan models under the Hudson brand. When sold by Hudson dealers, both cars were {{identified}} as Hudson vehicles via hood/grille emblems and horn buttons. Hudson Ramblers also received [...] "H" [...] symbols on fuel <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> (and, in 1956, also on hubcaps). For 1957, Rambler and Metropolitan became makes in their own rights, and no longer {{were identified as}} Hudson or Nash.|$|E
50|$|In {{the pursuit}} of power, the 4½ Litre Bentley engine had a {{distinct}} advantage. A single overhead camshaft actuated four valves per cylinder, inclined at 30 degrees, a technically advanced design at a time where most cars used only two valves per cylinder. Secondly the cars tanks - radiator, oil and petrol - had <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> that did not unscrew but were easily removed with one stroke of a lever. This saved time during stops.|$|E
40|$|This degree {{project was}} {{conducted}} in collaboration with Husqvarna AB, the headquarters of which are located in Jönköping. The aim was to further develop the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> found on {{more or less the}} whole of the company’s range of chain saws, {{in order to make it}} more user friendly. The present <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> is not easy to open and close, especially when wearing gloves, and under difficult conditions, which creates problems and prolongs filling time. On the basis of market surveys, different prototypes and tests, we have created an ergonomically improved cap of a new shape, which can be moved in the axial direction, thus making filling easier...|$|R

40|$|A {{facility}} and expertise {{has been developed}} at NAL to conduct automated internal pressure cycling tests. The hardware and instrumentation includes capturing {{of pressure on the}} data logger along with strain gage data. Digital data can be recorded continuously during entire pressure cycle, thus enabling to provide comparative view of reduction in stiffness, if any,in terms of graphs. The Maximum Pressure up To Which the Central Shells Could Be Tested Was 188. 5 psi. A Maximum Strain Of 5166 Micro Strains, At A Pressure Of 188. 5 psi, Was Found Near The GFRP Bulkhead In The Circumferential Direction. The Integrity Of The Bulkhead Joint Appears Satisfactory. The Nose-Cone, Tested For Internal Pressure Cycling Between 3 And L Lpsi Did Not Show Any Leaks Anywhere On The Surface Or From The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap.</b> However, After 1104 Pressure Cycles,The End Flange Failed With A Loud Pop. On Inspection, It Was Found That The Failure Is Due To Improper Adhesion Between The GFRP Base Material And The Aluminum Ring Holding The End-Flange. Subsequently, This Ring Was Joined To The GFRP Shell By Bolts And The Pressure Cycling Was Continued For A Further 5000 Cycles,As Required, Without Any Failure/Leaks Anywhere On The Nose Cone. The Nose Cone Was Then Subjected To A Steadily Increasing Pressure To Verify The Residual Strength. At About 60 psi, Leaks Were Observed Around The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> And The Pressure Was Continued Up To 85 psi. At This Pressure, The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> Seal Gave-Up And A Profuse Leak Sprouted Around The Cap This Was Verified Again By Replacing The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> With A New One That Also Failed Completely At About 85 psi Pressure. Presently,It May Be Concluded That The Lca s Gfrp Drop Tank Internal Bulkheads Of Central Shell Can Withstand A Pressure Of 185 psi And The Weak Link,In The DT Assembly, Is The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> Seal That Can Stand A Pressure Of Only 60 psi. ...|$|R
50|$|Vibration and {{low-speed}} crash tests ensured {{the cars}} would not shift or suffer damage in transit. The Vega was delivered topped with fluids, ready {{to drive to}} dealerships, so the engine was baffled to prevent oil entering the number one cylinder; the battery <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> high on the rear edge of the casing prevented acid spills; a tube drained fuel from carburetor to vapor canister; and the windshield washer bottle stood at 45 degrees.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the bodies and frames, Devin sold a growing assortment of accessories needed to complete the car. Some of these items were developed by Devin Enterprises, such as hinges and catches. One piece of advertising copy from 1960 lists a [...] "universal" [...] intake manifold for the Chevrolet V8 {{as well as a}} finned alloy differential housing for a de Dion rear suspension. Other items sold included everything from suspension parts, disk brakes or finned alloy brake drums up to wood-rimmed steering wheels, flip-up <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> for fuel or oil tanks, Borrani wire wheels with knock-offs, custom gauges, and BID clutch plates.|$|E

50|$|Nicholas Faith {{states in}} his book that Murray Mackay, one of the UK's leading motor vehicle crash and safety researchers, was {{critical}} of the pre-1967 Mini's passive safety features, including the protruding <b>filler</b> <b>cap,</b> the door latch, and {{the vulnerability of the}} passenger space to engine intrusion.|$|R
50|$|Below the seats, {{there is}} {{access to the}} petrol tank <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> along with a locker for gear such as a foot pump and an aerosol fog horn. A set of flares is stored aboard with red for {{distress}} and white flares which slowly descends on a parachute illuminating a large area. In case of technical difficulties with the navigation equipment, the crew can revert to using a set of waterproof charts of the local area which are also stored in pockets in the console. To {{the rear of the}} console is the 35 m towing rope on a reel which is used in conjunction with the tow bar to tow stricken vessels to safety.|$|E
50|$|At {{the front}} of the car a new bumper removed the original’s fake central grille and also {{replaced}} the Ferrari prancing horse emblem. The side intake cooling ducts were enlarged and the engine cover was replaced with a glass item allowing a view of the V8 engine. A new triple tail-light arrangement and an electronically operated spoiler were added. A double bubble roof was added, the idea being that Zagato could lower the roofline of a car, but retain enough headroom for each occupant. Other modifications included custom OZ Racing alloy wheels, external fuel <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> and a completely reworked interior including a three-inch rear view screen and suede upholstery. Zagato initially announced a production run of 22 examples, but only 10 or 12 cars were made.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1984, {{there were}} more {{equipment}} upgrades made across the range. The 1.3 base models gained reclining front seats, door bins, locking fuel <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> and clocks. The L models gained cloth door trim, upgraded upholstery, and remote-adjustable driver's side door mirrors; the 1.6 Ls gained five-speed gearboxes. The 1.3 HLEs gained five-speed [...] "4+E" [...] gearboxes with overdrive fifth gear ratios, side mouldings, tweed cloth upholstery and remotely adjustable passenger's side door mirrors. The HLS and 1.6 automatics gained tinted glass, central locking, electric front windows, velour upholstery and upgraded radio-cassette players. The MG Maestros gained electronic fuel-injected [...] versions of the 2-litre O-Series engine, uprated suspension and ventilated front disc brakes, colour-keyed exterior trim, tinted glass, central locking and leather-trimmed steering wheels. The new MG Maestro offered much better performance and refinement than its predecessor.|$|E
