25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of <b>gain</b> <b>reduction</b> independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of <b>gain</b> <b>reduction</b> to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one might wish to have less compression for left-side events).|$|E
25|$|A {{compressor}} in stereo linking mode {{applies the}} same amount of <b>gain</b> <b>reduction</b> to both the left and right channels. This is done to prevent image shifting that can occur if each channel is compressed individually. It becomes noticeable when a loud element that is panned to either edge of the stereo field raises the level of the program to the compressor's threshold, causing its image to shift {{toward the center of the}} stereo field.|$|E
25|$|A peak-sensing {{compressor}} {{responds to}} the instantaneous level of the input signal. While providing tighter peak control, peak sensing might yield very quick changes in <b>gain</b> <b>reduction,</b> more evident compression or sometimes even distortion. Some compressors apply an averaging function (commonly root mean square or RMS) on the input signal before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces a more relaxed compression that more closely relates to human perception of loudness.|$|E

2500|$|The {{amount of}} <b>gain</b> <b>reduction</b> is {{determined}} by ratio: a ratio of 4:1 means that if input level is 4dB over the threshold, the output signal level is 1dB over the threshold. The gain (level) has been reduced by 3dB: ...|$|E
2500|$|De-noise mode is an {{alternative}} to Active noise reduction. It provides for relatively noise-free listening to audio in a noisy environment. In this mode, audio intelligibility is improved due to selective <b>gain</b> <b>reduction</b> of the ambient noise. This method splits external signals into frequency components by [...] "filterbank" [...] (according to the peculiarities of human perception of specific frequencies) and processing them using adaptive audio compressors. Operation thresholds in adaptive audio compressors (in contrast to [...] "ordinary" [...] compressors) are regulated depending on ambient noise levels for each specific bandwidth. Reshaping of the processed signal from adaptive compressor outputs is realised in a synthesis filterbank. This method improves the intelligibility of speech signals and music. The best effect is obtained while listening to audio in the environment with constant noise (in trains, automobiles, planes), or in environments with fluctuating noise level (e.g. in a metro). Improvement of signal intelligibility in condition of ambient noise allows users to hear audio well and preserve hearing ability, in contrast to regular volume amplification.|$|E
2500|$|Compressors are {{designed}} to help the audio engineer to manage the dynamic range (loudness) of an audio signal, or a group of audio signals. Prior to the invention of automatic compressors, audio engineers accomplished the same goal by [...] "riding the faders", which mean listening carefully to the mix and lowering the faders of any singer or instrument which was getting too loud. [...] A compressor accomplishes this by reducing the gain of a signal that is above a defined level (the threshold) by a defined amount (the ratio). [...] Without this <b>gain</b> <b>reduction,</b> a signal that gets, say 10% louder as an input, will be 10% louder at the output. [...] With the gain reduced, a signal that gets 10% louder at the input will be perhaps 3% louder at the output. Most compressors available {{are designed}} to allow the operator to select a ratio within a range typically between 1:1 and 20:1, with some allowing settings of up to âˆž:1. [...] A compressor with an infinite ratio is typically referred to as a limiter. [...] The speed that the compressor adjusts the gain of the signal (called the attack) is typically adjustable as is the final output of the device.|$|E

50|$|If the inaudible radio {{frequency}} (RF) transmitter signal is inadvertently coupled into the receiver's audio signal path, it can trigger the AGC or squelch circuit {{to reduce the}} gain.

40|$|In this paper, a {{description}} is given {{of the most}} important statutory changes in federal taxation of capital income that have occurred in the USA since 1978, and of the changes in the predominant views of academic tax experts that preceded them. In addition, selected quantitative analyses that may have been influential in <b>gaining</b> <b>reduction</b> in the taxation of capital income are reviewed. It is shown that recent shifts in federal tax policy are broadly consistent with pervasive changes in the dominant thinking of professional tax economists, and especially consistent with the well-publicized writings of particular highly visible quantitative economists who hold the newer nontraditional views on tax policy. ...|$|R
