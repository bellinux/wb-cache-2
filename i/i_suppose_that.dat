5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an opera}} for {{children}} because {{it tries to}} recapture my own childhood. You see, when I was a child I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> Santa Claus is much too busy with American children {{to be able to}} handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought to us by the Three Kings, instead.|$|E
25|$|Surely Bentley {{was right}} to be {{surprised}} at finding Faunus haunting the bower , a ghost crying in the cold of Paradise, and the lusts of Pan sacred even in comparison to Eden. There is a Vergilian quality in the lines, haunting indeed, a pathos not mentioned {{because it is the}} whole of the story. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> in Satan determining to destroy the innocent happiness of Eden, for the highest political motives, without hatred, not without tears, we may find some echo of the Elizabethan fulness of life that Milton as a poet abandoned, and as a Puritan helped to destroy.|$|E

25|$|Chester County native Jesse W. Fell asked Abraham Lincoln for an autobiographical {{narrative}} in 1858. Lincoln initially refused, but eventually wrote a 606-word account, explaining that “there {{is not much}} of it, for the reason, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>that</b> {{there is not much}} of me.” Fell sent this sketch to his friend Joseph Lewis in West Chester. Lewis embellished on the short account and published the biography in the Chester County Times on February 11, 1860. The first published biography of Lincoln, it was circulated in newspapers across the U.S. and was considered crucial in securing the Republican nomination by Lincoln himself. The building that it was written in is today known as the Lincoln Building.|$|E
25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>that</b> the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be {{compared to that of}} the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>that</b> the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

500|$|The song itself recounts {{both the}} plot of the movie, and {{contains}} various in-jokes and references therein. One line about lawyers—"A huge tyrannosaurus ate our lawyer/Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> proves they're really not all bad"—was deliberately placed in the song to be ambiguous, as it could either be referring to lawyers or dinosaurs as being [...] "not all bad". The song also makes various pop culture references, mentioning both E tickets and Barney.|$|E
500|$|However, others {{noted that}} if Disney had {{attempted}} to block the film's release, it was unclear on what legal grounds it could be done. Moore took care to avoid direct copyright infringement of songs or films played as part of attractions, and intellectual property law is less clear on the {{other aspects of the}} film. Science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who distributed his first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, set in a 22nd-century Disney World, under a Creative Commons license, believes there's at most [...] "a possible trademark claim, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> Disney could conceivabl bring suit for violating the park's terms of use, but these are much harder cases to make than copyright." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{commenced}} on 20 August 1968 after {{a summer}} of pre-production. Director Ken Turner, who headed the location unit, recalled that The Secret Service became a complex series to shoot because it incorporated three design elements (studio puppet filming, studio special effects filming and live-action location filming). In a reversal to the practice used on earlier Supermarionation productions, location filming needed to be completed first before work could start at the Century 21 Studios. In Turner's words, [...] "We felt that somebody {{had to take the}} location stuff by the balls, get it shot and then hand it over to the director to fit his puppet stuff in. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> seemed a bit back to front but with that programme it was what worked out best." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{last bit}} of news {{yesterday}} morning is the King's anger against Eliza Wednesday (yesterday) night for being impudent to him. He threw a chair at her head and a spitoon also, which made a great cut {{on the side of}} her head. The nearest Doctor was sent for [...] both McGrew and McKibbin arrived. It seems the King told her to come to bed — she replied what right has a dog or a bitch there, which instantly gave vent to his ill temper that he had been brooding some days, and used a word of four letters belonging only to Waterclosets. She retorted, [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> is what you eat to exist on." [...] This brought the King's rage to an instant climax and [...] threw the articles at her head. I had intended to call yesterday to see how he continues to improve, but this domestic fracas of the Royal household puts it out of the question, till a few days more when the King will be settled and not so upset.|$|E
500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records myself, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] And I always promised myself I'd never do that, put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E
2500|$|And {{they say}} Solon loved {{and that is}} the reason, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>that</b> when {{afterwards}} they differed about the government, their enmity never produced any hot and violent passion, they remembered their old kindnesses, and retained [...] "Still in its embers living the strong fire" [...] of their love and dear affection.|$|E

It is as if I were to say: [...] "You surely know what 'It is 5 o'clock here' means; so you also know what 'It's 5 o'clock on the sun' means. It means simply that it is just the same there as it is here when it is 5 o'clock." [...] — The {{explanation}} by means of identity does not work here.|$|E
2500|$|Clement {{said that}} whether taxpayers would have {{standing}} {{if the government}} hired an outside party to hold the conferences for the Faith Based and Community Initiatives program would be dependent on circumstances. He opined {{that it would be}} likely that a taxpayer would have standing if the program paid for plane tickets for ministers, but when pressed by Scalia clarified that he thought if the funds were coming from the President and [...] "he's taking it from a general appropriation that makes no indication it's to go outside the Government so one could not in any way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to the appropriations, then <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> there would not be standing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Danish raids had {{a devastating}} effect on {{learning}} in England. Alfred lamented {{in the preface}} to his translation of Gregory's Pastoral Care that [...] "learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men {{on this side of the}} Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> there were not many beyond the Humber either". Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth. That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige.|$|E

2500|$|The Gospel of John is {{the only}} gospel to call Jesus God, and in {{contrast}} to Mark, where Jesus hides his identity as messiah, in John he openly proclaims it. It represents Jesus as an incarnation of the eternal Word (Logos), who spoke no parables, talked extensively about himself, and did not explicitly refer to a Second Coming. Jesus preaches in Jerusalem, launching his ministry with the cleansing of the temple. He performs several miracles as signs, most of them {{not found in the}} synoptics. The Gospel of John ends:(21:25) [...] "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen." ...|$|E
2500|$|This machine he {{displayed}} in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society. Another logician John Venn, however, in his 1881 Symbolic Logic, turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: [...] "I have no high estimate myself {{of the interest}} or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... {{it does not seem}} to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at Algorithm characterizations. But not to be outdone he too presented [...] "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's abacus ... gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that</b> it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".|$|E
2500|$|At one point, it {{was decided}} that Nova was pregnant, and scenes were filmed around the Page {{locations}} revealing Nova's pregnancy. In the penultimate drafts of Planet of the Apes, Taylor was killed by the bullet of an ape sniper while Nova, pregnant with Taylor's child, escaped and vanished into the Forbidden Zone. Although Harrison believed it was Heston who rejected the idea of Nova's pregnancy, those scenes were deleted, according to screenwriter Michael Wilson, [...] "at the insistence of a high-echelon Fox executive who found it distasteful. Why? <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>that,</b> if one defines the mute Nova as merely [...] "humanoid" [...] and not actually human, it would mean that Taylor had committed sodomy." [...] It was also decided that Nova's pregnancy would detract from the film's ending. In any case, all Harrison's scenes with Heston and Hunter in the sequence of Nova's pregnancy were cut. [...] "There's probably a great deal of footage of it somewhere." ...|$|E
