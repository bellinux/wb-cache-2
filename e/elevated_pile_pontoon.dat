The technical comparison were done between the artificial excavated pile and the bored pile on the pile foundation bearing capacity and the retaining wall effect. The artificial excavated pile replacing the bored pile was feasible, and the construction technology and the key problems of the artificial excavated piles were confirmed. The references were provided to the similar projects. The project summary The Mazhan to laiwu section design standards of the Qinglai expressway are two-way six lanes, a speed of 120 km/h and load level-. It is typical demonstration for environmental protection engineering. A viaduct of the MaLai section of the fourth contract is the pile foundation.

40|$|Past lead ore {{processing}} {{conducted in}} the Southeast Missouri Old Lead Belt since the 1700 s has left numerous large areas of lead contamination in <b>elevated</b> <b>piles</b> of fine gravel waste called “chat” and dried-out tailings ponds. Wind suspension and atmospheric dispersion are known to transport these materials to the surrounding communities where the lead could pose a human health threat through inhalation or ingestion of the deposited contamination. The {{purpose of this study}} was to estimate potential wind suspension rates, perform dispersion modeling of the tailings and chat sources, and determine ground surface deposition rates and potential soil concentrations of lead in the surrounding areas. The results can be used to prioritize soil sampling locations, site air monitors, help identify the source of soil lead contamination, and to help develop remediation plans. Numerous, large complex sources in the region were parameterized into 33 area sources with the aid of digital aerial photos, digitized typographic maps, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, and site inspections. An AP- 42 particulate emission model was used to estimate lower- and upper-bound hourly emission rates using six years of hourly wind speed data obtained from the St. Louis Airport. The emissions model accounted for wind speed, precipitation, source-specific aggregate size, fraction of vegetation cover, and site-specific lead concentrations. An alternative simplified method to calculate emissions from <b>elevated</b> chat <b>piles</b> was developed. The Fugitive Dust Model (FDM) was then used to calculate long-term average and maximum 24 -hour deposition rates of lead over a 200 km 2 region. Soil concentrations were estimated from modeled deposition rates, time of deposition (80 y) and an assumed surface (0 - 5. 08 cm) mixing depth. Model performance was evaluated by comparing lower- and upper- bound modeled predictions to both air and soil sampling data obtained at two sites. The predicted-to-observed (P/O) ratios calculated using the geometric mean of the lower- and upper-bound modeled concentrations ranged from a low of 0. 84 at 300 m to a high of 1. 4 at 1800 m, with an average of 1. 1. The P/O ratios tended to increase slightly at distances beyond about 1 km. These P/O ratios demonstrate exceptional model performance for the particular sampling transect (location and direction) investigated...|$|R

40|$|The natural {{evolution}} of mountainous rivers makes {{the study of}} river restoration necessary. Traditional hydraulics structures like check dams and concrete sills were generally used to control the natural phenomenon of erosion. Check dams and concrete sills are valid restoration structures {{but they are not}} suitable for perfect ecological balance because they are usually made of concrete and create an obstacle for fish fauna. Due to this problem the classical hydraulic structures are replaced by the block ramp. Block ramps are artificial reef with a low environmental impact which preserves the ecological characteristics and morphological continuity of the bed. They are realized with big stones, with a regular or with a rip-rap configuration. The characteristic parameters which affect a ramp project are bed material, slope and height, geometric configuration and presence of macro roughness elements. Due to the formation of a hydraulic jump downstream of a block ramp, energy dissipation takes place in the hydraulic jump and scour is formed on the stilling basin downstream of the block ramp. The scour mechanism downstream of a block ramp is greatly influenced by the hydraulic jump formation. In some cases, especially for low slopes and low densimetric Froude number, scour eventually does not occur. In the present work attempt has been made to reduce the scour downstream of block ramps. As it is clear that a thorough study of the scour geometry downstream of a block ramp is very important for safety reasons and is necessary for design purpose of the block ramps. Firstly the scour depth and length downstream of block ramp using a structure similar to a flip bucket was studied. The scour depth and length for Flip Bucket configuration was compared with scour depth in case of no bucket configuration. Secondly the scour depth and length by changing the Pile Heights at the toe of the ramp was investigated. The scour profile was studied very carefully. The effect {{of the size of the}} ramp bed material was also investigated. Thirdly the scour phenomenon downstream of a block ramp by introducing protection structures (rock sills) in the stilling basin in case of an enlarged channel is investigated. The scour mechanism and scour geometry was analyzed in presence of protection structures in the form of rocks. The rocks were placed at different locations to analyze its effects on the scour process. Two different channel expansion ratios were systematically analyzed. The type of scour formed were investigated and classified according to the scour morphology and geometry. From close observation it was seen that the introduction of flip bucket, <b>elevated</b> <b>pile</b> height at the toe of the ramp and rock sills in the stilling basin influences the scour profile, in fact scour gets reduced. Relationships were proposed to foresee the scour depth and length in presence of these new changed configurations...|$|R
50|$|Before World War I a steamer, the Wakatere, {{ran from}} {{the city to the}} old 20-metre-long wooden jetty at the end of Wharf Road (the old piles are still visible after a storm). The Bucklands {{established}} a private oval horse race track in the flat area near Hattaway Avenue. The front straight was on Morrow Avenue and lower Devon Road was {{the south end of the}} oval. It had a permanent start/finish box <b>elevated</b> on <b>piles</b> 10 metres above the track at the lower end of Lynton Road. This was a location of the Auckland Racing Club. The first recorded meeting was in 1864 when his horse owning neighbours in Howick were invited to compete. In 1889 a totalizator meeting was organized with the help of the Pakuranga Hunt to help celebrate the end of a severe recession. At that time the track was called the East Tamaki Racing Course. In the summers of the 1920s, car owning Aucklanders would make the long trip from the city dressed in their finery to watch the racing. In the 1920s and 1930s well-off Aucklanders such as the Pattens bought sections and constructed baches near the beaches where they lived over summer. Cliff Patten was a farrier who had strong connections with the horse racing fraternity. He worked for Bucklands Stock and Station Agents and became familiar with the area when the Bucklands ran their annual Christmas trip by boat to Bucklands Beach in the 1920s. He built a bach by the Beach on the Parade in 1928.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a survey on bryozoans and entoprocts in the Ria de Aveiro (NW Portugal) are presented. The Ria de Aveiro is a coastal lagoon hosting large port {{facilities}} and several tourist marinas, thus presenting {{a wide variety of}} submerged structures and consequently a rich fouling community. In June and July 2004, 10 stations were selected and biological samples were collected from hard substrates such as wooden <b>piles</b> and floating <b>pontoons.</b> The identification to species level revealed the presence of 2 entoprocts and 16 bryozoans (5 ctenostomes and 11 cheilostomes). The most common species are Bowerbankia gracilis (found in all stations), Cryptosula pallasiana and Bugula neritina (found in 8 and 9 out of 10 stations, respectively). Noteworthy is the occurrence of Tricellaria inopinata; it is well established in several sites of the two investigated channels and even becomes dominant in the Canal de Ovar. This cheilostome bryozoan is an alien species of Pacific origin, first introduced to Europe in the lagoon of Venice (Italy); this record in the Ria de Aveiro is the first one for Portuguese coasts. The case of T. inopinata has been studied in the lagoon of Venice as a meaningful example of bryozoan biodiversity loss related to the spread of alien species due to aquaculture activity and/or shipping (commercial vessels). The Ria de Aveiro, with its important port and tourist marinas, constitutes an ideal site for the development of alien species' propagules and a source for secondary dispersal; thus, improved monitoring of its fouling community could be useful to control and prevent the dispersal of non-native biota...|$|R
40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are commonly}} used to support tall buildings with a deep basement in major cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai and London. The design of pile foundations is often based on load tests carried out at the ground surface, prior to basement excavation. A sleeve {{may be used in}} a load test to eliminate shaft resistance within the entire depth of the planned excavation. In such a conventional load test, however, the effects of stress relief due to basement excavation on pile performance cannot be captured. Systematic research investigating capacity and stiffness of piles with and without considering stress relief effects is not available in the literature. There is no simple theoretical solution to calculate the capacity of a pile foundation subjected to stress relief resulting from deep excavation. The objectives of this research are to investigate the capacity and fundamental mechanisms of pile foundations with and without subjecting to stress relief. Two major research methodologies, namely centrifuge modelling and distinct element modelling (DEM), were adopted. The first series of centrifuge model tests included in-flight load tests on ten instrumented single piles conducted both at ground surface prior to excavation and at the formation level after completion of a 20 m-deep (prototype) in-flight excavation in dry sand. Each pile was 1. 6 m in diameter, 30 m in length and instrumented at eight levels in the shaft to measure axial loads. Two different pile-soil interfaces, namely non-dilatant and dilatant interfaces, were used to model the response of piles in loose sands/normally consolidated clays and dense sands/overconsolidated clays, respectively. Governing mechanisms of pile-soil interface subjected to unloading were explained and quantified by DEM study of shearbox tests under constant normal stiffness, constant normal load and constant volume conditions. The second and third series of centrifuge tests were to investigate 3 × 3 <b>elevated</b> <b>pile</b> groups (PGs) and piled rafts (PRs) subjected to stress relief, respectively. Both non-dilatant and dilatant pile-soil interfaces were considered. During each test, in-flight load test was conducted at the formation level after a 20 m-deep excavation. The piles were connected by a rigid cap, which was elevated by 1 m and in contact with bottom of excavation for each PG and PR, respectively. It is found that the capacity of a single pile with non-dilatant interface is reduced by 20 % after subjecting to a 20 m-deep excavation. The reduction in shaft resistance is proportional to the magnitude of stress relief. Conventional load test on a sleeved pile prior to excavation gives non-conservative pile capacity. For a pile with dilatant interface, dilation of the pile-soil interface induces an increase in normal stress acting on the pile shaft. The magnitude of dilation is 30 % higher after 20 m of stress relief. A semi-empirical equation is established to obtain the normal stress increase for a given dilatant pile-soil interface. Calculated pile shaft resistance based on the equation agrees well with measured data from centrifuge model tests. Furthermore, observed group efficiency of a PG subjected to stress relief due to excavation is only 0. 7, which should be considered when interpreting load test results from a single pile. Capacity of a pile foundation is improved if a raft is in contact with soil. The raft carries up to 23 % of total load at a settlement of 10 % pile diameter. Moreover, effective stress in the soil is increased by raft load and therefore capacity of each pile in the PR is higher than a corresponding single pile or a <b>pile</b> in an <b>elevated</b> PG. The raft-soil-pile interaction is verified and quantified three-dimensionally based on Boussinesq solution. Both measured and calculated results show that shaft resistance increase is up to 100 kPa for the centre pile in a 3 × 3 group within a depth of half of raft width. It {{should be noted that the}} findings are from small-scale model piles with diameter of 16 mm. Extrapolation of the results to prototype must consider the influence of pile diameter on shaft resistance...|$|R
60|$|He took to {{wandering}} {{about the}} settlement. The afterwards flourishing Sambir {{was born in}} a swamp and passed its youth in malodorous mud. The houses crowded the bank, and, as if {{to get away from the}} unhealthy shore, stepped boldly into the river, shooting over it in a close row of bamboo platforms <b>elevated</b> on high <b>piles,</b> amongst which the current below spoke in a soft and unceasing plaint of murmuring eddies. There was only one path in the whole town and it ran at the back of the houses along the succession of blackened circular patches that marked the place of the household fires. On the other side the virgin forest bordered the path, coming close to it, as if to provoke impudently any passer-by to the solution of the gloomy problem of its depths. Nobody would accept the deceptive challenge. There were only a few feeble attempts at a clearing here and there, but the ground was low and the river, retiring after its yearly floods, left on each a gradually diminishing mudhole, where the imported buffaloes of the Bugis settlers wallowed happily during the heat of the day. When Willems walked on the path, the indolent men stretched on the shady side of the houses looked at him with calm curiosity, the women busy round the cooking fires would send after him wondering and timid glances, while the children would only look once, and then run away yelling with fright at the horrible appearance of the man with a red and white face. These manifestations of childish disgust and fear stung Willems with a sense of absurd humiliation; he sought in his walks the comparative solitude of the rudimentary clearings, but the very buffaloes snorted with alarm at his sight, scrambled lumberingly out of the cool mud and stared wildly in a compact herd at him as he tried to slink unperceived along the edge of the forest. One day, at some unguarded and sudden movement of his, the whole herd stampeded down the path, scattered the fires, sent the women flying with shrill cries, and left behind a track of smashed pots, trampled rice, overturned children, and a crowd of angry men brandishing sticks in loud-voiced pursuit. The innocent cause of that disturbance ran shamefacedly the gauntlet of black looks and unfriendly remarks, and hastily sought refuge in Almayer's campong. After that he left the settlement alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for soil and groundwater contamination by uranium mine waste-rock piles is an environmental concern. The {{objective of this}} study was to characterize the vertical distribution of sulphide/sulphate and trace metals (nickel, arsenic, and uranium) at the study site DWR- 39 located on the Deilmann waste-rock pile at the Key Lake uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan. Seven standpipe lysimeters were installed within the pile and below it to measure soil suction at depths between 5 m and 33 m. Soil suction was monitored between May 00 and Aug 2002. Based on these data and moisture-content profiles measured through the pile measured using a neutron probe, it was determined that the waste rock was at residual water contents, suggesting that the waste-rock pile was well drained. Detailed vertical core samples to a depth of 33 m were collected at DWR- 39. These samples were used to define the lithology of the pile. The waste-rock pile was determined to be comprised of a basement-gneissic layer underlain by a sandstone layer. A thin layer with high organic content was encountered below the sandstone layer and was identified as the original lake sediments. Sulphide contents were lower in the sandstone (0. 01 %, n = 12) compared to basement rock (0. 11 %, n = 11). Sulphate concentration profiles suggested a downward migration of sulphate from the basement rock into the sandstone layer. However, the depth profiles of nickel, arsenic, and uranium total assays from these core samples proved inconclusive for verifying downward leaching to the water table. Sequential extraction analyses showed that 75 % of Ni was bound to the residual phase, 40 % of U was bound to carbonate phase, 25 % As in carbonate, Fe-Mn, and residual. These data suggested that the vast majority of Ni, As, and U are not mobile in the pile. In the groundwater below DWR- 39, elevated sulphate concentration was observed and this may originate from oxidation reactions in the basement materials of the waste rock <b>pile.</b> <b>Elevated</b> concentrations of metals (Ni and U) dissolved in groundwater may have originated from oxidation reaction in the basement materials. The lack of agreement between the groundwater chemistry immediately underlying the test site and the sequential extraction and the profiles of total metal assays may be attributed to the integrating effect (i. e. lateral mixing) of groundwater sample, and the heterogeneity of the basement rock in the waste-rock pile. Alternately, the groundwater chemistry immediately below the study site may not be the result of reactions in the waste-rock immediately above it...|$|R
