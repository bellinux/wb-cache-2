5000|$|The 431-cubic-inch {{displacement}} 1938-40 Cadillac V16 {{was one of}} {{the last}} new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main bearing support between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era's typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of overhead valves. Luxury car drivers presumably valued smoothness and silence more than high speed power. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional V belt drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds. The definitive engineering report on the 135 degree Cadillac V16 engine is [...] "The Evolution of the Cadillac Sixteen engine," [...] by E.W. Seaholm, in charge of Cadillac engine design. It was published by the industry journal [...] "Automotive Industries," [...] November 27, 1937.|$|E
50|$|A <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> launch {{consists}} {{of a series of}} high speed drive tires used in succession to propel the train forward. An example of a <b>friction</b> <b>wheel</b> launch is the Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure.|$|R
5000|$|Front or Rear <b>Wheel</b> <b>Drive.</b> Originally TOCA {{announced}} that only front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars {{would be eligible}} to take part. However, after high interest from teams running rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars, TOCA amended the spec to include both front and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars.|$|R

50|$|Further, the 993's {{optional}} all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{system was}} refined over {{that of the}} 964. Porsche departed from the 964's setup consisting of three differentials and revised the system based on the layout from its 959 supercar, replacing the centre differential with a viscous coupling unit. In conjunction with the 993's redesigned suspension, this system improved handling characteristics in inclement weather and still retained the stability offered by all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> without having to suffer as many compromises as the past all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system. Its simpler layout also reduced the earlier all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system's weight, though the four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> C4 weighs 111 pounds (50 kg) more than the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> version (at 3,131 pounds vs. 3,020 pounds or 1,420 kg vs. 1,370 kg).|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{available}} {{with a number}} of different transmission styles including front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and 4x4.|$|R

50|$|An {{exception}} is during positive acceleration when {{the engine power}} is driving two or fewer wheels. In this situation where all the tires are not being utilized load transfer can be advantageous. As such, the most powerful cars are almost never front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> as the acceleration itself causes the front wheels' traction to decrease. This is why sports cars usually have either rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> or all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (and in the all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> case, the power tends to be biased toward the rear wheels under normal conditions).|$|R
50|$|When most of GM's largest cars {{moved from}} the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> GM C {{platform}} to the front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> GM C platform in 1985, the D-body designation was reassigned to the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> GM C platform which continued {{to be used by}} the 1985-1986 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, 1987-1992 Cadillac Brougham and 1993-1996 Cadillac Fleetwood. In turn the 1985-1987 Cadillac Series 75, which took the place of the Cadillac Fleetwood Limousine, was produced on the new front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> GM C platform, and production of the old GM D platform came to an end.|$|R
50|$|The MT75 is a rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> or four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> gearbox, {{depending}} on variant, {{made by the}} Ford Motor Company. The MT75 replaced the Ford Type 9 transmission.|$|R

40|$|Steering {{system has}} {{function}} {{to adjust the}} direction of vehicle by turning the front tire.
