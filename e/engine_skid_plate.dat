50|$|A danger with off-roading is {{damage to}} the vehicle from hitting rocks or other hard {{surfaces}} on very uneven terrain. A typical solution would be to install <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> (sometimes also called bash plates), which are thick metal plates protecting vulnerable parts (such as the transfer/gear box or engine oil sump). Some manufacturers install <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> as standard equipment on some of their vehicles. For many others this additional protection is available as an after-market accessory. <b>Skid</b> <b>plates</b> may be simple flat plates, but {{they may also be}} formed (by stamping or by welding multiple pieces) to protect shaped items like differentials. Fuel tank <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> are a common factory option. In addition to <b>skid</b> <b>plates,</b> many off-roaders install differential covers that will not bend or break if they are smashed on rocks or other large objects. Since the axles on an off-road vehicle typically are the lowest hanging part of the vehicle making them susceptible to damage.|$|R

40|$|To {{obtain the}} best {{injection}} molding process parameters and mold {{design for the}} car B-pillar <b>skid</b> <b>plate,</b> the process parameters of injection molding CAE needs to be optimized. After determining the parts quality standards, we complete the range and analyze the results. But this method can only identify the influence trend of parameters on the test results; it can’t get the best process parameters. This paper uses the modified simplex method as optimization method. We transform the function optimization into the injection molding CAE process optimization. The injection molding process parameters are optimized. We get the best parts injection molding process parameters: the Mold temperature is 33. 24 ℃, the melt temperature is 213. 98 ℃, injection pressure is 80. 12 MPa, parts of the program sink mark index is 0. 5221 %, volume shrinkage is 1. 0143 %, maximum warping deformation is 1. 426 mm, the cavity residual stress is 4. 8333 MPa.

50|$|In 1998 (MY1999), {{the fuel}} tank became {{standard}} at 19 gal capacity. There were some changes between the 2002 and 2003 years. From 1996 to 2002, the side door mirrors were black metal framed mirrors; and from 2003 to 2006 they were plastic molded mirrors. The fit of hard and soft tops is slightly different, and the fabric and colors available changed from 2001 to 2003. In 2002 (MY2003), the 3-speed automatic transmission was replaced with a 4-speed automatic with overdrive. The overdrive can be turned off with a dash switch. The radio bezels went from a rectangle in 2002 to a rounded-edged rectangle for 2003. The sound bar inside was changed to sound pods. The interior seats also changed design, going from a rounder model to one with a distinct separation between back and headrest areas. The standard <b>skid</b> <b>plate</b> was also revised for 2003 {{to make room for}} the Rubicon's bigger NV241OR transfer case. The change from the 30/32RH to the 42RLE also gained an additional <b>skid</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
