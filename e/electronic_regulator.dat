Locomotives were given new 12V396TC14 diesel engines with an <b>electronic</b> <b>regulator</b> produced by MTU, on-board diagnostics system, more convenient dashboards, fire extinguishing installation, and new lights. The leasing company that now owns and lends PKP modernized locomotives funded the modernization. Units with all those improvements were numbered from 201 to 210. Presently, only those locomotives are in use, with the rest remaining as reserve. About one-third of the locomotives have been scrapped.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{changes were}} {{announced}} for 1979 at the Paris Motor Show in October 1978. Rear-seat belts were now fitted as standard, and a manual choke replaced the automatic one {{with which the}} car had been launched. [...] The station wagon {{as well as a}} new basic model, called simply the [...] "Renault 18", were introduced. Also new for 1979, the 18 Automatic became a separate model (with GTL trim) rather than simply a transmission option. A year later, all production models were outfitted with a new alternator that included a built-in <b>electronic</b> <b>regulator.</b> In July 1980, the 18 Diesel model was added. This model was mechanically similar to the Renault 20 Diesel, and was equipped with a [...] engine (rated at [...] ), negative offset front suspension, and larger four-stud wheels. The diesel-engined 18s came in two trim levels: TD and GTD. The basic TD (which was available as both a saloon and estate) had a four-speed gearbox and the equipment level of the TS, while the GTD (which was exclusively available as a saloon) had a five-speed gearbox and an equivalent equipment level as the GTS. Power-assisted steering was optional on the GTD, while a five-speed gearbox was optional on the TD. Diesel model sales never reached thirty percent of the overall annual production.|$|E

The first US patent for an electronic tourniquet system {{was awarded to}} Dr. McEwen in 1984 and to date he has been awarded many more US and foreign patents for tourniquet improvements. Modern tourniquet systems based on Dr. McEwen’s invention have self-checks and self-calibration {{to ensure that the}} systems are safe for use. They are also self-contained as they do not require external compressed gas sources to function. They provide accurate control over the cuff pressure through <b>electronic</b> <b>regulators,</b> and have various safety features such as audio-visual alarms for pneumatic leakage and inflation time. The use of automatic tourniquet systems has significantly improved tourniquet safety. Modern automatic tourniquets are self-calibrating and self-contained.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of non-sintered printed structures {{depends on}} the applied printing process. Aerosol Jet and Ink Jet printed silver structures have been post-treated by furnace and electrical sintering. The resulting different morphologies of the structures were investigated optically by scanning electron microscopy and electrically by measuring the specific electrical resistances. Aerosol Jet printed silver required higher temperature during furnace sintering compared to Ink Jet printed structures to reach the same specific resistance. At temperatures above 200 °C an influence of the printing process on the final electrical resistance was not observed anymore. The electrical sintering with direct current of Aerosol Jet and Ink Jet printed silver microstructures showed lower specific resistances for the aerosol generated structures. Electrical sintering was extended by an <b>electronic</b> <b>regulator</b> module (ERM), which allows the sintering of the printed structures to a specifie d target resistance. While the average resistance of the structures is depending on accurate adjustment of the ERM, the maximum standard deviation of the resistance values is only 2 % which {{is much better than}} in conventional sintering...|$|E
40|$|A {{wafer scale}} bulge testing {{system has been}} {{constructed}} to study the mechanical properties of thin films and microstructures. The custom built test stage was coupled with a pressure regulation system and optical profilometer which gives high accuracy three-dimensional topographic images collected on the time scale of seconds. Membrane deflection measurements can {{be made on the}} wafer scale (50 – 150 mm) with up to nanometer-scale vertical resolution. Gauge pressures up to 689 kPa (100 psi) are controlled using an <b>electronic</b> <b>regulator</b> with and accuracy of approximately 0. 344 kPa (0. 05 psi). Initial testing was performed on square diaphragms 350, 550, and 1200 μm in width comprised of 720 ± 10 nm thick low pressure chemical vapor deposited silicon nitride with ∼ 20 nm of e-beam evaporated aluminum. These initial experiments were focused on measuring the system limitations and used to determine what range of deflections and pressures can be accurately measured and controlled. Gauge pressures from 0 to ∼ 8. 3 kPa (1. 2 psi) were initially applied to the bottom side of the diaphragms and their deflection was subsequently measured. The overall pressure resolution of the system is good (∼ 350 Pa) but small fluctuations existed at pressures below 5 kPa leading to a larger standard deviation between deflection measurements. Analytical calculations and computed finite element analysis deflections closely matched those empirically measured. Using an analytical solution that relates pressure deflection data for the square diaphragms the Young’s modulus was estimated for the films assuming a Poisson’s ratio of v= 0. 25. Calculations to determine Young’s modulus for the smaller diaphragms proved difficult because the pressure deflection relationship remained in the linear regime over the tested pressure range. Hence, the calculations result in large error when used to estimate the Young’s modulus for the smaller membranes. The deflection measurements of three 1200 × 1200 μm 2 Si 3 N 4 −x membranes were taken at increased pressures (> 25 kPa) to increase nonlinearity and better determine Young’s modulus. This pressure-deflection data were fit to an analytical solution and Young’s modulus estimated to be 257 ± 3 GPa, close to those previously reported in literature...|$|E

The definition of Internet access involves multiple criteria and encompasses in particular its availability, adoption, speed, quality of service and price.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} effects of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) on the banking sector and the payments system. It provides insight into how technology-induced changes occur, by exploring both the nature and scope of main technology innovations and evidencing their economic implications for banks and payment systems. Some parts in the dissertation are descriptive. They summarise the main technological developments {{in the field of}} finance and link them to economic policies. These parts are complemented with sections of the study that focus on assessing the extent of technology application to banking and payment activities. Finally, it includes also some work which borrows from the economic literature on banking. The need for an interdisciplinary approach arises from the complexity of the topic and the rapid path of change to which it is subject. The first chapter provides an overview of the influence of developments in ICT on the evolution of financial services and international capital flows. We include main indicators and discuss innovation in the financial sector, exchange rates and international capital flows. The chapter concludes with impact analysis and policy options regarding the international financial architecture, some monetary policy issues and the role of international institutions. The second chapter is a technology assessment study that focuses on the relationship between technology and money. The application of technology to payments systems is transforming the way we use money and, in some instances, is blurring the definition of what constitutes money. This chapter surveys the developments in electronic forms of payment and their relationship to the banking system. It also analyses the challenges posed by <b>electronic</b> money for <b>regulators</b> and policy makers, and in particular the opportunities created by two simultaneous processes: the Economic and Monetary Union and the increasing use of electronic payment instruments. The third chapter deals with the implications of developments in ICT on relationship banking. The financial intermediation literature explains relationship banking as a type of financial intermediation characterised by proprietary information and multiple interactions with customers. This form of banking is important for the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. We discuss {{the effects of}} ICT on the banking sector as a whole and then apply these developments to the case of relationship banking. The fourth chapter is an empirical study of the effects of technology on the banking business, using a sample of data from the Spanish banking industry. The design of the study is based on some of the events described in the previous chapters, and also draws from the economic literature on banking. The study shows that developments in information management have differential effects on wholesale and retail banking activities. Finally, the last chapter is a technology assessment study on electronic payments systems in Spain and the European Union. It contains an analysis of existing payment systems and ongoing or planned initiatives in Spain. It forms part of a broader project comprising a series of country-specific analyses covering ten European countries. The main issues raised across the countries serve as the starting point to discuss implications of the development of electronic money for regulation and policies, and in particular, for monetary-policy making...|$|R
