25|$|Following revelations at the Moriarty Tribunal on 16 February 1999, in {{relation}} to Charles Haughey and his relationship with AIB, former Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald confirmed that AIB and Ansbacher wrote off debts of almost £200,000 that he owed in 1993, {{when he was in}} financial difficulties because of the collapse of the aircraft leasing company, GPA, in which he was a shareholder. The write-off occurred after <b>Dr</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> left politics and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> also said he believed his then Fine Gael colleague, Peter Sutherland, who was chairman of AIB at the time, was unaware of the situation.|$|E
25|$|In summary {{it would}} appear that in compromising his {{indebtedness}} with the Bank, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Fitzgerald</b> disposed of his only substantial asset, namely, his family home at Palmerston Road, a property which would now be worth a considerable sum of money. As in Mr. Haughey's case, there was a substantial discounting or forbearance shown in Dr. Fitzgerald's case. However in contrast with Mr. Haughey's case, Dr. Fitzgerald's case involved the effective exhaustion of his assets in order to achieve a settlement whereas Mr. Haughey's assets were retained virtually intact.|$|E

At an inquest held in Kilmallock Courthouse, Inspector McLean instructed the RIC witnesses not to answer jurors' questions but to portray the deaths of Wallace and Enright as cold-blooded murder. A juror responded to Police claims by boldly stating, [...] "You are simply trying to paint your own story in your own way." [...] The jury not only failed to bring a verdict of murder but blamed the Government for exposing the RIC to danger and condemned [...] "the arrest of respectable persons and the exasperating of the people." ...|$|E
