5|$|Trevor is {{depicted}} as a sociopath in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. He appears to be very insecure about {{having grown up in}} Canada, and takes offence to people mocking his accent. Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems to care about people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother, Ashley Butler, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy, Lamar Davis, Ron, Lester, Wade and Franklin Clinton. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his silence on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.|$|E

I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E
25|$|The boys' personalities differ {{largely from}} each other due to {{differences}} in their upbringing. Guo Jing <b>is</b> <b>honest,</b> loyal and righteous, but slow-witted. Conversely, Yang Kang is clever, but scheming and treacherous. They eventually meet each other and their respective lovers, Huang Rong and Mu Nianci. The main plot follows Guo Jing and Huang Rong's adventures and their encounters with the Five Greats. Meanwhile, Yang Kang plots with the Jurchens to conquer his native land, the Song dynasty. Yang Kang refuses to acknowledge his Han Chinese ethnicity and is strongly driven to acquire wealth, fame and glory.

25|$|One of {{the healthiest}} {{behaviors}} displayed by resilient {{families in the}} wake of a death <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> and open communication. This facilitates an understanding of the crisis. Sharing the experience of the death can promote immediate and long-term adaptation to the recent loss of a loved one. Empathy is a crucial component in resilience because it allows mourners to understand other positions, tolerate conflict, and be ready to grapple with differences that may arise. Another crucial component to resilience is the maintenance of a routine that helps to bind the family together through regular contact and order. The continuation of education and a connection with peers and teachers at school is an important support for children struggling with the death of a family member.|$|E
25|$|Jessica Tate (née Gatling) (Katherine Helmond)—The {{sister of}} Mary Campbell {{and one of}} the two main {{characters}} of the show. She is married to wealthy Chester Tate but separates from and later divorces him in the latter seasons of the series. Sweet-natured, extremely naïve and sheltered, she is often in a world of her own. Her flirtatious nature and hourglass figure make her a frequent target of male attention, but she <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> and loyal to her marriage. She is in denial of her husband's blatant infidelities throughout Season 1, although everyone repeatedly tells her about him and must listen to her increasingly absurd excuses. In Season 2 when she is accused of murder, she has no concept of the seriousness of her trial, flirting and making jokes with the judge. Later seasons show Jessica as still very sweet, but also stronger and less naïve in that she finally throws Chester out of her life. Helmond is one of the two actors to appear in every episode of the series.|$|E

25|$|In {{the title}} sequence, Arthur is shown meeting Terry {{at the prison}} gates {{following}} his release. He drives a white Ford Capri, although it is never made clear whether Terry had bought the vehicle from Arthur, hence their meeting, or if Arthur had given to Terry this car {{as part of their}} ensuing working deal, {{in the same manner as}} the flat that Arthur houses Terry in. (Terry drives a copper coloured Capri in some mid-run episodes, and a silver Capri in several others, and the exact model is seen to vary between different episodes). Terry enjoys a drink but usually responsibly, does not smoke and has an eye for the ladies. Despite his incarceration, he <b>is</b> <b>honest,</b> trustworthy and loyal, particularly to Arthur, although the scrapes that Arthur lands him in make him wonder why. He is intelligent and streetwise enough to disperse situations that his role as minder often lands himself - and Arthur or those around him - in, although at the same time is seen not to be strong willed enough to break free of Arthur's often devious ways of keeping their working relationship in place.|$|E

Homer quickly gets to his feet, saying he does not go for those [...] "back door shenanigans" [...] and promptly leaves, a series of events which establishes the idea in Mr. Burns' mind that Homer <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> and incorruptible.|$|E

For example, the A proposition 'every man is honest' and the E proposition 'no man is honest' cannot both be true {{at the same}} time, since no one can <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> and not honest at the same time. But both can be false, if some men <b>are</b> <b>honest,</b> and some men are not. For if some men <b>are</b> <b>honest,</b> the proposition 'no man is honest' is false.

McGregor explained that he could not turn down the opportunity to come back to Neighbours, as he was building a house and had bills to pay. He was contracted until mid-July 2014. Mark returned on 5 February 2014. McGregor told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he liked how Mark had become more laid back and was not so highly strung as before. He also said that Mark definitely wanted Kate back and added, [...] "Brennan <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> that he's still in love with her – but she isn't going to make it easy for him!"

500|$|Project 86's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by heavy rock and Schwab's [...] "loud, eerie, and atmospheric" [...] vocal style.

Rick Anderson of Allmusic called the music [...] "dense and crunchy", while Albuquerque Journal writer Ron Gonzales declared it a [...] "blisteringly heavy sound." [...] Commenting on their musical style, Schwab said, [...] "Our goal as a band has been to never make the same record twice. The only rule is that there are no rules.

500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E
500|$|Humanist {{scholars}} {{shaped the}} intellectual landscape throughout {{the early modern}} period. Political philosophers such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Thomas More revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government. Pico della Mirandola wrote the [...] "manifesto" [...] of the Renaissance, the Oration on the Dignity of Man, a vibrant defence of thinking. Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work Della vita civile ("On Civic Life"; printed 1528), which advocated civic humanism, and for his influence in refining the Tuscan vernacular to {{the same level as}} Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially Cicero, who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also Quintilian. Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work La città di vita, but an earlier work, Della vita civile (On Civic Life), is more wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which <b>is</b> <b>honest.</b>|$|E
500|$|Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk called Homesick [...] "a {{record that}} <b>is</b> <b>honest</b> and entertaining", despite how [...] "repetitive" [...] and [...] "dense it may be". [...] Nassiff {{went on to}} say that the album wouldn't appeal to the public, but it would be [...] "welcomed with open arms" [...] by the band's fans. When {{referring}} to the album's lyrics, Nassiff called the album [...] "a concept one", with a theme of [...] "the glory of being a musician", which encompasses having to be away from home for a period of time. [...] "The Downfall of Us All", as Nassiff put it, [...] "gets the listener psyched for the rest of the album". Rock on Request reviewer Anthony Avina furthered this comment by naming the songs [...] "Welcome to the Family" [...] and the title track as examples of the band showing off their [...] "wide range of talent while producing a harmonious album" [...] that the band's fans [...] "will instantly fall in love with". Avina noted the album had [...] "a unique sound that has elements" [...] from other bands such as Chiodos. Petteri Pertola, for Rockfreaks.net, [...] "appreciate the way these guys fuse metalcore and pop punk seamlessly together", adding that [...] "many songs are plagued by an overtly formulaic approach, but when it works, [...] Homesick is one of the catchiest listens you'll experience this year." [...] Punknews.org reviewer Elliot said the album had an [...] "undeniable quality", that is [...] "melodic competence". He viewed the a cappella intro to [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] as being [...] "a little gimmicky", while [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] was called a tribute to Blink-182. Despite noting that three of the songs [...] "stray" [...] from a format that the other songs on the album share, he referred to them as being [...] "not very impressive".|$|E
