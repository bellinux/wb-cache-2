40|$|The {{metabolic}} fate of [1 - 14 C]glucosamine, of N-acetyl[1 - 14 C]glucosamine and of glycoproteins labelled with [1 - 14 C]glucosamine was studied in rats {{for a period}} of 24 hr. after these materials were <b>given</b> <b>orally</b> or injected. When [1 - 14 C]glucosamine was injected 26 · 3 % of the label was excreted in the urine, 19 · 7 % was expired as carbon dioxide and 12 · 7 % was incorporated into plasma proteins. When the same compound was <b>given</b> <b>orally,</b> 49 · 2 % of the label was expired as carbon dioxide, with little appearing in the urine or in the plasma. When N-acetyl[1 - 14 C]glucosamine was injected, 51 · 3 % of the label was excreted in the urine with 12 · 3 % appearing in carbon dioxide, but there was little incorporation into plasma protein. When this compound was <b>given</b> <b>orally,</b> 46 · 5 % of the label was expired as carbon dioxide, 7 · 4 % was recovered in the urine and 1 · 7 % was incorporated into plasma protein. After the injection of 14 C-labelled glycoprotein 21 · 0 % of the label was expired as carbon dioxide, whereas when it was <b>given</b> <b>orally</b> 49 · 8 % of the label was recovered in carbon dioxide. The differences observed between the {{metabolic fate}} of the amino sugars when they were <b>given</b> <b>orally</b> and their fate when injected could not be accounted for by the action of the intestinal microflora or by the rate of administration of the material. It is concluded that amino sugars undergo metabolic alteration or degradation during absorption...|$|R

30|$|First, {{three types}} of test formats are investigated: (1) {{questions}} are not written but <b>given</b> <b>orally</b> only once in English and in the students’ first language (L 1) after they listen to the spoken text and (2) questions are not written but <b>given</b> <b>orally</b> in English and in the students’ L 1 before and after they listen to the spoken text. The third type is a control group: Questions are written and also <b>given</b> <b>orally</b> in English after the students listen to the spoken text. The first type of test {{is similar to the}} Test of English as a Foreign Language Paper-Based Testing (TOEFL PBT) and the second type the General Tests of English Language Proficiency (G-TELP).

40|$|KEY WORDS methylphenidate; Ritalin; ADHD; {{dopamine}} transporter; positron emission tomography; chiral drugs ABSTRACT Methylphenidate (MP) (Ritalin) {{is widely}} used {{for the treatment of}} atten-tion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is a chiral drug, marketed as the racemic mixture of d- and l-threo enantiomers. Our previous studies (PET and microdialysis) in humans, baboons, and rats confirm the notion that pharmacological specificity ofMP resides predominantly in the d-isomer. A recent report that intraperitoneally (i. p.) administered l-threo-MP displayed potent, dose-dependent inhibition of cocaine- or apomorphine-induced locomotion in rats, {{raises the question of whether}} l-threo-MPhas a similar effect when <b>given</b> <b>orally.</b> It has been speculated that l-threo-MP is poorly absorbed in humans when it is <b>given</b> <b>orally</b> because of rapid presystemic metabolism. To investigate whether l-threo-MP or its metabolites can be delivered to the brain when it is <b>given</b> <b>orally,</b> and whether l-threo-MP is pharmacologically active. PET and MicroPET studies were carried out in baboons and rats using orally delivered C- 11 -labeled d- and l-threo-MP ([methyl- 11 C]d-threo-MP and [methyl- 11 C]l-threo-MP). In addition, we assessed the effects of i. p. l-threo-MP on spontaneous an...|$|R
