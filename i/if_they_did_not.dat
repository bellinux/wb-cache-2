5|$|Universal {{wanted a}} sequel to Jaws early into {{the success of the}} {{original}} film. Producers Brown and Zanuck realized that someone else would produce the film <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> and preferred {{to be in charge of}} the project themselves.|$|E
5|$|During Tiberius' reign Jews {{had become}} more {{prominent}} in Rome and Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began proselytizing Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments. Tiberius in 19 AD ordered Jews who were of military age to join the Roman Army. Tiberius banished {{the rest of the}} Jews from Rome and threatened to enslave them for life <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> leave the city.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of Congress with being labeled weak on terrorism <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> authorize tribunals.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that {{neither he nor}} his brother would take vengeance on those who had voted against them in 1594, the Diet elected him prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed to Andrew, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|At the 13 February 1971 election, Askin's {{majority}} {{was reduced}} by four seats to the Labor Party under Pat Hills. Morton retained his seat, despite {{a significant reduction}} in his majority to 62.68%. Morton stayed in office for another year when, on 16 June 1972 he retired from politics. At the time of his departure it had been rumoured that he had been threatening to dismiss Blacktown City Council <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> stop blocking a $200 million development in Mount Druitt.|$|E
5|$|Hogg found {{employment}} in a conveyancer's office in York. Percy Shelley initially planned to visit him, but changed his {{plans in the}} spring of 1811 after {{he fell in love with}} a young woman named Harriet Westbrook. Shelley had always been opposed to the institution of marriage, but he cared deeply for Harriet and feared she would leave him <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> marry. Hogg repeatedly made the case to Shelley that marriage was in Harriet's best interests. Shelley was eventually persuaded and eloped with Harriet to Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E

5|$|Most policy analysts (on {{both right}} and left) were {{critical}} of the employer mandate provision. They argued that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> change existing plans, were real and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; {{that the costs of}} reporting and administration were not worth the costs of maintaining employer plans; and noted that the employer mandate was not essential to maintain adequate risk pools. The effects of the provision generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.|$|E
5|$|On the Wednesday at 1:00, Galatasaray fans {{attacked}} {{a bar in}} Strøget in Copenhagen, where some Arsenal fans were located. The Arsenal fans left the bar to confront the Galatasaray fans, {{which led to a}} fight lasting for an hour before riot police managed to control it and arrested four Britons and four Turks. In the fight, Paul Dineen, an Arsenal fan, was stabbed, leading to Arsenal offering fans refunds <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to fly to the game. Dineen was released from hospital later in the day and attended the match as a guest of the Arsenal directors.|$|E
5|$|One Arsenal supporter, Paul Dineen {{was stabbed}} {{in the back with}} a knife, during the riots in a pub, near the City Hall Square. The {{incident}} caused Arsenal to offer their fans full compensation, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to travel and attend the match. Another three members of the public, identified as one Englishman, Turk and Dutchman were also wounded by knifing when the event was still under its way. Sixty people, all presumed to have been involved, were detained by Danish law enforcement, while another 19 suffered injuries {{as a result of the}} violence.|$|E

5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> pay attention, as {{the country would be}} theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E
5|$|A second-place {{finish in}} the 2001–02 FA Premier League {{entitled}} Liverpool {{to participate in the}} Champions League for a second successive season, but they only finished third in their group and were eliminated from the competition. The third-place finish meant they entered the 2002–03 UEFA Cup. Liverpool beat Dutch team Vitesse Arnhem and Auxerre to set up an all-British tie with Scottish team Celtic. A 1–1 draw in the first leg meant Liverpool would progress to the semi-finals <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> concede a goal in the second leg at Anfield. However, Celtic scored before half-time and again in the second half to win 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E

They were forced to flee their homes, as they would have been imprisoned, physically abused or killed <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> After the war, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged high-ranking SAO SBWS and Serbian officials, including Slobodan Milošević and Goran Hadžić, with war crimes committed in Dalj. The killings were extensively covered by German media leading to forming of a public opinion in support of Croatia. By the end of 1991, Germany adopted support for diplomatic recognition of Croatia as its policy and duty.|$|E
5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold their shares to NSB. The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40,000 {{shares of the}} company. At the general meeting the same day, the company was liquidated, even though the two organizations opposed. Prior to the meeting, the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sell. The other minority owners agreed {{to cover the costs}} of the two environmental organizations, and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling {{resulted}} in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing {{the rights to}} Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates {{would be able to}} sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises, and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.|$|E
