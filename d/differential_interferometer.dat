40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a new phase}} jump phenomenon in a <b>differential</b> heterodyne <b>interferometer.</b> When the intensity of one arm of an interferometer changes from greater to less (or less to greater) than that of another, a phase jump of 180 degrees will take place if the phase difference between two arms is prefixed at pi.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{reliable}} detection, sizing, and sorting {{of viruses}} and nanoparticles {{is important for}} biosensing, environmental monitoring, and quality control. Here we introduce an optical detection scheme for the real-time and label-free detection and recognition of single viruses and larger proteins. The method makes use of nanofluidic channels in combination with optical interferometry. Elastically scattered light from single viruses traversing a stationary laser focus is detected with a <b>differential</b> heterodyne <b>interferometer</b> and the resulting signal allows single viruses to be characterized individually. Heterodyne detection eliminates phase variations due to different particle trajectories, thus improving the recognition accuracy as compared to standard optical interferometry. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by resolving nanoparticles of various sizes, and detecting and recognizing different species of human viruses from a mixture. The detection system can be readily integrated into larger nanofluidic architectures for practical applications...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: All-optical {{wavelength}} converters that utilise nonlinear {{gain and}} index dynamics in semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have attracted considerable research interest. In current SOA-based wavelength converters, the relatively slow {{recovery of the}} carrier density (typically several hundred picoseconds), dominated by the electron [...] hole recombination time, limits the maximum operating speed.

40|$|The low {{infrared}} {{background and}} high atmospheric transparency {{are the principal}} advantages of Antarctic Plateau sites for astronomy. However, the poor seeing (between one and three arcseconds) negates much of the sensitivity improvements that the Antarctic atmosphere offers, compared to mid-latitude sites such as Mauna Kea or Cerro Paranal. The seeing at mid-latitude sites, though smaller in amplitude, is dominated by turbulence at altitudes of 10 to 20 km.
