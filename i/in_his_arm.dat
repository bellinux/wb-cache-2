5|$|The French were {{initially}} {{unable to take}} possession of the fourth rate as {{every single one of}} the boats on board had been smashed by British shot. In the end, a French midshipman and a boatswain dived into the sea and swam to the British ship to take the formal surrender. Leander had lost a third of the crew: 35 men killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Thompson three times and Berry, who had a piece of human skull lodged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> The ship had been completely dismasted except the stubs of the fore and main masts and the bowsprit, and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes. Généreux had also been damaged, losing the mizzen topmast and almost losing the foremast as well. Losses on the crowded decks had been far more severe than on Leander, with casualties estimated at 100 killed and 188 wounded, again approximately a third of the total.|$|E
5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ sacks. In 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm. It {{was a result of}} repeated trauma to a nerve <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> that blocked the flow of blood. Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E

25|$|Gee {{reported}} to the Giants' camp on April 1, 1945. He {{reported to}} camp late because the Groton high school basketball team that he was coaching had advanced to tournament play. When {{he arrived at the}} Giants' camp in Lakewood, New Jersey, Gee told reporters that the soreness <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> was gone, and he believed he would be a winner. Two weeks later, he gave up only one hit in three innings as a relief pitcher in a pre-season exhibition game. However, the soreness <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> returned, and on June 9, 1945, Gee again announced that he was again retiring from the game. During the 1945 season, Gee appeared in only two games and pitched three innings for the Giants, allowing three earned runs for a 9.00 ERA.|$|E

On 4 November, he underwent surgery at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa to remove pieces of shrapnel {{that had been}} lodged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> during the abduction. During the two-hour operation, doctors found and removed seven pieces of shrapnel from his elbow and forearm, two of which were pressing on nerves.|$|E

25|$|The grace, strength, {{and safety}} of his marking, {{especially}} at full-back, has seldom been matched; and the consistent beauty, length, and accuracy of his drop kicking was wonderful to behold. He was a tough, tenacious, and fearless footballer, able to play through injury and, {{on at least one}} occasion, played with a broken bone <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> (Hogan, 1996, p.224). Although predominantly a right foot kick, he could kick well with either foot.|$|E
25|$|The Yankees re-signed Cone in {{the offseason}} to a three-year {{contract}} worth $19.5 million. Cone was 4–1 with a 2.02 ERA when {{he was diagnosed with}} an aneurysm <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> in 1996 and went on the disabled list {{for the majority of the}} year. In his comeback start that September against the Oakland Athletics, Cone pitched a no-hitter through seven innings before he had to leave due to pitch count restrictions. Mariano Rivera allowed a single, ending the no-hit bid.|$|E
25|$|Finally, doctors {{managed to}} save {{both mother and}} child. The baby, however, {{suffered}} damage at the brachial plexus, and the nerves <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> were injured. As he grew, it failed to develop normally, {{and by the time}} he was an adult, William's left arm was 15cm shorter than the right. There is also speculation that the difficult labour caused fetal distress, which deprived the future emperor of oxygen for eight to ten minutes and might have brought about other neurological problems.|$|E

Under constant attack, he and his comrades assembled a radio station to transmit information about the enemy's movements which helped the Allies determine where to deploy troops. Wilson was injured twice in the war and still had shrapnel <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> after the war.|$|E
25|$|Carpenter never flew another {{mission in}} space. After taking {{a leave of}} absence from the {{astronaut}} corps in the fall of 1963 to train for and participate in the Navy's SEALAB program, Carpenter sustained a medically grounding injury to his left arm in a motorbike accident. After failing to regain mobility <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> after two surgical interventions (in 1964 and 1967), Carpenter was ruled ineligible for spaceflight. He resigned from NASA in August 1967. He spent the last part of his NASA career developing underwater training to help astronauts with future spacewalks.|$|E

In 2004 the 'Baja Beach Clubs' operated by Conrad Chase in Barcelona and Rotterdam offered implanted chips to identify their VIP customers, who could in turn use it to pay for service.

25|$|Referred {{pain can}} be {{indicative}} of nerve damage. A case study done on a 63-year-old man with a sustained injury during his childhood developed referred pain symptoms after his face or back was touched. After even a light touch, there was shooting pain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> The study concluded {{that the reason for}} this man's pain was possibly due to a neural reorganization which sensitized regions of his face and back after the nerve damage occurred. It is mentioned that this case is very similar to what phantom limb syndrome patients suffer. This conclusion was based on experimental evidence gathered by V. Ramachandran in 1993, with the difference being that the arm that is in pain is still attached to the body.|$|E

In response, Norris stole his father's car and drove into the Rocky Mountains, where he attempted to commit suicide by injecting pure air into an artery <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> He was later apprehended as a runaway, and returned to live with his parents. When he returned home, his parents informed Norris that he and his younger sister were both unwanted children, and that they had intended to divorce when both children reached adolescence.|$|E

25|$|John Paul II's {{body was}} clothed in the {{familiar}} white soutane, over which was placed a plain white alb. A stole, the symbol of ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, John Paul II was clothed in a red chasuble. An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the colour of mourning for Popes. Around his collar, the pallium of white lamb's wool was draped. A white zucchetto and a white bishop's mitre adorned John Paul II's head. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> rested Paul VI's pastoral cross-staff, used by popes {{in place of the}} crozier. His hands clasped a rosary. At first, he lay in state in his favourite pair of Polish-made brown leather shoes, size 44-1/2, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather papal shoes.|$|E
