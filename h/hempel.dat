25|$|The raven paradox, {{also known}} as <b>Hempel's</b> paradox or <b>Hempel's</b> ravens, is a paradox arising from the {{question}} of what constitutes evidence for a statement. Observing objects that are neither black nor ravens may formally increase the likelihood that all ravens are black even though, intuitively, these observations are unrelated.|$|R

5000|$|Willard Van Orman Quine {{discusses}} {{an approach}} to consider only [...] "natural kinds" [...] as projectable predicates.He first relates Goodman's grue paradox to <b>Hempel's</b> raven paradox by defining two predicates F and G to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim [...] "each F is a G". Then <b>Hempel's</b> paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as [...] "is a raven", and [...] "is black") need not be projectible, while Goodman's paradox shows that [...] "is green" [...] is projectible, but [...] "is grue" [...] is not.|$|R

25|$|Some {{approaches}} {{for the resolution}} of the paradox reject <b>Hempel's</b> equivalence condition. That is, they may not consider evidence supporting the statement all non-black objects are non-ravens to necessarily support logically-equivalent statements such as all ravens are black.|$|R
40|$|Physicalism is {{the claim}} that {{that there is nothing}} in the world but the physical. Philosophers who defend physicalism have to confront a {{well-known}} dilemma, known as <b>Hempel’s</b> dilemma, concerning the definition of “the physical”: if “the physical ” is whatever current physics says there is, then physicalism is most probably false; but if “the physical ” is whatever the true theory of physics would say that there is, we have that physicalism is vacuous and runs the risk of becoming trivial. This paper has two parts. The first, negative, part is devoted to developing a criticism of the so-called via negativa response to <b>Hempel’s</b> dilemma. In the second, more substantial, part, I propose to take the first horn of <b>Hempel’s</b> dilemma. However, I argue for a broad construal of “current physics ” and characterize “the physical ” accordingly. The virtues of the broad characterization of “the physical ” are: first, it makes physicalism less likely to be false; and second, it ties our understanding of “the physical ” to the reasons we have for believing in physicalism. That is, it fulfills the desideratum of construing our theses according to the reasons we have to believe in them. 1...|$|R
25|$|The {{spread of}} logical {{positivism}} in the United States occurred throughout the 1920s and 1930s.

The definite diffusion of logical positivism in the United States was due to Carl <b>Hempel,</b> Hans Reichenbach, Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, and Herbert Feigl, who emigrated and taught in the United States.|$|E
