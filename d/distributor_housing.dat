40|$|The {{affordability}} {{crisis in}} the North American housing market has prompted the construction industry to reexamine technologies designed to lower cost through the factory mass production process. This thesis concentrates on modular prefabricated housing in the Province of Quebec {{in order to determine}} if this housing option can supply a less expensive alternative to comparable conventionally built housing. As issues of construction cost are allied with the quality of construction, a comparison between the conventional and the manufactured building industries, at this level, is also essential. Surveys evaluating sales cost and quality of construction have been developed for the modular prefabricated and conventional single family detached housing industry for the Province of Quebec. Fifteen prefabricated home builders and six conventional home builders were surveyed in order to facilitate the comparison between the two industries. It was found, based on the builders surveyed, that the average level of construction quality was consistent in both industries. The prefabricated residential home builders, however, proved on average to be approximately ten percent more expensive than the conventional home builders surveyed. Reasons for these cost discrepancies {{have been found to be}} related to the high start-up costs inherent in the manufactured housing industry, the overall cyclical market demand for housing, as well as price protection for <b>distributors</b> of manufactured <b>housing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose:   The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} and to understand how a company within Swedish fashion industry, namely Frank Dandy, enters foreign mar-kets. Background:   The Swedish fashion industry, defined as SMEs who have produced world-wide recognized brands created by designers and visionaries, has {{got a lot of}} coverage in media recently for its success abroad. Theories concerning in-ternationalization have previously not been applied to examine the latest development in the Swedish fashion industry or companies within it, such as Frank Dandy. A gap exists because previous studies have generalized re-tailers, textile industry, fashion <b>houses,</b> <b>distributors</b> and so on as fashion in-dustry. When in reality {{there is a big difference}} between these units, and what media refer to as the Swedish fashion industry. Method:   For this study, a qualitative method has been chosen and the abductive ap-proach of systematic combing has been applied when creating a case study concerning Frank Dandy’s internationalization process. The abductive ap-proach enables the authors to successively modify their framework as new empirical findings arise and thus match it with the best theory suited to give insight to how Frank Dandy enters foreign markets. Conclusion:   The {{purpose of this}} study has been fulfilled and the authors can conclude that Frank Dandy enters foreign markets through agents and distributors, as predicted by the Uppsala model. However, distributors are preferred over agents since they put less strain on the organization and finally that distribu-tors and agents are handpicked from an extensive international network...|$|R
40|$|The Chinese {{government}} has made repeated attempts to end the so-called welfare provision of housing so as to reduce {{the burden on the}} state and the individual work units. Development companies have been set up to undertake housing construction and the housing units sold as commodities; these are referred to as 'commodity housing'. The author conducts a comparative study of housing consumption in Beijing and Guangzhou, drawing upon two surveys of newly completed commodity housing conducted in 1996. In Beijing, which is dominated by the traditional socialist system of economic and social organisation, only a tiny portion of such housing is traded on the open market. In Guangzhou, where many of the market-oriented reform measures were first experimented with, the open market already accounts for a substantial proportion of the newly constructed stock. In both Beijing and Guangzhou, however, the work unit still constitutes the single most important buyer and <b>distributor</b> of commodity <b>housing.</b> Further, if the analysis is restricted to the subsidised sectors, which also include housing managed by the municipal housing bureau and resettlement housing, a comparison of the two samples reveals quite similar differential factors underlying housing consumption in the two cities, despite their difference in social and economic structure. The traditional redistributive system still exerts tremendous influence on housing consumption, even in cities renowned for their openness and market orientation. Certain differences in the results between the two cities are also revealed. For example, seniority is important only in Beijing, whereas professional and technical workers assume a special position only in Guangzhou. These differences point towards the importance of contextual considerations in the study of housing consumption in China. ...|$|R
40|$|Wednesday, July 02, 2003, 06 : 45 EDT (6 : 45 AM EDT) CDCHAN- 00149 - 03 - 07 - 02 -ADV 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cNThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is announcing {{laboratory}} test results showing that rodents imported into the United States from Africa nearly 3 months ago were infected with monkeypox virus. The findings provide the first laboratory-based evidence implicating imported African rodents as the likely {{source of the}} current U. S. outbreak of monkeypox, which has affected at least 81 people in six states. Since early June, CDC {{and state and local}} health departments have been investigating cases of monkeypox among persons who had contact with wild or exotic mammalian pets. As part of that effort, traceback investigations of animals have been conducted to identify how monkeypox virus was introduced into the United States. These investigations identified a common animal distributor in Illinois; prairie dogs sold by this distributor have been linked to many of the human cases of monkeypox reported to date. The <b>distributor</b> reported <b>housing</b> prairie dogs and Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys sp.) in close proximity at his facility. Because Gambian giant rats often are imported from regions of Africa where monkeypox is endemic, and serosurveys have demonstrated the presence of anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies in species of these genus, traceback investigations of the Gambian giant rats were initiated. These investigations identified a shipment of animals from Ghana, including Gambian giant rats, that were delivered to an animal importer in Texas on April 9; some of the Gambian giant rats from this shipment were in turn sold to the vendor in Illinois. The shipment of animals from Ghana contained approximately 800 small mammals of nine different species, including six genera of African rodents {{that might have been the}} source of introduction of monkeypox. These rodent genera included rope squirrels (Funiscuirus sp.), tree squirrels (Heliosciurus sp.), Gambian giant rats, brush-tailed porcupines (Atherurus sp.), dormice (Graphiurus sp.), and striped mice (Hybomys sp.). CDC has been conducting {{laboratory test}}ing of animals from the April 9 importation from Africa. On June 30, CDC laboratory tests (based on polymerase chain reaction and virus isolation methods) showed that one Gambian giant rat, three dormice, and two rope squirrels were infected with monkeypox virus. Evidence of infection was found in animals that had been separated from the rest of the shipment as early as April 9 - the day the shipment first arrived in the United States - indicating early and possibly widespread infection among the remaining animals in the shipment. The laboratory investigation confirms that multiple animal species are susceptible to infection with monkeypox virus and supports earlier public health actions recommending that any rodent originating from the April 9 shipment should be considered infected. CDC has recommended previously that state health officials place quarantines on commercial facilities or households that received African rodents from the April 9 importation. Subsequent interim guidance ([URL] is available for the removal of quarantine orders and the euthanasia of animals affected by the monkeypox outbreak, including specific recommendations for rodents that were part of the April 9 importation.
