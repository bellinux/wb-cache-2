In the paper is presented an attempt of introduction of heat treatment operation consisting in homogenizing treatment prior operation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>hardening,</b> to minimize negative effects of the T 6 heat treatment on plastic properties of hypereutectoidal AlSi 17 CuNiMg alloy. Tests of the mechanical properties were performed on a test pieces poured in standardized metal moulds. Parameters of different variants of the heat treatment, i. e. temperature and time of soaking for individual operations were selected basing on the ATD (Thermal Derivation Analysis) diagram and analysis of literature. The homogenizing treatment significantly improves ductility of the alloy, resulting in a threefold increase of the elongation and more than fourfold increase of the impact strength in comparison with initial state of the alloy. Moreover, the hardness and the tensile strength (Rm) of the alloy decrease considerably. On the other hand, combination of the homogenizing and <b>dispersion</b> <b>hardening</b> enables increase of elongation with about 40 %, and increase of the impact strength with about 25 %, comparing with these values after the T 6 treatment, maintaining high hardness and slight increase of the tensile strength, comparing with the alloy after the <b>dispersion</b> <b>hardening...</b>|$|E

Electroplated nickel {{coatings}} provide ductility, excellent {{corrosion resistance}} and good wear resistance, which qualifies {{them to meet}} complex demands of engineering, microtechnology and microelectronics. The co-deposition of particles is a promising alternative to deposit layers with adequate microstructure and properties avoiding the rise of residual stress.

40|$|Copper {{is widely}} used in many {{applications}} demanding high thermal and electrical conductivity, unfortunately its low hardness and wear resistance limit its performance. Work hardening has been proposed as a successful strengthening mechanism {{for the production of}} harder copper material, keeping the intrinsic conductivities. In this PhD thesis initially mechanical milling (MM) has been considered as suited strengthening technique due to the severe strain hardening and microstructural refinement induced by severe plastic deformation during the process. Then an enhanced hardening has been obtained by dispersion of a second harder phase in the copper matrix by mechanical alloying (MA), leading to the production of metal matrix composites (MMC). In this PhD thesis strain <b>hardened</b> and <b>dispersion</b> <b>hardened</b> copper materials have been sintered by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS). Firstly the MM behaviour of Cu as function of milling time has been studied, it consists in three stages: flaking, welding and fracturing process. Since stearic acid has been added as process control agent (PCA), its decomposition has been analysed to limit the residual porosity in sintered samples. Several focused attempts have been made and the best results have been obtained by using a fine particle size, decreasing the heating rate and applying the SPS pressure once the decomposition of PCA was completed. However the presence of copper oxide and microstructure defects induced by the severe strain hardening hinder the densification.

Simulated data sets have been generated to test the robustness of this new tool and demonstrate that rapid and reproducible results can be obtained without the need of any user input parameter. The method has then been successfully applied to a ternary Al-Zn-Mg alloy containing a fine <b>dispersion</b> of <b>hardening</b> precipitates. The relevance of this method for direct estimation of matrix concentration is discussed and compared with the existing methodologies. Microsc. Res. Tech. 74 : 257 - 263, 2011.

40|$|In {{order to}} keep the overall length of the compact linear {{collider}} (CLIC), currently being studied at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), within reasonable limits, i. e. less than 50 km, an accelerating gradient above 100 MV/m is required. This imposes considerable demands on the materials of the accelerating structures. The internal surfaces of these core components of a linear accelerator are exposed to pulsed radio frequency (RF) currents resulting in cyclic thermal stresses expected to cause surface damage by fatigue. The designed lifetime of CLIC is 20 years, which results in a number of thermal stress cycles of the order of 2. 33 · 1010. Since no fatigue data existed in the literature for CLIC parameter space, a set of three complementary experiments were initiated: ultra high cycle mechanical fatigue by ultrasound, low cycle fatigue by pulsed laser irradiation and low cycle thermal fatigue by high power microwaves, each test representing a subset of the original problem. High conductivity copper alloys in different temper states and several techniques to improve their fatigue life were investigated. The results obtained by the three techniques are presented and the relations between them are determined. The RF fatigue experiments had conditions similar to the CLIC application, but the achievable number of cycles was limited. The data obtained by RF is extrapolated with the ultrasonic fatigue experiments which show a similar relative merit for the candidate alloys. Based on the results, a precipitation hardened copper zirconium alloy and an aluminum oxide dispersion strengthened copper alloy fulfill the CLIC requirements, the former being slightly better in terms of fatigue, but more sensitive to the temper state. The ultra-high cycle ultrasound data showed surface roughening, which appeared at stress amplitudes lower than the fatigue strength. Different crack growth rates were observed between the precipitation strengthened and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>hardened</b> copper alloys. Compressive mean stresses were studied at ultra high number of cycles regime and they were not found to have an effect on fatigue performance under mechanical loading. Surface damage, due to RF induced fatigue, was observed to be anisotropic...|$|R
