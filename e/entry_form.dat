Watson made his Gardens debut in the opening match of the October 3, 1940. Newspaper reports in November said Watson was frustrated with not getting a main event match in his first six appearances at the Gardens. He appeared in one Gardens main event in February 1941 but his big push came two months later.

When Tunney held an open tournament to determine the number one contender for the world title on May 1, 1941, Watson entered; filing a copy of his <b>entry</b> <b>form</b> with the Ontario Athletics Commission so that Tunney would be unable to claim he did not enter, and then won four matches in one night to win the tournament.|$|E

2500|$|Transfer agents {{provide a}} variety of {{services}} to issuing companies, including: maintaining a registry of all shareholders, paying dividends and conducting proxy campaigns. Most investments in US equities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds are now held in book <b>entry</b> <b>form,</b> rather than [...] certificates {{as was the case}} as recently as the early 1970s when Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) began operations. Thus with the general acceptance of stock immobilization at the central depository, most of the registry function has shifted to reconciling daily immobilized positions with DTCC's nominee firm, Cede & Co. For example, a company has issued 10 million shares. One hundred thousand have been issued in certificated form to {{a variety of}} investors. The transfer agent keeps detailed records of these, and verifies the legitimacy of any certificate presented to it. The other 9,900,000 have been purchased by investors who hold them in book <b>entry</b> <b>form</b> through accounts at broker-dealers (retail), custodians and prime brokers (institutional). The [...] "owner" [...] of those 9,900,000 shares on the transfer agent's registry would be Cede & Co., DTCCC's nominee company.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background When using a {{conventional}} relational database approach {{to collect and}} query data {{in the context of}} specific clinical studies, a study with a new data set usually requires the design of a new database and <b>entry</b> <b>forms.</b> OpenSDE (SDE = Structured Data Entry) is intended to provide a flexible and intuitive way to create databases and <b>entry</b> <b>forms</b> for the collection of data in a structured format. This study illustrates the use of OpenSDE as a potential alternative to {{a conventional}} approach with respect to data modelling, database creation, data entry, and data extraction. Methods A database and <b>entry</b> <b>forms</b> are created using OpenSDE and MSAccess to support collection of coronary surgery data, based on the Adult Cardiac Surgery Data Set of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Data of 52 cases are entered and nine different queries are designed, and executed on both databases. Results Design of the data model and the creation of <b>entry</b> <b>forms</b> were experienced as more intuitive and less labor intensive with OpenSDE. Both resulting databases provided sufficient expressiveness to accommodate the data set. Data entry was more flexible with OpenSDE. Queries produced equal and correct results with comparable effort. Conclusion For prospective studies involving well-defined and straight forward data sets, OpenSDE deserves to be considered {{as an alternative to the}} conventional approach. </p...|$|R
