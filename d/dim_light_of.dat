25|$|The Ross Sea {{party was}} a {{component}} of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914â€“17. Five men were stranded not far away from Cape Evans. There was sea ice {{between them and the}} relative safety of the hut on Cape Evans. On 8 May two of the men, Aeneas Mackintosh and Victor Hayward, decided to make an attempt to reach the hut. Soon after they set out a blizzard hit. When the weather cleared up, the remaining men tried to look for them, but realized that the ice was far too thin to cross, and that their friends had been lost. Now they knew that they should wait for a thicker ice and for the full moon to attempt the crossing. Having the full moon was essential, because during polar night the Moon is the only source of natural light other than the extremely <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the stars.|$|E
2500|$|President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, {{which took}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} {{the freedom of}} all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with {{the adoption of the}} 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: [...] "We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with both}} the {{original}} Dark Fall and the sequel, , Jonathan Boakes worked primarily alone on Lost Souls, writing, designing and programming the game, as well as voicing several characters, designing the sound effects (with Matt Clark), and composing the music (with Ben Gammons). Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as [...] "the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think {{a little of that}} personality would be lost if tackled by a small team." [...] Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; [...] "working alone in the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the Darkling Room {{is the best way to}} approach this game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 16, 1804, {{at seven}} o'clock in the evening under the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> a waxing {{crescent}} moon, Intrepid slowly sailed into Tripoli harbor. Decatur's vessel was {{made to look like}} a common merchant ship from Malta and was outfitted with [...] To further avoid suspicion, on board were five Sicilian volunteers including the pilot Salvador Catalano, who spoke Arabic. The boarding party remained hidden below in position, prepared to board the captured Philadelphia. The men were divided into several groups, each assigned to secure given areas of the ship, with the additional explicit instruction of refraining from the use of firearms unless it proved absolutely necessary. As Decatur's ship came closer to Philadelphia, Catalano called out to the harbor personnel in Arabic that their ship had lost its anchors during a recent storm and was seeking refuge at Tripoli for repairs. By 9:30p.m. Decatur's ship was within 200 yards of Philadelphia, whose lower yards were now resting on the deck with her foremast missing, as Bainbridge had ordered it cut away and had also jettisoned some of her guns in a futile effort to refloat the ship by lightening her load.|$|E

60|$|De Batz {{stood and}} watched him {{for as long as}} the <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the street lamps illumined his slim, soberly-clad figure; then he turned on his heel and walked off in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, Davy, Davy!" [...] they shouted, {{for they}} were in the mood for anything. There stood Colonel Clark in the <b>dimmer</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the background. [...] "We must keep 'em screwed up, Davy," [...] he had said that very day.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, {{just before}} he saw the <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> the {{lanterns}} disappearing down the road, which at this point makes a sharp dip before rising abruptly once more {{on the outskirts of}} the wood, Sir Marmaduke finally put his foot in the stirrup and started to follow.|$|R

50|$|Desert rainbow-skinks {{shelter in}} {{woodland}} leaf litter, feeding mainly on invertebrates.

60|$|I {{was able}} in a moment's lull to peer {{through the windows}} and see the <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> Capri--the glimmer of Anacapri up on the black shadow--the lighthouse. We had passed the island. In {{the midst of the}} babel I sent out a few {{thoughts}} to a few people on the island. Then I had to come back.|$|R

50|$|Skaer {{has made}} a number of 16mm films with the British artist Rosalind Nashashibi {{including}} Flash in the Metropolitan in 2006, which depicts the artifacts and artworks of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as they appeared in a <b>dimmed</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the museum interrupted by the flashes of a strobe. The two have collaborated on the films Our Magnolia and Pygmalion Event, as well as several others.|$|R

60|$|The {{loneliness}} was absolute. Already the few <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> Calais lay far behind, and on {{this road}} {{there was not a}} sign of human habitation, not even the hut of a fisherman or of a woodcutter anywhere near; far away on her right was the edge of the cliff, below it the rough beach, against which the incoming tide was dashing itself with its constant, distant murmur. And ahead the rumble of the wheels, bearing an implacable enemy to his triumph.|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Echoes in Rain" [...] was {{released}} on 20 November 2015, {{the same day as}} the accompanying album Dark Sky Island. It showed Enya performing the song with the female string ensemble - Wired Strings, and a female choir, in Harrow School in London. The set featured an antique rotating globe, turning as the 'long journey home' the lyrics describe progressed and changed from night to day and back; to emphasise, intense lighting lit the church to represent the day (white, bright lights), and the night (blue, <b>dim</b> <b>lights)</b> <b>of</b> the journey.|$|R
60|$|Nelly Bryant {{gazed at}} the note with wide eyes. She was stunned. She took it limply, {{and looked at it}} under the <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the gas-lamp over the door.|$|E

6000|$|Why bade ye else, ye Powers! {{her soul}} aspire Above the vulgar flight of low desire? Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes; The glorious fault of angels and of gods: Thence to their images on earth it flows, And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows. Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age, Dull, sullen prisoners in the body's cage: <b>Dim</b> <b>lights</b> <b>of</b> life, that burn {{a length of}} years Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres; [...] 20 Like Eastern kings a lazy state they keep, And, close {{confined}} to their own palace, sleep.|$|R
5|$|In Constantinople, drums with {{twelve or}} {{fourteen}} sides were popular {{beginning in the}} 11th century. The 11th century rock-cut churches of Cappadocia, such as Karanlik Kilise and Elmali Kilise in GÃ¶reme, have shallow domes without drums due to the <b>dim</b> natural <b>lighting</b> <b>of</b> cave interiors.|$|R
25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is first mentioned in Red Mars; it takes off when Sax creates an alga {{to withstand the}} harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet. In Green Mars, GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By Blue Mars, GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help them better adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better in the <b>dimmer</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the outer planets.|$|R
