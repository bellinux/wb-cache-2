25|$|Building {{the last}} 50-mile segment proved {{difficult}} and expensive. Allen Bowie Davis {{took on the}} role of management. In Cumberland, Dam No. 8 and <b>Guard</b> <b>Lock</b> No. 8 had begun construction in 1837 and the final locks (70-75) to Cumberland were completed around 1840. That left an 18½ mile segment in the middle, which would eventually require building the Paw Paw tunnel, digging the deep cut at Oldtown, and building 17 locks.|$|E
25|$|The Fox River Navigational System Authority is rehabilitating and {{operating}} {{the system of}} Lower Fox River locks between Lake Winnebago and Green Bay, including the Locks at Little Chute in Doyle Park. Repairs to the Little Chute <b>guard</b> <b>lock,</b> lock and combined locks {{are scheduled to be}} completed by 2009. Funding for the bridge at the Little Chute Lock and additional repairs on the Fox River Locks appear to be in question.|$|E
50|$|Initially, canal boats {{could enter}} the Potomac River through the <b>guard</b> <b>locks,</b> and proceed upriver for some distance. The dam in the Potomac below the <b>guard</b> <b>locks</b> {{ensured that the}} Potomac was deeper at its {{junction}} with Wills Creek than it is today. The <b>guard</b> <b>locks</b> and the dam were removed {{as part of the}} Wills Creek flood control project, built by the Army Corps of Engineers for Cumberland in the 1950s.|$|R

25|$|Seven guard locks, {{often called}} inlet locks (numbered 1 through 8) were built to allow water and {{sometimes}} boats (particularly at Big Slackwater and Little Slackwater) to enter. Dam #7 and <b>Guard</b> <b>Lock</b> #7 were proposed (near mile 164 at the South Branch of the Potomac) but never built. In 1856, {{there was a}} steam pump put at that site. Later, in 1872, a new steam pump was put near mile 174.|$|E
25|$|Since {{these were}} locks to {{regulate}} water {{coming into the}} canal, they are frequently called inlet locks. At the slackwaters (particularly at Big Slackwater and Little Slackwater) they allowed boats to reenter the canal from the slackwater. There is no <b>guard</b> <b>lock</b> #7, since Dam #7 was proposed to be around mile 164 {{near the mouth of}} South Branch, but it was never built. A steam pump was later put where this dam would have been in 1856. In 1872, a new steam pump was put 10 miles upstream at mile 174.2, and gave about 24 cubic feet per second of water.|$|E
25|$|Lock {{numbering}} {{changed over}} the years. As mentioned before, <b>Guard</b> <b>Lock</b> No. 2 was numbered Lock 24 for a time, which could cause confusion with Riley's Lock, No 24, upstream. For {{a period of time}} in the early days, the locks were called by letters but that was later changed to numbers. Oddly enough, many of the lock numbers correspond to the contour elevation, e.g. Lock 26 is at the 260 foot elevation line, and lock 30 is at the 300 foot mark, although it is doubted that things were planned that way, and many locks do not correspond to the elevation, e.g. Lock 72 is at the 580 foot mark.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{different}} variations with the 74 lift locks. Note also that a boat going the whole {{length of the}} canal {{would also have to}} go through 2 <b>guard</b> <b>locks</b> as well (at Big Slackwater and Little Slackwater respectively).|$|R

25|$|Athlone is {{a popular}} stop for {{pleasure}} craft along the River Shannon. Lough Ree, the largest lake on the Shannon, is a short distance upstream from Athlone, and many boat companies are based out of the town. For craft to pass through Athlone, {{it is necessary to}} use a lock in the river, which beside the weir and downstream of the current road bridge. The lock, weir, and bridge were all constructed by the Shannon navigation commissioners in the 1840s. Before then, boats used a canal, about {{a mile and a half}} long, to the west of the river. The canal was built by Thomas Omer for the Commissioners of Inland Navigation. Work started in 1757 and involved the work of over 300 men. Omer built a single lock, 120′ X 19′ with a rise of 4.5′, but there was also a <b>guard</b> <b>lock,</b> further upstream, with a single set of gates to protect the canal against floods. There were also two lay-bys, or harbours, one above the lock and another at the upstream end. The old canal is no longer navigable.|$|E
2500|$|The second <b>guard</b> <b>lock</b> at Violette's lock, was confusingly {{numbered}} Lock 24 for {{a period}} of time when that was the end of the canal. Later, when the section up to Dam #3 (Harpers Ferry) was opened, Lock 24 was the lock at the Seneca Aqueduct (i.e. Riley's Lock). <b>Guard</b> <b>lock</b> #2 is also 88' 5" [...] long, making it too small for a standard C & O canal boat (92') to go through.|$|E

Meanwhile, Sherlock talks to Eurus, but she attacks him and knocks him unconscious. The <b>guards</b> <b>lock</b> Sherlock, John, Mycroft, and the governor together in Eurus's old cell.|$|R
2500|$|Construction {{initiated}} {{along the}} Portage Canal in 1849 and finished in 1851. [...] In 1856, the first steamship from the Mississippi, the Aquila, {{passed through the}} Portage {{on its way to}} Green Bay, signaling the opening of the waterway. [...] The lock and canal were improved several times, culminating in the construction of a concrete structure in 1928. There was a <b>guard</b> <b>lock</b> on the Wisconsin (Portage Lock) and a lifting lock to lower boats to the Fox (Fort Winnebago Lock). [...] Each lock was [...] long and [...] wide.|$|E
2500|$|In January, 1869, {{further details}} were {{reported}} on the P.T. Company’s proposed locks. [...] According to the news report, the P.T. company intended to commence work during the coming construction season, that is, of 1869. [...] The company contemplated building {{a total of five}} locks, four of which would be 200 feet long, and the fifth one would be a <b>guard</b> <b>lock,</b> placed {{at the top of the}} works by the boat basin, to protect against high water, floating logs and trees, and other things that could damage the lifting locks. [...] Several contractors were then corresponding with the company about taking on the work.|$|E
2500|$|From Lock 5 at Little Falls to Cumberland (as {{mentioned}} above, {{the canal}} started at Little Falls, {{and was later}} extended down to Georgetown), the canal was divided into three divisions (of about 60 miles apiece), each of which was further divided into 120 sections of about one-half mile. A separate construction contract was issued for each section. Locks, culverts, dams, etc. were listed on the contracts by section number, not by mileage as is done today. For instance, Locks 5 and 6 are on Section No. 1, {{all the way to}} <b>Guard</b> <b>Lock</b> #8 on section 367. Sections A-H were in the Georgetown level below lock 5 ...|$|E
2500|$|Here {{is a list}} {{of items}} on the canal, as a canaller {{traveling}} by boat from Georgetown to Cumberland would see. (Note: some present day items are on this list also.) A typical canaller would know the canal by the names of the levels and the locks. Most list of points of the canal's points of interest do not contain a list of the levels with their names like we have here. Also note that most lists of locks do not include <b>Guard</b> <b>Locks</b> 4 and 5, which a boat would have to pass through, if navigating the entire canal (It was generally possible for boats to pass through the other <b>guard</b> <b>locks</b> also, but that is {{if they were going to}} other destinations, usually on the Virginia/West Virginia side of the river). Also note sometimes there are often slight discrepancies in mileages, for instance NPS and Hahn reports Lock 75 at 175.60 miles, Davies lists [...] "175.35 (175.50)", and Hahn also reports the NPS mile markers are in the wrong place from Milepost 117 to Lock 51, further adding to the confusion. Also note that Some streets in Georgetown were renamed, mostly as numbered streets, pursuant to an 1895 law. See Georgetown street renaming.|$|R
50|$|Between Northumberland and Muncy, {{the canal}} lay {{east of the}} river. Beyond Muncy, where the river makes a right-angle turn, the canal lay to the north. Started in 1828 and {{completed}} in 1835, it had 19 lift locks overcoming a total vertical rise of about 140 ft. The locks, beginning with No. 13, slightly upstream of the Northumberland Canal Basin, and ending with No. 34 at Lockport, {{across the river from}} Lock Haven, included two <b>guard</b> <b>locks</b> and an outlet lock in addition to the 19 lift locks.|$|R

2500|$|Construction on {{the current}} canal began in 1913, but work was put on hold from 1916 to 1919 due to a {{shortage}} of men and workers during World War I (1914-18) and was completed and officially opened on August 6, 1932. Dredging to the planned 25 foot depth was not completed until 1935. The route was again changed north of St. Catharines, now running directly north to Port Weller. In this configuration, there are eight locks, seven at the Niagara Escarpment and the eighth, a <b>guard</b> <b>lock,</b> at Port Colborne to adjust with the varying water depth in Lake Erie. The depth was now , with locks [...] long by [...] wide. This canal is officially known now as the Welland Ship Canal. The Welland Canal's first [...] "hands-free" [...] vacuum mooring was tested in Lock 7 prior to 2014. Installation of the updated systems for Locks 1 through 7 will be completed in 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Little Slackwater was {{a tricky}} place to navigate. Not {{only did it}} {{have a lot of}} hairpin turns, but also just before <b>Guard</b> <b>lock</b> #5, there was a strip of land in the water called [...] "the pier" [...] : loaded boats going {{downstream}} would have to go outside the pier, and unloaded boats on the inside, thus making steering difficult for the loaded boats to get into the lock. If the current was fast in the river it could go as fast as the boat, rendering the tiller useless, and thus, a boat could be almost impossible to steer. One man reported that at the slackwater, they had him sit {{at the front of the}} boat with a hatchet in case they had to cut the towline , and had a couple of [...] hatches turned upside down, so that they could escape to shore on the hatches. On 1 May 1903, the towline to Boat No. 6 broke, with Captain Keim, Mrs. Keim, their two daughters, and Harry Newkirk aboard. One daughter drowned, another suffered a broken leg, and the captain died later of injuries. The rest (including the mules aboard) survived.|$|E
50|$|A <b>guard</b> <b>lock</b> was {{constructed}} {{on the east}} side of the Schoharie Creek. The lock did not raise the level of the canal at all.

Folk lore states that the lock was built using the limestone blocks from Queen Anne's Chapel, which was razed to make way for the canal.|$|E

50|$|The Potomac Wharf Branch {{was used}} to carry coal to {{flat-bottom}} Potomac River boats, and to canal boats, before a canal wharf facility for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O Canal) was completed. The flat-bottom boats ferried coal down the Potomac to Georgetown, Washington, D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia during the Spring, when the water level was high enough for navigation. After the C&O Canal reached Cumberland, canal boats could enter the Potomac River through the <b>guard</b> <b>locks.</b> The original Potomac River wharf had been built by John Galloway Lynn of Cumberland, and {{was known as the}} Lynn Wharf. It ran along what now is Avirett Avenue. It was deeded to the Maryland Mining Company in 1849.|$|R
