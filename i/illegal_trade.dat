5|$|Like many Australian {{cockatoos}} and parrots, the red-tailed black cockatoo {{is threatened}} by the thriving <b>illegal</b> <b>trade</b> in bird smuggling. High demand and high transit mortality mean that many more birds are taken from the wild than actually sold.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 {{moratorium}} ban on whaling set {{under the terms}} of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the <b>illegal</b> <b>trade</b> of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|E
40|$|Endangered fauna {{is one of}} the {{biological}} elements that has a ecologic function as a buffer of ecosystem sustainability, but today this function is disturbed by exploitation in endangered fauna through <b>illegal</b> <b>trading.</b> The legal issues raised are: first, how the role of Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA DIY) is played in controlling the <b>illegal</b> <b>trading</b> of endangered fauna in DIY, and, secondly, how BKSDA DIY coordinate with related institutions in controlling the <b>illegal</b> <b>trading</b> of endangered fauna. This research is an empirical legal one, where the data were collected by interviewing the respondents, and the literature study. The research findings show that BKSDA DIY has played its role in controlling the <b>illegal</b> <b>trading</b> of endangered fauna by coordinating with the related institutions, but that role has not been done thoroughly because of the obstacles that came from the internal and external of the BKSDA DIY. For recommendations, BKSDA DIY is supposed to involve the related institutions in controlling the <b>illegal</b> <b>trading</b> of endangered fauna, and the regulations related to it need to be revised...|$|R

5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; {{they have been}} used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their {{powerful}} physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and <b>illegal</b> <b>trade</b> in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market.

5|$|In modern times, bears {{have come}} under {{pressure}} through encroachment on their habitats and <b>illegal</b> <b>trade</b> in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable; even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the American black bear, {{are at risk of}} extirpation in certain areas. In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Illegal</b> <b>trade</b> routes {{are known}} to exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may cost up to US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E

5|$|In Italy, {{the number}} of {{breeding}} pairs declined from 30 in 1970 to 9 in the 1990s. Nearly all breeding failures were due to human activities. In Spain, which holds about 50% of the European population suggested causes of decline include poisoning by accumulation of lead, pesticides (especially due to large-scale use in the control of Schistocerca gregaria locust swarms), and electrocution. Windfarms may also pose a threat. Poorly designed power transmission lines in east Africa electrocute many wintering vultures. A shortage of carrion resulting from new rules for disposal of dead animals following the outbreak of Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis in parts of Europe during 2000 may have also {{had an effect on}} some populations.

5|$|Smuggling {{was one of}} Christchurch's {{most lucrative}} {{industries}} during the 18th and 19th centuries due to easy access to neighbouring towns and the difficult harbour entrance which acted {{as a barrier to}} customs cutters. Many townspeople were involved in this <b>illegal</b> <b>trade</b> and large quantities of wealth were accumulated. In 1784 a confrontation between a gang of local smugglers and Customs and Excise officers led to the Battle of Mudeford in which a Royal Navy officer was killed and a smuggler subsequently executed. Another important industry during this period was the manufacture of fusee chains for watches and clocks. In 1790, Robert Cox began to manufacture fusee chains in workshops in the High Street. By 1793 Cox gained a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. In 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. However, by 1875 the chains were no longer required due to changes in watch designs and the factories were closed.|$|E

5|$|The skins of wild {{cats and}} other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the {{beginning}} of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although <b>illegal</b> <b>trade</b> and smuggling continue to be a problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the USA and Germany.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok.

5|$|However, {{the trading}} of tiger parts in Asia {{has become a}} major black market {{industry}} and governmental and conservation attempts to stop it have been ineffective to date. Almost all black marketers engaged in the trade are based in China and have either been shipped and sold within in their own country or into Taiwan, South Korea or Japan. The Chinese subspecies was almost completely decimated by killing for commerce due to both the parts and skin trades in the 1950s through the 1970s. Contributing to the <b>illegal</b> <b>trade,</b> {{there are a number of}} tiger farms in the country specialising in breeding the cats for profit. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 captive-bred, semi-tame animals live in these farms today. However, many tigers for traditional medicine black market are wild ones shot or snared by poachers and may be caught anywhere in the tiger's remaining range (from Siberia to India to the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra). In the Asian black market, a tiger penis can be worth the equivalent of around $300 U.S. dollars. In the years of 1990 through 1992, 27 million products with tiger derivatives were found. In July 2014 at an international convention on endangered species in Geneva, Switzerland, a Chinese representative admitted for the first time his government was aware trading in tiger skins was occurring in China.|$|E

40|$|Mainland Southeast Asia [...] or Indochina as it {{has long}} been known owing to its {{position}} between India and China [...] has been marked by decades of trafficking in <b>illegal</b> goods. <b>Illegal</b> <b>trades</b> in Mainland Southeast Asia are numerous, highly diverse, and most likely increasingly complex. Of course, two of the most prominent <b>illegal</b> <b>trades</b> defining the area are human trafficking and drug trafficking, human trafficking in relation to the extensive regional prostitution market it feeds, with Thailand being infamous the world over for that reason; and drug trafficking in relation to opium and heroin produced in bulk within the similarly ill-famed Golden Triangle. Complexity arises from the fact that human trafficking and drug trafficking can be said to be linked in some places and to some extent, whether drug consumption by prostitutes―and by many of their clients―is concerned or whether economic havoc created by excessively brutal and rapid eradication of illicit crops pushes women into prostitution. However, as we will see, complexity is likewise increased by the fact that many other <b>illegal</b> <b>trades</b> feed off these two major trafficking activities and their existing, and sometimes congruous, networks. Some of these trades may, at some point, contribute to one another; they may also proceed, to some extent, from propitious specific regional dynamics (trafficking in drugs and arms in the context of armed conflicts for example). It is this great diversity and complexity of <b>illegal</b> <b>trading</b> across Mainland Southeast Asia that this book deals with, focusing on five of its most pervasive phenomenon: drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, wildlife trafficking and illegal logging, and the trade in counterfeit goods and contraband...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe <b>illegal</b> drug <b>trade</b> has been present in Mexico {{since the beginning}} of the twentieth century when prohibition of the opium trade started. Since then, the social harm of the <b>illegal</b> drug <b>trade</b> in all its forms has been constantly increasing. Today, the most obvious example of the social harm of the <b>illegal</b> drug <b>trade</b> in Mexico is drug-related crime. As a result, Mexican authorities have launched a frontal attack against the drug cartels in an effort to reduce drug-related violence. However, the results of these efforts have not been as expected. One of the main problems that Mexican authorities face in their war on drugs is the lack of a well-coordinated anti-drug strategy to fight the <b>illegal</b> drug <b>trade.</b> Further, the efforts made by the Mexican government are based on a supply-reduction approach that has proved ineffective both in Mexico and around the world over the last century because it is not aimed at the social roots of the <b>illegal</b> drug <b>trade.</b> Thus, Mexico's war on drugs has become a never-ending story.
