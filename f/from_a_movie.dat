5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E

5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} hours of one morning, McKinnon was driving to Ocala, Florida when the chorus guitar riff to [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] came to him, {{sometime}} in September 2008. Upon arriving at his mom's house, he got an acoustic guitar and worked the song out, finishing it within 2 days. The song's lyrics are about pressure when it comes to songwriting and the attempt to make people happy because of it. It was the last song written for the album. [...] "My Life for Hire" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, but remained unfinished until shortly before recording sessions began. The lyrics refer to the music business and how the band were told that they couldn't [...] "be the band we wanted to be", as McKinnon commented. The title [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?" [...] was a quote that McKinnon [...] "thought was cool", from the movie Night at the Museum, while the lyrics are about getting revenge. [...] "NJ Legion Iced Tea" [...] refers to how someone would feel watching gigs. The title for [...] "Mr. Highway's Thinking About the End" [...] also comes <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> The Good Son, while the lyrics are about people attempting to undermine your achievements. [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] is about trusting other people, and looking after them.|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{emphasized}} that his star ratings had little meaning if not {{considered in the}} context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of Basic Instinct 2, stating, [...] "I cannot recommend the movie, but... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie?</b> Godawful and boring, that would be a reason". In August 2004 Stephen King, in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics, including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider-Man 2 as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve. In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences. He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was [...] "unsuited" [...] to such a film: [...] "Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
