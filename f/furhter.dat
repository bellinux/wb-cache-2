40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{this study}} aimed to carry of the {{cultural}} adaptation and to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} Compliance with Standard Precautions Scale (CSPS) for nurses in Brazil. Method: the adaptation process entailed translation, consensus among judges, back-translation, semantic validation and pretest. The reliability was evaluated by internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) and stability (test-retest). The instrument was administered to a sample group of 300 nurses who worked in a large hospital located in the city of São Paulo/SP, Brazil. Results: through the semantic validation, the items from the scale were considered understandable and deemed important for the nurse´s clinical practice. The CSPS Brazilian Portuguese version (CSPS-PB) revealed excellent interpretability. The Cronbach`s alpha was 0. 61 and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 85. Conclusion: the initial study showed that CSPS-PB is appropriate to assess compliance with standard precautions among nurses in Brazil. The reliability was considered acceptable. <b>Furhter</b> study is necessary to evaluate its comprehensive psychometric properties...|$|E

40|$|In recent times, {{communication}} {{technologies have}} evolved {{at a brisk}} rate. 3 G and 4 G networks have already been widely deployed. However, with increase in user number and applications, alternative strategies {{in the form of}} 5 G systems have been devised. Thus, it is desirable to have communication systems which can provide low error levels with minimum delay. DPLL based systems play a versatile role in modern day communication receivers. Popular DPLL receiver packages based on Zero Crossing (ZC) and Least Square Polynomial Fitting (LSPF) techniques have been recently proposed to serve standalone reception in communcation setups. Such systems involve intensive computations and thus show excellant error performance; but are bottlenecked by poor time performance. The LSPF-DPLL system was aided by a Modified Phase Resolving Numerically Controlled Oscilator (MPR-NCO) to achieve both improved error and time performance in another subsequent DPLL design that was proposed of late.

40|$|The {{learning}} {{capability of}} a neural network improves with increasing depth at higher computational costs. Wider layers with dense kernel connectivity patterns <b>furhter</b> increase this cost and may hinder real-time inference. We propose feature map and kernel level pruning {{for reducing the}} computational complexity of a deep convolutional neural network. Pruning feature maps reduces {{the width of a}} layer and hence does not need any sparse representation. Further, kernel pruning converts the dense connectivity pattern into a sparse one. Due to coarse nature, these pruning granularities can be exploited by GPUs and VLSI based implementations. We propose a simple and generic strategy to choose the least adversarial pruning masks for both granularities. The pruned networks are retrained which compensates the loss in accuracy. We obtain the best pruning ratios when we prune a network with both granularities. Experiments with the CIFAR- 10 dataset show that more than 85 % sparsity can be induced in the convolution layers with less than 1 % increase in the missclassification rate of the baseline network...|$|E

Its usefulness {{lies in the}} fact that in fractal graphics, fractal objects are generated by an infinite recursive process of successive approximations. An itertive procedure produces a sequence of results and tends towards one final object called a set attractor (fractal), which is independent of the initial choice. This stable character of set attractor is due to the {{stability of}} iterative procedure, else the system of underlying successive approximations would show chaotic behavior and never settle into a stationary state. However, fractals themselves have a variety of applications in digital imaging, mobile computing, architecture and construction, various branches of engineering and applied sciences. For recent potential applications of fractal geometry in related fields, one may refer to Batty and Longley [24], Buser et al. [25], Lee and Hsieh [26], Mistakeidis and Panagouli [27], Shaikh et al.
