5000|$|On June 24, 1977, in {{the case}} of Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the {{requirement}} that the circumstances giving rise to jurisdiction comply with the notion of [...] "fair play and substantial justice" [...] should apply to the quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> questions. The Supreme Court significantly diminished the utility of the quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> because if the case meets the minimum contacts, fair play and substantial justice tests, the action can be brought under the <b>in</b> personam <b>jurisdiction.</b> Quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> however, can still be an effective option to bring the lawsuit to a particular court because quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> allows to overcome limitations of the long-arm statute of a particular state.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{personal}} <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> English law has its {{origin in the}} idea that a monarch could not exercise power over persons or property located outside of his or her kingdom. [...] To some degree, this was a de facto rule; the monarch's men could not arrest people or seize property outside the kingdom without risking physical conflict with the soldiers and police of other kingdoms. Slowly this principle was incorporated into written law, but problems arose in cases where property owners could not be sued because they had left the kingdom or had died and therefore were not present within the kingdom at the time they were being sued. To solve this problem, the courts created another type of <b>jurisdiction,</b> called quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem,</b> that is, <b>jurisdiction</b> over the land itself, even if the person who owned the land was not in the country. However, this jurisdiction was limited to the settlement of debts owed by the owner of the land.|$|R
50|$|Within the U.S. {{federal court}} system, <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> {{typically}} {{refers to the}} power a federal court may exercise over large items of immoveable property, or real property, located within the court's jurisdiction. The most frequent circumstance in which this occurs in the Anglo-American legal system is when a suit is brought in admiralty law against a vessel to satisfy debts arising from the operation or use of that vessel.|$|E
5000|$|In rem {{jurisdiction}} ("power {{about or}} against the thing) is a legal term describing the power a court may exercise over property (either real or personal) or a [...] "status" [...] against a person over whom the court does not have in personam jurisdiction. <b>Jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> assumes the property or status is the primary object of the action, rather than personal liabilities not necessarily associated with the property (quasi in rem jurisdiction).|$|E
50|$|Three {{types of}} {{jurisdiction}} developed, collectively termed territorial jurisdiction {{because of their}} reliance upon territorial control: in personam <b>jurisdiction,</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction, and quasi in rem jurisdiction. Some sources refer to all three types of territorial jurisdiction as personal jurisdiction, since most actions against property (in rem jurisdiction) bear, in the end, upon the rights and obligations of persons. Others continue to recognize the traditional distinction between personal jurisdiction and jurisdiction over property, even after Shaffer v. Heitner (discussed below).|$|E
5000|$|A quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> {{legal action}} (Latin, [...] "as if against a thing") {{is a legal}} action based on {{property}} rights of a person absent from the <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>In</b> the American legal system the state can assert power over an individual simply {{based on the fact}} that this individual has property (bank account, debt, share of stock, land) in the state. Quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> does not have much function in the United States any longer. However, in very specific cases, quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> can still be effective.|$|R
40|$|Mr. Justice Field {{observed}} in 1877, 2 ̆ 2 The authority [to render in personam judgments] of every tribunal is necessarily restricted by the territorial {{limits of the}} State {{in which it is}} established. 2 ̆ 2 A steady erosion of state lines as the demarcation for state court <b>in</b> personam <b>jurisdiction</b> began thereafter (especially following the International Shoe Co. v. Washington decision). Today the extent of this erosion in the various states is considerable. Stucky v. Stucky is one example {{of the extent to which}} state boundaries have yielded to the pressure to expand the state courts 2 ̆ 7 personal <b>jurisdiction.</b> <b>In</b> that case the Nebraska Supreme Court held interalia that, under the given fact situation, a nonresident defendant in a divorce action can be made amenable to a personal judgment for alimony, child support, and attorney 2 ̆ 7 s cost. This holding is unique in that Nebraska has no specific statute providing for this result, and few other states have arrived at this judicial conclusion without a specific statute allowing such a procedure. This article analyzes the Nebraska decision by discussing three relevant areas: (1) the facts leading to the result in the instant case, (2) the bases for divorce <b>jurisdiction</b> (both <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> and <b>in</b> personam) that have been accepted in Nebraska and elsewhere, and (3) the court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion on the Stucky fact pattern relating to the facts and the traditional bases for divorce <b>jurisdiction.</b> The article <b>in</b> conclusion evinces a method of reaching the same result for the case with a more restricted holding; predicts some possible ramifications of Stucky; and finally, suggests some legislation that would crystallize the new law in this area...|$|R
40|$|This Article closely {{examines}} the rationale offered {{for the new}} quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and concludes that it cannot withstand careful analysis. Courts have explained that the new theory of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is necessary to fill gaps in the state 2 ̆ 7 s long arm statute. However, gaps in a long arm statute can be filled by legislative amendments which can provide <b>in</b> personam <b>jurisdiction</b> up to the full extent permitted by due process. In fact, long arm statutes have steadily expanded {{over the last decade}} to take up the slack left by Shaffer. <b>In</b> personam <b>jurisdiction</b> under a long arm statute is far preferable to the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Indeed, given its reliance on attachment, its limited res judicata effect, and its vague and uncertain standards, the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> may very well be unconstitutional and is surely bad policy. Moreover, {{the manner in which the}} new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> has been unilaterally forged by courts violates separation of powers. This Article argues, therefore, that state courts should not succumb to the temptation to embrace the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and that it should be repudiated in New York and the other states that follow it. This Article is divided into three parts. Part I discusses the development of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and {{examines the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Shaffer. Part II surveys the use of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> the states since Shaffer. It traces and analyzes the growth of the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> doctrine, considers the causes of this development, and contrasts the new doctrine with the developments in the large majority of states that have not used quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> since Shaffer. Part III considers the contemporary validity of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> and demonstrates that it is no longer a valid jurisdictional device. The Article concludes that the new quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> threatens to resuscitate a doctrine that, after honorable service, deserves retirement...|$|R
50|$|The {{form of the}} styling of this case—the {{defendant}} {{being an}} object, rather than a legal person—is {{because this is a}} <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> (power over objects) case, rather than the more familiar in personam (over persons) case. In current US legal practice, in rem is most widely used in the area of asset forfeiture, frequently in relation to controlled substances offenses. In rem forfeiture cases allow property (in this case, $124,700 in cash) to be directly sued by and forfeited to the government, without either just compensation or the possessor (and presumptive owner) being convicted of a crime.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{often and}} familiarly, {{defendants}} are persons: either natural persons (actual human beings) or juridical persons (persona fiction) under the legal fiction of treating organizations as persons. But a defendant {{may be an}} object, {{in which case the}} object itself is the direct subject of the action. When a court has jurisdiction over an object, it is said to have <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem.</b> An example of an in rem case is United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola (1916), where the defendant was not The Coca-Cola Company itself, but rather [...] "Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola". In current US legal practice, in rem suits are primarily asset forfeiture cases, based on drug laws, as in USA v. $124,700 (2006).|$|E
50|$|In rem {{jurisdiction}} {{referred to}} jurisdiction over a {{particular piece of}} property, most commonly real estate or land. Certain cases, notably government suits for unpaid property taxes, proceed not against an individual but against their property directly. Under territorial <b>jurisdiction,</b> <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> jurisdiction could be exercised by the courts of a state by seizing the property in question. Since an actual tract of land could not literally be brought into a courtroom as a person could, this was effected by giving notice upon the real property itself. In rem jurisdiction was thus supported by {{the assumption that the}} owner of that property, having a concrete economic interest in the property, had a duty to look after the affairs of their property, and would be notified of the pending case by such seizure. In rem jurisdiction was limited to deciding issues regarding the specific property in question.|$|E
50|$|Extension of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> led {{to extreme}} results that {{threatened}} {{the justification for}} the <b>jurisdiction.</b> Bearing <b>in</b> mind that territorial <b>jurisdiction</b> existed <b>in</b> a pre-industrial society where transportation across the country was difficult, long, and potentially treacherous, and consider the hypothetical wherein Alice owes Bob money, and Bob owes Carmel, a resident of New York, money. Carmel seeks to recover on Bob's debt to Carmel, however cannot do so because Bob avoids Carmel by travelling to California. Alice, however, happens to travel through New York. Carmel serves notice upon Alice, and attaches Alice's debt to Bob (considered to be property within the state) to the proceeding. Alice can no more certainly provide notice to Bob in California than Carmel could provide, and the transient and involuntary exposure of Bob to being hauled into court in New York by this attachment seems to erode the original rationale of quasi <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>rem</b> asset {{recovery}} has been controversial and {{the fairness of}} the procedures has been questioned. Prior to 2000 in the United States, for example, the burden of proof was on the property owner to prove that his property was not derived from, or used to commit, a criminal offense, and there was no remedy for [...] "innocent owners" [...] who were without fault concerning the illegal use of their property. Remedial legislation enacted in 2000, however, addressed these concerns and Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture has become a standard part of law enforcement in the U.S., yielding US$1.5b annually in asset recoveries. While encouraged in UNCAC, adapting domestic law to create a legal basis for <b>in</b> <b>rem</b> recoveries is not required of state parties.
