5|$|During the 1848 revolution, San Martin left Paris {{and moved}} to Boulogne-sur-Mer, a small city in {{northern}} France. He was almost blind and had many health problems because of his advanced age, but continued to write letters and keep <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> news from South America. Shortly after receiving {{the news of the}} Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade, he died, three o'clock on 17 August 1850.|$|E

5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects {{as diverse as the}} death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mau {{attempted}} to verify his navigational {{knowledge of the}} wider Pacific by working as a seaman on an inter-island ship run by the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked together on a project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the topic and kept <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anthropologist Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation. When McCoy's assignment on Satawal ended, he asked Pialug {{if he wanted to}} come to Hawaii with him.|$|E

40|$|The cold fission {{configuration}} {{after the}} preformation of the fragments resembles a short-lived dinuclear or quasi-molecular system. The most conceivable scission configuration {{is given by}} two fission fragments <b>in</b> <b>touching</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> symmetry axes aligned (pole-pole orientation). This conclusion {{was based on the}} simple argument that this configuration offers the optimal tunneling time, i. e. the difference between the Coulomb barrier and the decay energy Q is minimal. Other orientations are apparently precluded in cold spontaneous fission and should be regarded as quasi-fission doorways in the synthesis of superheavy elements by cold fusion. ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{differences}} in approaches to religious art, stylistic developments passed about as quickly across religious divisions as within the two [...] "blocs". Artistically Rome remained <b>in</b> closer <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands than <b>with</b> Spain.|$|R
5|$|Many Welsh {{painters}} gravitated {{towards the}} art capitals of Europe. Augustus John {{and his sister}} Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales {{for most of their}} lives, while remaining <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{for running}} the {{university}} is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university's statutes and charter, {{with the exception of}} academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members to court and one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum for discussion and to ensure graduates stay <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> university.|$|E
5|$|The Czech revolutionary {{network in}} Europe {{also had a}} role in the {{uncovering}} of Bagha Jatin's plans. The network was <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots. The American network, headed by E. V. Voska, was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Voska had begun working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities.|$|E

5|$|This episode {{originated}} as {{a script}} from freelance writer Scott Kaufer, {{who was an}} acquaintance of Chris Carter and former employee of California magazine and Warner Bros comedy development department. Chris Carter rewrote the script, which included the addition of Barnett's salamander hand. Fox's standards and practices department fought with the producers over the scene where Barnett strangles Reggie Purdue, {{and as a result}} the producers were forced to reduce the length of the scene. The footage of the young girl with progeria was filmed after the production crew contacted the Progeria Society and were put <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> family of Courtney Arciaga, who was a young girl with the disease. She and her family were fans of the series, and were flown from their San Diego home to Vancouver to shoot the scene.|$|E
5|$|When V-E Day {{arrived in}} early May 1945, Chappuis and his crewmates stayed in Asola for a week-long celebration. On {{the night the}} war ended, {{residents}} of Asola removed the seats from the town's theater for a victory ball. While two orchestras played onstage, the liberated townspeople toasted the Americans, and Chappuis danced with the Ugolinis' daughters. When Chappuis returned to the United States, he stayed <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ugolinis and sent them weekly food packages. Chappuis also stayed in touch with Comucci, the resistance leader who rescued him. In 1974, Chappuis returned to Italy to meet with Comucci {{for the first time}} in 20years. And in August 1975, Comucci and his wife traveled to Michigan to visit Chappuis.|$|E
5|$|Developmental stages began for {{the film}} midway through the series' first season {{production}} in January 1998. Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them {{a slice of the}} lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. A large part of Parker and Stone's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R-rated, to keep <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> series' humor and its roots, the short The Spirit of Christmas. Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective and do something other than a simple movie-length version of a regular episode. Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down, the two won the battle for a more mature rating.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 5/6 August, {{infantry}} in the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade and 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade were at Abu Hamra, the 127th (Manchester) Brigade (42nd Division) at Hod el Enna, the 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade (42nd Division) on its left <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, (52nd Division) which had its left on Redoubt No. 21. The next morning, infantry in the 42nd Division was ordered to advance eastwards at 04:00 and occupy a line from Bir el Mamluk to Bir Katia, while the 52nd (Lowland) Division was to advance from Abu Hamra and prolong the infantry line of the 42nd Division to the north-east. Although they carried out their orders during their two-day march from Pelusium Station to Katia, infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade lost 800 men, victims to thirst and the sun; other infantry brigades suffered similarly. It {{became clear that the}} infantry could not go on, and they ceased to be employed in the advance. Indeed, it was necessary for the Bikanir Camel Corps and Yeomanry detachments, as well as the medical services, to search the desert for those who had been left behind.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's first match {{after the}} final was against Arsenal, a match the club needed to win to stay <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> top four. Two goals from Robin van Persie, after Liverpool had scored {{in the first half}} meant that Liverpool lost 2–1 and were 10 points behind the team in 4th place, which would ensure {{qualification}} for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Liverpool's league form continued to falter {{after the final}}; they won four of their last thirteen matches and ended the season in eighth place. Despite their poor league form, Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup against Chelsea. But they were unable to win a second trophy and lost 2–1. Cardiff played West Ham United in their first match after the final, which they lost 2–0. Despite the loss, they only needed to win one more in their remaining thirteen matches to finish in 6th place and qualify for the Championship playoffs. They faced third placed West Ham United, in the playoffs, which were contested over two-legs, with one at each team's home ground. Cardiff were unable to secure a second Wembley final, as West Ham United won 5–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} was mobilised in August 1914 in the 1st South Western Mounted Brigade, but did {{not proceed}} to France until December 1915. In May 1916, two squadrons joined the XV Corps cavalry unit, with two further squadrons joining IX Corps Cavalry regiment. During 1916–17, duties mainly involved policing, traffic control, despatch riding and similar activities. In March 1917, the regiment played its only part in the War as horsed cavalry, during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. Over an eleven-day period, German forces retreated 20–25 miles to prepared positions. The RWY formed part of the advanced guard of the British Army, attempting to keep <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German rearguards, but this was difficult owing to the broken {{nature of the ground}} behind the original German lines. Contact was made several times with Uhlans and a lance captured in one of these engagements is still in possession of the regiment.|$|E

5|$|In late 1962, Ray Davies {{left home}} {{to study at}} Hornsey College of Art. He pursued {{interests}} in subjects such as film, sketching, theatre and music such as jazz and blues. When Blues Incorporated played at the college in December, he asked advice from Alexis Korner, who recommended Giorgio Gomelsky, the former Yardbirds manager, who put Davies <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Soho-based Dave Hunt Band, a professional group of musicians who played jazz and R A {{few days after the}} Ray Davies Quartet supported Cyril Stapleton at the Lyceum Ballroom on New Years Eve, Davies, while still remaining in the Quartet, joined the Dave Hunt Band which briefly included Charlie Watts on drums. In February 1963, Davies left Dave Hunt to join the Hamilton King Band (also known as the Blues Messengers), which had Peter Bardens as pianist. At the end of the spring term he left Hornsey College with a view to study film at the Central School of Art and Design, around this time the Quartet changed their name to the Ramrods. In June, the Hamilton King Band broke up, though the Ramrods kept going, performing under several other names, including the Pete Quaife Band, and the Bo-Weevils, before (temporarily) settling on the Ravens. The fledgling group hired two managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace, and in late 1963 former pop singer Larry Page became their third manager. American record producer Shel Talmy began working with the band, and the Beatles' promoter, Arthur Howes, was retained to schedule the Ravens' live shows. The group unsuccessfully auditioned for various record labels until early 1964, when Talmy secured them a contract with Pye Records. During this period they had acquired a new drummer, Mickey Willet; however, Willet left the band shortly before they signed to Pye. The Ravens invited Mick Avory to replace him after seeing an advertisement Avory had placed in Melody Maker. Avory had a background in jazz drumming and had played one gig with the fledgling Rolling Stones.|$|E
