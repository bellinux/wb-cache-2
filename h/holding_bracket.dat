This is 1.5m from the northern edge of the building with 4.18m between the top of the brick wall and the top of the outlet. The diameter of the outlet is approximately 30 cm. The corrugated roof sheeting at the centre of the eastern wall has been cut back in two places and the metal in between bent down, indicating the former position of the chimney. A flat piece of iron attached to the left of this is probably the remains of a <b>holding</b> <b>bracket</b> for the chimney. Looking inside through the broken bricks on the western wall, it is possible to see a second matching flue outlet at a corresponding distance from the southern edge of the building. At a lower level, between these round outlets and the northern and southern walls, are two square holes indicating the flue inlets. Although no longer attached to the inlets and outlets, the remains of two iron flues still lie on the dirt floor, running across the barn and back again. They appear to be made out of iron sheeting fashioned into round pipes with telescopic sleeves joined together to form the returns. Some remnants of timber tiers are also evident, mainly along the northern wall. These tiers are made of bush saplings.|$|E

40|$|The {{calibration}} {{and improvement}} of the Cal Poly supersonic wind tunnel was performed {{in order to create}} a fully functional facility for supersonic testing. While investigating possible shocks present in the wind tunnel, it was discovered that the real concern was not the tunnel but the measurement systems. Both measurement systems, pitot tube and Schlieren, were evaluated and were found to be deficient. The pitot system had so much play in it that it bent backward every time the tunnel was run invalidating the results, and giving false shock data. The Schlieren system was missing one vital component to make it work. By definition the Schlieren was not a Schlieren because it was missing a primary light barrier. Furthermore, once the Schlieren component deficiency was corrected, the architecture of the device impeded use with the tunnel because of vibration limitations. The pitot system was corrected by stiffening the <b>holding</b> <b>bracket</b> and also installing a cross bar that limited horizontal movement. Moreover, the inner converging-diverging section was cleaned, smoothed out, and finally aligned and shaped correctly in order to eliminate and lessen probability of shocks. The experiment was also intended to be used as an instructional tool for undergraduate students at Cal Poly. Students will be able to measure a shock using a 15 degree wedge, a pitot measurement system, and the ability to see a shadowgraph of the shock itself...|$|E

We are all able to recognize that some bodies are hotter than others, but our temperature sense is qualitative rather than quantitative and is capable of only a limited range.

The {{purpose of the}} test is to evaluate the monitor's performance as a mobile instrument capable of detecting alpha and/or beta contamination that may exist {{on a flat surface}} such as a floor. The monitor consists of a large area scintillation probe (600 cm{sup 2 }) and a rate meter mounted on heavy-duty wheels with a 22 mm separation between the monitored surface and the probe. Performance was evaluated under normal and severe environmental conditions in terms of temperature and humidity variations, and exposure to RF and magnetic fields. Sensitivity measurements were also made to determine the probe's efficiency for detecting alpha and beta contamination. The overall performance of the floor monitor is considered satisfactory under the various environmental conditions with no major problems observed. The monitor is approximately 50 % efficiency for {sup 90 }Sr/{sup 90 }Y with the source placed in contact with the detector's protective grille (0 mm) and at a distance of 22 mm.

As installed, the machine holds one pre-tensioned panel at 25 -degrees from horizontal. Currently, single or two panel machines are available, and can be manufactured at the deck angle required for optimum performance. The effective screen cloth surface area on the pre-tensioned panels was 43 " wide by 34 " long, and the feed stream was distributed evenly along the 43 " wide surface. The panel installation system was very simple, consisting of six cams used to <b>hold</b> an edge <b>bracket</b> onto the panel. A single individual can change a panel {{in just a few}} minutes. The scope of work for this project follows the pattern set in Part 1, in which five tests were completed on each of two feed samples, one from Hibbing Taconite, and one from Northshore Mining. The scope of work for Part 2 also includes silica and magnetic iron assays on head samples as well as on each size fraction. Otherwise, the test plan was identical to the previous part. For each material, initial tests were completed to achieve the established separation criteria as in Part 1. These criteria were to achieve a split at near 100 microns for the Hibbing Taconite material, and to achieve an undersize grade close to 90 % - 325 mesh for the Northshore Mining material. Once the panel was selected and other operating issues were resolved, a formal test sequence was conducted using two values for feed rate and two values of feed solids that were just higher and just lower than in the initial tests. The idea was to bracket the optimum separation and measure the variation in screen performance as these two parameters varied. As seen in Table 1, the four tests were completed in a 2 x 2 pattern, and a fifth test was a repetition of one of the first four in order to measure experimental error.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This {{dissertation}} provides {{insights into}} the impact of differential taxation of financial assets on household portfolio decisions. To address endogeneity of household marginal tax rates, it exploits the structural tax rate changes created by the Bush-era tax acts in 2001 and 2003. In the first chapter, Taxation and Household Asset Location and Allocation: Evidence from the Bush Tax Acts, examines the effects of different tax treatments across different financial assets on household asset location and allocation decisions in taxable and tax-deferred accounts. The empirical results, based on the Survey of Consumer Finances data, indicate that households with greater tax rate differentials between interest and capital gains hold significantly lower shares of bonds in taxable accounts and greater shares of bonds in tax-deferred accounts by "risk-preserving" portfolio changes. These households also hold significantly more shares of stocks in their taxable portfolio. The second chapter, Dividend Taxation and Households' Dividend Portfolio Decisions: Evidence from the 2003 Bush Tax Act, examines how the different tax treatments across different types of financial income affect households' portfolio decisions. The empirical results, based on the Public Use Tax File, suggest that households in the upper tax <b>bracket</b> <b>hold</b> significantly greater shares of qualified dividends in their dividend income, whereas the preferential tax treatment and 60 -day holding period required of qualified dividends significantly hamper households' capital gains realization in the short run. However, the significant effect of the preferential tax treatment of long-term capital gains over dividends on households' income composition disappears after the 2003 tax act. The third chapter, Effects of Uncertain Tax Rates on Households' Financial Decisions: Evidence from the Bush Tax Acts, investigates how tax rate uncertainty affects households' demand for dividend yields. During 2008 − 2010, persistent political debates and the late enactment of the tax cut extension creates great uncertainty for high-income households regarding their future tax rates. Empirical results indicate that high-income households significantly lower their dividend yields {{during the period of}} uncertainty because they face the potential of increased tax disadvantages for dividends relative to capital gains...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants employ {{sunlight}} directly to generate electricity. Although the solar energy {{is free of}} charge, the plant needs to operate cost-efficiently in order to compete with conventional coal-, gas-, and nuclear energy. One possibility is the optimization of the components used. Therefore, minimizing thermal and optical losses is essential. Different loads and boundary conditions have a significant influence on shape accuracy of parabolic solar mirrors. In general, it depends substantially on the support structure which usually differs from those used in standardized laboratory measurements. The aim of this work is to characterize influences on the shape accuracy in collector, the preparation of appropriate models and programs, {{as well as the}} evaluation of how well mirror shape in collector can be predicted based on laboratory results. The optical performance of the mirrors as well as the annual yield are quantified. As a result of this work, interfaces to the DLR internally developed tools SPRAY and Greenius are created and comprehensive workflows employing Matlab Tools provided. In laboratory and collector test benches optical measurements of the mirror shape, the support structure and occurring strains at the glass <b>brackets</b> <b>holding</b> the mirrors are carried out and reproduced with FE-models. An optimization workflow is implemented to support the evaluations. The investigations were carried out with the EuroTrough-geometry by using mirrors of RP 3 geometry. In the following, important results of this work are summarized: As an important finding, the consideration of further parts of the support structure than the glass brackets does not significantly influence dead load results. However, and as presented in exemplary simulations, geometrical deviations of the mounting elements of the support structure can {{have a significant effect on}} the shape accuracy. The resulting optical performance as well as the influence on the annual yield for the investigated load cases is evaluated. Mounting inaccuracies of the mirror mounting elements can induce significant shape deformations even in case of only a few mrad or mm deviation - and also affect the optical performance and the annual yield of the plant. Deriving technical specifications, but also the optimization of the geometries is made possible, since optical, thermal, and economical losses can be quantified due to the progress within this work. The predictability of mirror shape in collector is limited, and will be discussed, since the aforementioned geometrical deviations of the support structure are not universally known or predictable...|$|R
