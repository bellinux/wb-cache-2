40|$|ABSTRACT: Gully erosion is {{appeared}} widely on sloping {{arable land}} caused by high intensity rainfall {{and it would}} bring deterioration of agricultural productivity of land. In {{the northern part of}} Luzon Island of the Philippines, farmers reported that gully erosion was severely developed in recent years in some areas of corn fields located on hilly land. In order to understand the actual condition of development of gully erosion, we attempted to develop a method to extract spatial distribution of gullies and to analyze recent development of gully associated with land use changes by using multi-platform satellite data. Gully-eroded areas are presented as dark linear features on satellite images on the condition that the spatial resolution of satellite data is small enough. The average <b>gully</b> <b>top</b> width in this case was about 2 meters, which was considerably larger compared with the 0. 5 meter spatial resolution of the WorldView panchromatic data adopted in this study. After performing median filtering to reduce local noise, the Sobel filter was applied to enhance the edge features of the image. At this stage, enhanced linear parts were contaminated with gully and non-gully objects. Thereafter, the following processes were undertaken to extract only the gully-affected areas; first, the topographic factors were considered by enhancing the image contrast of the pixels oriented orthogonally to the slope orientation, second, texture parameters (window size: 21 by 21 pixels) were calculated and non-gully objects were discriminated after setting an appropriate threshold, and third, forest areas were estimated from multi-temporal ALOS/AVNIR 2 data and set it as masked out area. It was notified that the second process was effective in maskin...|$|E

500|$|Tower Ridge is {{the longest}} of the north face's four main ridges, with around 600 metres of ascent. It is not {{technically}} demanding (its grade is Difficult), and most pitches can be tackled unroped by competent climbers, but it is committing and very exposed. Castle Ridge (Moderate), the northernmost of the main ridges, is an easier scramble, while Observatory Ridge (Very Difficult), the closest ridge to the summit, is [...] "technically the hardest of the Nevis ridges in summer and winter". Between the Tower and Observatory Ridges are the Tower and Gardyloo Gullies; the latter {{takes its name from}} the cry of [...] "garde à l'eau" [...] (French for [...] "watch out for the water") formerly used in Scottish cities as a warning when householders threw their slops (and worse) out of a tenement window into the street. The <b>gully's</b> <b>top</b> wall was the refuse pit for the now-disused summit observatory. The North-east Buttress (Very Difficult) is the southernmost and bulkiest of the four ridges; it is as serious as Observatory Ridge but not as technically demanding, mainly because an [...] "infamous" [...] rock problem, the 'Man-trap', can be avoided on either side.|$|R

50|$|To climb Island Peak, one has {{the option}} of {{starting}} from a base camp at 5087 m called Pareshaya Gyab and starting the climb between 2 and 3 am. Another popular option is to ascend to High Camp at around 5600 m {{to reduce the amount}} of effort and time needed for summit day. However, adequate water supply and concerns about sleeping at a higher altitude may dictate starting from base camp. Base camp to high camp is basically a hike but just above high camp, some rocky steps require moderate scrambling and up through a broad open <b>gully.</b> At the <b>top</b> of the <b>gully,</b> glacier travel begins and proceeds up to a steep snow and ice slope. From here, fixed ropes may be set up by the guides for the strenuous ascent of nearly 100 m to the summit ridge. The climb to the summit is somewhat difficult due to steep climbing. On top, while Mount Everest is a mere ten kilometres away to the north, the view will be blocked by the massive wall of Lhotse, towering 2300 m above the summit.|$|R
40|$|Examines the habitat, {{microhabitat}} and {{the calling}} behaviour of the Krombit tinkerfrog, {{which is a}} critically endangered myobatrachid frog endemic to the rainforest <b>gullies</b> of Kroombit <b>Tops</b> in south-east Queensland. Taudactylus pleione (the Kroombit tinkerfrog) is a critically endangered myobatrachid frog endemic to the rainforest <b>gullies</b> of Kroombit <b>Tops,</b> an elevated plateau in southeast Queensland, Australia. Its numbers have declined in recent times, particularly at the higher altitude plateau streams. Efforts to conserve the species, including a proposal to commence captive breeding, are hampered by inadequate knowledge of the species' habitat requirements and conditions required for reproduction. This project investigated the characteristics of occupied rainforest patches and streams, microhabitat and structure of male call sites and influence of climatic variables on male calling activity. Habitat characteristics of rainforestlwet sclerophyll patches and streams used by T. pleione were compared to randomly selected unoccupied patches and streams. Callsites and call-perches used by male T. pleione were compared to available potential callsites and perches. Daily calling activity of male T. pleione was analysed in relation to climatic and other variables. Patches of notophyll rainforest and adjacent wet sclerophyll forest were mapped from aerial photography. The habitat and spatial patterns of ten patches occupied by T pleione and ten randomly selected unoccupied patches were compared. Within these, habitat and microhabitat data were compared for seven occupied and eight unoccupied streams. The habitat of T. pleione {{can be described as}} first-order streams at Kroombit Tops originating above 825 m within patches of simple notophyll gully vine forest (Regional Ecosystem 12. 12. 1) spanning more than 168 m of elevation, that are generally greater than 20 ha in area with an area-perimeter ratio of 73 or higher and a catchment of over 56 ha, no more than 207 m from the nearest occupied patch. Patches of less than 20 ha may be occupied provided they have patch roundness index values of 0. 68 or higher. Streams have generally less than 7. 9 % crevice cover and 'large pebbles' (2. 1 - 6. 0 cm) occurred at a frequency of 30 % or more. Data were collected from call-sites used by male T. pleione for advertisement calling and from randomly selected paired locations within the same gully. Occupied call-sites had significantly higher rock and crevice cover, but significantly lower slope and direct summer radiation values. Males {{were significantly more likely to}} be found using rockpiles than other call-perch structures available at the site. Preliminary analysis of the acoustic reflectivity of the call-perches used by T. pleione males, based on the density of their component materials, showed they were significantly more reflective than potential call-perches. Daily male T. pleione calling activity was recorded at one escarpment stream over 1, 836 days. Associated daily temperature and rainfall data were collected at Kroombit Tops and long-term rainfall and temperature data obtained from Bureau of Meteorology stations within 50 km of the study site. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between male calling behaviour at this site and meteorological and astronomical variables. The resultant modelling identified two distinct periods within the calling season: the calling onset and sustained calling periods. The calling onset period model explained 85. 9 % of cases using five variables describing atmospheric moisture, temperature, rainfall and moon phase. The sustained calling period model explained 77. 8 % of cases using three variables describing atmospheric moisture and rainfall. This study has provided the first quantitative data on habitat and microhabitat use by T. pleione and the methodology developed has application for further research on the habitat requirements of the species. Further, this study has greatly increased knowledge of when male T. pleione call and the factors influencing calling. These results can improve the effectiveness of future surveys and monitoring as well as providing a application to any future attempts at translocation or captive breeding of this critically endangered species...|$|R
40|$|National audiencePassive margin {{are for a}} {{long time}} used to {{reconstruct}} globalsea-level variations at geological time scale for various reasons. They usually show a simple and undeform sedimentary record witha possibility to correlate unconformities regionally and in somecases worldwide, a gradational evolution of depositional environmentsfrom the continental to the deep marine realms includingthe shoreline, and a well-known subsidence history. Sequencestratigraphy proved to be a wonderful tool to decipher the passivemargin sedimentary record from the earliest outcomes of seismicstratigraphy (Vail et al., 1977; Posametier et al., 1988) to themost recent standardization (Catuneanu et al., 2009), applications(Embry 2008 - 2009) and simplifications (Neal and Abreu, 2009). Numerous hypotheses, however, have not been fully tested yet,like for example, the nature of the sedimentary facies that composethe prograding clinoform bodies on the shelf – a classic endmember of most passive margin sedimentary record (e. g. Mitchumet al. 1977; Berg 1982; Alexander et al. 1991; Pirmez et al. 1998; Hubbard et al., 2010, Helland-Hansen et al., 2012) – the timingand phases relationship of these sedimentary facies with respectto relative sea-level changes (Reynolds et al., 1991) or the paleowater depth of sediment deposited at the toe of the clinoforms(Greenlee and Moore, 1988). This paper sought to ground-truth the vertical succession andlateral facies associations of clinoform deposits in the relativelysimple, passive margin system of the New Jersey shelf by usingthe data provided by the IODP-ICDP Expedition 313 (Mountain,Proust et al., 2010). The arrangement of lithofacies in clinothemdeposits follows complex patterns of prograding shoreface sandsand offshore silts when storm-influenced mud deposits drape theshelf. <b>Gullies</b> incise the <b>top</b> of the clinothems feeding shelfslope apron and toe of slope with turbidites and debrites. Theclinothems are interpreted as the subaqueous counterpart of asubaerial delta detached for more than 60 km in the offshore duringtransgressive and early highstand times. The subaerial deltaprogrades rapidly on the shelf during late highstand, forced regressionand lowstand periods feeding the clinothem with sandsand silts and steps back during early transgressive times leavingclinothems sealed by offshore muds. The New Jersey example shows that the model of delta progradationand reservoir partioning in current passive margin settingsshould be strongly revised as well as forcing parameters as relativesea level never dropped below the clinoform rollover duringlowstand times, as predicted by traditional sea level charts...|$|R
40|$|The {{large amount}} of multi-temporal {{high-resolution}} images acquired {{in the last few}} years offers the opportunity to identify morphological changes associated with recent geologic activity on the surface of Mars. In this study we focus on a single gully in Sisyphi Cavi, located in the south polar region at 1. 44 °E and 68. 54 °S. The gully incises the gullied equator-facing slope of an isolated polar pit within an infilled impact crater. It is important to notice that the following investigations describe the activity and modifications of an existing gully and not the formation of the gully itself. High-resolution image data analyses show new deposits at the terminus of the gully channel and on the gully apron within spring (after solar longitudes of 236 °) of martian years (MY) 29 and 31. Our morphological investigations show that the identified new deposits were formed by dark flows through the entire <b>gully</b> deposited on <b>top</b> of the apron between solar longitudes (L S) ∼ 218 ° and ∼ 226 °. Thermal data show a temperature increase between L S ∼ 218 ° and ∼ 226 °. Near-infrared spectral data show relatively constant band strengths of CO 2 ice and H 2 O ice in this time range. After the formation of the dark flows (after L S ∼ 226 °), temperatures increase rapidly from ∼ 180 K to >∼ 270 K at L S ∼ 250 °. At this time, spectral data indicate that all volatiles on the surface sublimated. However, an earlier beginning of sublimation when the dark flows were observed (between L S ∼ 218 ° and ∼ 226 °) is likely, due to the fact that the instruments can only show the last phase of sublimation (decrease of volatile band strengths). Spectral modeling shows that from winter to mid-spring, the surface of the studied area is covered by translucent CO 2 slab-ice contaminated by minor amounts of H 2 O ice and dust. Furthermore, our spectral modeling indicates that the dark material most likely flows on top of the CO 2 slab-ice cover. Three different scenarios were proposed to explain the identified dark flows, including (1) flows supported by liquid H 2 O, (2) flows supported by CO 2 gas, and (3) dry flows. On the basis of our study we find that scenario (1) is unlikely because of the very low temperatures. While scenario (2) is consistent with the observed beginning of CO 2 ice sublimation in the study area, it is unlikely because of the limitation of the activity to only one gully compared to surrounding gullies that share the same morphologies, slope angles, and volatile contents. Also with scenario (3), dry flows, the activity of only one gully is difficult to explain. Thus, we propose a mixture of scenario (2 and 3), dry flows supported by the ongoing sublimation of CO 2 ice within the gully, to be the most plausible scenario, when the observed active gully comprises different source material than the surrounding gullies, i. e., a higher content of probably sand-sized material from outcrops located in the alcove...|$|R
