Results show that fatigue cracks in pearlitic steels initiate at the wire surface starting from small defects, whose size decreases with the drawing process. Fatigue cracks created from defects (initiation phase) exhibit a fractographic appearance consisting of ductile microtearing events which can be classified as tearing topography surface or TTS, and exhibit a remarkably lower spacing in the prestressing steel wire than in the <b>hot</b> rolled <b>bar.</b> In addition, some S-N tests were performed in both material forms under a stress range of about half the yield strength.

50|$|Heat sealing is {{the process}} of sealing one {{thermoplastic}} to another similar thermoplastic using heat and pressure. The direct contact method of heat sealing utilizes a constantly heated die or sealing bar to apply heat to a specific contact area or path to seal or weld the thermoplastics together. Heat sealing is used for many applications, including heat seal connectors, thermally activated adhesives and film or foil sealing.Common applications for the heat sealing process: Heat seal connectors are used to join LCDs to PCBs in many consumer electronics, as well as in medical and telecommunication devices. Heat sealing of products with thermal adhesives is used to hold clear display screens onto consumer electronic products and for other sealed thermo-plastic assemblies or devices where heat staking or ultrasonic welding is not an option due to part design requirements or other assembly considerations. Heat sealing also is used in the manufacturing of bloodtest film and filter media for the blood, virus and many other test strip devices used in the medical field today. Laminate foils and films often are heat sealed over the top of thermoplastic medical trays, Microtiter (microwell) plates, bottles and containers to seal and/or prevent contamination for medical test devices, sample collection trays and containers used for food products. Medical and the Food Industries manufacturing Bag or flexible containers use heat sealing for either perimeter welding of the plastic material of the bags and/or for sealing ports and tubes into the bags.A variety of heat sealers are available to join thermoplastic materials such as plastic films: <b>Hot</b> <b>bar</b> sealer, Impulse sealer, etc.|$|E

This article compares the quality of the electrical circuit between industry iron and <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> machine methods in the cover coating process by using Peeling Strength to indicate the quality in the same temperature and time condition. The experimental result illustrates the electrical circuits using the <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> machine method give Peeling Strength value in the acceptable range and the laminating surface of circuits is smooth and uniform. On the other hand, Peel Strength value of electrical circuits using the industry iron method is unsteady and lower than the acceptable range.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigates the}} shape {{evolution}} of the pinholes on the bloom surfaces, which are originated from the continuous casting process, during multi-pass <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling. It is important to track the shape {{evolution of the}} pinholes since they can be formed as the sharp surface cracks after <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling and can initiate the surface bursts in the cold forging process. It {{is very hard to}} track the deformation behavior of the pinholes with detection tools during hot rolling, so the numerical simulations can be properly utilized. In general, the size of the pinholes in the bloom surface is order of micrometer although the bloom size is order of millimeter. This size discrepancy between them makes it difficult to discretize the domain including the pinholes for the finite element (FE) simulations. To overcome this limitation of the conventional FE simulation, multi-scale technique coupling the macro and micro models was developed in current study. This technique was implemented into the commercial simulation code, DEFORM- 3 D. The developed multi-scale simulation technique was capable of simulating the shape evolution of the pinholes through multi-pass <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling successfully. It is concluded that aspect ratio of the initial pinhole should be larger than 2. 0 approximately to prevent it folded...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to adjust the roll gap for the dimension accuracy of bar in <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling process considering roll wear. In this study <b>hot</b> <b>bar</b> rolling processes for round and oval passes have been investigated. In order to predict the roll wear, the wear model is reformulated as an incremental form and then wear depth of roll is calculated at each deformation step on contact area using the results of finite element analysis, such as relative sliding velocity and normal pressure at contact area. Archard’s wear model was applied to predict the roll wear. To know the effects of thermal softening of DCI (Ductile Cast Iron) roll material according to operating conditions, high temperature micro hardness test is executed and a new wear model has been proposed by considering the thermal softening of DCI roll expressed in terms of the main tempering curve. The new technique developed in this study for adjusting roll gap can give more systematically and economically feasible means to improve the dimension accuracy of bar with full usefulness and generality...|$|E
