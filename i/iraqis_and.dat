5|$|After the ten-day campaign, the Israelis were {{military}} {{superior to}} their enemies and the Cabinet subsequently considered {{where and when}} to attack next. Three options were offered: attacking the Arabic enclave in Galilee held by the Arab Liberation Army; moving eastward {{as far as possible}} in Samarian and Judean areas, taken by the <b>Iraqis</b> <b>and</b> Jordanians; or attacking southern Negev taken by the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} the {{southern}} Levant has a varied past and as such, its cuisine has contributions from various cultures. After the area was conquered by the Muslims, it became part of a Bilad al-Sham under the name Jund Filastin. Therefore, many aspects of Palestinian cuisine {{are similar to the}} cuisine of Syria—especially in the Galilee. Modern Syrian-Palestinian dishes have been generally influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups: the Arabs, the Persian-influenced Arabs (<b>Iraqis)</b> <b>and</b> the Turks.|$|E
5|$|The Iraq War in Anbar Province, {{also known}} as the Al Anbar campaign, {{consisted}} of fighting between the United States military, together with Iraqi Government forces, and Sunni insurgents in the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar. The Iraq War lasted from 2003 to 2011, but the majority of the fighting and counterinsurgency campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007. Although the fighting initially featured heavy urban warfare primarily between insurgents and U.S. Marines, insurgents in later years focused on ambushing the American and Iraqi security forces with improvised explosive devices (IED's), large scale attacks on combat outposts, and car bombings. Almost 9,000 <b>Iraqis</b> <b>and</b> 1,335 Americans were killed in the campaign, many in the Euphrates River Valley and the Sunni Triangle around the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi.|$|E

25|$|Cross-national {{empirical}} verification, or rejection, of populist {{suspicion and}} fear of refugees' {{threat to national security}} and terror-related activities is relatively scarce. Case studies suggest that the threat of an Islamist refugee Trojan House is highly exaggerated. Of the 800,000 refugees vetted through the resettlement program in the United States between 2001 and 2016, only five were subsequently arrested on terrorism charges; and 17 of the 600,000 <b>Iraqis</b> <b>and</b> Syrians who arrived in Germany in 2015 were investigated for terrorism. One study found that European jihadists tend to be 'homegrown': over 90% were residents of a European country and 60% had European citizenship.|$|E

As officials could find no evidence of any connections, terrorism as a motive was ruled out, and they suggested that the crash was an apparent suicide.

Their operational plan included a simultaneous attack by a Golani company from the 15th Battalion, which would attack from Atlit through Mazar in the north; and Alexandroni's 33rd Battalion from Bat Shlomo through Meir Shfeya in the south. A Carmeli battalion would block the approaches from the southeast, next to Ayn Ghazal, and eight armored vehicles along with a bulldozer and Guard Corps troops would clear obstacles {{on the main road}} and stage diversions.|$|E

[...] On the evening of 28 April 2003, Saddam Hussein's birthday, a crowd of about one hundred men, women, and children staged anti-American protests outside US military outposts in Fallujah. The Iraqis claimed they were unarmed, while the Army said that some individuals were carrying and firing AK-47s. The soldiers manning one of the outposts fired on the crowd, killing at least twelve and wounding dozens more. [...] The Army never apologized for the killings or paid compensation. In the weeks afterwards, the town's pro-US mayor urged the Americans to leave.|$|E
