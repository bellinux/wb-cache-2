5000|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a {{sheet metal forming}} process in which a sheet metal blank is {{radially}} drawn into a <b>forming</b> <b>die</b> by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered [...] "deep" [...] drawing when {{the depth of the}} drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius.|$|E

5000|$|In tube {{hydroforming}} (THF) {{there are}} two major practices: high pressure and low pressure.With the high pressure process the tube is fully enclosed in a die prior to pressurization of the tube. In low pressure the tube is slightly pressurized to a fixed volume during the closing of the die (this used to be called the Variform process). Historically, the process was patented in the '50s, but it was industrially spread in the '70s for the production of large T-shaped joints for the oil & gas industry.Today it is mostly used in the automotive sector, where many industrial applications can be found. It is also a method of choice for several tubular members of bicycles.In tube hydroforming pressure is applied to the inside of a tube that is held by dies with the desired cross sections and forms. When the dies are closed, the tube ends are sealed by axial punches and the tube is filled with hydraulic fluid. The internal pressure can go up to a few thousand bars and it causes the tube to calibrate against the dies. The fluid is injected into the tube through one of the two axial punches. Axial punches are movable and their action is required to provide axial compression and to feed material towards the center of the bulging tube. Transverse counterpunches may also be incorporated in the <b>forming</b> <b>die</b> in order to form protrusions with small diameter/length ratio. Transverse counter punches may also be used to punch holes in the work piece {{at the end of the}} forming process.|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} {{semi-solid}} metal forming {{is dependent on}} a globular solid grain formation within a liquid phase. This paper presents experimental works concerning semisolid metal processing of aluminium 7075 feedstock billets which were produced by direct thermal method. The flowability of feedstock billets was evaluated by an injection test processing unit. The feedstock billets were heated to a temperature of 620 °C by using a box furnace before transferred into a <b>forming</b> <b>die.</b> The formed feedstock billet {{was removed from the}} <b>forming</b> <b>die</b> after it was cooled to ambient temperature. Several analyses were conducted on the formed feedstock billets including dimensional measurement and microstructure analysis. The results show that the feedstock billets which contained the highest amount of free secondary phase were most successfully formed. Microstructure analysis results also revealed the formation of more globular and larger α–Al solid grains in the same feedstock billets. In this experimental work, the feedstock billets with higher amount of secondary (liquid) phase had a significant effect on formability. It is concluded that in order to achieve successful formability of the direct thermal method feedstock billets, the billets need to a have higher secondary phase content. Thus, important preparation methods of feedstock billets were characterised in order to allow for SSM processing...|$|E
