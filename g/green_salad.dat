Families were catered for at lunchtimes by the hot-water rooms, {{each of which}} could accommodate up to 3,000diners, providing hot water for drinks and crockery for visitors who brought their own picnics. [...] The price was 2d per person, according to the 1892 guide book, and cakes and jams made in the gardens' bakery and on-site kitchens were also available, at extra cost. [...] "One shilling tea rooms", close to the hot water rooms, offered lunchtime deals such as a pot of tea, bread and butter, <b>green</b> <b>salad</b> and fruit cake for a shilling.

60|$|Perhaps memory reads {{into this}} {{experience}} {{more than in}} those <b>green</b> <b>salad</b> days I actually found there. But of this at least I am certain--that the morning sped on unheeded in his company, and I was even unconscious of how cold I was until he suddenly glanced anxiously into my face and told me so. So now we wandered off together towards the great house--which hitherto I had left unapproached. We climbed the green-stained scaling steps from terrace to terrace, tufted with wallflower and snapdragon amongst the weeds, cushioned with bright moss, fretted with lichen. Standing there, {{side by side with}} him, looking up--our two figures alone, on the wide flowerless weed-grown terrace--hale, sour weeds some of them, shoulder-high--I scrutinized the dark, shut windows.|$|E

It was customary for the Romans to precede their gargantuan banquets with refreshing lettuce salads in the belief that lettuce enhanced the appetite and relaxed the alimentary canal. It had other uses, too. Dried lettuce juice was used to aid sleep in Elizabethan times and through World War II lactucarium, a sedative made from wild lettuce extracts, was used in hospitals¹. Today, lettuce is used as the main ingredient in most salads and it is joined by a variety of other <b>salad</b> <b>greens.</b> <b>Salad</b> <b>greens</b> are easy to grow in the home garden and are an important source of vitamins and minerals in our diets. Dark green leaves are good sources of vitamins A and C, iron, folic acid, and calcium.
