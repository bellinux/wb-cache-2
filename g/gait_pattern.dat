40|$|Traditionally, gait {{analysis}} has been {{centered on the}} idea of average behavior and normality. On one hand, clinical diagnoses and therapeutic interventions typically assume that average <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> remain constant over time. On the other hand, {{it is well known that}} all our movements are accompanied by a certain amount of variability, which does not allow us to make two identical steps. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the intra-individual <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> across different time-scales (i. e., tens-of-mins, tens-of-hours). Nine healthy subjects performed 15 gait trials at a self-selected speed on 6 sessions within one day (duration between two subsequent sessions from 10 to 90 mins). For each trial, time-continuous ground reaction forces and lower body joint angles were measured. A supervised learning model using a kernel-based discriminant regression was applied for classifying sessions within individual <b>gait</b> <b>patterns.</b> Discernable characteristics of intra-individual <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> could be distinguished between repeated sessions by classification rates of 67. 8 ± 8. 8 % and 86. 3 ± 7. 9 % for the six-session-classification of ground reaction forces and lower body joint angles, respectively. Furthermore, the one-on-one-classification showed that increasing classification rates go along with increasing time durations between two sessions and indicate that changes of <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> appear at different time-scales. Discernable characteristics between repeated sessions indicate continuous intrinsic changes in intra-individual <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> and suggest a predominant role of deterministic processes in human motor control and learning. Natural changes of <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> without any externally induced injury or intervention may reflect continuous adaptations of the motor system over several time-scales. Accordingly, the modelling of walking by means of average <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> that are assumed to be near constant over time needs to be reconsidered in the context of these findings, especially towards more individualized and situational diagnoses and therapy...|$|R

40|$|In this research, we have {{developed}} an autonomous decentralized multi-legged robot system (ADMRS, Fig. 2). This system is modeled on the walk pattern generating mechanism of walking animals (Central Pattern Generator: CPG, Fig. 1). Each leg is an autonomous partial system (subsystem) and communicates with its neighbor subsystems, and then harmonious <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> are achieved as a total system. ADMRS can be composed of any number of legs and has the features such as high fault-tolerance and easiness of maintenance (Fig. 3). We developed a mathematical CPG model suitable for ADMRS. The model generates natural oscillating modes and makes them transit according to the oscillation energy. The modes and the energy correspond to the <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> and the desired walk speed, respectively.

Results indicated that restricted ankle ROM contributes to decreased velocity and cadence and decrease in gait symmetry. A compensatory pattern was observed for pelvic obliquity, hip and knee flexion at toe-off and foot progression angle. Observed patterns did not resemble those observed in TTA. Results suggest that restricted ankle ROM contributes to some components of alterations in <b>gait</b> <b>patterns</b> observed in TTA.
