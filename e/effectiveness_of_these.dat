5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The safety and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> new agents are still uncertain, {{because they are}} {{based on the results of}} a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.|$|E

5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E

Her missions around this time were generally strategic bombing missions, however the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> final missions were mixed, with some failing to achieve strategic results. She also provided close air support for UN troops for the final weeks of the war before an armistice was reached at Panmunjom in July 1953, ending major combat operations in Korea. During this time, the two sides often conducted costly attacks in order to strengthen their bargaining positions at the negotiating table. Boxer remained in Korean waters until November 1953. She received eight battle stars for her service in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Four of XXIBomber Command's {{next five}} raids were made against targets in Nagoya. The first {{two of these}} attacks on 13 and 18December used {{precision}} bombing tactics, and damaged the city's aircraft plants. The third raid was a daylight incendiary attack which was conducted after the Twentieth Air Force directed that 100 B-29s armed with M-69 bombs be dispatched against Nagoya to test the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> weapons on a Japanese city. Hansell protested this order, as he believed that precision attacks were starting to produce results and moving to area bombardment would be counterproductive, but agreed to the operation after he was assured {{that it did not}} represent a general shift in tactics. Despite the change in armament, the 22December raid was planned as a precision attack on an aircraft factory using only 78 bombers, and bad weather meant that little damage was caused. XXIBomber Command raided the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo again on 27December, but did not damage the facility. On 3January 1945, 97 B-29s were dispatched to conduct an area bombing raid on Nagoya. This attack started several fires, but these were quickly brought under control.|$|E

5|$|LeMay {{increased}} the number of mine-laying sorties in June, and the 505th Bombardment Group joined the 313thBombardment Wing on occasion. In response to this offensive, the Japanese greatly expanded their mine-sweeping force by 349 ships and 20,000 men and deployed additional anti-aircraft guns around the Shimonoseki Strait. They had little success in permanently clearing minefields or downing the B-29s, however. Many of Japan's major harbors, including those of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya, became permanently closed to shipping. During the last weeks of the war, B-29s continued to drop large numbers of mines off Japan and the campaign was expanded into Korean waters. The 313thBombardment Wing lost only 16 B-29s during mine-laying operations. Overall, mines dropped by Superfortresses off the home islands sank 293 ships, which represented 9.3percent of all Japanese merchant shipping destroyed during the Pacific War and 60percent of losses between April and August 1945. Following the war, the USSBS assessed that the Twentieth Air Force should have placed a greater emphasis on attacking Japanese shipping given the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> attacks.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into three parts: concealment, advertisement, and disguise. Part 1, concealment, covers the methods of camouflage, which are colour resemblance, countershading, {{disruptive}} coloration, and shadow elimination. The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> arguments for and against them, and experimental evidence, are described. Part 2, advertisement, covers the methods of becoming conspicuous, especially for warning displays in aposematic animals. Examples are chosen from mammals, insects, reptiles and marine animals, and empirical evidence from feeding experiments with toads is presented. Part 3, disguise, covers methods of mimicry that provide camouflage, as when animals resemble leaves or twigs, and markings and displays that help to deflect attack or to deceive predators with deimatic displays. Both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry are treated as adaptive resemblance, much like camouflage, while a chapter is devoted to the mimicry and behaviour of the cuckoo. The concluding chapter admits that the book's force is cumulative, consisting of many small steps of reasoning, and being a wartime book, compares animal to military camouflage.|$|E

25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution.
