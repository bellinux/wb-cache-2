She concluded by saying, [...] " [...] is both sad and amusing, believable, well acted and very well told". Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times summed up her review by writing, [...] "Packaged with Naseeruddin as the adorable old man... and Kalki as the charming young, energetic woman, Waiting is a delight." [...] While acknowledging the [...] "underdeveloped and overwritten" [...] parts of the plot, Gupta was nonetheless appreciative of Koechlin and Shah, calling them good fits for their roles. Rajeev Masand writing for CNN-News18 offered similar observations; he criticized the [...] "weak" [...] plotting, but talked well of the characters: [...] "you yearn for them to <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> and soak in the silence. Each time they do, the film soars." [...] Also lauding Shah's [...] "real" [...] and Koechlin's [...] "endearing" [...] performances, he wrote that Waiting, [...] "raises important questions about life, love, and letting go. Plus there are those two splendid performances. That's plenty to merit a viewing." ...|$|E
500|$|Hex Enduction Hour takes {{influence}} from the Velvet Underground's [...] "Sister Ray", Captain Beefheart {{and the early}} 1970s Krautrock band Can. Smith {{has said that the}} title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word [...] "Enduction" [...] to suggest the album could be a listener's induction into the Fall and that [...] "Hex" [...] was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by Sounds as [...] "emerg like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a [...] "well produced noise" [...] that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he [...] "could {{have done a better job}} on a 4-track if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that [...] "nowadays people just can't <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> if they don't know what they're talking about." [...] Elaborating on the purposely amateurish production values, Smith remarked that [...] "it was all recorded in deliberately bad places...deliberately simple sort of thing. Three songs were written at rehearsal and done the next time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laura Miller of Salon.com wrote {{a scathing}} review of Diary, saying that Palahniuk's books [...] "traffic in the half-baked {{nihilism}} of a stoned {{high school student}} who has just discovered Nietzsche and Nine Inch Nails" [...] and that [...] "everything even remotely clever in them has been done before and better by someone else." [...] In response, Palahniuk (who had never responded to a review before) sent an angry e-mail to Salon's Letters section. Palahniuk observed [...] "Until you can create something that captivates people, I'd invite you to <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up.</b> It's easy to attack and destroy an act of creation.

5000|$|Andy Gill from The Independent {{gave the}} album a more {{negative}} review. He criticized Duritz' song-writing as [...] "self-pitying" [...] {{and called him}} a [...] "classic solipsistic soul-barer, he <b>just</b> won't <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> about himself".

One innovative third grade teacher went a step further and provided her students with a lively outlet for their creative skills in the 2 ̆ 2 Humor Corner. 2 ̆ 2 As we entered the classroom, two youngsters were enjoying jokes produced by classmates and browsing through a few of the riddle books on display. Holding The Biggest Riddle Book in the World (Rosenbloom, 1976), one student greeted us with: 2 ̆ 2 I bet you can 2 ̆ 7 t answer this one!

60|$|There {{were very}} {{few people in the}} day coaches at that time of night, so we made a slim haul until we got to the sleeper. The Pullman {{conductor}} met me at one door while Jim was going round to the other one. He very politely informed me that I could not go into that car, as it did not belong to the railroad company, and, besides, the passengers had already been greatly disturbed by the shouting and firing. Never in all my life have I met with a finer instance of official dignity and reliance upon the power of Mr. Pullman's great name. I jabbed my six-shooter so hard against Mr. Conductor's front that I afterward found one of his vest buttons so firmly wedged in the end of the barrel that I had to shoot it out. He <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> like a weak-springed knife and rolled down the car steps.|$|E

"A day or {{two after}} that I found out {{from a man who}} run a still, and knew the Red Captain well, that he had made up his mind to lave Galway and come down south, where he had some friends; so I <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> the house and walked down here.

Not a penny of it would I touch if I were dying of hunger, and sooner than be pointed at as an {{informer}} I would throw myself over them big rocks. But they have got Denis, and either they will make him as bad as themselves--which I don't think--or they will shoot him; and if they don't shoot him he will be shot one of these days by the soldiers. What I want you to promise, your honor, is, that if I point out where you can lay your hands on the villains, you won't say who tould you, and that you will tell your soldiers not to shoot Denis.|$|E

"Well, I was {{reckoning}} ez it's such a wild {{night there}} wouldn't be any use keepin' open, {{and when you}} fellows left I'd <b>just</b> <b>shut</b> <b>up</b> for good and make things fast," [...] said Harkutt, dubiously. Before his guests had time to fully weigh this delicate hint, another gust of wind shook the tenement, and even forced the unbolted {{upper part of the}} door to yield far enough to admit an eager current of humid air that seemed to justify the wisdom of Harkutt's suggestion. Billings slowly and with a sigh assumed a sitting posture in the chair. The biscuit-nibbler selected a fresh dainty from the counter, and Wingate abstractedly walked to the window and rubbed the glass. Sky and water had already disappeared behind a curtain of darkness that was illuminated by a single point of light--the lamp in the window of some invisible but nearer house--which threw its rays across the glistening shallows in the road. [...] "Well," [...] said Wingate, buttoning up his coat in slow dejection, [...] "I reckon I oughter be travelin' to help the old woman do the chores before supper." [...] He had just recognized the light in his own dining-room, and knew by that sign that his long-waiting helpmeet had finally done the chores herself.|$|E

60|$|The {{proposal}} for a moonlight ramble was received with acclamation by all the younger portion of the company. They immediately set forth and descended from story to story, dimly lighting their way by waxen tapers, which are a necessary equipment to those whose thoroughfare, in the night-time, lies {{up and down a}} Roman staircase. Emerging from the courtyard of the edifice, they looked upward and saw the sky full of light, which seemed to have a delicate purple or crimson lustre, or, at least some richer tinge than the cold, white moonshine of other skies. It gleamed over the front of the opposite palace, showing the architectural ornaments of its cornice and pillared portal, as well as the iron-barred basement windows, that gave such a prison-like aspect to the structure, and the shabbiness and Squalor that lay along its base. A cobbler was <b>just</b> <b>shutting</b> <b>up</b> his little shop, {{in the basement of the}} palace; a cigar vender's lantern flared in the blast that came through the archway; a French sentinel paced to and fro before the portal; a homeless dog, that haunted thereabouts, barked as obstreperously at the party as if he were the domestic guardian of the precincts.|$|R
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} evidence that psychosocial stressors {{are among the}} most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.

5000|$|The lead single [...] "Shut Up and Let Me Breathe" [...] is {{a potent}} song about {{domestic}} violence and was written for the Violence Free Families initiative. In an interview with her FanClub, she said [...] "It's saying, <b>just</b> come on, <b>shut</b> <b>up,</b> let me breathe… it's not about the strangulation, it's about wanting personal space. If you’ve had anything emotional: bullying or intimidation, you question yourself, anyone who's had that understands it's not about you it's about me. So the song {{is not so much}} about the person who is doing the damage, it's about doubting yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Till {{at last we}} came to the low sheds that squatted {{between the}} steamer and the railway-end. The lark led me into one, where a red-cap was writing.

[...] And he led me on to another shed, which was <b>just</b> going to <b>shut</b> <b>up.</b> Here they finally had the condescension to give me two tickets--a hundred and fifty francs the two.

5000|$|In the {{corporate}} environment, management {{has been known}} to distribute this book to employees during times of [...] "structural reorganization," [...] or during cost-cutting measures, in an attempt to portray unfavorable or unfair changes in an optimistic or opportunistic way. This has been characterized by Barbara Ehrenreich in her book Bright-sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America as an attempt by organizational management to make employees quickly and unconditionally assimilate management ideals, even if they may prove detrimental to them professionally. Ehrenreich summarizes its message as [...] "the dangerous human tendencies to 'overanalyze' and complain must be overcome for a more rodentlike approach to life.
