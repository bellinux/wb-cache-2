50|$|While regular vacuum {{cleaners}} {{are designed to}} simply contain visible dirt and debris, hypoallergenic vacuums are designed to trap {{almost all of the}} smaller particles which in a regular vacuum are simply re-circulated into the ambient air. While this is not an issue for most people who do not suffer allergies, many with particular sensitivities to allergens (including asthma) can find that this not only does not help their condition, but stirring the dust into the air can make the condition worse.Most modern hypoallergenic {{vacuum cleaners}} use a system consisting of four primary components: the final output filter (generally a HEPA or similar filter), the motor and fan or <b>impeller</b> <b>assembly,</b> secondary particle filter to protect the motor assembly, and a primary filter - a bag, cup or wet filter bucket (each of which provide the initial filtration and retention of most dust and contaminants). Modern high quality hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners generally use HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrestor) filters to trap the vast majority (at least 99.97%) of very small particles that other vacuum cleaners would simply re-emit into the ambient air - ideally specifying a recognised and independently tested HEPA filter grade (see HEPA article) rather than just using the term. Recently many cheaper 'HEPA type' filters have appeared on the market attempting to capitalise on the term, these are generally inferior and do not meet the stringent requirements set by the US Dept of Energy (or in Europe EN 1822) to call themselves HEPA, and have not been independently tested to assess their ability to stop dust egress. While many dry bagless systems include HEPA grade filtration, the user is generally exposed to the very dust and allergens they are trying to avoid during emptying/cleaning the system. Anti-allergy bagged systems avoid most of this risk with a bag that will contain dirt and contaminants, and wet filter bagless systems also allow emptying without exposure to airborne particles as it is contained in a 'mud'. While Wet filter systems do avoid the cost and environmental waste of needing new bag for every filling, like wet/dry and shampooing machines they do generally require a very small amount of anti foaming agent, though this is generally environmentally benign. Some Hypoallergenic vacuum bags differ a great deal from non-hypoallergenic bags. Hypoallergenic bags often come in two pieces, an inner and outer bag. The inner bag (which captures the dirt) will be disposable and completely contained. Outer bags will sometimes take the place of a filter all together filtering out dust and allergens out of the air. Some modern hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners will use the two bag system with the outer bag made up of high-performance filtration material treated with antimicrobials to impede the growth of mold, bacteria and other parasites. A two bag system will still require a final HEPA filter to be able to comply with the standards of HEPA filtration. All good Hypo-allergenic systems are designed, not just to contain 99+% of containments (99.97% in the case of HEPA systems), but to clean the air while cleaning the floors, some, including water filter models, achieving retention of particles over 0.3 micrometer diameter of 99.99% (1 particle in 10,000 released).|$|E
40|$|A high-pressure-ratio, low-mass-flow {{centrifugal}} compressor stage was designed, fabricated, and tested. The design followed specifications that the stage {{be representative of}} state-of-the-art performance and that the stage {{is to be used}} as a workhorse compressor for planned experiments using laser Doppler velocimeter equipment. The final design is a 75, 000 -RPM, 19 -blade impeller with an axial inducer and 30 degrees of backward leaning at the impeller tip. The compressor design was tested for two- and/or quasi-three-dimensional aerodynamic and stress characteristics. Critical speed analyses were performed for the high speed rotating <b>impeller</b> <b>assembly.</b> An optimally matched, 17 -channel vane island diffuser was also designed and built...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDrum mix plant {{used for}} mixing of {{concrete}} and other raw materials used in road construction. Impeller {{is used in the}} exhaust system of drum mix plant to remove dust particles. Fixture is used in manufacturing of impeller during welding to hold the different parts of the <b>impeller</b> <b>assembly</b> like blades (vanes), upper and lower plates. This paper shows an innovative way to use impeller structure itself as fixture and which has been resulted in the reduction of distortion produced during welding. In this paper modelling work has been done using AutoCAD, Pro-e, Solid Works software, and analysis part has been done using ANSYS workbench. Hence the design and analysis of the fixture has been presented in this paper. Unbalance mass for the impeller has been reduced to 44 g for the new design from 100 g for the existing design...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{measurement}} of rheological {{properties of the}} tyre rubber bitumen blends is often challenging due to presence of suspended tyre rubberâ€™s crumbs. Furthermore, the phase separation {{during the course of}} measurements makes the viscosity of these non-homogeneous blends difficult to ascertain. In this study, a new dual helical impeller was designed and manufactured to be used with a rotational viscometer {{in order to have a}} real-time control of the viscosity while performing a laboratory mixing of the blends. Layer based manufacturing techniques showed to be a convenient method to produce complex shaped impeller prototypes before manufacturing the more expensive stainless steel <b>assembly.</b> <b>Impeller</b> geometry was optimised to create a convective like flow within the sample and so minimise phase separation. Shear rate constant is geometry dependent and a calibration exercise was carried out to ascertain this. Results of both calibration and validation phases showed that the new impeller provides reliable viscosity measurements of homogenous fluids such as neat bitumen. With regards to complex fluids the new impeller showed a more stable and realistic trend than that obtained by using a standard spindle. In fact, it was demonstrated that the new impeller significantly decreases phase separation within the blend and in turns provides a more realistic {{measurement of}} the viscosity. This system represents a feasible and improved solution for optimising the laboratory modification process of tyre rubber bitumen blends by adapting the rotational viscometer as a low-shear mixer...|$|R
