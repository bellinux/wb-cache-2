5000|$|A rya is a {{traditional}} Scandinavian wool rug with a long pile of about 1 to 3 inches. They were made using a form of the <b>Ghiordes</b> <b>knot</b> to make the double-sided pile fabric. Though rya means [...] "rug" [...] in English, the original meaning in Sweden of rya was a bed cover with a knotted pile. The first ryas originated in the early fifteenth century as coarse, long-piled, heavy covers used by mariners instead of furs. As time progressed, the rugs have evolved to be lighter and more colorful. The insulation that ryas provide protect against the cold Scandinavian climate. Ryas are a knotted pile carpet, with each knot composed of three strands of wool, which enables the rug to exhibit rich texture from all the different shades of color. The name originates from a village in southwest Sweden. [...] The term rya may also refer to a breed of sheep whose wool is used to make rya carpets (see Rya (sheep)).|$|E
