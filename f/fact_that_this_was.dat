5|$|The {{attacks of}} 28 March were a {{continuation}} of the rapid advances that had so shattered the Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not a set-piece assault, but merely an attack off the line of march. The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, with 230 RIR losing another 240.|$|E
25|$|The title First Among Sequels was {{met with}} stiff {{resistance}} from Fforde's publishers because it had 'sequel' in the title, and {{it was felt that}} telegraphing the 'sequelness' of the book might be a bad move. It was decided, however, to capitalise on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a series - a sort of 'Have you discovered Thursday Next yet?' approach to marketing.|$|E
25|$|One gruesome {{reminder}} of the sacrifices of the generation was the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the first}} times in conflict whereby more men died in battle than from disease, which was the main cause of deaths in most previous wars. The Russo-Japanese War was the first conflict where battle deaths outnumbered disease deaths, but it was fought on a much smaller scale between just two nations.|$|E
50|$|Dhanauli Thakuran {{is named}} after the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> mostly {{populated}} by the Thakurs (Thakurs belong to warrior clan).|$|R
50|$|Mickey and Donald {{have a lot}} of slapstick {{humor in}} Chapter 5, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an {{adventure}} story.|$|R
50|$|Also notable <b>is</b> the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} version of the Penguin {{revealed}} to be LGBT, when the character reveals his feelings for Edward Nygma.|$|R
25|$|CBS {{wanted the}} NBA to start Game 6 of the Finals at 10:30 local time on Sunday morning to {{accommodate}} a golf telecast of the Kemper Open (similar to 1976). This time, the NBA refused and CBS agreed to a noon start in Portland. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the Finals' clinching game, CBS cut away from its NBA coverage very quickly after the game ended, skipping the trophy presentation in the Trail Blazers' locker room to instead televise the golf tournament.|$|E
25|$|His era was {{especially}} one of artistic development. But it was Ningirsu {{who received the}} majority of Gudea’s attention. Ningirsu the war god, for whom Gudea built maces, spears, and axes, all appropriately named for the destructive power of Ningirsu—enormous and gilt. However, the devotion for Ningirsu {{was especially}} inspired by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Gudea's personal god and that Ningirsu was since ancient times the main god of the Lagashite region (together with his spouse Ba'u or Baba).|$|E
25|$|Beyond its {{increasingly}} visible role providing organically grown {{food for}} the School Dining Hall, the 270-acre Hotchkiss Farm is also where art classes can practice plein air painting, poetry classes can find inspiration, environmental science classes can explore terrain that includes rare grassland bird habitats, and American history classes can reflect on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> once part of a land grant from King George III. When completed, farm trails will add an estimated three to five miles to the six or more that already traverse the Hotchkiss Woods.|$|E
50|$|The {{species name}} {{refers to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the third species reared from the host plant Phyllanthus microcarpus and is derived from Latin tertiarius (meaning third).|$|R
50|$|The Doctor and Nyssa briefly {{discuss the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Nyssas first {{encounter}} with the Daleks, because she never encountered them during any of her appearances in the television series.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewers have {{commented that}} {{although}} Lemmy {{has always said}} that the late Wendy O. Williams was a wonderful person, this doesn’t alter the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a truly horrible track.|$|R
25|$|Counsel for the Law Society raised two counterarguments to this point, both {{stemming}} from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an application for judicial review. First, {{he argued that the}} High Court should be reluctant to exercise its powers of judicial review in this case, because Shankar had an alternative remedy in the form of show cause proceedings before a court of three judges. Secondly, he argued that evaluating whether the standard of proof was applied correctly would involve an examination of the merits of the Committee's decision, and such an examination of merits was not permitted in a judicial review case.|$|E
25|$|A short {{distance}} past {{the church is}} Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with Churchtown. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the narrow lanes a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood {{at the entrance to}} this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription Nutgrove School Established 1802. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants down to recent years becoming the parish councilheadquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a very interesting eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. Joyce in his Neighbourhood of Dublin states that this house was at one time the dower house of Rathfarnham Castle but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as Frizell's map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house {{on the opposite side of}} the avenue which was formerly named Ely Cottage, later altered to Ely Lodge, and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently been restored in a very tasteful manner.|$|E
500|$|In the episode's DVD commentary, MacFarlane {{addressed}} what viewers {{perceived to}} be a rather abrupt ending to the episode. As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back, Lois walks through the front door, returning from the hospital, and has brought the kids home with her. MacFarlane stated, [...] "Some of the fans actually noticed, commented on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a very abrupt resolution, but, to that I would say, you're not watching [...] wouldn't you rather we throw in more jokes and fill up the time, and then hustle {{to the finish line}} at the last minute?".|$|E

5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times; they were granted in 1989. The arms show two white seagulls {{on a red}} background. <b>This</b> design <b>was</b> chosen to highlight the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an island community.|$|R
500|$|The most {{long-term}} and long-lasting {{result of}} the fall of Amorium, however, was in the religious rather than in the military sphere. Iconoclasm was supposed to bring divine favour and assure military victory, but neither the army's weaknesses nor the reported treachery of Boiditzes could detract from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a humiliating disaster to match the worst defeats of any iconophile emperor" [...] (Whittow), comparable in recent memory only to the crushing defeat suffered by Nikephoros I (r. 802–811) at Pliska. As Warren Treadgold writes, [...] "the outcome did not exactly prove that Iconoclasm was wrong... but it did rob the iconoclasts for all time of their most persuasive argument to the undecided, that Iconoclasm won battles". A little over a year after Theophilos's death, on 11 March 843, a synod restored the veneration of icons, and iconoclasm was declared heretical.|$|E
500|$|Uematsu {{has noted}} {{that the process of}} {{composing}} was excruciating, involving trial and error and requiring the sound staff to spend several nights in sleeping bags at Square Co. headquarters. [...] He blamed much of the problem on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> his first soundtrack to use the new Super Famicom hardware, as opposed to his previous soundtracks composed for the Famicom. The liner notes for the Final Fantasy IV OSV album were humorously signed as being written at 1:30 AM [...] "in the office, naturally." [...] Uematsu has stated that, beginning with the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IV, he started {{to move away from the}} idea that the soundtrack had to be solely an orchestral score. In June 2007, Square Enix held a casting for a vocalist to sing a version of Final Fantasy IVs [...] "Theme of Love" [...] rearranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Megumi Ida was selected from approximately 800 applicants to perform the song, which was featured on the Japanese Nintendo DS remake of the game, as well as the accompanying soundtrack album.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1987, Moore {{was struck}} down with {{bacterial}} pneumonia. He initially {{tried to ignore}} the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated [...] "How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?".|$|E
2500|$|... {{where we}} justify our choice of {{integration}} constants by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the unique choice giving the correct Newtonian limit. [...] This gives the solution {{in terms of}} coordinates which directly exhibit the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> spacetime <b>is</b> conformally equivalent to Minkowski spacetime, but the radial coordinate in this chart does not readily admit a direct geometric interpretation. [...] Therefore, we adopt instead Schwarzschild coordinates, using the transformation , which brings the metric into the form ...|$|R
3000|$|... -LCP. The {{theoretical}} {{importance of}} this class of LCPs lays in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the largest class for which polynomial convergence of IPMs can be proved without additional conditions (such as boundedness of the level sets).|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} name velatus {{is from the}} Latin velatus meaning concealed, referring to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the first species of Encheloclarias found on Sumatra after 150 years of ichthyological exploration, and the secretive nature of this species.|$|R
2500|$|Of all {{the rooms}} of the appartement du roi, this room perhaps best {{expressed}} the personal tastes of Louis XIV. [...] In addition to the collection of gems, there were works by Nicolas Poussin and Giovanni Lanfranco on the walls as well as Harpsichord with a painted case. [...] The personal nature of this room was offset by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the room in which Louis XIV governed France. [...] Councils were held here, writers who extolled the gloire of the Sun King were received here, and private audiences most often occurred in this room.|$|E
2500|$|On April 20, 2010, Cuomo sued Espada for {{siphoning}} $14million {{from the}} Soundview Health Clinic for personal expenses. The lawsuit covered 5 years of spending, expenditures which included $80,000 in restaurant bills (which included $20,000 in sushi delivered to Espada's Mamaroneck home), personal trips including to Las Vegas and Puerto Rico, and renting a residence required to establish residency {{in the district}} for his Senate race in 2008. Cuomo stated, [...] "Siphoning money from a charity would be egregious under any circumstances, but the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> orchestrated by the state Senate majority leader makes it especially reprehensible. In New York, no one is above the law, and this suit should finally make that clear to Senator Espada." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2004 {{marked the}} first time the Flames {{qualified}} for the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs since 1996. [...] The Red Mile's beginnings were relatively humble, and consisted of people driving down the Red Mile honking and waving flags, as people walked the streets cheering and clapping hands. [...] Several thousand fans went to bars along 17th Avenue S.W. to watch the Flames on the road against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round, and also to watch the team play at the nearby Pengrowth Saddledome for home games. [...] When the Flames eliminated the Canucks in the seventh and deciding game by Martin Gelinas' overtime goal, fans flooded the streets in a relatively spontaneous party celebrating the Flames first playoff series victory since the 1989 Stanley Cup final against the Montreal Canadiens. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> spontaneous is a phenomenon in itself; there had been no advertising or other form of publicizing of 17th Avenue as an after-game party strip prior to the playoff run.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "East Point" [...] {{derives from}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the {{terminus}} of the Atlanta & West Point Railroad in the east; West Point, Georgia, is the terminus where the rail line ends in the west.|$|R

2500|$|One excuse {{offered by}} the FCO for their failure to consult the files was that the {{ownership}} of the papers was confused, that the FCO merely possessed stewardship, thus the archives had been considered [...] "out of bounds" [...] for FoI requests (the FCO were not the owners, so {{they did not have}} the right to go through the documents). Cary, however, managed to uncover the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not the case, that there had been [...] "major exceptions to the general principle that these papers have been considered 'out of bounds'." [...] Such an excuse became irrelevant after the 2006 legal request from Leigh Day because all documents have to be checked when it comes to court cases. [...] "It was perhaps convenient to [...] that the migrated archives ... did not need to be consulted for the purposes of FOI requests, while also being conscious of the files as a sort of guilty secret, of uncertain status and in the 'too difficult' tray", Cary concluded.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} why Gavriilidis made such a point of announcing that Akropolis was [...] "continuing {{the work of the}} Queen". [...] Possibly he hoped to share the {{immunity}} from criticism that she had apparently been enjoying since February. [...] If so, he took a great risk in associating himself with the Queen and her supposedly Pan-Slavist family connections; it seems that many took — or pretended to take — his introductory editorial as a declaration of intent to [...] "continue the Queen's work" [...] of Pan-Slavic subversion. [...] All the old opponents of the Queen's translation immediately sprang to the attack again with redoubled energy, since Pallis and Gavriilidis had struck the same nerve as the Queen: the gap between the spoken and written languages. [...] The format of the Queen's book had only implied that some of the least educated might need a little help with written Ancient Greek; now Gavriilidis had announced on a front page {{that a majority of the}} population could not understand it at all. [...] The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> true did nothing to diminish the reawakened fury of the conservative nationalists.|$|E
2500|$|His {{close friends}} and fellow photographers, led by Joseph Keiley, {{encouraged}} him {{to carry out his}} dream and publish a new magazine, one that would be independent of any conservative influences. It did not take him long {{to come up with a}} new plan. In August, 1902, he printed a two-page prospectus [...] "in response to the importunities of many serious workers in photographic fields that I should undertake the publication of an independent magazine devoted to the furtherance of modern photography." [...] He said he would soon launch a new journal that would be [...] "the best and most sumptuous of photographic publications" [...] and that it would published entirely by himself, [...] "owing allegiance only to the interests of photography." [...] He called the new journal Camera Work, a reference to the phrase in his prospectus statement in which he meant to distinguish artistic photographers like himself from the old-school technicians with whom he had fought for many years. To emphasize the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an independent journal every cover would proclaim [...] "Camera Work: A Photographic Quarterly, Edited and Published by Alfred Stieglitz, New York".|$|E
