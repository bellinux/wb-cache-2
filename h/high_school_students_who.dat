25|$|In 1999, Hughes {{said that}} his request to direct the film met with {{resistance}} and skepticism because he lacked filmmaking experience.

25|$|The {{dramatic}} increase of emigration (Republikflucht, brain drain) {{in the first}} half of 1953, already high since the establishment of the GDR, constituted a serious economic and social problem. Another factor that contributed to an already complicated political situation was the high number of political prisoners in the GDR. Suppression of the illegal organisation Junge Gemeinde (Young Congregation), wrongly perceived as the central youth organisation of the Evangelical Church, played a role here. Numerous trainee pastors were imprisoned (e.g. Johannes Hamel and Fritz Hoffmann). Ecclesiastic recreation centres were closed and taken over by the FDJ (e.g.: Schloss Mansfeld and Huberhaus Wernigerode). <b>High</b> <b>school</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> belonged to a church were often expelled by the school authorities, sometimes even shortly before school graduation.|$|E
