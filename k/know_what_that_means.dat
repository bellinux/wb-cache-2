500|$|In {{addition}} to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually {{paid tribute to}} the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan [...] "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, [...] "they finger us back—and you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out {{the first night of}} the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Specific {{individuals}} {{have been identified}} with Atari Democrats. Al Gore's [...] "passion for technological issues, from biomedical research and genetic engineering to {{the environmental impact of}} the [...] "greenhouse effect," [...] linked him with other technological politicians on Capitol Hill known as Atari Democrats." [...] TIME magazine noted that Tim Wirth [...] "made a reputation as the typical [...] "Atari Democrat," [...] who urges growth and investment in high-technology industries."The New York Times referred to Paul Tsongas as an Atari Democrat, [...] "a member of the young generation of politicians and economists who looked to high technology as a source of jobs and economic growth." [...] Gary Hart also referred to himself as an Atari Democrat and stated, [...] "I was, early on in my Senate career, described as an Atari Democrat. No one would <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> because there are no more Ataris, but we were among the first - a small group of us to forecast the transition of the economy from industrialized manufacturing to the information age." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suppose M and N are two {{differentiable}} manifolds with dimensions m and n, respectively, and f is {{a function}} from M to N. Since differentiable manifolds are topological spaces {{we know what it}} means for f to be continuous. But what does [...] "f is [...] " [...] mean for ? We <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> when f {{is a function}} between Euclidean spaces, so if we compose f with a chart of M and a chart of N such that we get a map that goes from Euclidean space to M to N to Euclidean space we know what it means for that map to be [...] We define [...] "f is [...] " [...] to mean that all such compositions of f with charts are [...] Once again the chain rule guarantees that the idea of differentiability does not depend on which charts of the atlases on M and N are selected. [...] However, defining the derivative itself is more subtle. [...] If M or N is itself already a Euclidean space, then we don't need a chart to map it to one.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They'll {{tell him}} that labour {{conditions}} are not good here. He <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> He'll turn back quick enough. I'm {{in a small way}} of business, and I can't afford to take any chances fighting the Unions.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{write these}} lines while the servant is packing my portmanteau. Traveler <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> My dog is glad, at any rate, {{to get away}} from London. I think I shall hire a yacht, and try what a voyage round the world will do for me. I wish to God I had never seen Stella! ...|$|R
60|$|Things went on {{like this}} for another week. Then they reached--so Jill says--a climax. If Jill <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> I don't. But Pinky Carewe was the climax. Pinky's name is James, but Jill and I always called him Pinky because we couldn't bear him. He took to calling at Owlwood and one evening he took Aunt Tommy out driving. Then Jill came to me.|$|R
60|$|News reaches me that Bob is {{laid down}} with diphtheria; and you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{papers to}} make you your own master--a free man--you surely <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> Did you never hear of free niggers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will do it, young Bertie, {{or never}} darken my doors again. And you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> No more of Anatole's dinners for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They smiled. I shall <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> smile <b>means</b> some day. They don't waste their smiles. D'you {{see that}} track by Gale Anstey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And the {{assistance}} {{for which you}} wish?" [...] said father, putting his hand in his pocket. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> action <b>means</b> when I am talking to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said her}} pupil, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> smile <b>means.</b> You are {{thinking}} of my gentleman-tenant.--Do you know Mr. Moore of the Hollow?" [...] she asked Mr. Helstone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, with God's blessing," [...] {{repeated}} the poor youth, earnestly. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means,</b> Betty, and--and--I think I am {{beginning to understand}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, for you I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> Well, I {{have seen}} monsieur; {{that is what}} I wanted. He can't persuade me that he isn't very clever. Farewell." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate laughed. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> These Western {{girls are}} {{compelling}} creatures. Well, I will not complain if she only shakes {{you out of}} your scientific complacency." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Alone, quite alone. You {{have no fear}} of <b>that.</b> And you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> word <b>means?</b> Not only to be {{separate}} from all others but to have not even one friend.|$|R
6000|$|WELLWYN. [Calming {{himself with}} an effort.] But look here, Constable, as a {{reasonable}} man--This poor wretched little girl--you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> life <b>means</b> better than anyone! Why! It's {{to her credit}} to try and jump out of it! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't. You don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> picture <b>means</b> to me. But {{surely you}} could get the Nilghai to help you, and knock me down and tie me up. I shouldn't fight for the whiskey, but I should for the work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom was now quite amphibious. You do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means?</b> You had better, then, ask {{the nearest}} Government pupil-teacher, who may {{possibly}} answer you smartly enough, thus - ...|$|E
6000|$|... "... So I said 'Listen, Izzy, that'll {{be about}} all from you! My {{father was a}} gentleman, though I don't suppose you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means,</b> and I'm not accustomed....'" ...|$|E
60|$|MAN. I've not had two hours' {{undisturbed}} sleep {{since the}} war began. I'm on the staff: you don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> I haven't closed my eyes for thirty-six hours.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the reunion}} show a post {{was made to}} the band's website {{regarding}} their future, stating - [...] "Honestly, I don’t have any real news to report. There isn’t some secret record that we’ve been sitting on for two years. There’s {{not much more than}} the five of us getting together to make music again. That’s all we got. Who <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> I’m not making any huge promises or trying to tease you all reading this. We’re all in different places in our lives now, but we all know that we want to keep spending time with one another and working on the music that we love to create. The future is wide open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So is mine," [...] responded the artist, [...] "but I {{know enough}} of their lingo {{to make out}} that Italy has entered this fool war. She's going to fight the Austrians," [...] he continued, his voice shaking nervously, [...] "and do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> will <b>mean,</b> sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think really, do you know, I {{would rather}} not go over the detestable thing again. Not many; my wife, though, and a man I know called Danton, who--who's prejudiced. After all, I have myself to think about too. And right through, right through--there wasn't the least doubt of that--they all in their hearts knew it was me. They knew I was behind. I could feel that {{absolutely}} always; it's not just eyes and ears we use, there's us ourselves to consider, though God alone <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> But the password was there, as you might say; and they all knew I knew it, all--except'--he looked up as if in bewilderment--'except just one, a poor old lady, a very old friend of my mother's, whom I--I Sabathiered!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm on the dodge. You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> I {{got in a}} shooting-scrape at {{home and}} had to run off. When it blows over I hope to go back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> You do want {{to abuse}} me. So they've been {{bullying}} him about the money he paid to that man Lopez. How did anybody know anything about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How clever you are!" [...] {{she said}} gleefully, and caressed a button of his velvet coat. [...] "But you don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means!</b> It {{does not mean}} that I love you--not merely that." ...|$|E
60|$|Being {{permitted}} to reach land in safety, I prepared to eclipse Fan's ring and Mary's necklace with my rich and rare rococo watch. But I {{found it impossible}} to set it going, though I tried all the keys in the house, so I took it to an experienced watchmaker and left it to be regulated. Every one <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means,</b> and can imagine my impatience as week after week went by and still that blessed thing was not done. It came at last, however, and with it a bill that startled me; but I could not dispute it, for the job was a difficult one, owing to the antiquity of the works and the skill required to set a watch going that probably had not been wound up for half a century.|$|R
6000|$|And {{not without}} reason. The {{room had been}} [...] "stacked," [...] and every boy who has ever {{attended}} boarding school or college <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> In {{the center of the}} room lay the parts of the two beds in a heap and on top of those parts were piled a miscellaneous collection of books, chairs, clothing, the table and bureau, looking glass, an empty water pitcher, football, baseball bats, shoes, bed clothing, rugs, papers, pens, pencils, soap, caps, a steamer trunk from the closet, several framed photographs, some college banners, and a score of other articles. On the very top of the heap was a fancy sofa pillow Nellie had given to Tom and to this was pinned a card, on which was written, in a disguised scrawl: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes {{but nothing}} {{to what she}} was before that blessed John Smith broke her leg and {{battered}} her nose. Ingenious Smith!--gifted Smith!--noble Smith! Author of all our bliss! Hark! Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> wheeze <b>means?</b> Mary, <b>that</b> cub has got the whooping-cough. Will you never learn {{to take care of}} the children!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means!</b> James, why aren't you {{a little}} more human? You get heaps of invitations to nice houses. Much better {{go out and make}} some women friends. You ought to marry, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> {{with young}} men," [...] said Martha, who was {{sufficiently}} serious {{in her way}} of thinking to hold by that doctrine as to wolves in sheep's clothing in which Mrs. Ray had been educated.|$|E
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake, no! I {{have been}} paying calls all the {{afternoon}} with Mrs. Jerningham, and you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>means.</b> She {{has gone to the}} Hall now, and I am to pick her up in half an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Satisfied is too mild a word, Miss Sally. I am delighted. I {{knew you}} could {{accomplish}} wonders, but I never hoped for this. Eden is a dream--the dearest, quaintest, sweetest little home that ever {{waited for a}} bride. When I bring her here--oh, Miss Sally, do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> thought <b>means</b> to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Canler {{had asked}} for no security, and you <b>know,</b> dearie, <b>what</b> <b>that</b> will <b>mean</b> for me if papa cannot meet them. Oh, how I detest that man! ...|$|R
5000|$|However, these {{negative}} probabilities are never observed as one can't isolate {{the cases in}} which the photon [...] "goes through both slits", since we don't even <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>that's</b> supposed to <b>mean.</b>|$|R
