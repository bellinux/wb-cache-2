5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to {{twice as fast as}} warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cooler air mass.|$|E

40|$|Let Δ be a {{root system}} with a subset of {{positive}} roots, Δ^+. We consider <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the Hasse diagrams of some posets associated with Δ^+. For each edge one naturally defines its type, and we study the partition of the set <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> into types. For Δ^+, the type is a simple root, and for the posets of ad-nilpotent and Abelian ideals the type is an affine simple roots. We give several descriptions of the set <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> given type and uniform expressions for the number <b>of</b> <b>edges.</b> By a result of Peterson, the number of Abelian ideals is 2 ^n, where n is the rank of Δ. We prove that the number <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding Hasse diagram is (n+ 1) 2 ^n- 2.
