40|$|On {{the basis}} of the Berlin wisdom paradigm, we define wisdom <b>in</b> the <b>military</b> context as expert {{knowledge}} and judgment concerning <b>in</b> extremis <b>military</b> operations. We measured wisdom <b>in</b> the <b>military</b> context by asking participants to give advice to an inexperienced officer facing an in extremis operation; subsequently, we coded their responses. Data were provided by 74 senior noncommissioned officers (NCOs) in the U. S. defense forces. In support of convergent validity, wisdom <b>in</b> the <b>military</b> context was positively related to general objective wisdom and general self-assessed wisdom. Relationships of wisdom <b>in</b> the <b>military</b> context and general objective wisdom with Big Five personality characteristics were nonsignificant, whereas general self-assessed wisdom was positively related to extraversion, agreeableness, and openness to experience, and it was negatively related to neuroticism. The findings provide initial support for the validity of the new wisdom <b>in</b> the <b>military</b> context measure. We discuss several implications for future research and practice regarding wisdom <b>in</b> the <b>military</b> context. 13 page(s...|$|R

The remaining Device Forts still <b>in</b> <b>military</b> use were initially garrisoned with reservist units and then closed as military establishments.

In contrast, an inspection in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable structural condition, but antiquated in design. A report produced in 1641 suggested that £8,000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs, including £3,000 for additional sea defences.|$|E
