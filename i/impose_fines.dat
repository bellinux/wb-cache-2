5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} <b>impose</b> <b>fines,</b> but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that had to be taken for granted.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, food waste's {{effect on}} the {{environment}} has been an issue. Ireland is facing fines of millions of euros if the amount of biodegradable waste it sends to landfill does not fall below the maximum quantity set by the European Union's Landfill Directive.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the extent of {{judicial}} review exercised by the EU courts over the European Commission’s decision <b>imposing</b> <b>fines</b> in EU competition law. When considering appeals against fines in competition law, the position of the EU courts are limited to a review of <b>imposed</b> <b>fines</b> in respect of the European Commission’s Guidelines instead of an exercise of a more comprehensive appellate review. The review should not only be a control of legality but it has to be an unlimited merits control. An appeal control should be directed to review fully the facts and to control proportionality of the <b>imposed</b> <b>fines.</b> The article analyses also the question of the protection of fundamental rights in the scope of the review over decisions <b>imposing</b> <b>fines.</b> For that purpose, the article provides also a comparative analysis of the selected judgments of the EU courts and the European Court of Human Rights.

5|$|Forests {{were special}} areas {{of land in}} medieval England, owned by the Crown and subject to forest law. They were often {{selected}} because of their natural resources, and were expected to provide the Crown with a flow of money or raw materials. In 1195, the Forest of Dartmoor extended across all of Devon, but in 1204 John curtailed {{the extent of the}} royal forest, removing much of Devon from Forest Law and leaving the area known in the modern period as Dartmoor. This reduced forest was still subject to the Forest Laws, involving a specialised group of legal officials who met at Lydford Castle to <b>impose</b> <b>fines</b> and other punishments. Probably both Lydford Castle and the forest was given to the Sheriff of Devon, William Brewer, in 1216. The arrangement changed under Henry III, when the estates were given to Richard, the Earl of Cornwall in 1239. Legally, this meant that the Forest of Dartmoor was converted to a chase, although the Earls of Cornwall continued to hold law courts at Lydford Castle, enforcing chase laws that closely resembled the former Forest Laws.|$|E

25|$|While the {{embankments}} {{prevented the}} tide entering the area, they also prevented the fresh {{water from the}} north from leaving it, and drainage channels were cut to channel it to sluices through the main flood banks. Some of the early channels were cut by the monks of Meaux Abbey, but their primary function was probably navigation rather than drainage, since they ran east-west rather than north-south. Land drainage in England became more organised after {{the passing of the}} Statute of Sewers in 1532. This established Commissioners of Sewers for the main marshland areas of the country, with powers to inspect banks, to assign the work of maintenance, and to <b>impose</b> <b>fines</b> on those who did not comply. By the early seventeenth century, the salt marshes to the south were generally free from flooding, although in 1646 a severe storm resulted in a breach near Drypool, which resulted in Stoneferry being flooded for 26 weeks. The protection of the salt marshes had been achieved by erecting a large flood bank at Sutton, which prevented water from the carr lands to the north from entering the marshes, but as it then had nowhere to go, the carrs remained waterlogged. Various plans for a new outlet to the south were suggested from the 1660s, but were met with opposition. In 1675, a local landowner called Sir Joseph Ashe cut a drain from Wawne carrs to the Hull, using windmills to pump the water into the Hull, and others followed his example.|$|E

A Cook County Circuit Court judge appointed an outside lawyer to represent Berrios before the Board of Ethics beginning in April 2011, {{and the firm}} billed the county $4,773 for its work as of September, 2012. The Board of Ethics rejected Berrios' appeal of the final determination. By November, 2012, 15 members of Berrios' family were on state or county payrolls or receiving state or county pensions. Berrios topped the [...] "Hall of Shame" [...] category in [...] "Chicago’s Best and Worst Politicians of 2012" [...] in Chicago Magazines December, 2012 issue.

2500|$|PETA is {{an animal}} rights {{organization}} and, as such, it rejects speciesism and also opposes {{the use and}} abuse of animals in any way, as food, clothing, entertainment, or research subjects.

[...] PETA lobbies government agencies to <b>impose</b> <b>fines</b> and/or confiscate animals when animal-welfare legislation has been violated, promotes a vegan lifestyle, tries to reform practices on factory farms and in slaughterhouses, sends undercover investigators into animal-research laboratories, farms, and circuses, initiates media campaigns against particular companies or practices, helps to find sanctuaries for animals formerly used by circuses and zoos, and initiates lawsuits against companies that refuse to change their practices.
