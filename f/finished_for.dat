5|$|Kameo {{is known}} for its {{prolonged}} development cycle, which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing and nurturing monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more befitting of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was repurposed from a fairy to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly <b>finished</b> <b>for</b> the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used the extra time to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, and add a local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.|$|E

Fourteen ships were {{originally}} laid down between 1917 and 1918 for the Austro-Hungarian Navy as the MT.130 class. However, the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary left them incomplete until 1920, when three ships were <b>finished</b> <b>for</b> the Regia Marina. An additional five ships were completed for the JKRM in 1931 as the Malinska class.|$|E

5|$|The Meadowbrook State Parkway {{was first}} envisioned in 1924 {{as part of}} the Long Island State Park Commission (LISPC) and Robert Moses's system to connect several parks in Nassau and Suffolk counties. One park {{included}} in the proposal was Jones Beach State Park, which opened along with the Ocean Parkway in 1929. Construction of the Meadowbrook and Loop causeways began in July 1933, and was slated for completion in January 1935. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation loaned $5,050,000 toward the project, which was completed in October 1934. Nassau County acquired the right-of-way for an extension to the Northern State Parkway in 1936, and the highway was originally intended to be <b>finished</b> <b>for</b> the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens. The start of construction was ultimately delayed until December 1953, and the $10million (1953 USD) highway was completed in October 1956.|$|E

Prendergast's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe, actor position, and prop placement. Any changes in dialogue or ad-libbed lines were similarly written down. Assistant director Danny McCauley was responsible for collaborating with unit production manager Phil Rawlins to finalize shooting orders and assigning extras. Rawlins, McCauley, production manager Lindsley Parsons Jr., and Katzenberg were all tasked with keeping things moving {{as fast as possible}} and keeping the budget under control; every hour on stage cost the production $4000.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1802, Wrexham was visited by a troupe of {{travelling}} comedians. One of the leaders, who had heard Randles play, requested that she performed with them. Before the age of two, she joined the troupe at Wrexham theatre to play Ar hyd y nos and The Downfall of Paris. There, she played her pieces with an apple and slice of cake {{on either side of}} the piano, receiving both when she <b>finished</b> <b>for</b> playing well. Over the next nine months, Randles played at the houses of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, Lady Dungannon and Lady Cunliffe. Williams-Wynn proposed that Randles play in a Wrexham concert during the spring of 1803, under the direction of the Welsh harpist John Parry. The concert was postponed a number of times due to the illness of Randles' mother, who insisted they carry on without her. On the night of the concert, Randles' mother died, after hearing that it was a success.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be <b>finished</b> <b>for</b> years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|The 1985–86 {{season was}} one of Al-Talaba and Saeed's best season in their history where Al-Talaba {{achieved}} their third league title after beating their rivals at the time, Al-Rasheed, in front of 50,000 spectators, with Saeed's only goal from a penalty, finishing in 1st with 25 points from 15 matches. Saeed finished the season as the top goalscorer of the league along with Al-Zawra'a's Ahmed Radhi and Al-Jaish's Rahim Hameed where, for the first time, {{every one of them}} scored 9 goals in the league. As of that season, Saeed was also made the club's vice president. In the 1986 Saddam International Tournament, Saeed played for Baghdad XI, rather than Al-Talaba, because Baghdad XI was essentially the Iraq national team under a different name. Baghdad XI won all of their group matches including a victory over Saeed's club Al-Talaba to qualify for the semi-finals where they thrashed Al-Zawra'a to reach the final. However, Baghdad XI lost the final 2–1 to Al-Rasheed; Saeed scored Baghdad XI's only goal in the final in the 78th minute with a penalty. Saeed returned to Al-Talaba for the 1986 Al-Muthabara Cup between Al-Talaba and Al-Rasheed; Al-Rasheed won the match 2–1. In the 1986–87 season, Al-Talaba finished mid-table in 6th place at 49 points. The {{second half of the season}} witnessed the retirement of the team captain, Jamal Ali, in 1987, when Saeed was named the new captain of the team, although he only participated in the first stage of the league due to an association punishment against him. The 1987–88 season was the only season where Saeed hasn't scored any goals due to him not participating in many matches because of national duty. They <b>finished,</b> <b>for</b> the first time since 1977–78, in 8th place at 30 points. Saeed wasted Al-Talaba's hope in achieving the league title in 1988–89 when he missed his penalty in the final of the league against their rivals, Al-Rasheed, after a 1–1 draw. The score was 4–3 to Al-Talaba but with Saeed's miss they got the equalizer and with his teammate missing the fifth penalty, Al-Rasheed won 5–4. Saeed returned to the top three goalscorers of the league table in 3rd with 12 goals along with Al-Zawra'a's Saad Abdul-Raheem.|$|E
