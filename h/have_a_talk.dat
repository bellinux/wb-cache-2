500|$|Returning home, the Chili Peppers parted ways and, for {{the most}} part, {{remained}} secluded from {{each other through the}} rest of 1997. No new material was written during that time, and {{it was not until the}} beginning of 1998 that the band began rehearsal. At that point, Navarro had become dependent on drugs, with Kiedis also struggling to remain clean. The band decided they would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>talk</b> with Navarro and attempt to convince him to enter rehab. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute, and Navarro fell over an amplifier in a drug-induced daze. In April 2010, Navarro discussed this incident, stating that: [...] "One [...] was [...] my drug use at the time. The other was musical differences. Anthony says it was because I tripped and fell over an amp while on drugs. I say that he was on more drugs than me at that point. We both had a loose relationship with reality. Who do you want to believe?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lat's career took a {{turn for}} the better on 10 February 1974; Asia Magazine, a {{periodical}} based in Hong Kong, published his cartoons about Bersunat—a circumcision ceremony all Malaysian boys of the Islamic faith have to undergo. [...] The cartoons impressed Tan Sri Lee Siew Yee, editor-in-chief of the New Straits Times. [...] Lee found Lat's portrayal of the important ceremony humorous yet sensitive, and grumbled that the newspaper should have hired the artist. [...] He was surprised to be told that Lat was already working within his organisation. [...] Lat was called to Lee's office to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>talk,</b> which raised the reporter's profile in the company. [...] He became the paper's column cartoonist, taking up a position created for him by Samad, now deputy editor of the New Straits Times. [...] His first duty was to document Malaysian culture in a series of cartoons titled Scenes of Malaysian Life. [...] The newspaper also sent him to study for fourmonths at St Martin's School of Art in London, where he was introduced to English editorial cartoons and newspapers. [...] Returning to Malaysia full of fascination with his experience, Lat transformed Scenes of Malaysian Life into a series of editorial cartoons. [...] His approach proved popular, {{and at the end of}} 1975 he was appointed full-time cartoonist with total freedom in his work.|$|E

After his poor play in Allsvenskan, and a tough start in the J20 SuperElit, he allowed six goals in an {{exhibition}} game against Canada. National junior team coaches Bo [...] "Kulon" [...] Lennartsson and Mikael Tisell were worried and decided to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>talk</b> with Lundqvist, where they questioned his motivation. Lundqvist's turning point came {{at the turn of}} the year at the 2001 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Moscow, where he led the Swedish national junior's team to a fourth-place finish in the tournament. He spent the rest of the season in the J20 SuperElit where he played 18 games, leading the league in minutes played by a goaltender.

2500|$|On {{the night}} of May 9, 1919, Europe {{performed}} for the last time. He had been feeling extremely ill all day, but {{wanted to go on}} with the concert (which was to be the first of three in Boston's Mechanics Hall). During the intermission Europe went to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>talk</b> with two of his drummers, Steve and Herbert Wright. After Europe criticized some of their behavior (walking off stage during others' performances), Herbert Wright became very agitated and threw his drumsticks down in a seemingly unwarranted outburst of anger. He claimed Europe did not treat him well and that he was tired of getting blamed for others' mistakes. He lunged for Europe with a penknife and was able to stab him in the neck. Europe told his band to finish the set and he would see them the next morning. To Europe and his band the wound seemed superficial. As he was carried away, he told them [...] "I'll get along alright." [...] At the hospital, they could not stop the bleeding and he died hours later.|$|E
