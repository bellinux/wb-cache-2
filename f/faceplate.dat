5|$|Both {{strontium}} and strontianite {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it {{was identified as a}} new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application of strontium (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75 percent of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the <b>faceplate</b> glass. With the displacement of cathode ray tubes by other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.|$|E
25|$|Broken <b>faceplate.</b> This {{is a real}} emergency, {{but very}} {{unlikely}} as the <b>faceplate</b> is usually a highly impact-resistant polymer and should not shatter. It can be mitigated by opening the free flow valve and holding the opening level, facing down, and breathing very carefully. a small hole or crack can be covered with a hand to slow the leak.|$|E
50|$|There are {{reportedly}} {{no plans to}} sell additional <b>faceplates</b> in the US retail locations (as indicated in the letter page in issue 200 of Nintendo Power) or the UK. Nintendo of Europe cannot supply replacement <b>faceplates</b> of any kind, and the feature is omitted from the product's marketing, packaging, and manual in Europe. However, some third parties are manufacturing such <b>faceplates</b> {{for sale in the}} US and Europe, and some importers stock <b>faceplates</b> acquired from Japan. Nintendo of America sells some of the <b>faceplates</b> individually online.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States and Canada, the Game Boy Micro is {{available}} in two regular colors, each sold with three interchangeable <b>faceplates</b> included: silver with black, [...] "Ammonite" [...] and [...] "Ladybug" [...] <b>faceplates,</b> and black with silver, [...] "Flame" [...] and [...] "Camouflage" [...] <b>faceplates.</b> [...] The [...] "20th Anniversary" [...] edition was released in December , which resembles the Famicom controller.|$|R
40|$|Steel-plate {{reinforced}} concrete (SC) composite walls typically consist of thick concrete walls with two exterior steel <b>faceplates.</b> The concrete core is sandwiched {{between the two}} steel <b>faceplates,</b> and the <b>faceplates</b> {{are attached to the}} concrete core using shear connectors, for example, ASTM A 108 steel headed shear studs. The shear connectors and the concrete infill enhance the stability of the steel <b>faceplates,</b> and the <b>faceplates</b> serve as permanent formwork for concrete placement. SC composite walls were first introduced in the 19802 ̆ 7 s in Japan for nuclear power plant (NPP) structures. They are used in the new generation of nuclear power plants (GIII+) and being considered for small modular reactors (SMR) due to their structural efficiency, economy, safety, and construction speed. ^ Steel <b>faceplates</b> can potentially undergo local buckling at certain locations of NPP structures where compressive forces are significant. The steel <b>faceplates</b> are usually thin (0. 25 to 1. 50 inches in Customary units, or 6. 5 to 38 mm in SI units) to maintain economical and constructional efficiency, the geometric imperfections and locked-in stresses induced during construction make them more vulnerable to local buckling. Accidental thermal loading may also reduce the compressive strength and exacerbate the local buckling potential of SC composite walls. This dissertation presents the results from experimental and numerical investigations of the compressive behavior of SC composite walls at ambient and elevated temperatures. The results are used to establish a slenderness limit to prevent local buckling before yielding of the steel <b>faceplates</b> and to develop a design approach for calculating the compressive strength of SC composite walls with non-slender and slender steel <b>faceplates</b> at ambient and elevated temperatures. ^ Composite action in SC walls is achieved by the embedment of shear connectors into the concrete core. The strength and stiffness of shear connectors govern the level of composite action. This level of partial composite action can influence the behavior and stiffness of SC composite walls. This dissertation presents numerical investigations of the level of partial composite action and its influence on the flexural stiffness of SC walls. The results are used to propose design criteria for steel headed shear studs, such as their size, spacing, and strength. ...|$|R
25|$|The optical {{distortion}} {{effects of the}} diver’s mask or helmet <b>faceplate</b> also produce an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved.|$|E
25|$|External graticules also {{protect the}} glass {{face of the}} CRT from {{accidental}} impact. Some CRT oscilloscopes with internal graticules have an unmarked tinted sheet plastic light filter to enhance trace contrast; this also serves to protect the <b>faceplate</b> of the CRT.|$|E
25|$|Materials used in {{construction}} include teak wood or tun wood (Cedrela toona), {{which is a}} variation of mahogany, for the neck and <b>faceplate</b> (tabli), and calabash gourds for the resonating chambers. The instrument's bridges are made of deer horn, ebony, or very occasionally from camel bone. Synthetic material is now common as well.|$|E
5000|$|Accuphase {{products}} are well regarded by high-end audio enthusiasts, but the brand is uncommon in the USA. Accuphase {{products are}} readily identified by their large Champagne-colored <b>faceplates</b> and large dual analog power meters - which {{are similar to}} the respected McIntosh Laboratory brand (McIntosh is famous for its unique <b>faceplates,</b> which are made of silk-screened glass and use large blue analog power meters).|$|R
50|$|Stems tighten {{around and}} hold the {{handlebar}} either by pinch bolts, which require 'feeding' the handlebar through the stem after removing controls, accessories and bar covering; or via detachable <b>faceplates,</b> also called pillow blocks, especially on BMX bicycles, which allow a handlebar with controls, accessories or bar covering to be removed intact. Stems with <b>faceplates</b> or pillow blocks are known as pop-top stems.|$|R
25|$|Cylindrically curved <b>faceplates</b> such {{as those}} used for {{firefighting}} full-face masks produce severely distorted views underwater.|$|R
25|$|Often, meters {{designed}} for semi-automated reading have a serial port on that communicates by infrared LED through the <b>faceplate</b> of the meter. In some multi-unit buildings, a similar protocol is used, {{but in a}} wired bus using a serial current loop to connect all the meters to a single plug. The plug is often near a more easily accessible point.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{improvement}} in diver safety provided by the more secure attachment of the breathing apparatus to the diver's face, some models of full face mask can fail catastrophically if the <b>faceplate</b> is broken or detached from the skirt, as there is then no way to breathe from the mask. This can be mitigated by carrying a standard secondary second stage, and preferably also a spare half mask.|$|E
25|$|A {{hardware}} revision, New Nintendo 3DS, {{was unveiled}} in August 2014. It {{is produced in}} a standard-sized model and a larger XL model; both models feature upgraded processors and additional RAM, an eye-tracking sensor to improve {{the stability of the}} autostereoscopic 3D image, colored face buttons, and near-field communication support for native use of Amiibo products. The standard-sized model also features slightly larger screens, and support for <b>faceplate</b> accessories.|$|E
40|$|A {{sandwich}} core comprises two <b>faceplates</b> {{separated by a}} plurality of cells. The cells are comprised of walls positioned at oblique angles relative to a perpendicular axis extending through the <b>faceplates.</b> The walls preferably form open cells and are constructed from open cells and are constructed from rows of ribbons. The walls may be obliquely angled relative {{to more than one}} plane extending through the perpendicular axis...|$|R

25|$|This gag has two mouthguards, {{similar to}} those worn by {{football}} and hockey players. One rests on the lower teeth of the wearer while the other is against the top. Again, like sports mouthguards, these mouthguards can be softened in boiling water to fit {{to the mouth of}} the wearer. The mouthguards are attached to a front <b>faceplate,</b> like most plug gags, and straps from the front to the back.|$|E
25|$|A new flying Batmobile design {{appears in}} Batman Beyond {{used by the}} new Batman (Terry McGinnis). This version of the vehicle made {{multiple}} appearances {{in the future of}} the DC Universe as flying cars were shown as commonplace technology in this future. This design is a radical departure from the usual style of Batmobiles, as they usually have a bat motif, from a bat <b>faceplate</b> on the grill, to tail fins resembling bat wings.|$|E
25|$|Giger's {{original}} {{design for the}} facehugger was a much larger creature with eyes and a spring-loaded tail. Later, in response to comments from the filmmakers, Giger reduced the creature's size substantially. At first, Giger assumed that the facehugger would wrap around {{the outside of the}} astronaut's helmet, but Scott decided that it would have far more impact if the facehugger were revealed once the helmet was removed. Scott and Giger realised that the facehugger should burn through the helmet's <b>faceplate</b> with its acid blood; subsequent redesigns of the space helmet included a far larger <b>faceplate</b> to allow for this. Dan O'Bannon initially conceived the facehugger as somewhat resembling an octopus, possessing tentacles. However, when he received H. R. Giger's designs, which substituted tentacles with fingerlike digits, he found Giger's design concept to be superior. Since no one was available at the time, O'Bannon decided to design the facehugger prop himself. The technical elements of the musculature and bone were added by Ron Cobb. Giger's initial design for the smaller facehugger had the fingers facing forward, but O'Bannon's redesign shifted the legs to the side. When the foam rubber sculpture of the facehugger was produced, O'Bannon asked that it should remain unpainted, believing the rubber, which resembled human skin, was more plausible.|$|E
25|$|Various other {{accessories}} for the console exist, such as decorative <b>faceplates</b> {{to change the}} physical appearance of the console.|$|R

25|$|Masks tend to fog when warm humid {{exhaled air}} {{condenses}} {{on the cold}} inside of the <b>faceplate.</b> To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of the}} glass and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.|$|E
25|$|A {{free flow}} helmet {{supplies}} a continuous flow of {{air to the}} diver, and he breathes this as it flows past. Work of breathing is minimal, but flow rate must be high if the diver works hard, and this is noisy, affecting communications and requiring hearing protection to avoid damage to the ears. This type of helmet is popular where divers {{have to work hard}} in relatively shallow water for long periods. It is also useful when diving in contaminated environments, where the helmet is sealed onto a dry suit, and the entire system is kept at a slight positive pressure by adjusting the back-pressure of the exhaust valve, to ensure that there is no leakage into the helmet. This type of helmet is often large in volume, and as it is attached to the suit, it does not move with the head. The diver must move his body to face anything he wants to see. For this reason the <b>faceplate</b> is large and there is often an upper window or side windows to improve the field of vision.|$|E
25|$|The first {{hardware}} revision, the Lisa 2, {{was released}} in January 1984 and was priced between $3,495 and $5,495 US. It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives {{in favor of a}} single 400k Sony microfloppy. It was possible to purchase the Lisa 2 with as little as 512k RAM. The Lisa 2/5 consisted of a Lisa 2 bundled with an external 5MB or 10MB hard drive. In 1984, {{at the same time the}} Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5 to all Lisa 1 owners, by swapping the pair of Twiggy drives for a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front <b>faceplate</b> was included to accommodate the reconfigured floppy disk drive. With this change, the Lisa 2 had the notable distinction of introducing the new Apple inlaid logo, as well as the first Snow White design language features. The Lisa 2/10 featured a 10MB internal hard drive (but no external parallel port) and a standard configuration of 1MB of RAM.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the CRO in its current form, the cathode ray tube had already been in use as a measuring device. The cathode ray tube is an evacuated glass envelope, similar to that in a black-and-white television set, with its flat face covered in a fluorescent material (the phosphor). The screen is typically less than 20 cm in diameter, much smaller than the one in a television set. Older CROs had round screens or <b>faceplates,</b> while newer CRTs in better CROs have rectangular <b>faceplates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The crest or comb {{on the top}} of {{the helmet}} was {{designed}} to strengthen it. Later versions also had cheek guards and even removable <b>faceplates</b> to protect the soldier from sword cuts.|$|R

500|$|Now on foot, {{the knights}} drew swords and {{returned}} to battle, Le Gris again proving stronger than his opponent and slowly gaining the upper hand. After several minutes of engagement, Carrouges slipped and Le Gris was able to stab his rival through the right thigh. As the crowd gasped and murmured, Le Gris stepped back to view his opponent's injury and Carrouges desperately counter-attacked, wrestling Le Gris to the ground. Le Gris' heavy armour prevented him from regaining his feet and Carrouges repeatedly stabbed at his floored opponent, his blows denting but not puncturing the thick plate steel. Realising that his sword was inadequate, Carrouges straddled Le Gris and used the handle of his dagger to smash the lock holding Le Gris' <b>faceplate</b> in position. Even as his opponent struggled beneath him, Carrouges tore the plate off and demanded that Le Gris admit his guilt. Le Gris refused and cried out [...] "In the name of God and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent". Infuriated, Carrouges drove his dagger through Le Gris' neck, killing him instantly.|$|E
