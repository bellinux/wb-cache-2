40|$|The {{prototype}} <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> 2, 3, 7, 8 -te-trachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is carcinogenic {{and toxic}} in experimental animals. At the cellular level, TCDD toxicity is often expressed as an inhibition or alteration in normal cell maturation. In this respect, we {{and others have}} demonstrated that exposure of experimental animals to TCDD causes immunosuppression, including inhibition of B lymphocyte maturation and antibody synthesis. Although the immunological effects of TCDD are well described, {{little is known about}} its mechanism of action. In the present studies, it was found that TCDD increases membrane protein phosphorylation, which is, in part, associated with tyro-sine-specific phosphorylation in B lymphocytes. This increase in phosphorylation occurred within minutes following TCDD treat-ment and was not associated with protein kinase C. The increase in tyrosine kinase by TCDD appears to be primarily due to d...|$|E
40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AHR) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that is best known because it mediates the actions of polycyclic and <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> environmental toxicants such as 3 -methylcholanthrene and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. We report here the successful identification of an endogenous ligand for this receptor; ≈ 20 μg was isolated in pure form from 35 kg of porcine lung. Its structure was deduced as 2 -(1 ′H-indole- 3 ′-carbonyl) -thiazole- 4 -carboxylic acid methyl ester from extensive physical measurements and quantum mechanical calculations. In a reporter gene assay, this ligand activates the AHR with a potency five times {{greater than that of}} β-naphthoflavone, a prototypical synthetic AHR ligand. 2 -(1 ′H-indole- 3 ′-carbonyl) -thiazole- 4 -carboxylic acid methyl ester competes with 2, 3, 7, 8 -[3 H]tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin for binding to human, murine, and fish AHRs, thus showing that AHR activation is caused by direct receptor binding, and that recognition of this endogenous ligand is conserved from early vertebrates (fish) to humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> {{on the development}} of bone tissue-like organization in primary cultures of normal diploid calvarial-derived rat osteoblasts was examined. Initially, when placed in culture, these cells actively proliferate while expressing genes associated with biosynthesis of the bone extracellular matrix. Then, post-proliferatively, genes are expressed that render the osteoblast competent for extracellular matrix mineralization and maintenance of structural as well as functional properties of the mature bone-cell phenotype. Our results indicate that, in the presence of TCDD, proliferation of osteoblasts was not inhibited but post-confluent formation of multicellular nodules that develop bone tissue-like organization was dramatically suppressed. Consistent with TCDD-mediated abrogation of bone nodule formation, expression of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin was not upregulated post-proliferatively. These findings are discussed within the context of TCDD effects on estrogens and vitamin D-responsive developmental gene expression during osteoblast differentiation and, from a broader biological perspective, on steroid hormone control of differentiation...|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the results of a study on the {{degradation}} of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in anoxic sediment-water systems. First of all several transformation processes are shown to take place, leading to formation of a variety of products.

Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) are developed relating the disappearance rate constants of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in anoxic sediments to readily available molecular descriptors. The correlations are based on disappearance rate constants for the reductive transformation of approximately 45 halogenated hydrocarbons. A batch method was used in which the compounds were incubated in a standard water-sediment system and periodically analysed. Subsequently the pseudo-first order reaction rates were correlated to several molecular descriptors. The best correlations were obtained using the following descriptors: 1.

40|$|In some mammals, <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (HAH) {{exposure}} causes wasting syndrome, {{defined as}} significant weight loss associated with lethal outcomes. The most potent HAH in causing wasting is 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-rho-dioxin (TCDD), which exerts its toxic effects through the {{aryl hydrocarbon receptor}} (AHR). Since TCDD toxicity is thought to predominantly arise from dysregulation of AHR-transcribed genes, {{it was hypothesized that}} wasting syndrome is a result of to TCDD-induced dysregulation of genes involved in regulation of food-intake. As the hypothalamus is the central nervous systems' regulatory center for food-intake and energy balance. Therefore, mRNA abundances in hypothalamic tissue from two rat strains with widely differing sensitivities to TCDD-induced wasting syndrome: TCDD-sensitive Long-Evans rats and TCDD-resistant Han/Wistar rats, 23 h after exposure to TCDD (100 mu g/kg) or corn oil vehicle. TCDD exposure caused minimal transcriptional dysregulation in the hypothalamus, with only 6 genes significantly altered in Long-Evans rats and 15 genes in Han/Wistar rats. Two of the most dysregulated genes were Cyp 1 a 1 and Nqo 1, which are induced by TCDD across a wide range of tissues and are considered sensitive markers of TCDD exposure. The minimal response of the hypothalamic transcriptome to a lethal dose of TCDD at an early time-point suggests that the hypothalamus is not the predominant site of initial events leading to hypophagia and associated wasting. TCDD may affect feeding behaviour via events upstream or downstream of the hypothalamus, and further work is required to evaluate this at the level of individual hypothalamic nuclei and subregions.

40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is traditionally defined as a transcription factor activated by exogenous polyaromatic and <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (PAH/HAH) ligands. Active AhR induces genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, including cytochrome P 4501 A 1, which function to metabolize activating ligands. However, recent studies implicate AhR in biological events that are apparently unrelated to the xenobiotic response, implying that endogenous activation mechanisms exist. Three AhR genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) encode proteins that demonstrate differential activation in response to PAH/HAHs, with the nonresponsive drAhR 1 a having some sequence divergence from the PAH/HAH-responsive AhRs in the ligand binding domain (LBD). We used these differences to guide the mutagenesis of mouse AhR (mAhR), aiming to generate variants that functionally discriminate between activation mechanisms. We found substitution of histidine 285 in the LBD with tyrosine gave a receptor that could be activated by isopropyl- 2 -(1, 3 -dithietane- 2 -ylidene) - 2 -[N-(4 -methylthiazol- 2 -yl) carbamoyl]acetate (YH 439), a potential AhR ligand chemically distinct from classic PAH/HAH-type ligands, but prevented activation by both exogenous PAH/HAH ligands and the endogenous activation mimics of suspension culture and application of shear-stressed serum. The differential response of H 285 Y mAhR to YH 439 suggests that this activator has a novel mode of interaction that tolerates tyrosine at position 285 in the LBD and is distinct from the binding mode of the well characterized PAH/HAH ligands. In support of this, the PAH-type antagonist 3 ′, 4 ′-dimethoxyflavone blocked mAhR activation by 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin but not YH 439. Furthermore, the strict correlation between response to exogenous PAH/HAH ligands and mimics of endogenous activation suggests that a PAH-type ligand may underpin endogenous mechanisms of activation.

Some chemicals in this class cause adverse biological effects after binding to an intracellular cytosolic protein called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Toxic responses such as thymic atrophy, weight loss, immunotoxicity, and acute lethality, as well as induction of cytochrome P 4501 A 1, have been correlated with the relative affinity of PCBs, PCDFs, and PCDDs for the AhR. Therefore, an important step in predicting the effects of these chemicals is the estimation of their binding to the receptor. To date, however, the use of quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to estimate binding affinity across multiple chemical classes has shown only modest success possibly due, in part, to a focus on minimum energy chemical structures as the active molecules. In this study, we evaluated the use of structural conformations other than those of minimum energy for the purpose of developing a model for AhR binding affinity that encompasses more of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> chemicals known to interact with the receptor.

Some PAHs can induce a teratogenic phenotype similar to that caused by planar <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> such as dioxin. Consequently, mechanism of action is often equated between the two classes of compounds. Unlike dioxins, however, the developmental toxicity of PAH mixtures is not necessarily additive.

An oval-shaped pollution halo has formed, spanning 3 km from west to east and 2 km from south to north, and mainly occurs in groundwater depths of 2 - 4 m.

Pharmacological characterization of chick embryo hepatic beta-ARs showed that they preferentially bind mammalian beta 2 -agonists and antagonists. PCB 126 significantly decreased hepatic beta-AR affinity (Kd) compared to vehicle-treated embryos. There were, however, no significant differences between control and PCB 126 -treated embryos, or control and vehicle-treated embryos. This suggests there is an effect of the corn oil vehicle.

40|$|Ketoconazole (KCZ) {{has been}} shown to exhibit {{anti-inflammatory}} effects in addition to its inhibitory effects against fungi; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a receptor that is activated by polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs) and <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as dioxin, is a sensor of the redox system against oxidative stress and regulates nuclear factor-erythroid 2 -related factor- 2 (Nrf 2), a master switch of the redox machinery. To clarify whether KCZ modulates AhR-Nrf 2 function leading to redox system activation, cultured human keratinocytes were treated with KCZ. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that KCZ induced AhR nuclear translocation, resulting in the upregulation of CYP 1 A 1 mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, KCZ actively switched on Nrf 2 nuclear translocation and quinone oxidoreductase 1 expression. Tumor necrosis factor-α- and benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) -induced reactive oxidative species (ROS) and IL- 8 production were effectively inhibited by KCZ. Knockdown of either AhR or Nrf 2 abolished the inhibitory capacity of KCZ on ROS and IL- 8 production. In addition, KCZ-induced Nrf 2 activation was canceled by AhR knockdown. Moreover, KCZ inhibited BaP-induced 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine and IL- 8 production. In conclusion, the engagement of AhR by KCZ exhibits the cytoprotective effect mediated by the Nrf 2 redox system, which potently downregulates either cytokine-induced (AhR-independent) or PAH-induced (AhR-dependent) oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} (dioxin) receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor {{that produces a}} wide range of biological and toxic effects in many species and tissues. Whereas the best-characterized high-affinity ligands include structurally related <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (HAHs) and polycyclic <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs), the AhR is promiscuous and can also be activated by structurally diverse exogenous and endogenous chemicals. However, little is known about how these diverse ligands actually bind to and activate the AhR. Utilizing AhR ligand binding, DNA binding, and reporter gene expression assays, we have identified a novel ligand-selective antagonist (CH 223191) that preferentially inhibits the ability of some classes of AhR agonists (2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related HAHs), but not others (PAHs, flavonoids, or indirubin), to bind to and/or activate the AhR and AhR signal transduction. HAH-specific antagonism of AhR-dependent reporter gene expression by CH 223191 was observed with mouse, rat, human, and guinea pig cell lines. Ligand- and species-selective antagonism was also observed with the AhR antagonists 3 &# 39;-methoxy- 4 &# 39;-nitroflavone and 6, 2 &# 39;, 4 &# 39;,-trimethoxyflavone. Our results suggest that the differences in the binding by various ligands to the AhR contribute to the observed structural diversity of AhR ligands and could contribute in ligand-specific variation in AhR functionality and the toxic and biological effects of various classes of AhR agonists...|$|R
40|$|Activation of the Ah {{receptor}} (AhR) by <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (HAHs), such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin (TCDD, dioxin), {{can produce}} {{a wide variety of}} toxic and biological effects. While recent {{studies have shown that the}} AhR can bind and be activated by structurally diverse chemicals, how widespread of these AhR agonists are in environmental, biological and synthetic materials remains to be determined. Using AhR-based assays, we demonstrate the presence of potent AhR agonists in a variety of common commercial and consumer items. Solvent extracts of paper, rubber and plastic products contain chemicals that can bind to and stimulate AhR DNA binding and/or AhR-dependent gene expression in hepatic cytosol, cultured cell lines, human epidermis and zebrafish embryos. In contrast to TCDD and other persistent dioxin-like HAHs, activation of AhR-dependent gene expression by these extracts was transient, suggesting that the agonists are metabolically labile. Solvent extracts of rubber products produce AhR-dependent developmental toxicity in zebrafish in vivo, and inhibition of expression of the metabolic enzyme CYP 1 A, significantly increased their toxic potency. Although the identity of the responsible AhR-active chemicals and their toxicological impact remain to be determined, our data demonstrate that AhR active chemicals are widely distributed in everyday products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the biological and toxicological effects of <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). When activated by dioxin, the cytosolic AhR protein complex translocates into the nucleus and dimerizes with the ARNT (Ah receptor nuclear translocator) protein. The heteromeric ligand:AhR/Arnt complex then recognizes and binds to its specific DNA recognition site, the dioxin response element (DRE). DREs are located upstream of cytochrome P 4501 A 1 (CYP 1 A 1) and other AhR-responsive genes, and binding of the AhR complex stimulates their transcription. Although CYP 1 A 1 expression {{has been used as}} the model system to define the biochemical and molecular mechanism of AhR action, there is still limited knowledge about the roles of each of the seven DREs located in the CYP 1 A 1 promoter. These seven DREs are conserved in mouse, human and rat. Deletion analysis showed that a single DRE at- 488 was enough to activate the transcription. Truncation analysis demonstrated that the DRE at site- 981 has the highest transcriptional efficiency in response to TCDD. This result was verified by mutation analysis, suggesting that the conserved DRE at site- 981 could represent a significant an...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) {{and related}} <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (e. g., PCDFs), often called "dioxins", are ubiquitously present {{environmental}} contaminants. Some of them, notably 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), {{are among the}} most toxic synthetic compounds known. The biological effects of dioxins are mediated via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Mutations in the AhR transactivation domain are linked to sensitivity to the acute lethality of TCDD. We present here a study of AhR gene polymorphism in normal and cancer human tissues affecting pre-mRNA splicing in the AhR gene-coding transactivation domain region (exon 10, intron 10, exon 11 region), previously shown to be associated with AhR dysfunction. We tested 126 pairs of normal and cancer tissue samples from liver, lung, stomach, kidney, mucous, breast, and pancreas of 49 males and 77 females (45 - 70 years of age). We used in vitro splicing assay, RT-PCR and sequencing methods. Our results showed that in an in vitro system it is possible to reconstitute cellular pre-mRNA splicing events. Tested cancer tissues did not contain mutations in the AhR transactivation domain region when the DNA sequences were compared with those from normal tissues. There were also no differences in AhR mRNA splice variants between normal and malignant breast tissues and no polymorphisms in the studied regions or cDNA...|$|R
40|$|We {{employed}} DNA microarray {{to identify}} unique hepatic gene expression patterns associated with subchronic exposure to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and other <b>halogenated</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (HAHs). Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed for 13 weeks to toxicologically equivalent doses of four different HAHs {{based on the}} toxic equivalency factor of each chemical: TCDD (100 ng/kg/day), 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF; 200 ng/kg/day), 3, 3 ´, 4, 4 ´, 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126; 1, 000 ng/kg/day), or 2, 2 ´, 4, 4 ´, 5, 5 ´hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153; 1, 000 µg/kg/day). Global gene expression profiles for each exposure, which account for 8, 799 gene probe sets contained on Affymetrix RGU 34 A GeneChips, were compared by principal components analysis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands TCDD, PeCDF, and PCB 126 produced very similar global gene expression profiles that were unique from the nonAhR ligand PCB 153, underscoring the extensive impact of AhR activation and/or the resulting hepatic injury on global gene expression in female rat liver. Many genes were coexpressed during the 13 -week TCDD, PeCDF, or PCB 126 exposures, including classical AhR-regulated genes and some genes not previously characterized as being AhR regulated, such as carcinoembryonic-cell adhesion molecule 4 (C-CAM 4) and adenylate cyclase-associated protein...|$|R
