His life is also credited by Jains with starting the institution of charity (daana) from layperson to mendicants, when he received surgarcane juice in his hand from king Sreyamsa, to break his fast. This is accepted in the Jain tradition as what started the tradition of alms giving in its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E

In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E

He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode.

5|$|His {{aversion to}} the {{imposition}} of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, property rights and even the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E

50|$|The novel explores several social {{problems}} in Victorian England, especially those {{relating to the}} <b>institutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> the Church, and education. These themes are developed in particular through Hardy's use of contrast. For example, {{at the beginning of}} their relationship, Jude's Christian faith contrasts with Sue's religious scepticism, a contrast which is heightened even further by their later role-reversal. Although the central characters represent both perspectives, the novel as a whole is firmly critical of Christianity and social institutions in general.|$|R
