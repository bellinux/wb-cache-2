5|$|Between 1800 and 1992, {{at least}} 37 {{instances}} of Sallekhana are recorded in Jain literature. There were 260 and 90 recorded Sallekhana deaths among Svetambara and Digambara Jains respectively between 1993 and 2003. According to Jitendra Shah, the Director of L D Institute of Indology in Ahmedabad, {{an average of}} about 240 Jains practice Sallekhana each year in India. Most of them are not recorded or noticed. Statistically, Sallekhana is undertaken both by men and women of all economic classes and among the educationally forward Jains. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> more often by women than men.|$|E
5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which quantum state the first particle will take on when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed,</b> so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E

25|$|There is also {{an attempt}} to bring nanofluidic {{technology}} into energy conversion.

25|$|Sleep is {{sometimes}} thought to help conserve energy, though this theory {{is not fully}} adequate as it only decreases metabolism by about 5–10%.

25|$|In haploids {{produced}} from anther culture, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>observed</b> that some plants are aneuploids {{and some are}} mixed haploid-diploid types. Another disadvantage associated with the double haploidy is the cost involved in establishing tissue culture and growth facilities. The over-usage of doubled haploidy may reduce genetic variation in breeding germplasm. Hence one has to take several factors into consideration before deploying doubled haploidy in breeding programmes.|$|E
