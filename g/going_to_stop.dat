5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it.... n his own way, the man integrated football the right way – {{and no one was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him.|$|E
5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|Strasburg {{was born}} in San Diego, California, He credits his {{maternal}} grandmother with helping him develop his baseball skills as a child. She would frequently play catch and even work on pitching with him. He labels her {{as one of his}} biggest inspirations. He was married on January 9, 2010, to Rachel Lackey, whom he had met while they were students at San Diego State. On June 24, 2014, Strasburg stated {{in an interview that he}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> chewing tobacco in the wake of his college coach Tony Gwynn's death, although he admitted to The Washington Post two years later that he had not yet completely kicked the habit.|$|E

6000|$|... "What is it? How can {{you have}} the courage to ask such a question, Toribia? Look at the {{confusion}} your pestilent fowls are creating amongst my papers--papers that concern the safety of the republic! Woman, what measures are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> this before I have your fowls all killed on the spot?" ...|$|R
5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him.|$|E
25|$|The Get Your Sting and Blackout World Tour {{promoting}} {{the album was}} initially reported to be the band's last tour, though this proved {{not to be the}} case. In later interviews given after the tour had started, at least two band members (Klaus Meine and Matthias Jabs) stated that the band was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> touring and was in fact, working on new material.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask you," [...] said Brown. [...] "It's jolly rum. I {{distinctly}} {{remember him}} giving {{it out in}} hall that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>stopped</b> because of the O.W.'s day row." ...|$|R

25|$|New Zealand's chief administrator, Walter Hadlee, had {{advocated}} a compromise from the start. Now {{he had no}} objection to WSC making a brief tour of his country in November, nor was he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the Kiwis' best player, his son Richard, from appearing with WSC. The South Africans, subject to an international boycott caused by the apartheid policy of their government, were keen to see their individual cricketers compete with the world’s best. Some were prepared to acclaim South Africa as the best {{side of the world}} {{on the basis of the}} performances of some of their players in WSC.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} Test, England made a tortuous 133 in 115 four-ball overs, with George 'Joey' Palmer taking 7 for 68. By close of {{play on the}} first day, Australia were in the driving seat at 86 for 1. Whilst England {{recovered}} to dismiss them for 197 and then made 232 themselves, they were never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Australia getting the 169 runs they needed to win. The third Test was even more one-sided. England got 188. Then Australia made 262, with Percy McDonnell making 147, Alec Bannerman 70, and no other batsman scoring more than 7! England again collapsed to 134, and Australia won by 6 wickets.|$|E
25|$|Kazuma is a 16-year-old game-obsessed shut-in, {{becoming}} one after having his heart broken by his childhood friend in middle school. While {{returning home from}} buying a video game, he attempted to save a classmate from being hit by what he believed was a truck (which {{turned out to be}} a tractor that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> beforehand), but went through acute stress reaction and died. As a result, he is sent to the parallel reality and becomes a role-playing game character. He has average stats in crucial categories, but above average intelligence and extremely high luck, neither of which are important for adventurers. Regardless, he becomes one and learns basic skills such as stealing, archery, monster detection, and magic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series was}} fronted by Amanda Holden. She said: [...] "I'm so {{delighted to be}} hosting this new series that will look into the amazing work the RSPCA do and {{hopefully}} we'll {{be able to find}} some much needed new homes for the pets featured on the show. I am just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> myself from taking them all home with me!" ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, across town, Sam and Lila Loomis are {{murdered by}} an assailant with a knife. Claiborne is {{convinced}} that Norman faked his death and proceeded to kill them. The police are skeptical. As they are surveying the crime scene, they see a news article talking about a movie being made based on Norman's life. Claiborne {{is convinced that}} Norman is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> this movie by killing everybody, so he heads out there <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him.|$|R

25|$|Opposition {{from the}} many railway {{travellers}} resulted. Their case was centred {{on the fact that}} a motorway costing formula was used to prove that the users would waste some £750,000 in excess travel compared to BR's calculated loss of only £260,000. In the end the TUCC upheld the users' complaints; but it was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> there. In early 1968 BR made another attempt to close the line. This time the Transport Minister, Barbara Castle, requested more information from BR, which was furnished to her successor, Richard Marsh, who took over as Transport Minister in April 1968. At this time structural problems with the bridge over Cliffe High Street in Lewes were identified, which necessitated single line working, with a revised timetable in place to reflect this.|$|E
500|$|Meyer had a [...] "No Smoking" [...] sign {{added to}} the Enterprises bridge, which he {{recalled}} [...] "Everyone had a fit over [...] I said 'Why have they stopped smoking in the future? They've been smoking for four hundred years, you think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> in the next two?" [...] The sign appeared in the first shot of the film, but was removed for all others appearing in the final cut of the film.|$|E
500|$|Diefenbaker {{used the}} Pipeline Debate {{as a major}} theme in the campaign, one which he {{mentioned}} {{more than any other}} issue. [...] In Vancouver, he told the largest political crowd in the province since 1935, [...] "I give this assurance to Canadians—that the government shall be the servant and not the master of the people... The road of the Liberal party, unless it is stopped—and Howe has said, 'Who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> us?'—will lead to the virtual extinction of parliamentary government. You will have the form, but the substance will be gone." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{became a}} bi-lateral school in 1973 for ages 12-18 with 1,200 boys and girls, when it joined with Stanmer Secondary Modern School. It became {{administered}} by East Sussex Education Committee. By the late 1970s {{it was a}} comprehensive school. It became a school many parents from Brighton suburbs tried to avoid in the 1980s, as it served the council estates along Lewes Road, with some parents even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> court <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> their children attending the school.|$|R

500|$|By early September, Saladin had {{realised}} that harassing the Frankish army with {{a limited}} portion of his troops was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> its advance. In order to do this he needed to commit his entire army to a serious attack. Fortuitously for Saladin, the Crusaders had to traverse {{one of the few}} forested regions of Palestine, the [...] "Wood of Arsuf", which ran parallel to the sea shore for more than [...] The woodland would mask the disposition of his army [...] and allow a sudden attack to be launched.|$|E
500|$|In a November 2010 {{interview}} {{reported at}} NME.com, drummer Joey Kramer {{confirmed that the}} band had every intention to finish and release their long-delayed album in 2011, stating, [...] "Really, {{at this point in}} time, the only thing that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> us is if someone out-and-out dies. Other than that, we've already been through what we've been through and stood the test of time. What else is there?" [...] On January 18, 2011, Tyler declared that [...] "Joe (Perry) has got some licks and I've got a bunch of songs that I've written for solo and/or Aerosmith" [...] and the band would start prepping the album that week.|$|E
500|$|Bill Drummond {{summed up}} The JAMs' {{approach}} to composition {{in the first}} [...] "KLF Information Sheet", sent out in October 1987: [...] "We made [...] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and the stuff {{that came out of}} our mouths.... Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> working just because there is a law against what you are doing." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This {{is really}} {{promising}} that the labels are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>stop</b> kvetching and start thinking intelligently about where their money's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come {{from in the}} 21st century," [...] said Aram Sinnreich, of Radar Research, being quoted in the Los Angeles Times. [...] "SpiralFrog is one small step for the record labels, one great leap for music kind." ...|$|R

50|$|On {{weekends}} and Holidays (noted {{in the current}} train schedule), Track 1 is not used. Currently (2009), trains originating from Gladstone use Summit as a final destination (on the Wall Track). That same train is then used as a Gladstone bound train originating at Summit Station upon {{the arrival of the}} Dover bound train. Trains originating in Dover follow though to New York, picking up passengers at Summit Station (on Track 2) desiring to go to Hoboken, where Hoboken-bound passengers then transfer at Newark Broad Street Station. Trains originating in New York then use Summit as a transfer Station for passengers <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stops</b> along the Gladstone line, and then itself for passengers going towards Dover Station.|$|R
500|$|He {{began the}} 1981 season with five {{consecutive}} 100-yard games, including a 253-yard effort. [...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid like that would do if he ran {{as much as the}} guy on the West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch is going to be our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him now. And so be it." [...] His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.|$|E
500|$|Paige {{has gained}} herself a {{reputation}} as someone who can be [...] "difficult". [...] The Times Brian Logan wrote, [...] "Paige is not exactly known for her humility. In newspaper profiles, that dread word 'difficult' is often applied". On one occasion, she told a male interviewer that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> giving interviews to female reporters because, in her own words, [...] "I don't trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with you and then betray it every time". What {{has been seen as}} a cold side to her personality was also noted by Logan, but Paige has said that a common misconception of her is that she is confident and very serious. [...] Another editor found her [...] "refreshingly down-to-earth" [...] and [...] "very friendly".|$|E
500|$|Roz Laws {{writing for}} the Sunday Mercury felt there was [...] "plenty of chemistry" [...] present between Gilly and Steph. Their {{relationship}} was frequently commented on by the Daily Mail Jaci Stephen in her weekly soap column. She expressed disinterest in Steph and Cheryl's rivalry over Gilly, and found it implausible that Jem and Steph would quarrel over him. When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010, Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short-lived. She bemoaned the lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead-up to their wedding, observing: [...] "Of course, {{you know that the}} moment she says that nothing is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> her marrying Gilly, the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse, shortly behind the wedding car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm going," [...] said Mr. Parker, {{picking up}} his hat. [...] "And I'll give you a piece of advice, too.

That's all I've got to say, and that goes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I didn't do it, ma'm," [...] the boy repeated. [...] "Directly I {{got out of}} the gate, I {{started off}} to run home. I hadn't gone not twenty yards when I heard a smash; but I wasn't <b>going</b> for <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>to</b> see what it was. It weren't no {{business}} of mine, and that's all I know about it." ...|$|R
