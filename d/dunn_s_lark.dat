40|$|We {{developed}} twenty microsatellite markers for the Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark</b> (Chersophilus duponti), one of {{the most}} endangered European bird species, and tested in two related, more widely distributed species: crested lark (Galerida cristata) and thekla lark (Galerida theklae). 14 markers amplified and were polymorphic in Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark,</b> 11 in crested lark and 6 in thekla lark. Microsatellite var- iability analyses were carried out on Dupont 0 <b>s</b> <b>lark</b> (N = 23 – 28 individuals), crested lark (N = 9 – 10) and thekla lark (N = 14) populations in NE Spain showing moderate/high diversity, ranging from 1 to 13 alleles per locus. The mean allelic richness in Dupont’s lark was 6. 21 and expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0. 195 to 0. 848 and from 0. 071 to 0. 889, respectively. Crested and thekla larks showed moderate/high diversity with a mean allelic richness of 4. 36 and 4. 67, respectively. This microsatellite set could be useful for population genetic studies of lark species widely differing in popula- tion fragmentation and conservation status across the Old World. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

J., <b>Dunn,</b> <b>S.</b> D., Wada, Y., and Futai, M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 4126 – 4131). The Arrhenius slopes {{of the speed of}} the individual 120 ° steps and reciprocal of the pause length between rotation steps were very similar, indicating a flat energy pathway followed by the rotationally coupled catalytic cycle. In contrast, the Arrhenius slope of the reciprocal pause length of the γM 23 K mutant F 1 was significantly increased, whereas that of the rotation rate was similar to wild type. The effects of the rotor γM 23 K substitution and the counteracting effects of βE 381 D mutation in the interacting stator subunits demonstrate that the rotor-stator interactions play critical roles in the utilization of stored elastic energy. The γM 23 K enzyme must overcome an abrupt activation energy barrier, forcing it onto a less favored pathway that results in uncoupling catalysis from rotation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Modern {{infrastructure}} {{systems are}} vital to the functioning of modern society. They promote social well-being, support economic development and are crucial in mitigating the effects of natural hazards. While there is some understanding of their mitigation role, {{there has been little}} quantifiable work on how they support our societies or how they stimulate economic development. Some recent analysis of infrastructure systems have shown that many of these seemingly different systems display similar architectures to each other leading to the hypothesis that the evolution of these systems is a result of underlying drivers that are common to all. This paper presents a network model that captures the growth of infrastructure networks in terms of architecture, hazard tolerance and geographical characteristics. The results presented in the paper suggest that the model may be the basis for an enhanced understanding of the role that infrastructure plays in sustaining our communities.

40|$|Abstract. Calcineurin-dependent {{pathways}} {{have been}} implicated in the hypertrophic response of skeletal muscle to functional overload (OV) (<b>Dunn,</b> <b>S.</b> E., J. L. Burns, and R. N. Michel. 1999. J. Biol. Chem. 274 : 21908 – 21912). Here we show that skeletal muscles overexpressing an activated form of calcineurin (CnA*) exhibit a phenotype indistinguishable from wild-type counterparts under normal weightbearing conditions and respond to OV with a similar doubling in cell size and slow fiber number. These adaptations occurred {{despite the fact that}} CnA * muscles displayed threefold higher calcineurin activity and enhanced dephosphorylation of the calcineurin targets NFATc 1, MEF 2 A, and MEF 2 D. Moreover, when calcineurin signaling is compromised with cyclosporin A, muscles from OV wildtype mice display a lower molecular weight form of CnA, originally detected in failing hearts, whereas CnA * muscles are spared this manifestation. We also show that OV-induced growth and type transformations are prevented in muscle fibers of transgenic mice overexpressing a peptide that inhibits calmodulin from signaling to target enzymes. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that both calcineurin and its activity-linked upstream signaling elements are crucial for muscle adaptations to OV and that, unless significantly compromised, endogenous levels of this enzyme can accommodate large fluctuations in upstream calciumdependent signaling events...|$|R
