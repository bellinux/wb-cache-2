40|$|In this thesis, the development, implementation, and {{evaluation}} of <b>educational</b> <b>programming</b> for K- 12 school groups in visitor-centered museums in the United States are examined. A literature review consisting of {{an examination of the}} history of museum education, the educational theories that inform programming development, the common services provided by a museum???s education department, and the goals and impacts of visitor-centered learning and Common Core standards in the museum setting is presented, followed by case studies of three museums with visitor-centered <b>educational</b> <b>programming.</b> Four principles that support successful <b>educational</b> <b>programming</b> for K- 12 school groups in visitor-centered museums are then outlined. It is concluded that in order to create dynamic <b>educational</b> <b>programs</b> that resonate with visitors on a personal, meaningful level, museum educators designing visitor-centered <b>educational</b> <b>programs</b> must be willing to experiment with a variety of educational theories and teaching techniques that will ultimately support and enable the development of strong museum community partnerships...|$|R
