2500|$|Especially {{given that}} he was from Pudsey, Hutton was often portrayed as Sutcliffe's protégé but Hutton {{maintained}} {{that it was the}} coaching of George Hirst that did most to develop his career. He said of Sutcliffe: [...] "You do learn a lot from watching a player of Herbert's class. [...] It was an enriching and invaluable experience to bat with him". [...] Sutcliffe's view of Hutton was that he was [...] "a marvel – the discovery of a generation". [...] Hutton said that his shyness {{and the fact that he}} was twenty years younger than Sutcliffe made it difficult for him to approach his partner when he needed help, which he more readily got from Bill Bowes and Hedley Verity. About Sutcliffe he said: [...] "I did not find it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him".|$|E
6000|$|... "And I am sure I {{hope you}} will," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Leslie. And then {{the subject was}} allowed to drop; for Mr. Leslie {{knew that it was}} not always <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Miss Jack on such matters.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Mr. Spillikins, [...] "you're so awfully sympathetic. It {{makes it}} so <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. With other girls, {{especially}} with clever ones, even with Dulphemia. I often feel a perfect jackass beside them. But I don t feel that way with you at all." ...|$|E
50|$|An only child, Buckley {{found his}} mother <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{than his father}} because of her {{attitude}} toward religion.|$|R
5000|$|Each Year the {{graduating class}} of Guilderland High School {{collects}} a [...] "Senior Superlative" [...] survey {{to be presented}} in the yearbook. Superlatives include Best Friends, Best Smile, <b>Easiest</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> Best Laugh, etc.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so fast. It may be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you like}} this. I {{do not know}} how the laws are over here. Maybe this sort of thing is not permitted. You will promise me that I shall have no trouble over the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some do; Aunt Jessie and {{her boys}} have capital talks, and I wish we could; but mother's so busy with her housekeeping, and father with his business, there {{never seems to}} be any time {{for that sort of}} thing; even if there was, it don't seem as if it would be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them, because we've never got into the way of it, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then they}} walked down through Portman Square and Grosvenor Square, and across Piccadilly to Jermyn Street. John Eames {{acknowledged}} to himself that it was odd {{that he should have}} an earl leaning on his arm as he passed along through the streets. At home, in his own life, his daily companions were Cradell and Amelia Roper, Mrs Lupex and Mrs Roper. The difference was very great, and yet he found it quite as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the earl as to Mrs Lupex.|$|E
60|$|Until to-day {{she would}} have resented the {{suggestion}} {{that she was in}} love with George. She liked to be with him, partly because he was so <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> and partly because it was exciting to be continually resisting the will power he made no secret of trying to exercise. But to-day there was a difference. She had suspected it at luncheon and she realized it now. As she looked down at him from behind the curtain, and marked his air of gloom, she could no longer disguise it from herself.|$|E
6000|$|Foster remarked the girl's blush. Since {{she knew}} so much, it was plain that Lawrence {{had asked her}} to marry him and she had agreed. He {{imagined}} that Lawrence wanted Mrs. Stephen to hear somebody else's account of the matter, and although it would have been <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Lawrence alone, he asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} that you did from the first," [...] said Lenore. [...] "And {{it would make it}} much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you than to any outsider, who would never understand, even if it were {{possible}} for me to explain, {{how hard it is to}} see which way my duty lies--especially filial." ...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that people find it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other with dogs as the initial focus, {{breaking}} down the usual social barriers that make people perceive others as strangers. {{many of whom are}} unable to properly exercise their dogs and who could benefit from taking their dogs to a dog park.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{truth about}} this, and a perspicuity in making {{arrangements}} for lessening her immediate embarrassment, which had some effect in softening Eleanor's anger. So she suffered herself to walk {{by his side}} over the now deserted lawn, till {{they came to the}} drawing-room window. There was something about Bertie Stanhope which gave him, in the estimation of everyone, a different standing from that which any other man would occupy under similar circumstances. Angry as Eleanor was, and great as was her cause for anger, she was not half as angry with him as she would have been with anyone else. He was apparently so simple, so good-natured, so unaffected and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> that she had already half-forgiven him before he was at the drawing-room window.|$|E
60|$|In {{course of}} time other letters came from George, but Alec wrote no more. The days passed slowly. Lady Kelsey {{returned}} from the Riviera. Dick came back from Naples to enjoy {{the pleasures of the}} London season. He appeared thoroughly to enjoy his idleness, signally falsifying the predictions of those who had told him {{that it was impossible to}} be happy without regular work. Mrs. Crowley settled down once more in her house in Norfolk Street. During her absence she had written reams by every post to Lucy, and Lucy had looked forward very much to seeing her again. The little American was almost the only one of her friends with whom she did not feel shy. The apartness which her nationality gave her, made Mrs. Crowley more <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> She was too fond of Lucy to pity her. The general election came before it was expected, and Robert Boulger succeeded to the seat which Dick Lomas was only too glad to vacate. Bobbie was very charming. He surrounded Lucy with a protecting care, and she could not fail to be touched by his entire devotion. When he thought she had recovered somewhat from the first blow of her father's sentence, he sent her a letter in which once more he besought her to marry him. She was grateful to him for having chosen that method of expressing himself, for it seemed possible in writing to tell him with greater tenderness that if she could not accept his love she deeply valued his affection.|$|E
6000|$|But {{nevertheless}} Mr. Glascock had {{not quite}} {{made up his}} mind to ask the elder sister to be his wife. He was one of those men to whom love-making does not come very easy, although he was never so much at his ease as when he was in company with ladies. He was sorely in want of a wife, but he was aware that at different periods during the last fifteen years he had been angled for as a fish. Mothers in England had tried to catch him, and of such mothers he had come to have the strongest possible detestation. He had seen the hooks,--or perhaps had fancied that he saw them when they were not there. Lady Janes and Lady Sarahs had been hard upon him, till he learned to buckle himself into triple armour when he went amongst them, and yet he wanted a wife;--no man more sorely wanted one. The reader will perhaps remember how he went down to Nuncombe Putney in quest of a wife, but all in vain. The lady in that case had been so explicit with him that he could not hope for a more favourable answer; and, indeed, he would not have cared to marry a girl who had told him that she preferred another man to himself, even if it had been possible for him to do so. Now he had met a lady very different from those with whom he had hitherto associated,--but not the less manifestly a lady. Caroline Spalding was bright, pleasant, attractive, very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> and yet quite able to hold her own. But the American Minister was--a bore; and Miss Petrie was--unbearable. He had often told himself that in this matter of marrying a wife he would please himself altogether, that he would allow himself to be tied down by no consideration of family pride,--that he would consult nothing but his own heart and feelings. As for rank, he could give that to his wife. As for money, he had plenty of that also. He wanted a woman that was not blasée with the world, that was not a fool, and who would respect him. The more he thought of it, the more sure he was that he had seen none who pleased him so well as Caroline Spalding; and yet he was a little afraid of taking a step that would be irrevocable. Perhaps the American Minister might express a wish to end his days at Monkhams, and might think it desirable to have Miss Petrie always with him as a private secretary in poetry! ...|$|E
5000|$|Says Kris: [...] "Besides that, {{they are}} the most {{accessible}} group--the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> We've got it so they're the ones who are doing the shooting and they're the ones who are digesting that same information. We don't see {{a lot of good things}} for teens and we really wanted this to be one of the good things." ...|$|R
3000|$|... (…) {{living in}} our Oxfordshire village, I had many friends, {{but all of}} them were English friends. I didn’t meet anybody from Poland or any other Eastern European country. So I felt a little bit {{isolated}} sometimes, you know. Everybody is brought up in their own culture and obviously it’s sometimes <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> somebody who understands you at the same level.|$|R
6000|$|So far Nina had {{performed}} {{but a small}} part of the task which she had before her. She found it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the old man about the title-deeds of the house in the Kleinseite than she did to tell him of her own affairs. But the thing was to be done, though the doing of it was difficult; and, after a pause, she persevered. [...] "And I told aunt Sophie," [...] she said, with her eyes turned upon the ground, [...] "of my engagement with Anton." ...|$|R
50|$|Sen is {{also said}} to {{resemble}} her grandmother {{much more than}} either her mother or her sister. Journalists who meet her describe her as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> and devoid of starry airs.|$|E
50|$|Ranked {{second most}} popular. <b>Easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> and loves sports. He {{had a friend}} who had once betrayed him and he could not trust anyone again. His smiles and laughs prove to be fake. He loves his dog, whom you can {{normally}} find going on a walk with.|$|E
50|$|Amanda {{is portrayed}} as very fragile, self-doubting, and unassertive, lacking {{self-confidence}} and afraid to speak up for herself, except when there's something wrong with her. She is also portrayed as innocent, unsuspecting, and naive. Despite her suicidal past and self-doubting nature, Amanda is also bright, cheery, warm, affable, and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> Shortly before her death, Amanda, with Candace's support, {{was in the process}} of suing her parents for her inheritance from her grandfather.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! and it's much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> than <b>to</b> bear either,' said Madame, {{rubbing her}} nose with much {{irritability}} of manner. 'There, {{get to your}} work, child, and put the things in order, do.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "May Day" [...] in [...] "Tales of the Jazz Age" [...] "A {{man with}} {{prominent}} teeth cut in. Edith inhaled a slight cloud of whiskey. She liked men {{to have had}} something to drink; they were so much more cheerful, and appreciative and complimentary—much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> [...] "My name's Dean, Philip Dean," [...] he said cheerfully. [...] "You don't remember me, I know, but you used to come up to New Haven with a fellow I roomed with senior year, Gordon Sterrett." [...] Edith looked up quickly. [...] "Yes, I went up with him twice—to the Pump and Slipper and the Junior prom." ...|$|R

50|$|Dennis Mira is {{the husband}} of Dr. Charlotte Mira. He {{seems to be a}} very {{absent-minded}} fellow, walking around with his shirt buttons mismatched. However, he is a very kind man; Eve is very fond of him and finds it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. He is very nonthreatening to her; however, he is intelligent, and as Charlotte says, very good at separating what is good and evil. Mira occasionally teaches at Colombia University.|$|E
50|$|Kirsty - Unlike {{the rest}} of the gang, Kirsty is a highly {{organised}} person who knows exactly where she is going in life. She is highly intelligent but has very poor people skills, something she views as a character flaw in everyone else. She is trying to get Johnny's life organised since he is clearly incapable of doing it himself, but has not realised that he does not especially want his life organised. He finds her very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> since she never listens. She is the only female member of the gang.|$|E
50|$|Kirsty. (Also {{known as}} Sigourney, Kimberly, Klytemnestra and Kasandra). Unlike {{the rest of}} the gang, Kirsty is a highly {{organised}} person who knows exactly where she's going in life. She is highly intelligent but has very poor people skills, something she views as a character flaw in everyone else. She is trying to get Johnny's life organised since he is clearly incapable of doing it himself, but hasn't realised that he doesn't especially want his life organised. He finds her very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> since she never listens. Unlike her most obvious Discworld counterparts, Susan Sto Helit and Granny Weatherwax, Kirsty has a tendency to romanticise things hidden beneath her practicality and finds Johnny's down-to-Earth attitude to things almost as annoying as his lack of direction.|$|E
60|$|Another misfortune was, {{that he was}} a bachelor. Ladies think, and I, for one, {{think that}} ladies are quite right in so thinking, that doctors should be married men. All the world feels that a man when married acquires some of the {{attributes}} of an old woman--he becomes, to a certain extent, a motherly sort of being; he acquires a conversance with women's ways and women's wants, and loses the wilder and offensive sparks of his virility. It must be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> such a one about Matilda's stomach, and the growing pains in Fanny's legs, than to a young bachelor. This impediment also stood much in Dr Thorne's way during his first years at Greshamsbury.|$|R
5000|$|In California, Fang's gang is {{not getting}} along so well. Maya and Fang have a {{conversation}} in which Fang notices some minor differences between the two. Maya is softer than Max, <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> She is also more vulnerable, emotionally. Fang is about to kiss her {{when the rest of}} his gang attacks the two with Cheez Whiz. Soon Fang surprises Max by calling her, saying that he needs her to meet him in San Diego. Fang isn't very happy because Max would rather throw Dylan in his face and Max is mad because Fang would rather throw Maya in Max's face. Fang is [...] "mad" [...] at Dylan because he is [...] "Max's perfect other half".|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's not <b>easy</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you,' {{returned}} Lizzie, in some confusion, 'for {{you see all}} {{the consequences}} of what I say, as soon as I say it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{readers of}} Consumer Reports {{magazine}} scored independent community pharmacies the highest based on overall satisfaction and service among {{all types of}} pharmacy providers. Readers who responded to a survey expressed their highest satisfaction rate (94%) regarding their experiences at a neighborhood independent pharmacy, based on pharmacists’ knowledge about drugs and other products, helpfulness and courtesy, speed, accuracy, and personal service. In addition, at independent pharmacies patients were {{twice as likely as}} at chain drugstores to encounter pharmacists who were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> and provided one-on-one consultations. Senior editor of Consumer Reports, Todd Marks said, “We found that the independents made fewer errors, offered swifter service at the pharmacy counter, and {{were more likely to have}} medications ready for pickup when promised.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Especially {{given that}} he was from Pudsey, Hutton was often portrayed as Sutcliffe's protégé but Hutton {{maintained}} {{that it was the}} coaching of George Hirst that did most to develop his career. He said of Sutcliffe: [...] "You do learn a lot from watching a player of Herbert's class. It was an enriching and invaluable experience to bat with him". [...] Sutcliffe's view of Hutton was that he was [...] "a marvel - the discovery of a generation". [...] Hutton said that his shyness {{and the fact that he}} was twenty years younger than Sutcliffe made it difficult for him to approach his partner when he needed help, which he more readily got from Bill Bowes and Hedley Verity. About Sutcliffe he said: [...] "I did not find it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him".|$|E
5000|$|Jammer {{believed}} that he joined the NCP to get Cylon Centurions off the street, to lessen tensions on the planet, and to prevent further over-reactions by patrolling Cylons, as happened at the Temple Massacre. However, his actions began wearing on his conscience, especially {{when he found out}} that Cally Tyrol was on a list the Cylons have set for execution. At first, he asked Sharon [...] "Boomer" [...] Valerii to see if she could let her go, but Boomer said she couldnt do anything about it. Jammer seemed to be awkward about talking to Boomer because he was friends with her when she was (unknowingly) masquerading as a human aboard Galactica. Boomer found it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. Before the mass execution was interrupted by Colonial fighters, Jammer, in his NCP uniform and mask, allowed Cally to make an escape by cutting off her restraints.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{no sound}} effects beyond the almost ambient-like playing of normal life sounds, and the Aces' {{inexperience}} as actors probably worked in their favour: they simply played {{as though they}} were allowing listeners to eavesdrop on their own real-life conversations, allowing Easy Aces listeners more than those of many shows to believe the Aces really could have been their own unusual neighbours. The couple worked from a card table with a microphone sunk in its center, feeling it was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> each other in this manner rather than standing at a microphone. In addition, as Arthur Frank Wertheim noted in his book Radio Comedy, Ace shunned belly laughs in favour of consistent character humour. [...] "A lot of times, on the air," [...] Wertheim quoted Ace as saying, [...] "I noticed comics in a sketch do a joke that destroys the character because it gets a big laugh." ...|$|R
60|$|So far as Lothair was concerned, {{the luncheon}} was unsuccessful. His {{conversational}} powers deserted him. He answered in monosyllables, and never originated a remark. He was greatly relieved when they rose {{and returned to}} the gallery, in which they seemed all disposed to linger. The duke approached him, and, in his mood, he found it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> men than to women. Male conversation is of a coarser grain, and does not require so much play of thought and manner; discourse about Suez Canal, and Arab horses, and pipes, and pachas, can be carried on without any psychological effort, and, by degrees, banishes all sensibility. And yet he was rather dreamy, talked better than he listened, did not look his companion in the face, as the duke spoke, which was his custom, and his eye was wandering. Suddenly, Bertram having joined them, and speaking to his father, Lothair darted away and approached Lady Corisande, whom Lady Montairy had just quitted.|$|R
50|$|Sepetys {{decided she}} needed to write a fiction novel rather than a non-fiction volume {{as a way of}} making it <b>easier</b> for {{survivors}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. She interviewed dozens of people during her stay.|$|R
