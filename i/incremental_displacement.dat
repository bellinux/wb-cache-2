40|$|We {{consider}} {{the character of}} several finite deformations of compressible isotropic, nonlinear hyperelastic materials, specifically azimuthal shear of a thick-walled circular cylindrical tube, the bending deformation of a rectangular block and axial shear of a thick-walled circular cylindrical tube. For each problem the equilibrium equations are applied to the special case of isochoric deformation, and explicit necessary and sufficient conditions on the strain-energy function for the material to admit such a deformation are obtained. These conditions are examined for several strain-energy functions and in each case complete solutions of the equilibrium equations are obtained. The predictions of the shear response for different strain-energy functions are compared using numerical results to show the dependence of the applied shear stress on the resulting macroscopic deformation. It is then shown how consideration of isochoric deformations in compressible elastic materials provides a means of generating classes of strain-energy functions for which closed-form solutions can be found for incompressible materials. For the problem of bending deformation we find that isochoric deformation is not possible in a compressible material. The conditions for a non-isochoric bending deformation to be admitted by the equilibrium equations are then examined for each of three classes of compressible isotropic materials. Explicit solutions for each case are then derived. Finally, we consider an <b>incremental</b> <b>displacement</b> superimposed on the azimuthal shear of a circular cylindrical tube.

30|$|The axial {{shortening}} {{analysis of a}} concrete tall building essentially requires a construction sequence analysis and a creep analysis of the concrete structure. The construction sequence analysis {{is a series of}} static analyses, where new construction activities are applied to an already deformed and stressed structure (Kurc and Lulec 2013). Before defining the geometry of the newly added structure for the construction sequence analysis, it is necessary to determine what type of shortening is considered. Total shortening in a tall building can be divided into pre-installation and post-installation shortening (Fintel et al. 1987). Pre-installation shortening and post-installation shortening are sometimes called up-to-slab shortening and subsequent shortening, respectively. In cast-in-place concrete building structures, pre-installation shortening, which is the amount of shortening developed before slab installation, is meaningless since it is automatically compensated by leveling the forms. On the other hand, in steel building structures where columns are prepared to exact lengths, the total shortening, which is the sum of the pre-installation and the post-installation shortenings, is of significance because the slabs are built at a predetermined position. In this study, the analysis models are reinforced concrete tall buildings and the post-installation shortenings are calculated. In an analysis model, the displacement of each node is assumed to be zero until the node is generated. The <b>incremental</b> <b>displacements</b> are calculated for each construction step. The <b>incremental</b> vertical <b>displacements</b> at the columns and walls are accumulated to yield the post-installation shortening at the target time.|$|R

The {{fundamental}} principles {{involved in the}} selection and implementation of time integration schemes for finite element analysis of nonlinear creep problems are investigated. The relationship between {{the nature of the}} integration algorithms and the mechanical principles of the time-dependent problem is explored. The emphasis is on uniaxial creep and simple constitutive laws are adopted. The essential nature of the problem is presented in different formulations. The creep problem is contained in a system of nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations in the creep strains only. This suggests that the integration scheme should be applied to the creep strains whereas traditional methods approximate the stresses. An internal variable framework is used to demonstrate the links between a consistent mathematical programming formulation and the conventional Newton-Raphson procedures.

40|$|A {{shear band}} of finite length, formed inside a ductile {{material}} {{at a certain}} stage of a con- tinued homogeneous strain, provides a dynamic perturbation to an incident wave field, which strongly influences {{the dynamics of the}} material and affects its path to failure. The investigation of this perturbation is presented for a ductile metal, with reference to the incremental mechanics of a material obeying the J 2 -deformation theory of plasticity (a special form of prestressed, elastic, anisotropic, and incompressible solid). The treatment originates from the derivation of integral representations relating the incremental mechan- ical fields at every point of the medium to the <b>incremental</b> <b>displacement</b> jump across the shear band faces, generated by an impinging wave. The boundary integral equations (under the plane strain assumption) are numerically approached through a collocation technique, which keeps into account the singularity at the shear band tips and permits the analysis of an incident wave impinging a shear band. It is shown that the presence of the shear band induces a resonance, visible in the <b>incremental</b> <b>displacement</b> field and in the stress intensity factor at the shear band tips, which promotes shear band growth. Moreover, the waves scattered by the shear band are shown to generate a fine texture of vibrations, par- allel to the shear band line and propagating at a long distance from it, but leaving a sort of conical shadow zone, which emanates from the tips of the shear band...|$|E

In the proposed PSA scheme, such errors are removed completely by loading a particular arctangent function. Moreover, measuring efficiency of the proposed planar capacitive sensors is improved by combining coarse measurement and fine estimation. Experiments show unanimous results to model-based fitting.

40|$|Localized {{deformations}} in {{the form}} of shear bands are known to be preferential near-failure deformation modes of ductile materials. The development of shear localization bands has been also shown to be possible in anisotropic composite materials consisting of random distributions of aligned rigid fibres of elliptical cross section in a soft elastomeric matrix. In the present work, the incremental behaviour of a prestressed, elastic, anisotropic and incompressible material is analyzed in the dynamic regime, under the plain strain condition. Dynamic perturbations of stress/deformation incident wave fields, caused by a shear band of finite length, formed inside the material at a certain stage of continued deformation, are investigated. A shear band of finite length {{can be seen as a}} very thin layer of material across which the normal component of <b>incremental</b> <b>displacement</b> and of nominal traction remain continuous, but the incremental nominal tangential traction vanishes, while the corresponding displacement becomes unprescribed. Therefore, it is possible to model such a shear band as a weak surface whose faces can freely slide, but are constrained to remain in contact. At the base of the proposed dynamic perturbation analysis is the time-harmonic infinite-body Green's function for incremental displacements obtained by Bigoni & Capuani for small isochoric and plane deformation superimposed upon a nonlinear elastic and homogeneous strain. The integral representation relating the incremental stress at any point of the medium to the <b>incremental</b> <b>displacement</b> jump across the shear band faces, is obtained.

The objective function comprises terms which account for inertia, strain energy, contact, friction and external forcing. The Euler–Lagrange equations corresponding to this extended variational principle are shown to be consistent with the equations of motion of solids in frictional contact.

This auxiliary problem is based on consideration of the influence of σ z [...] = ± zq/ 2 satisfying face load conditions and associated constant transverse shear stresses on the preliminary solutions of primary bending problems. These transverse stresses are treated as virtual quantities since they do not participate in the static in-plane equilibrium equations as the above-mentioned virtual <b>incremental</b> <b>displacements</b> in the application of principle of virtual work.

Explicit-ly derived tangent stiffness matrices and nodal forces of large-deformation planar beam elements, with two translational and one rotational degrees of freedom at each node, are adopted following the work of [Kondoh and Atluri (1986) ]. By us-ing the Scalar Homotopy Methods, the displacements of the equilibrium state are iteratively solved for, without inverting the Jacobian (tangent stiffness) matrix. It is well-known that, the simple Newton’s method (and the Newton-Raphson iteration method that is widely used in nonlinear structural mechanics), which necessitates the inversion of the Jacobian matrix, fails to pass the limit load as the Jacobian matrix becomes singular. Although the so called arc-length method can resolve this problem by limiting both the <b>incremental</b> <b>displacements</b> and forces, it is quite complex for implementation.
