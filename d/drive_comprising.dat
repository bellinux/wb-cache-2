40|$|Neurons {{in active}} {{networks}} {{are subject to}} a fluctuating synaptic <b>drive</b> <b>comprising</b> excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials arriving at high rates relative to the integration time of the cell. The standard approach for treating stochastic synaptic currents and conductances has been to approximate them by a Gaussian whitenoise or coloured-noise {{process in which the}} amplitudes of the underlying post-synaptic potentials are considered small. Importantly, this diffusion approximation has allowed for various firing-rate properties of populations of fluctuation-driven neurons to be calculated using Johanessma’s [1] and Ricciardi’s [2] Fokker-Planck framework. This framework in turn {{has proven to be a}} powerful theoretical tool for deriving the emergent states of coupled neuronal networks as a function of the properties of constituent neurons. The Gaussian/diffusion model of fluctuating synaptic conductance is in widespread use theoretically, computationally and experimentally and, in many cases, is an excellent approximation to the synaptic drive experienced by neurons in active networks in vitro or in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the segmental spinal nervous system may organize movement using a collection of force-field primitives. The temporal organization of primitives has not been examined in detail. Recent data examining muscle activity underlying corrections of motor patterns suggested that primitives might be recruited into motor programs as waveforms with a constant duration. Here we test the idea that each primitive or premotor <b>drive</b> <b>comprising</b> part of the motor patterns might be expressed as {{the combination of a}} small number of time-frequency atoms from some orthonormal basis. We analyze the temporal organization of pre-motor drives extracted from the motor pattern by the Bell-Sejnowski algorithm for independent component analysis. We then use matching pursuit cosine packet analysis to examine the time series of the activation waveforms of each of the independent components. The analysis confirms that the motor pattern can be described as a combination of a small number of time-frequency atoms. These atoms combine to generate the temporal structure and activation of the individual components or premotor drives that generate individual muscle activity...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} applications, such as paper mills, {{locomotive}} traction and machine tools, which require high performance control {{of more than}} one electric motor. These multi-motor drives are generally available in two configurations. The first one consists of a number of three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) connected in parallel to a common DC link, each inverter feeding a three-phase AC motor. This configuration allows independent control of all machines by means of their own three-phase VSIs. The second method comprises one inverter, which feeds multiple parallel-connected three-phase motors. However, this configuration does not allow independent control of each motor and is suitable only for traction. This thesis explores a novel concept for multi-motor drive systems, based on utilization of multi-phase machines and VSIs, and series connection of all the machines in the group. Application of a single multi-phase VSI in conjunction with multi-phase machines generates additional degrees of freedom. The research presented here utilises these additional degrees of freedom to control a number of machines independently within a novel multi-phase multi-machine drive. The concept is {{based on the fact that}} independent flux and torque control of any AC machine, regardless of the number of stator phases requires control of only two stator current components. This leaves the remaining current components free to control other machines within the group. It is shown that it is possible to connect the machines in such a way that what one machine sees as the flux/torque producing components the other machines see as non-flux/torque producing components, and vice versa. Therefore it is possible to connect in series a number of multi-phase machines and independently control each machine while supplying them from a single multi-phase inverter. Different configurations of the multi-motor drive are possible depending on certain properties of the supply phase number. In general, higher the supply phase number is, higher the number of connectable machines is. However, some phase numbers are more favourable than others, as discussed in detail in the thesis. Simulation studies are provided for five, six, seven, nine, ten and fifteen phase configurations in order to verify the concept. It is shown that the concept is independent of the type of AC machines used and the only requirement is that they all have sinusoidal distributed magnetomotive force. Current control in both the stationary and rotating reference frames is considered and it is concluded that current control in the rotating reference frame requires compensation of the additional voltage drops caused by the series connection. Two possible methods of compensating for these voltage drops are suggested and verified by simulation. Finally, a laboratory rig is described, which utilises two three-phase inverters connected in such a way as to form a single six-phase inverter. A six-phase two-motor <b>drive</b> <b>comprising</b> a symmetrical six-phase induction machine and a three-phase induction machine or a three-phaseP MSM is investigatede xperimentally.

The <b>drive</b> <b>comprises</b> a five-phase induction machine with open-end stator windings, supplied using two two-level voltage-source inverters with isolated and unequal dc-link voltages, in the ratio 2 [*]:[*] 1. The topology offers {{the advantages of}} a modular structure with fewer semiconductor components and has a greater potential for fault tolerance, as compared with an equivalent single-sided four-level drive.

Hence, this paper examines the implementation of two-level-shifted carrier-based PWM methods. The effect of dead time on the drive performance is discussed, and it is shown that simultaneous PWM switching of both inverters can lead to degraded output phase voltage waveforms. Detailed analysis of this phenomenon is presented, a solution is proposed, and the modified modulation techniques are incorporated in an experimental setup, at first in conjunction with V/f control. Once the proof of concept has been provided, full field-oriented control is implemented in this OeW drive topology for the first time; detailed experimental testing is conducted, and results are reported...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Naturalistic driving studies (NDS) capture {{large volumes}} of drive data from {{multiple}} sensor modalities, which are analyzed for critical information about driver behavior and driving characteristics that lead to crashes and near-crashes. One of the key steps in such studies is data reduction, which {{is defined as a}} process by which “trained employees ” review segments of driving video and record a taxonomy of variables that provides information regarding the sequence of events leading to crashes. Given the volume of sensor data in NDS, such manual analysis of the drive data can be time consuming. In this paper, we introduce “drive analysis ” {{as one of the first}} steps towards automating the process of extracting mid-level semantic information from raw sensor data. Techniques are proposed to analyze sensor data from multiple modalities, and extract a set of 23 semantics about lane positions, vehicle localization within lanes, vehicle speed, traffic density and road curvature.

A decoupled carrier based (CB) PWM modulation strategy, based on unequal voltage reference sharing between the two converters, is introduced in this paper. The stability of dc-link voltages in OeW drives is investigated next, using a novel analysis technique. Several modulation methods are analysed and {{the results show that}} application of the coupled pulse width modulation technique, with carriers having in-phase disposition (PD), leads to overcharging of the capacitor in the dc-link of the inverter intended to operate with the lower dc-link voltage. On the other hand, the proposed decoupled CB PWM scheme naturally eliminates the dc-link capacitor overcharging problem. These findings are verified experimentally, using open-loop V/f control. Two different decoupled CB modulation methods are compared and the best performing modulation method is selected and incorporated further into an OeW drive with field-oriented control (FOC). The presented steady state and transient experimental results demonstrate that the decoupled CB PWM technique is suitable for high performance variable speed drive applications...|$|R
