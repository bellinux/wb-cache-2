50|$|<b>Embarkation</b> <b>orders</b> were {{received}} on 11 February and by 16 March the division's units had concentrated in France. Once again, {{it was the}} 2/7th Bn {{that was the first}} into the line. From June to September the division was engaged in minor operations along the Flanders coast, but in October it moved into the Ypres Salient where it took part in the Battle of Poelcapelle (9 October). The 2/7th advanced after an exhausting 11-hour approach march; both the Commanding Officer and his Second-in-Command were awarded the DSO for their work in organising a chaotic situation and driving off enemy counter-attacks.|$|R
50|$|King George V {{inspected}} the division on 19 February 1915, and gave permission for the Notts & Derby Brigade {{to change its}} title to Sherwood Foresters Brigade. Soon afterwards, <b>embarkation</b> <b>orders</b> arrived. The North Midland Division began landing in France in late February 1915 and by 8 March had completed its concentration - the first complete TF formation to arrive on the Western Front. In early April it went into the line at Messines for two months to learn the techniques of trench warfare. It was numbered the 46th (North Midland) Division in May, when the Sherwood Foresters Brigade was numbered 139th (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade.|$|R
5|$|The {{regiment}} conducted training until 24 September, {{when they}} received <b>embarkation</b> <b>orders.</b> Due to {{the fear of}} German warships being in the area, the wait for suitable escort ships delayed their departure until 15 October. With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting {{to be joined by}} the Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. They docked at Port Said on 2 December and Alexandria the next day. The regiment disembarked on 4 December and boarded a train for their camp in the Cairo suburb of Zeitoun. There they started a training programme, using the desert for manoeuvres, during both day and night.|$|R
50|$|The {{regiment}} {{was raised}} in Perthshire by John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl as the 77th Regiment of Foot (or Atholl Highlanders, or Murray's Highlanders) in December 1777. The regiment was formed as a relief for other regiments serving in North America, {{and spent most of}} its existence in Ireland. The terms upon which the regiment was raised stated that the men were to be employed for either three years or the duration of the war in America. In 1781, the original three-year term ended, and the men expected the regiment to be disbanded. However, the regiment was transported to England and marched to Portsmouth to be embarked for service in India. Upon learning of this, the men mutinied, and the <b>embarkation</b> <b>orders</b> were countermanded. The regiment was marched to Berwick, where it disbanded in 1783.|$|R
500|$|What {{remained}} of August {{and most of}} September was taken up with training, until the regiment received <b>embarkation</b> <b>orders</b> and set sail from Auckland on 23 September. The unescorted transport ships returned to the same harbour the next morning, believing two German cruisers, were in the area. The troops disembarked {{and it was not}} until 11 October that they sailed again. This time they reached Wellington on 14 October. Two days later, now part of a large convoy of transport ships, four warships and 9,000 men, they sailed again for an [...] "unknown destination". Stopping at Hobart, the New Zealand convoy waited until 1 November to be joined by an Australian contingent, then thirty-eight ships set sail, heading north. With only brief halts to re-coal at Colombo on 15 November and Aden on 24 November, the convoy entered the Suez Canal on 1 December. Four days later, the regiment disembarked at Alexandria. They entrained for Cairo and established their camp {{on the edge of the}} desert, in the suburb of Zeitoun. In the following months, the regiment practised their horsemanship, conducted small arms and bayonet training, and learned to construct trenches.|$|R
50|$|Not {{only were}} {{buildings}} shattered, but the tsunami also severely eroded the villagers ability to sustain themselves. It destroyed twenty-two of the islanders' outrigger canoes and eight boats, leaving only two <b>embarkations</b> in working <b>order,</b> and killed 823 livestock animals, including 239 pigs belonging to 25 families.|$|R
50|$|The 163rd Battalion reached Bermuda on May 29, 1916, {{to relieve}} the 38th and the latter sailed for Davenport, England on May 31. The Bermuda Militia Artillery and the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps both sent drafts to the Front during the war, but many local {{soldiers}} unable to join those contingents were able to join CEF battalions, either in Bermuda or Canada, and other Bermudians resident in Canada also joined the CEF (see Bermudians in the Canadian Expeditionary Force). They arrived on June 13, and proceeded to Camp Borden. On the following day the 38th was inspected by Major-General D. Watson, G. O. C. of the newly formed 4th Canadian Division, who was so favourably impressed with the unit's standard of efficiency that he accepted it for his division. The 38th became {{a unit of the}} 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade at Bramshott Camp, commanded by Brig. General Lord Brooke. On July 1 the 38th (and the rest of the 4th Canadian Division) was inspected by His Majesty the King. Early in August, <b>embarkation</b> <b>orders</b> for the 4th Division were received; the 38th sailed from Southampton to Le Havre on August 13. Two days later they entrained for Poperinghe, Belgium, reaching there on August 17. That evening half the battalion (A and C Companies, commanded by Major Parkinson) was sent forward to support trenches east of Ypres; by morning, they had received their baptism of shell fire.|$|R

60|$|He {{filled the}} streets of the city with {{barricades}} and pitfalls, excepting two streets which led to the place of embarkation. The object of these obstructions was to embarrass Caesar's progress through the city in case he should force an entrance while his men were getting on board the ships. He then, in order to divert Caesar's attention from his design, doubled the guards stationed upon the walls on the evening of his intended <b>embarkation,</b> and <b>ordered</b> them to make vigorous attacks upon all Caesar's forces outside. He then, when the darkness came on, marched his troops through the two streets which had been left open, to the landing place, and got them as fast as possible on board the transports. Some {{of the people of the}} town contrived to make known to Caesar's army what was going on, by means of signals from the walls; the army immediately brought scaling ladders in great numbers, and, mounting the walls with great ardor and impetuosity, they drove all before them, and soon broke open the gates and got possession of the city. But the barricades and pitfalls, together with the darkness, so embarrassed their movements, that Pompey succeeded in completing his embarkation and sailing away.|$|R
40|$|Asylum {{is being}} {{gradually}} denuded {{of the national}} institutional mechanisms (judicial, legislative and administrative) that {{provide the framework for}} a fair and effective asylum hearing. In this sense, there is an ongoing ‘denationalization’ or ‘deformalization’ of the asylum process. This chapter critically examines one of the linchpins of this trend: the erection of pre-entry measures at ports of <b>embarkation</b> in <b>order</b> to prevent asylum seekers from physically accessing the territory of the state. Pre-entry measures comprise the core requirement that foreigners possess an entry visa granting permission to enter the state of destination. Visa requirements are increasingly implemented by immigration officials posted abroad or by officials of transit countries pursuant to bilateral agreements (so-called ‘juxtaposed’ immigration controls). Private carriers, which are subject to sanctions if they bring persons to a country who do not have permission to enter, also engage in a form of de facto immigration control on behalf of states. These measures constitute a type of ‘externalized’ or ‘exported’ border that pushes the immigration boundaries of the state as far from its physical boundaries as possible. Pre-entry measures have a crippling impact on the ability of asylum seekers to access the territory of states to claim asylum. In effect, states have ‘externalized’ asylum by replacing the legal obligation on states to protect refugees arriving at ports of entry with what are perceived to be no more than moral obligations towards asylum seekers arriving at the external border of the state...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not stay}} very {{long on the}} raft. It {{ought to have been}} very nice punting about there in the cool shade of the trees, or sitting moored to an over-hanging root; but perhaps the very notion that I was bound in {{gratitude}} specially to enjoy my little cruise, and cherish its recollection, turned the whole thing from a pleasure into a duty. Be that as it may, {{there is no doubt that}} I soon wearied and came ashore again, and that it gives me more pleasure to recall the man himself and his simple, happy conversation, so full of gusto and sympathy, than anything possibly connected with his crank, insecure <b>embarkation.</b> In <b>order</b> to avoid seeing him, for I was not a little ashamed of myself for having failed to enjoy his treat sufficiently, I determined to continue up the river, and, at all prices, to find some other way back into the town in time for dinner. As I went, I was thinking of Smethurst with admiration; a look into that man’s mind was like a retrospect over the smiling champaign of his past life, and very different from the Sinai-gorges up which one looks for a terrified moment into the dark souls of many good, many wise, and many prudent men. I cannot be very grateful to such men for their excellence, and wisdom, and prudence. I find myself facing as stoutly as I can a hard, combative existence, full of doubt, difficulties, defeats, disappointments, and dangers, quite a hard enough life without their dark countenances at my elbow, so that what I want is a happy-minded Smethurst placed here and there at ugly corners of my life’s wayside, preaching his gospel of quiet and contentment.|$|R
5|$|After {{their arrival}} in the United Kingdom, the {{battalion}} was transported by rail {{to the south of}} England where it set up a camp at Lopcombe Corner, on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire. Amidst the backdrop of the Battle of Britain, the battalion's personnel used their integral Vickers machine-guns and Bren guns to provide self-defence against air attack and to bolster the anti-aircraft defences of local areas. They also undertook training exercises and formed a mobile striking force tasked with rapidly responding {{in the event of an}} invasion. In September, the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 9th Division. On 14 October the battalion moved to Meeanee Barracks in Colchester, Essex, where it took over responsibility for a defence sector from a British officer training battalion. The 2/9th remained in Colchester until 10 November when orders came for the 18th Brigade to hand over to the 25th Brigade, and the 2/9th was relieved by the 2/31st Battalion. With the threat of invasion passing as winter came, the decision was made to redeploy the Australians to North Africa where they might be actively employed in combat operations. Following this, preparations for <b>embarkation</b> began as <b>orders</b> were received for the battalion to entrain for Glasgow where, on 15 November 1940, it boarded HMT Strathaird.|$|R
