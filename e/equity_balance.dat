5000|$|The SIPC serves {{two primary}} {{roles in the}} event that a {{broker-dealer}} fails. First, the SIPC acts to organize the distribution of customer cash and securities to investors. Second, to the extent a customer's cash and/or securities are unavailable, the SIPC provides insurance coverage up to $500,000 of the customer's net <b>equity</b> <b>balance,</b> including up to $250,000 in cash. In most cases where a brokerage firm has failed or is on the brink of failure, SIPC first seeks to transfer customer accounts to another brokerage firm. Should that process fail, the insolvent firm will be liquidated. In order to state a claim, the investor is required to show that their economic loss arose because of the insolvency of their broker-dealer and not because of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad investment decisions. In certain circumstances, securities or cash may not exist in full based upon a customer's statement. In this case, protection is also extended to investors whose [...] "securities may have been lost, improperly hypothecated, misappropriated, never purchased, or even stolen".|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we extend prior {{research}} on the international analysis of accounting conservatism (Joos and Lang, 1994; Ball et al., 2000; Giner and Rees, 2001), by examining the level of accounting conservatism across eight European countries (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Belgium), and assessing the statistical significance of the differences among them. The definitions of conservatism that we use are, on the one hand, the Feltham and Ohlson (1995) definition, which implies a persistent understatement of book value of shareholders' <b>equity</b> (<b>balance</b> sheet conservatism). On the other hand, we use the one proposed by Basu (1997), that is, a timelier recognition of bad news in earnings relative to good news (earnings conservatism). We also address the possible scale problems of the models used to measure balance sheet conservatism. Finally, we check whether our comparative results could be influenced by a different sample composition in each country. Our results show that there are both balance sheet and earnings conservatism practices in all countries under study. In addition, while continental countries show larger balance sheet conservatism, differences in earnings conservative practices between countries are not that pronounced, although {{they tend to be}} larger in the UK. We also find that the existence of balance sheet conservative practices is associated with reduced levels of earnings conservatism, which is consistent with the results in Pope and Walker (2003) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) {{legislation}} on non-Anne country airlines by using a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), assuming those airlines are treated equally. A financial appraisal model of a case study of Kenya Airways is created to answer two key questions: (1) whether the EU ETS results in a negative impact on airlines located in developing countries or not, and (2) whether new and fuel efficient aircraft can be an effective mitigation option for those airlines and how its impacts could be different compared to other carriers in developed countries serving the same market. The results suggest that the option of keeping the current aircraft is preferred for airlines due to the additional large investment cost, while the fuel efficient aircraft option provides benefits across all stakeholder and related groups such as passengers, the workforce, and the environment. It is found that, compared to airlines in developed countries, the high investment requirement burdens carriers in developing countries to a greater extent due to the higher discount rate and exchange rate volatility. For global market based measures (MBMs), the option to support carriers in developing countries can be a possible measure to retain the <b>equity</b> <b>balance</b> among the parties involved, as it may lower barriers to implement new technology-such as new and fuel efficient aircraft-which mitigates aircraft emissions. Specifically, carbon financing through the revenue from global MBMs’ offset schemes could be used towards this objective...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of the CCPI Since 2005, the Climate Change Performance Index {{has been}} {{contributing}} to {{a clearer understanding of}} national and international climate policy. It is an important tool towards the various initial positions and interests as well as kept and broken promises of the numerous countries in a world which is facing the challenge to reduce the causes of a dangerous climate change. To further demonstrate existing measures more accurately and encourage steps towards an effective climate policy, the index’ methodology has been evaluated after its seventh edition. The evaluation process was carried out in order to reorganise the underlying data, to find a method to integrate newly available deforestation data, to better capture recent political movements and to develop an approach which is more focused on mitigation solutions regarding climate change performance. Our world is characterized by fast-moving geopolitical and natural changes and our goal was to increase the sensitivity of the CCPI towards these changes. One of the biggest challenges {{for the creation of a}} country-related composite index is the vast diversity of countries regarding geographical pre-conditions, historic responsibilities and economic capabilities. A second goal of the evaluation of the CCPI was, therefore, to better balance the subsets of indicators for a more equitable result in terms of these country specifics. A major step forward has been made with the integration of data on emissions from deforestation. We are now able to present a more complete view on anthropogenic impacts on the world’s climate. With an updated weighting and categorization of indicators we can track changes in climate change performance more immediately and at the same time increase the <b>equity</b> <b>balance</b> of the CCPI...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is written in}} order to answer what values and norms determine the way we distribute outcomes, such as rewards and punishment, in more specific money or shares etc, in organizations (e. g. in a company or organization). Which factors {{determine whether or not}} a given outcome is treated fair or not? As Morton Deutsch built several hypotheses regarding the conditions which determine the norms which are employed as the basis of distributive justice; equity, equality and need. Out of these norms, the first two are the focus of this research. The equity norm prescribes that distribution of outcomes should be proportional to the individual's contribution such as human resources, time, skills etc. On the other hand, equality norms suggest equal outcomes for everyone no matter how or what their input is. Deutsch suggested that cooperative relations in which the economic productivity or gain is the primary goal, equity will be the dominant norm. In contrast, cooperative relations in which maintaining an enjoyable social relations is the common goal, the equality norm will be dominant factor. From this theory, the application of these norms over entrepreneurial team ventures can be complicated. As of today {{to the best of our}} knowledge there is currently no research addressing these questions. To decide which norm will be the main characteristic of basis of distributive justice over different type of entrepreneurial ventures, a quantitative study has been made with a main instrument of a survey that has collected valuable information about ventures background, the members social relationship with each other and friendship degrees, the extent of economical gain and the snapshot of equality or <b>equity</b> <b>balance</b> in these ventures. Study has showed that there is a correlation between the level of friendship the venture founders had in the beginning and the basis of distributive justice they take.
