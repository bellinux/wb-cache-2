50|$|Stalling's {{working process}} {{involved}} meeting each animated short film's director or directors before the animation process begun. Together {{they set the}} time signatures to which the short was to be drawn. The animators of the film were measuring animation frames per beat. After the animation process was completed, Stalling would receive the animators' <b>exposure</b> <b>sheets</b> or bar sheets. The sheets broke the animation, dialogue, and sound effects into musical bars, which Stalling would then use to create his score for the film.|$|R
5000|$|Landreth {{directed}} the animators to use graph editing {{rather than the}} <b>exposure</b> <b>sheets</b> typically used in 2D animation. The latter enable an animator to [...] "break down the individual motions in a character", but Landreth preferred an approach that did not involve characters moving in curves. He wanted the characters to portray realistic motion, which begins with an abrupt twitch for a muscle contraction and must also account for momentum and mass. For example, Landreth stated that an individual's arm should be slightly {{in front of the}} body, at 30 degrees with respect to the [...] "scapular plane of the skeleton".|$|R
50|$|The {{completed}} digital cels were composited over scanned background {{paintings and}} camera or pan movements were programmed {{into a computer}} <b>exposure</b> <b>sheet</b> simulating the actions of old style animation cameras. Additionally, complex multiplane shots giving a sense of depth were possible. Unlike the analog multiplane camera, the CAPS multiplane cameras were not limited by artwork size. Extensive camera movements never before seen were incorporated into the films. The {{final version of the}} sequence was composited and recorded onto film. Since the animation elements existed digitally, it was easy to integrate other types of film and video elements, including three-dimensional computer animation.|$|E
50|$|While {{design is}} going on, the timing {{director}} (who {{in many cases}} will be the main director) takes the animatic and analyzes exactly what poses, drawings, and lip movements will be needed on what frames. An <b>exposure</b> <b>sheet</b> (or X-sheet for short) is created; this is a printed table that breaks down the action, dialogue, and sound frame-by-frame {{as a guide for}} the animators. If a film is based more strongly in music, a bar sheet may be prepared in addition to or instead of an X-sheet. Bar sheets show the relationship between the on-screen action, the dialogue, and the actual musical notation used in the score.|$|E
50|$|An <b>exposure</b> <b>sheet</b> (also {{referred}} to as camera instruction sheet, dope sheet or X-sheet) is a traditional animation tool that allows an animator to organize their thinking and give instructions to the camera operator on how the animation is to be shot. It consists of five sections, and is a bit longer and a bit narrower, than A4. Every eighth line down is marked thicker than the rest and shows half a foot of film. One second of animation would take three of these sections. Sound breakdown was often done on separate sheets called bar sheets made by the editor, and given to the animator who would transpose them to his dope sheet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{animation}} for {{the film}} was handled overseas by Rough Draft Korea in South Korea. Creative supervisor Vincent Waller said, [...] "We're getting animation back that is looking terrific." [...] The sequel {{is a combination of}} traditional animation and live action as its predecessor was, and also used computer-generated imagery (CGI) handled by Iloura VFX in Melbourne, Australia to render the characters in 3D. Sherm Cohen returned to work on the sequel, when he previously worked on The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie as a character designer and the lead storyboard artist and left the show in 2005. Series animation directors Tom Yasumi and Alan Smart worked on the film's <b>exposure</b> <b>sheets.</b> Most of the character layout crew of the film are from the series.|$|R

50|$|Note {{that often}} {{it is not the}} music that is synced to the {{animated}} action, but the other way around. This is especially so when the music is a classical or other well-known piece. In such cases, the music for the animation is pre-recorded, and an animator will have an <b>exposure</b> <b>sheet</b> with the beats marked on it, frame by frame, and can time the movements accordingly. In the 1940 film Fantasia, the musical piece The Sorcerer's Apprentice, composed in the 1890s, contains a fragment that is used to accompany the actions of Mickey himself. At one point Mickey, as the apprentice, seizes an axe and chops an enchanted broom to pieces so that it will stop carrying water to a pit. The visual action is synchronized exactly to crashing chords in the music.|$|E
40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. internationaleThis paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to improve the phoneme-based lipsync process. The lipsync process {{is a step in the}} animation production pipelines of 2 D and 3 D cartoons. It consists in generatingthe mouth positions of a cartoon character from the dialogue recorded by an actor. The result of this step is a sequence of time markerswhich indicate the series of mouth shapes to be drawn : for instance an "opened" mouth when a "a" is uttered and a "closed" mouth for a "p". Until now, the lipsync phase has been done by hand: experts listen to the audio tape and write on an <b>exposure</b> <b>sheet</b> the shapes of the mouth and their timing. This traditional method is tedious and time consuming, almost one day for 4 minutes. We propose to speed up the lipsync process using tools coming from the field of automatic speech recognition. A standard tool of labelling cannot be used because the voices of the cartoon's characters are atypical: shouted voice, child voice, foreign accent, whispered speech, voice of animal characters, laugh [...] . We describe the LIPS tool (LIPS Logiciel Interactif de PostSynchronisation : lipsync Interactive Software) and the generation of the acoustic models required by the tool...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{assess the}} balance <b>sheet</b> <b>exposure</b> of {{commercial}} banks {{to the real}} estate market, and develop a hypothesis on the potential systematic effects of real estate conditions across banks. By applying a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model to bank portfolios, we test for the relation between bank values and a real estate market proxy after controlling for general market and interest-rate conditions. We find {{a positive relationship between}} monthly bank returns and the real estate index, even after accounting for general market and interest-rate movements. The sensitivity of bank values to the real estate market has increased over time, and the bank-specific sensitivity coefficient is positively related to the bank's balance <b>sheet</b> <b>exposure</b> to real estate. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has highlighted {{the need for}} models that can identify counterparty risk exposures and shock transmission processes at the systemic level. We use the euro area financial accounts (flow of funds) data to construct a sector-level network of bilateral balance <b>sheet</b> <b>exposures</b> and show how local shocks can propagate throughout the network and affect the balance sheets in other, even seemingly remote, parts of the financial system. We then use the contingent claims approach to extend this accounting-based network of interlinked exposures to risk-based balance sheets which are sensitive to changes in leverage and asset volatility. We conclude that the bilateral cross-sector exposures in the euro area financial system constitute important channels through which local risk <b>exposures</b> and balance <b>sheet</b> dislocations can be transmitted, with the financial intermediaries playing {{a key role in}} the processes. High financial leverage and high asset volatility are found to increase a sector 2 ̆ 019 s vulnerability to shocks and contagion...|$|R

50|$|Under F-IRB, EAD is {{calculated}} taking {{account of the}} underlying asset, forward valuation, facility type and commitment details. This value does not take account of guarantees, collateral or security (i.e. ignores Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques {{with the exception of}} on-balance sheet netting where the effect of netting is included in Exposure At Default). For on-balance sheet transactions, EAD is identical to the nominal amount of <b>exposure.</b> On-balance <b>sheet</b> netting of loans and deposits of a bank to a corporate counterparty is permitted to reduce the estimate of EAD under certain conditions.

25|$|Contemporary bank {{management}} {{methods for}} liquidity {{are based on}} maturity analysis of all the bank's assets and liabilities (off balance <b>sheet</b> <b>exposures</b> may also be included). Assets and liabilities are put into residual contractual maturity buckets such as 'on demand', 'less than 1 month', '2–3 months' etc. These residual contractual maturities may be adjusted to account for expected counter party behaviour such as early loan repayments due to borrowers refinancing and expected renewals of term deposits to give forecast cash flows. This analysis highlights any large future net outflows of cash and enables the bank to respond before they occur. Scenario analysis may also be conducted, depicting scenarios including stress scenarios such as a bank-specific crisis.|$|R
