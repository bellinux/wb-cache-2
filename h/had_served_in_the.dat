They and their successors Probus (276–82) and Diocletian (ruled 284–305) and his colleagues in the Tetrarchy formed a sort of self-perpetuating military junta of Danubian officers who were born in the same provinces (several in the same city, Sirmium, a major legionary base in Moesia Superior) and/or <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same regiments.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} repatriations, {{returned}} prisoners were generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many {{believed that they}} had only been allowed to return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered much less than civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, the prisoners were blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than fight to the death. They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their generation who <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Free French Forces or Resistance.|$|E

In March 1915, it was discovered that 12,290 men serving in the ranks had been members of a university or public school Officers' Training Corps (OTC). Most applied for and were granted commissions, while others who did not apply were also commissioned.
