25|$|Pierre-Yves Gayraud, the film's costume designer, spent fifteen weeks researching 18th century fashion. Production of over 1,400 costumes, in {{addition}} to the preparation of shoes, hats and other accessories were completed within three months by workshops in and around Bucharest in Romania. The costume department had to make the clothing look worn and dirty. Additionally, the actors were required to wear the costumes and more or less live in them prior to shooting. The character Grenouille was not given any white clothing and wore bluish over-garments throughout most of the film because the filmmakers wanted to depict him as a shadow and a chameleon. Instead of dressing the character of Laura in the colorful regional dress that was the tradition of the time, she was dressed in the less vivid tones of a Parisian damsel to highlight her social aspirations as well as <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{a tribute}} {{published}} when Wilkinson's death was announced, the former Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet-Keir summed up her personality: [...] "Ellen Wilkinson {{was as far}} removed from being a bore as {{it is possible for}} any human being to be. Whatever she did, wherever she went, she created an atmosphere of excitement and interest... and not just because of <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> and green dress".|$|E
500|$|The subject {{wears an}} opulent red gown with turned-back trumpet sleeves and a partlet with {{standing}} collar; {{the latter is}} embroidered with a fleur-de-lis pattern, the heraldic emblem of French royalty. The design on her [...] underskirt shows a pattern variously identified as strawberries, gilliflowers, Scots thistles or pinks; the last of these was an emblem of the Grey family. A French hood on her head covers most of <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b> She wears numerous pieces of jewellery, including a necklace finished with medallions and pearls; these indicate a person of high social and economic status, which {{is reinforced by the}} silk and velvet of her gown. The sitter is not, however, wearing a wedding ring, suggesting she was not yet married. Instead she is holding a prayer book. This type of costume was popular during the Tudor period, particularly in the 1550s, and the accuracy of its depiction has been used to advance the portrait's authenticity as a depiction of Jane Grey.|$|E
50|$|Mallory's appearance, {{especially}} <b>her</b> bright <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> {{and revealing}} uniform, is highly {{reminiscent of the}} main character in the film Run Lola Run.|$|R

500|$|When {{they lived}} at Cock Lane William and Fanny had {{employed}} a maid, Esther [...] "Carrots" [...] Carlisle (Carrots {{on account of}} <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair).</b> [...] She had since {{moved to a new}} job and knew nothing of the haunting, but seeking evidence of Fanny's poisoning, Moore went to question her. [...] Carrots told him that Fanny had been unable to speak in the days before she died, so Moore invited her to a séance, held on 19January. [...] Once there, she was asked to confirm that Fanny had been poisoned, but Carrots remained adamant that Fanny had said nothing to her, telling the party that William and Fanny had been [...] "very loving, and lived very happy together." [...] Kent arrived later that night, this time with James Franzen and priests William Dodd and Thomas Broughton. [...] Frazer began with her usual introduction before Moore sent her out, apparently irritated by her behaviour. [...] He then asked the party of about20 to leave the room, calling them back a few minutes later. [...] This time, the séance centred on Carrots, who addressed the ghost directly: ...|$|E
2500|$|When Anne Shirley {{arrives at}} the Cuthberts' farm, called [...] "Green Gables", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly {{sensitive}} about <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, {{in a dispute over}} her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe’s head when he calls her [...] "Carrots" [...] on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> black and salvage her wounded pride.|$|E
2500|$|Anne {{is highly}} imaginative, {{eager to please}} and quite {{dramatic}} at times. [...] However, she is defensive about her appearance, despising <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> and pale, thin frame. She is often quite talkative, {{especially when it comes}} to describing her fantasies and dreams. At first, stern and sharp Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage, but after much observation and considering, along with Matthew's strong liking to Anne, she decides to let her stay.|$|E
60|$|She shrugged her shoulders. She was {{certainly}} a very pretty woman, and her black gown set off to fullest advantage <b>her</b> deep <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> and fair complexion.|$|R

2500|$|The book recounts Anne's {{adventures in}} making a home: the country school where she quickly excels in her studies; her {{friendship}} with Diana Barry, the girl living next door (her best or [...] "bosom friend" [...] as Anne fondly calls her); her budding literary ambitions; and her rivalry with her classmate Gilbert Blythe, who teases her about <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b> For that, he earns her instant hatred, although he apologizes many times. As time passes, Anne realizes she no longer hates Gilbert but cannot bring herself to speak to him.|$|E
2500|$|Gilbert Blythe: A handsome, smart, {{witty and}} chivalrous classmate {{who has a}} crush on Anne the moment he sees her. Unaware of Anne's near-pathological {{sensitivity}} about <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair,</b> {{he tries to get}} Anne's attention by holding her braid and calling her [...] "Carrots!" [...] Anne's explosively hostile reaction only causes Gilbert to be more smitten. He makes several attempts to apologize, the failure of all of which do not seem to mar his admiration. He attempts to apologize one last time when he saves Anne from drowning; Anne crassly rebuffs this attempt, only to regret it almost immediately. Years later, he gives up his job offer of teaching at the Avonlea school so that Anne may live at Green Gables, upon which the two reconcile and become good friends.|$|E
2500|$|Wednesbury {{unreasonableness}} is a [...] "shorthand legal reference" [...] to {{the classical}} common law judicial approach expounded in the English case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947). In that case, Lord Greene, the Master of the Rolls, described two forms of unreasonableness. First, unreasonableness can be a general description of a public authority doing things that must not be done, such as not directing itself properly in law by considering matters which it is not bound to consider and taking into consideration irrelevant matters. Another type of unreasonableness occurs when a public authority does something that is [...] "so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within {{the powers of the}} authority", as illustrated by the dismissal of a teacher because of <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b> The latter has now come to be termed as Wednesbury unreasonableness. However, Lord Greene recognized that these aspects of unreasonableness are by no means clear, and [...] "all these things run into one another".|$|E

60|$|And at noon {{he remembered}} how one of his companions, who was a {{gatherer}} of samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave {{at the head of}} the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries. And he set to and ran, so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust followed him as he sped round the sand of the shore. By the itching of her palm the young Witch knew his coming, and she laughed and let down <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b> With <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> falling around her, she stood at the opening of the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that was blossoming.|$|E

60|$|The third night, as {{he stood}} at the window {{watching}} two children playing in the dusk, there was a knock. It was Istra. She stood at his door, smart and inconspicuous in a black suit with a small toque that hid the flare of <b>her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was {{afternoon}} when he awoke. He sprang up and rushed around the stack. Istra was still asleep, curled in a pathetically small childish heap, her tired face in repose against the brown-yellow of her khaki jacket. <b>Her</b> <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> {{had come down}} and shone about her shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|Everybody {{likes to}} be appreciated.
