5|$|Dr. Manheim recovers {{long enough}} to explain {{that he was doing}} {{experiments}} involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment is running out of control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.|$|E
5|$|Bagration {{called for}} the First, Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the Daugava River and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the {{surrounding}} areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt {{the plans for the}} Bagration were sound, <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the possibility of a German incursion by Army Group North against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{suffered}} from psychotic episodes and delusions and though <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after {{a confrontation with}} a razor, when in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself {{and moved to the}} Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homoeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.|$|E

25|$|After {{arriving}} in New Orleans on December 1, Jackson instituted martial {{law in the}} city, as <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the loyalty of the city's Creole and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with Jean Lafitte's smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees, in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary. These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral Alexander Cochrane and later General Edward Pakenham, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, {{many of whom had}} served in the Napoleonic Wars. Jackson only had about 5,000 men.|$|E
25|$|The Hongwu Emperor was {{long-lived}} {{and survived}} his first heir, Zhu Biao, the Crown Prince. <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his succession {{and issued a}} series of dynastic instructions for his family, the Huang Ming Zu Xun. These instructions {{made it clear that}} the rule would pass only to children from the emperor's primary consort, excluding the Prince of Yan in favour of Zhu Yunwen, Zhu Biao's son. When the Hongwu Emperor died on 24 June 1398, Zhu Yunwen succeeded his grandfather as the Jianwen Emperor. In direct violation of the dynastic instructions, the Prince of Yan attempted to mourn his father in Nanjing, bringing a large armed guard with him. The imperial army was able to block him at Huai'an and, given that three of his sons were serving as hostages in the capital, the prince withdrew in disgrace.|$|E
500|$|The city of Dallas {{received}} the building well, {{and a local}} television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially {{opened to the public}} in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the arrangement of its elements. He said: [...] "It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse." [...] He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.|$|E

500|$|On his {{retirement}} Lang {{was raised to}} the peerage as Baron Lang, of Lambeth in the County of Surrey. He thus remained in the House of Lords, where he attended regularly and contributed to debates. [...] <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> money, despite a pension, a large grace and favour house at Kew, and some generous cash gifts from well-wishers. [...] In 1943 he spoke in the House of Lords {{in support of the}} Beveridge Report on social insurance, and on 9 February 1944 he reiterated his earlier opposition to obliteration bombing. In October 1944 Lang was greatly distressed by the sudden death of William Temple, his successor at Canterbury, writing: [...] "I don't like to think of the loss to the Church and Nation... But 'God knows and God reigns'." ...|$|E
500|$|Edith Cardus died on 26 March 1968. Despite their {{separate}} day-to-day lives, {{she had been}} an influential presence for nearly all Cardus's adult life; they had communicated by telephone almost daily, and he felt her loss keenly. After her death he left the National Liberal Club and moved into her flat, which remained his base {{for the rest of}} his life. In the ensuing months <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his deteriorating relationship with The Guardian; the paper had been renamed in 1959 following reorganisation, and its editorial offices had moved to London in 1964. Cardus felt that much of the old ethos had departed, and that his once-sacrosanct copy was now at the mercy of subeditors. He was particularly incensed by the treatment meted out to his 1969 Edinburgh Festival reports, and referred to the subeditors' room as [...] "the Abattoir" [...] in one of many letters complaining of editorial butchery.|$|E
500|$|After Cobain {{committed}} suicide in 1994, Yankovic and his band were hesitant to play the extremely popular [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] during live shows. For several months after Cobain's death, Yankovic would first perform a somber tribute to Cobain prior to playing the song itself. Shortly after Cobain's death, Yankovic was scheduled to play a show in Seattle, where Nirvana first became famous. Due to this connection, Yankovic was hesitant to perform the spoof, as <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> how the audience might react to the parody. However, Yankovic was urged by journalists {{to go through with}} the performance, as they said that the song would be [...] "cathartic" [...] for the area. Ultimately, the performance [...] "went over extremely well". Yankovic continues to play [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] live, stating that [...] "Kurt was a fan of the song" [...] and [...] "he would have wanted it that way." ...|$|E

500|$|Thome {{missed a}} {{significant}} portion of the first half of the Phillies' 2005 season due to injury; he compiled only a [...]207 batting average with 7 home runs and 30 RBIs going into the All-Star break. He was only sporadically effective; one result was that Phillies fans booed him and cheered for replacement Ryan Howard instead. He had season-ending surgery on his right elbow in August, while Howard won the NL Rookie of the Year Award. The Phillies traded Thome and cash considerations to the Chicago White Sox on November 25, 2005, for outfielder Aaron Rowand and minor league pitching prospects Gio González and Daniel Haigwood. Though the emergence of Howard made Thome more expendable to the squad, another factor in his trade to the White Sox was his family situation – Thome's mother, the [...] "go-to lady" [...] in his family and his biggest fan, had died a year earlier, and <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his father. Since Philadelphia was willing to trade him, Thome waived the no-trade clause in his contract for the good of the team and requested that if possible, they trade him to Chicago so he could be with his father.|$|E
500|$|At this time, Hemingway was {{constantly}} worried {{about money and}} his safety. <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his taxes {{and that he would}} never return to Cuba to retrieve the manuscripts he had left there in a bank vault. He became paranoid, thinking the FBI was actively monitoring his movements in Ketchum. The FBI had, in fact, opened a file on him during World War II, when he used the Pilar to patrol the waters off Cuba, and J. Edgar Hoover had an agent in Havana watch Hemingway during the 1950s. By the end of November, Mary was at her wits' end, and Saviers suggested Hemingway go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and Hemingway may have believed he was to be treated there for hypertension. [...] The FBI knew Hemingway was at the Mayo Clinic, as an agent later documented in a letter written in January 1961. In an attempt to maintain anonymity, Hemingway was checked in at the Mayo Clinic under Saviers's name. Meyers writes that [...] "an aura of secrecy surrounds Hemingway's treatment at the Mayo" [...] but confirms he was treated with electroconvulsive therapy as many as 15 times in December 1960 and was [...] "released in ruins" [...] in January 1961. Reynolds was able to access Hemingway's records at the Mayo, which indicated that the combination of medications given to Hemingway may have created the depressive state for which he was treated.|$|E

With no thought of the possible emotional ramifications of this move, he bought a house in Arden about [...] from the Experimental Station and moved into it with his parents. He was 37 at the time. Interactions with his parents soon became tense. Carothers was still seeing Sylvia Moore, who was now single, and his parents greatly disapproved of the relationship. Finding the tension in the household too wearing, his parents returned to Des Moines in the spring of 1934.|$|E

2500|$|But a whole {{generation}} of journalists and activists were influenced greatly by Seldes. Long-time Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy said, [...] "He was a reporter who didn't worry about being objective. <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> what he would choose to write. I'm always amused when they call somebody 'one-sided'. Seldes offered one side – the side you weren't getting elsewhere". Nader said of Seldes, [...] "He was like a doctor. He reported about disease in the political economy, and the gross inequities of power, and the abuses and the exploitation. I {{always wanted to be a}} crusading lawyer, and he gave me some materials to contemplate crusading about." [...] Journalist Nat Hentoff said, [...] "He took what should be the most honorable term in journalism – muckraking – and made it work again. A lot of journalists of his generation and the generation or two that followed, did more, took risks, because [...] was the model. And the fact that he was there made them feel like whores if they didn't do more." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Apalachee {{played a}} ball game, {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} [...] "Apalachee ball game", described in detail by Spaniards in the 17th century. The fullest description, however, was written {{as part of a}} campaign by Father Juan de Paiva, priest at the mission of San Luis de Talimali, to have the game banned, and some of the practices described may have been exaggerated. The game was embedded in ritual practices which Father Paiva regarded as heathen superstitions. He was also concerned about the effect of community involvement in the games on the welfare of the villages and Spanish missions. In particular, <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> towns being left defenseless against raiders when inhabitants left for a game, and that field work was being neglected during game season. Other missionaries (and the visiting Bishop of Cuba) had complained about the game, but most of the Spanish (including, initially, Father Pavia) liked it (and, most likely, the associated gambling). At least, they defended it as a custom that should not be disturbed, and that helped keep the Apalachee happy and willing to work in the fields. The Apalachee themselves said that the game was [...] "as ancient as memory", and that they had [...] "no other entertainment ... or relief from ... misery".|$|E
