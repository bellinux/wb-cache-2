40|$|Abstract — A <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> {{is a kind}} of marker covertly {{embedded}} in a noise- tolerant signal such as audio or image data. It is typically used to identify ownership of the copyright of such signal. "Watermarking " is the process of computer-aided information hiding in a carrier signal; the hidden information should, but does not need to contain a relation to the carrier signal. <b>Digital</b> <b>watermarks</b> may be used to verify the authenticity or integrity of the carrier signal or to show the identity of its owners. Like traditional <b>watermarks,</b> <b>digital</b> <b>watermarks</b> are only perceptible under certain conditions, i. e. after using some algorithm, and imperceptible anytime else. If a <b>digital</b> <b>watermark</b> distorts the carrier signal {{in a way that it}} becomes perceivable, it is of no use. ...|$|R

25|$|Like {{traditional}} physical watermarks, digital watermarks {{are often}} only perceptible under certain conditions, i.e. after using some algorithm. If a digital watermark distorts the carrier signal {{in a way}} that it becomes easily perceivable, it may be considered less effective depending on its purpose. Traditional watermarks may be applied to visible media (like images or video), whereas in <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking,</b> the signal may be audio, pictures, video, texts or 3D models. A signal may carry several different watermarks at the same time. Unlike metadata that is added to the carrier signal, a digital watermark does not change the size of the carrier signal.|$|E
25|$|Because DVD-Video's content-scrambling system (CSS) {{was quickly}} broken, DVD-Audio's {{developers}} sought a better method of blocking unauthorized duplications. They developed CPPM, {{which uses a}} media key block (MKB) to authenticate DVD-Audio players. In order to decrypt the audio, players must obtain a media key from the MKB, which also is encrypted. The player must use its own unique key to decrypt the MKB. If a DVD-Audio player's decryption key is compromised, that key can be rendered useless for decrypting future DVD-Audio discs. DVD-Audio discs can also utilize <b>digital</b> <b>watermarking</b> technology developed by the Verance Corporation, typically embedded into the audio once every thirty seconds. If a DVD-Audio player encounters a watermark on a disc without a valid MKB, it will halt playback. The 4C Entity also developed a similar specification, Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM), which is used on Secure Digital cards.|$|E
