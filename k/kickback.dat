5|$|The Macdonald Liberals easily won {{re-election}} in 1949 and 1953, but the Conservatives made steady gains under Robert Stanfield, their new leader. The Conservatives for example, {{drew attention to}} <b>kickback</b> schemes under which brewing companies, wineries and distilleries contributed to the Liberal party {{in exchange for the}} right to sell their products in government liquor stores. The Liberals seemed secure against such allegations however, {{as long as they were}} led by the popular Angus L. Macdonald. However, Macdonald suffered a slight heart attack on April 11, 1954, and was admitted to hospital where he died in his sleep two nights later, just four months before his 64th birthday.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding {{for public education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and man-made disasters occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance <b>kickback</b> scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance <b>kickback</b> scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} is currently underway in France {{in order to}} establish the extent to which former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and former President Nicolas Sarkozy were implicated in the sale of <b>kickbacks</b> to Pakistan officials.

When Jacques Chirac came to power, he cancelled the Pakistani official's <b>kickbacks,</b> angering those in that country.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{patient and}} overall welfare effects of <b>kickbacks</b> paid by a monopolistic hos-pital to competitive physicians {{in return for}} patient referrals. This practice is regarded as unethical and illegal in most cases. On the other hand, <b>kickbacks</b> can also enhance the distribution of labor {{in the production of}} medical services. In the context of medical services modelled as credence goods where patients need one of two possible treatments (minor or major), it is shown that pa-tient welfare is always lower with <b>kickbacks</b> than without. When the use of <b>kickbacks</b> is allowed, an equilibrium with overcharging (the patient requires the minor treatment but is charged for the expensive one) and one with overtreatment (the patient receives but does not require the major treatment) are possible. The latter results if patients can verify the treatment but not the diagno-sis, the former arises when no verifiability applies. Overall welfare is lowest in the equilibrium with overtreatment. Overcharging does not necessarily reduce overall welfare, as it depends on the degree of altruism among referring physicians. If they are solely extrinsically motivated, al-lowing <b>kickbacks</b> increases overall welfare. If physicians behave altruistically, a tradeoff arises between resource savings and guilt disutility from referrals. Additional equilibria emerge if the hospital can differentiate prices and post its own price for inexpensive treatments. <b>Kickbacks</b> continue to be predicted if physicians are not overly altruistic and no or only partial verifiability applies. In these cases, a prohibition of <b>kickbacks</b> improves the allocation. <b>Kickbacks</b> disappear, however, if treatment and diagnosis are verifiable, or if the hospital market is competitive...|$|R

5|$|Starscream, {{having been}} humiliated {{at the hands}} of Megatron, infiltrates Shockwave's towers and sabotages his lab equipment. In the lab he finds Grimlock being held prisoner. He offers Grimlock freedom in {{exchange}} for his fealty, but Grimlock escapes by grabbing and throwing Starscream into the restraint controls, killing him. He reunites with his teammates Swoop, Slug, and Snarl; then proceeds to kill the defending Insecticons and the swarm leaders named Hardshell, <b>Kickback</b> and Sharpshot. Grimlock learns from Shockwave that their processors were tampered with, leaving Grimlock with a speech impairment. By way of his Space Bridge, Shockwave also found a new planet inhabited by large creatures; these were used to inspire all of their new alternate forms. Grimlock was further modified, and now cannot transform on command, but must be in a state of rage to do so. He recalls a name that Sharpshot gave them, the Dinobots, and claims it as their new team name. Then he notices another Space Bridge tower that Shockwave has constructed nearby. Grimlock fights his way to Shockwave, biting his left arm off and rigging the tower to explode. The crumbling tower falls, killing Grimlock and Shockwave in the process and the portal in Cybertron's orbit begins to decay as the remaining three Dinobots watch in horror.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of his exile, Zardari had several {{different}} legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007. However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary. In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999. This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program. If the ordinance was rescinded, {{he would have had to}} deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a <b>kickback</b> from a gold bullion dealer. In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007. In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance. In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms. In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion. He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial.|$|E

25|$|Splitter: A {{splitter}} or {{riving knife}} is a vertical projection located behind the saw blade. This {{can be a}} pin or a fin. It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent <b>kickback.</b> Splitters may incorporate pawls, a mechanism with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing <b>kickback.</b> Splitters can take many forms, including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to an insert. Splitters are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|E

25|$|Five {{days after}} Carey's {{historic}} {{victory at the}} bargaining table in the UPS strike, details of the donations <b>kickback</b> scheme were unveiled by the court-appointed federal official overseeing the union's elections. The report revealed that the donations <b>kickback</b> scheme included Citizen Action. The report said that Carey had approved a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action, and that Citizen Action had donated $75,000 of this money to the Carey re-election effort. The August 23 report also indicated that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had been approached by Carey campaign officials. The report did not, however, conclude that Carey knew of the transactions and referred the matter to federal prosecutors for further investigation. Based on the report's findings, federal officials overturned the 1996 Teamsters presidential election, and called for new rules that would bar non-Teamsters from contributing to union election campaigns and establish a $1,000 contribution limit. The Independent Review Board opened its own inquiry into the financial scandal on August 27.|$|E
