40|$|<b>Initiation</b> <b>rites</b> are {{a common}} feature of many cultures. Classic {{laboratory}} studies conducted in the West {{have shown that the}} more severe the group admission process (the initiation), the stronger the liking of the group joined. Cognitive Dissonance Theory is typically offered as the theoretical explanation offered for this effect. New group members are though to exaggerate their liking of their new group as a way of avoiding feelings of dissonance. However, this explanation overlooks the role of culture in group <b>initiation</b> <b>rites</b> across the world. In many world cultures, <b>initiation</b> <b>rites</b> have functions and consequences beyond those typically explored in existing psychological literature. Amongst many African tribes, <b>initiation</b> <b>rites</b> have a strong educational element and initiates are typically taught about important tribal customs/ practices. This paper explores the cultural functions of <b>initiation</b> <b>rites</b> amongst a variety of African tribes, arguing that <b>initiation</b> <b>rites</b> serve as important conveyors of cultural knowledge and as a way of preserving cultural knowledge from generation to generation...|$|R
40|$|Extract] Culturally {{sensitive}} {{integration of}} medical circumcision could avert adverse effects at traditional male <b>initiation</b> <b>rites.</b> In many traditional cultures, male <b>initiation</b> <b>rites</b> involve circumcision practices that can sometimes result in medical complications. In a recent {{incident in the}} Northern Territory, three young men required airlifting from their Borroloola initiation site to Darwin for medical assistance. The risk of permanent harm and potentially fatal outcomes could be decreased if safer options were available during initiation ceremonies.

40|$|Young {{workers are}} at {{heightened}} OHS risk in workplaces. This enhanced risk {{is due to}} biological, neurological, developmental and labour market position risk factors. This article focuses on another hazard that is commonly encountered by adolescent workers: exposure to <b>initiation</b> <b>rites</b> and pranks. It needs to be noted, however, that older workers can also be subjected to practical jokes at workplaces. <b>Initiation</b> <b>rites,</b> pranks and bullying are all forms of workplace violence. Indeed, these behavioural categories often overlap. For example, groups of workers may play 'tricks' on a new employee that escalate in intensity and severity when repeated over time and may culminate in <b>initiation</b> <b>rites</b> that involve actual physical violence.

The article alleged that in September 2012, a group of male fraternity members at the university had attacked and raped a female student as part of an <b>initiation</b> <b>rite</b> at a party at the university's chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. The article further asserted that the university's sexual assault policies were severely lacking and that the university administration did not handle sexual assault cases appropriately. The article attracted significant media attention and made national headlines, leading to the suspension of the university's Greek system and further investigation into the article's claims; these investigations quickly revealed numerous inconsistencies and raised serious questions about the article's veracity. On January 12, 2015, Charlottesville Police Department officials told the University that [...] "their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at Phi Kappa Psi...so there's no reason to keep them suspended". On January 30, 2015, UVA President Teresa Sullivan acknowledged that the Rolling Stone story was discredited. Charlottesville Police officially suspended their four-month investigation on March 23, 2015, stating that they had no evidence of a gang rape taking place, and that [...] "there is no substantive basis to support the account alleged in the Rolling Stone article." [...] On April 5, 2015, Columbia Journalism Review published [...] calling the Rolling Stone article [...] "a failure" [...] and criticizing the magazine's actions.

After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an <b>initiation</b> <b>rite</b> that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that [...] "The Blonde" [...] is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either. Determined to get a message to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar. The man still accepts the message from Curt to see what he could do. As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself. Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for [...] "The Blonde" [...] to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth.

The <b>initiation</b> <b>rite</b> can continue to be practised and the actual circumcision can be replaced by some other symbolic acts not harmful to women's bodies. This can be derived from the culture itself or Scripture that now forms part of the Nandi way of life." ...|$|E
