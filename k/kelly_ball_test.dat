40|$|Due {{to the low}} {{workability}} of slipform concrete mixtures, {{the science}} of rheology is not strictly applicable for such concrete. However, the concept of rheological behavior may still be considered useful. A novel workability <b>test</b> method (Vibrating <b>Kelly</b> <b>Ball</b> or VKelly <b>test)</b> that would quantitatively assess the responsiveness of a dry concrete mixture to vibration, as is desired of a mixture suitable for slipform paving, was developed and evaluated. The objectives of this test method are {{for it to be}} cost-effective, portable, and repeatable while reporting the suitability of a mixture for use in slipform paving. The work to evaluate and refine the test was conducted in three phases: 1. Assess whether the VKelly test can signal variations in laboratory mixtures with a range of materials and proportions 2. Run the VKelly test in the field at a number of construction sites 3. Validate the VKelly test results using the Box Test developed at Oklahoma State University for slipform paving concrete The data collected to date indicate that the VKelly test appears to be suitable for assessing a mixture’s response to vibration (workability) with a low multiple operator variability. A unique parameter, VKelly Index, is introduced and defined that seems to indicate that a mixture is suitable for slipform paving when it falls in the range of 0. 8 to 1. 2 in. /√s...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{the most}} {{commonly}} method for measuring fresh concrete’s workability on site in Indonesian is {{by means of the}} Abrams harder cone. Workability is measured as a numerical value called the slump number. This method is the oldest and most widely used test on site. On the contrary, two alternatives devices to measure workability of fresh concrete on the field exist. These are K – Slump Tester and the <b>Kelly</b> <b>Ball.</b> The K-Slump Tester rapidly and directly indicates workability of fresh concrete. The device has a pointed end for easy insertion into fresh concrete and a disc that controls the depth of penetration. When inserted, wet concrete enters the shaft through side openings and raises a floating plunger to give an estimate of concrete slump. <b>Kelly</b> <b>Ball</b> is also used to determining the consistency of fresh concrete on site. The deviation of fresh concrete {{as a response to the}} weight of the ball, indicate concrete’s workability. This device has a cylindrical weight with a semispherical bottom 14 kg of weight, a rod with handle, a guide, and support stirrups. The aim of this experimental study is to formulate a more accurate correlation value of workability obtained by the K-Slump and <b>Kelly</b> <b>Ball,</b> to the slump values obtained from the Abrams cone.

Core strength is theorized to optimize athletic performance, reduce risk of injury, and facilitate return from injury. Reliable and valid measures of core strength are necessary to track progress and determine effectiveness of human performance training. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the reliability and validity of three medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests.</b> A total of 20 healthy physically active males and females (Age: 22. 7 ± 7. 8 years, Height: 164. 79 ± 25. 70 cm, Weight: 70. 95 ± 12. 34 kg) participated. Testing occurred in two sessions separated by one to seven days. During session one, isokinetic testing was performed followed by medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests.</b> Isokinetic strength testing included torso flexion, extension, and rotation, standardized according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> were performed in four directions: forwards, backward, and rotational (right/left). Subjects performed five practice trials of each throw, followed by a five-minute rest period. Following the rest period, subjects performed five measured medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests.</b> Subjects performed only the medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> in session two. Average peak torque was utilized for analysis of isokinetic strength. The average distance of the first three medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> in each direction was utilized for analysis. Pearson correlations were calculated to assess validity between medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> in session one and the corresponding isokinetic strength. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the reliability of the medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> between sessions. No significant Pearson correlations were observed between the forward, backward, and rotational medicine <b>ball</b> toss <b>tests</b> and corresponding measures of isokinetic strength (r=- 0. 047, p= 0. 845; r=- 0. 074, p= 0. 756; r=- 0. 051, p= 0. 832 (right); r= 0. 18, p= 0. 447 (left), respectively).

40|$|Vehicle {{manufacturers}} today face increasing {{demands to}} produce fuel efficient vehicles. If {{this is to}} be successfully achieved, the reduction of energy losses is vital [1]. One approach to loss reduction is to use lower viscosity trans mission fluids to reduce splash (churning) losses in the drive-train. However, this introduces potential problems in regard to the durability of machine components due to reduction in oil film thickness [2]. As regards gear transmission, the durability is mainly related to the formation of micropits on parts of gears where sliding is high, which later lead to pitting damage. The formation of micropits is due to surface stress which can be reduced by fluids that form thick EHD films or reduce sliding friction. In order to determine if these same lubricant properties as well as other parameters, known to influence the fuel efficiency of axle lubricants, also affect contact fatigue damage in rolling contacts, an extensive experimental study using a rolling four <b>ball</b> <b>test</b> was performed. The tests were performed with a series of fluids that form thin and thick EHD films and have low and high sliding friction. Additionally, these fluids have been formulated to hav e high and low hydrodynamic friction. All these fluids contai ned additive packages that meet the API GL- 5 gear oil specifications. The different properties of the lubricating fluids were controlled by changes to the base oils as well as addition of friction modifiers. The results have shown that it is possible do distinguish the pitting properties of the different lubricants by using rolling four <b>ball</b> <b>tests.</b> A multiple linear regression statistical analysis was performed with the use of Matlab for evaluating the results obtained from rolling four <b>ball</b> <b>tests.</b> The statistical model developed, showed that some of the physical properties of fluids that a ffect fuel efficiency have an impact on pitting performance of the lubricants.

40|$|The {{lubricants}} {{that are}} used today by Sandvik Materials Technology AB in the cold pilger process contain chlorinated paraffins. Due to environmental, economic and health reasons, these lubricants have to be replaced. The method for trying out new pilger lubricants today is full scale trials in cold pilger mills. The main aim of this thesis has been to investigate whether {{it is possible to}} evaluate pilger lubricants by using some standard laboratory tribological test methods. In addition to this, a review of published literature and a description of the cold pilger process in tribological terms have also been conducted. The literature review included the published work pertaining to cold pilgering in tribology related scientific journals and books. This review indicated that only very limited information is available in open literature and the survey was therefore broadened to include other similar metal working processes. The test methods that have been used are the sliding four <b>ball</b> <b>test</b> machine and the SRV (Schwingung Reibung Verschleiß) reciprocating friction and wear tester. The test specimens for the four ball machine were standard bearing steel balls. In the SRV tests, cylinder on disc and a <b>ball</b> on disc <b>test</b> specimen configurations were used. The cylinder specimens were manufactured from the tube material and the disc specimens were made of mandrel material. The balls for the SRV were made of standard stainless steel. In the four ball machine, both the wear preventive characteristics and extreme pressure properties have been evaluated. In the SRV Optimol machine, seizure and wear tests have been performed. To analyse the surfaces, Wyko 1100 NT optical surface profiler has been used. A more thorough analysis of test specimen surfaces was also carried out by using SEM/EDS at SMT. The results show that the SRV cylinder on disc and ball on disc seizure tests are very representative of the cold pilger process. The ranking of various lubricant formulations from these tests correlate very well to the ranking from the full scale cold pilger trials. The surface damage modes and material transfer in the tests correspond well with those observed in the actual process. The SRV wear test corresponds only to a limited extent and {{the reason for this is}} that the ranking of cold pilger lubricants is not based on wear. The four <b>ball</b> EP <b>tests</b> do not correlate that well with the real ranking. This is attributed to the use of different test specimen material in four <b>ball</b> <b>tests</b> as compared to that actual tube/mandrel materials and the test method may not reproduce the conditions prevalent in the cold pilger process.
