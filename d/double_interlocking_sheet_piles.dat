40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the present state of construction of cofferdam techniques with special emphasis and a brief on other techniques developed world over for mitigating hydraulic forces on the temporary structures. A cofferdam is a temporary structure designed to keep water and soil out of the excavation in which a bridge pier or other structure is built. When construction must take place below the water level, a cofferdam is built to give workers a dry work environment. <b>Sheet</b> <b>piling</b> is driven around the work site, seal concrete is placed into the bottom to prevent water from seeping in from underneath the <b>sheet</b> <b>piling,</b> and the water is pumped out. There are different types of cofferdam, some are used to support excavation operation and some are enclosed type box placed in the water. The present case study deals with step by step procedure adopted at Sabah International Convention Centre and Jesselton Residence which is both located at Kota Kinabalu Sabah. It depicts the intricacy of the management of the work at site and gives lot of insights to such similar works involving details of bentonite slurry, rock bund, planning and execution of <b>interlocking</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> reinforcement, concreting, plants and equipment, safety procedures to be adopted for the construction of cofferdam...|$|R
5000|$|Kingsley Dam {{is located}} at the east end of Lake McConaughy and was the second largest {{hydraulically}} filled earthen dam in the world (behind Fort Peck Dam) on the time of its completion. The dam was named for George P. Kingsley, a Minden, Nebraska banker, who worked with C. W. McConaughy to promote the project. The dam was built by pumping sand and gravel from the river bed to form its sides, while pumping a mixture of loess soil and water {{into the center of the}} structure to form its watertight core. Seepage of water under the dam is prevented by a wall of <b>interlocked</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> driven 30 to 160 ft deep and tied into the impervious Brule clay formation that lies beneath the dam. The dam's face is protected by more than a million tons of rock in several layers and more than 180,000 [...] "jackstones," [...] (rebar-reinforced concrete tetrahedrons), each weighing 800 lb. The dam is 162 ft tall, 3.1 mi long, and 1,100 ft wide at its base.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} the determination of the real parameters of the cross-sectional values of <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> walls made of U-profile piles (moment of inertia and section modulus) and their drivability with regard to interaction of piles through soil. Among the main factors which influence this are the soil friction in the interlocks and the transmission of longitudinal shear forces in the <b>interlocks</b> of the <b>sheet</b> <b>piles.</b> In the field, the soil–interlock interaction depends mainly on the installation method and the soil properties. The aim of this research was to study the dependencies between the applied forces and the friction in the interlocks by full-scale physical modeling during press-in by taking the pile–pile and interlock–soil interactions into account. The results of the on-site full-scale tests as well as the laboratory physical modeling of U-profile piles in different soil conditions are presented in the paper. Using the data obtained, “force–displacements” diagrams were constructed to assess the influence of soil friction and resistance in the interlocks. The calculation model was improved based on the results to provide a more reliable numerical modeling and design of the “sheet pile–soil media” system. The physical modeling clearly shows the influence of soil behavior on the <b>interlock</b> between <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> {{especially in the case of}} saturated sand...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{construction}} sites require strict {{control of their}} environmental impact, which, for vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving, can include damage to nearby structures due to ground vibrations. However, the lack of knowledge concerning the generation of soil vibrations makes the prediction of ground vibration levels difficult. This MSc. thesis in particular, focuses on a crucial link in the vibration transfer chain: the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil interface, which {{is also one of}} the least documented. The aim of this thesis is first, to carry out a full-scale field test consisting in the monitoring of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and ground vibrations during <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibratory driving. And second, to analyze a selected portion of the collected data with focus on the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer. Both aspects of the thesis work aim, more generally, to contribute to the understanding of ground vibration generation under vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving. The full-scale field study was performed in Solna in May 2013. It consisted in the vibratory driving of seven <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> out of which three were fitted with accelerometers. During the driving, ground vibrations were measured by accelerometers, the closest ones placed only 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The design and installation of the soil instrumentation was innovative in as much as accelerometers were not only set on the ground surface but also at three different depths (~ 3 m, 5 m and 6 m). The analysis presented in this thesis is primarily a comparison between <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibrations and ground vibrations measured 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The principal aspects considered in the comparison are: the influence of penetration through different soil layers, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency, the frequency content of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and soil vibrations, and differences between toe- and shaft-generated vibrations. The main conclusions from this study are:  Most of the vibration loss occurs in the near field: 90 - 99 % of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration magnitude was dispersed within 0. 5 m from the driven <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Moreover, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency was reduced for higher <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> acceleration levels and higher frequencies.  The soil characteristics strongly influence the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration levels. A clear distinction could be made between "smooth" and "hard" driving, the latter being associated with an impact situation at the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> toe.  The focus of ground vibration studies should not only be the vertical vibrations.

40|$|Bored {{concrete}} piles {{have been used}} widely on commercial developments in London for about the last 50 years. The life of a commercial building is between 25 – 30 years and, as each building is demolished and rebuilt, the piles from the previous buildings remain in the ground causing obstructions to the new foundations.

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called oblique bending. As a result of oblique bending, the strength and lateral stiffness of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce oblique bending in a steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against oblique bending. Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if oblique bending is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce oblique bending. From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of oblique bending. Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|During {{vibratory}} <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> {{quite often}} the soil near the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall will settle. In many cases {{this is not}} a problem. For situations with houses, pipelines, roads or railroads at relative short distance these settlements may not be acceptable. The purpose of the research described in this thesis is to develop a model that is capable of predicting the settlement due to vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> with reasonable accuracy. The research is limited to <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> in sand. First a description is given of the processes during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling.</b> From this description the main mechanisms that are responsible for the settlement during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> are identified. These are the densification of the soil and the displacement of a soil volume due to the volume of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Presently available models to predict the settlement are described and commented. It is concluded that all models possess some shortcomings. As densification {{is one of the main}} causes for the settlement much attention is paid to the behaviour of sand during cyclic loading. Available models to predict the densification for large numbers of loading cycles are described. Attention is paid to the combined effect of generation and dissipation of excess pore pressure. To supplement the findings from the literature a series of cyclic triaxial tests is performed to clarify some aspects. These tests show that the history of the sand greatly influences the behaviour during cyclic loading. A numerical model is developed that takes into account the different sub processes during vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> (interface behaviour <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> - soil, propagation of vibrations, densification, dissipation excess pore pressure and summation of the local volume strains). For the propagation and the densification different options are considered and implemented. The selected constitutive models are extended to handle both undrained and drained soil behaviour. To validate the developed model a well instrumented field test is designed and executed. This test is performed at Raamsdonksveer, The Netherlands. Measured data are the vibrations near the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile,</b> the pore pressure, the local densification, the settlement at surface and at two depths and the change in cone resistance. The measured data are processed and interpreted. In addition to the results of this test, measured surface settlements from a number of projects are used as well to compare predictions with the developed model with actual behaviour. A reasonable agreement between measured and predicted settlement is found. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Only four <b>sheet</b> <b>piles</b> were driven, with one measurement per <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Some measurements were less successful and some parameters had to be assumed. This limits the accuracy but still provides some interesting results. Another aim is to compare the measured values to existing models for predicting vibrations from <b>piling</b> and <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> operations. There are today several prediction models available, which however often provide too crude estimations or alternatively are too advanced to be incorporated in practical use. Two basic empirical prediction models are compared to the measured values in Karlstad, where the first is one of the earliest and most well known models and the other is a later development of the first model. The purpose of this comparison is to evaluate these models to {{contribute to the development of}} a new prediction model. The results show that the earlier model greatly overestimates the vibration magnitude while the later developed model provides a better estimation.   A literature study is performed to gain a theoretical background to the problem of ground vibrations and how they are related to the method of vibratory driving of <b>sheet</b> <b>piles.</b> The analysis considering the field study and prediction models is mainly performed by using MATLAB to obtain different graphical presentations of the vibration signals. The conclusions that can be drawn from the results are that the focus of vibration analysis should not always be the vertical vibration components. Horizontal movements of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> might be introduced, e. g. by the configuration of the clamping device, which generates additional vibrations in horizontal directions. The soil characteristics influence the magnitude of the vibrations. As the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> reaches a stiffer soil layer, the vibration magnitude increases. A realistic and reliable prediction model should take the characteristics of the soil into account...|$|R

The effect of excavation and backfilling process on the behavior of the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall have been thoroughly investigated and the results are presented in terms of the wall deformations and bending moments, developed anchor forces, and the earth pressures developed on both active and passive side of the wall. Development of failure mechanism in terms of soil displacements and incremental deviatoric strains, slip lines and plastic points formations have been illustrated. Such structures in the field are often associated with high water table, which renders significant hindrance in the construction of <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall, and hence, dewatering is adopted in such cases. The dewatering scheme substantially alters the stress conditions on the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall, and if not accommodated in the design, might render the behavior as unrealistic. This aspect has been addressed in the present article. It has been observed that the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall systems in the dewatered excavation cases are failing before the desired excavation depth, and hence, forms a crucial part of the analysis...|$|R

For a quick estimate the material is usually driven 1/3 above ground, 2/3 below ground, but this may be altered depending on the environment. Taller <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls will need a tie-back anchor, or [...] "dead-man" [...] placed in the soil a distance behind {{the face of the}} wall, that is tied to the wall, usually by a cable or a rod.
