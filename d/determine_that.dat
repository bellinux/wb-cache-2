5|$|After Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble {{used the}} luminosity–period {{relation}} for Cepheids together with spectral shifts first measured by fellow astronomer Vesto Slipher at Lowell Observatory to <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> {{the universe is}} expanding (see Hubble's law).|$|E
5|$|In two {{subsequent}} studies, however, Richard {{and colleagues}} (2014) and Loizides and colleagues (2015) used DNA analysis to <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> this species {{is identical to}} morels collected in southern Europe, matching the original description of Morchella tridentina by Bresadola. This name therefore takes precedence over M. frustrata.|$|E
5|$|Cal also {{exhibits}} feminine characteristics, {{which allows}} Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother {{gives him a}} doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle. Luce carefully observes Callie's actions and diagnoses them as feminine, which causes him to <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> Callie has a feminine gender identity. Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and etched into children at their young ages.|$|E
50|$|The Court <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> a {{constitutional}} protection {{of a right}} to free development of personality meant that a child’s autonomy increases with age, including {{the development of a}} gender identity and bodily awareness. The Court <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> genital surgeries should not be conducted on children over the age of five. It <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> multidisciplinary teams should assess children’s needs on a case-by-case basis.|$|R
5000|$|The Combatant Status Reviews <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> 38 detainees {{were not}} illegal combatants after all.

5000|$|However, a {{toxicology}} test later <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> Diane Linkletter had {{no drugs}} in her system {{the day she}} died. An autopsy conducted by the Los Angeles Coroner's Office <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> Linkletter died from [...] "multiple traumatic injuries".|$|R
5|$|During their patrol, Wish Bear spots Christy {{stranded}} in a canoe within a lake; the other Bears and Cousins {{set out to}} rescue her. Dark Heart fires lightning bolts before the team, and captures many of them with his magic bag the favor he wanted Christy to do all along. The few Family members at hand <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> she {{has teamed up with}} him. This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a conference at the Hall of Hearts; Friend Bear, Secret Bear and Christy's friends later join them.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E

5|$|Jealous of Kim's {{attraction}} to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick {{the lock on}} his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> his period of isolation has left Edward without any sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Walter and Astrid <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> most of {{the effects}} of the device are {{occurring}} in the areas between western Massachusetts and Liberty Islandthe locations of the doomsday machines in the prime and parallel universes respectivelyaligned like iron filings around the ends of a magnet. Walter convinces Broyles to move the device to Liberty Island to reduce the area affected by the strange events. During this time, Peter wakes with confused memories and leaves the hospital, traveling to a location in New York City and buying a silver dollar coin from a pawn shop.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov {{volunteered for}} his 437-day flight {{to learn how}} the human body would respond to the {{micro-gravity}} environment on long-duration missions to Mars. Upon returning from his second spaceflight, Polyakov held {{the record for the}} most total time in space. This record, however, was later broken by Sergei Avdeyev and is currently held by Gennady Padalka. Data from Polyakov's flight has been used by researchers to <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> humans are able to maintain a healthy mental state during long-duration spaceflight just as they would on Earth.|$|E
25|$|The Court <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> a {{constitutional}} protection {{of a right}} to free development of personality meant that a child’s autonomy increases with age, including {{the development of a}} gender identity and bodily awareness. It <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> {{the best interests of the}} child were protected by allowing the child to determine their own gender identity. The Court <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> genital surgeries should not be conducted on children over the age of five, and that multidisciplinary teams should assess children’s needs on a case-by-case basis.|$|R
500|$|The NCAA {{originally}} <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} not count player and team statistics for the game, because three quarters had not been completed.

5000|$|In August 2012, the {{jurisdiction}} covering Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> there was insufficient evidence {{to cover the}} treatment, but the same jurisdiction subsequently <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> Medicare would cover TMS {{for the treatment of}} depression after December 2013.|$|R
5|$|The French army {{carried out}} Bonaparte's {{plan in the}} Battle of Saorgio in April 1794, and then {{advanced}} to seize Ormea in the mountains. From Ormea, they headed west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge. After this campaign, Augustin Robespierre sent Bonaparte {{on a mission to}} the Republic of Genoa to <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> country's intentions towards France.|$|E
5|$|The Question {{explains}} that he has evidence that indicates Doctor Psycho was in Kahndaq when Doctor Light was killed. Superman is physically ill and struggles to control his powers as he and the Question {{break out of the}} base to track down Doctor Psycho, with several other heroes in tow. When they confront Doctor Psycho, they <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> although he was present, he was not responsible for what happened in Kahndaq. Meanwhile, Pandora attempts to convince Vandal Savage to open the box, but he is also unable to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} {{for this type}} of registration is set forth in the Lanham Act, which permits concurrent use registration where the concurrent use applicant made a good-faith adoption of the mark prior to the registrant filing an application for registration. Such registrations are most commonly achieved by agreement of the parties involved, although the USPTO must still <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> no confusion will be caused.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of R.palmatus {{have made it}} difficult for taxonomists to agree on how it should be classified, resulting in an elaborate taxonomical history and an extensive synonymy. First named Agaricus palmatus by Bulliard in 1785, it was reclassified into several different genera before becoming Rhodotus in 1926. The familial placement of the genus Rhodotus within the order Agaricales has also been subject to dispute, and the taxon has been transferred variously to the families Amanitaceae, Entolomataceae, and Tricholomataceae. More recently, molecular phylogenetics analysis has helped <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> Rhodotus is most closely related to genera in the Physalacriaceae.|$|E
5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E
5|$|After {{an alien}} entity declaring {{itself to be}} God destroys {{spacecraft}} en route to Earth, the Enterprise is launched {{under the command of}} Admiral Kirk to engage the vessel. He re-assembles the former crew, including Spock, and sets out to intercept the alien. As they approach the entity, it transports a humanoid probe on board the Enterprise that takes a variety of forms—including that of Jesus. The crew <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> the being and its craft are from an alternate dimension and have been responsible for the creation of religion of numerous planets to teach their inhabitants its laws in a manner understandable at their points in development. The being is malfunctioning; the crew repair it and send it back to its own dimension.|$|E

The Minister <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> inclusion in the Commonwealth Heritage List could not prevent the proposed demolition of the Wings 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and decided not to list them.|$|R
5|$|Ambassador Soval is summoned before Administrator V'Las and the High Council to face {{punishment}} {{over his}} use of a mind meld. Since the act is widely considered to be criminal by the Vulcan authorities, Soval is summarily dismissed from the Ambassadorial service. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol are questioned by the Syrrannites. After a short while, T'Pol is taken to see her mother, T'Les, and the two disagree about the tenets of the group — the Vulcan authorities call them extremists, a term T'Les disagrees with. Soon, Archer begins to see visions of an old Vulcan, and the dissidents <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> he had the katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and <b>determine</b> <b>that</b> this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E
50|$|In {{a narrow}} 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> 18 U. S. C. §§ 241 was instituted {{by the federal}} courts to {{prohibit}} only officers {{of the federal government}} from violating constitutional rights. It was <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the statute did not cover officers of a state who violate the state rights of its citizens. Therefore, it was <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the federal court did not have jurisdiction to prosecute Williams under 18 U. S. C. §§ 241 because he was under commission by the State of Florida and not by the US Federal Government.|$|R
50|$|Tague contested the {{election}} result. After the House of Representatives election committee canvassed over 1,300 votes Fitzgerald's plurality {{went down to}} 10 votes. After <b>determining</b> <b>that</b> one-third of the votes in three precincts of Boston's Ward 5 were fraudulent, the committee threw out the votes of those precincts. The committee <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> {{the election}} had been tainted by illegal registrations and fraud. They <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> Tague won the election by 525 votes. On October 2, 1919, {{by a vote of}} 5 to 2, the committee voted to unseat Fitzgerald and to seat Tague.|$|R
