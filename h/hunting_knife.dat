5|$|The jury heard how {{the murder}} weapons {{had been found}} in a shed at Nazir's house along with two bags of bloodied clothes. DNA and {{fingerprints}} belonging to Nazir was found on the <b>hunting</b> <b>knife</b> and Parker's blood was found on both the hammer and knife. His blood was also found on the clothes of two of the accused, along with Nazir and Mahrad's DNA and a pathologist told how marks on Parker's body matched the hammer found in Nazir's shed. Three balaclavas were also recovered from the property, again containing traces of Parker's blood, Nazir's younger brother Wyed told the court he had seen his brother cleaning the murder weapon {{on the night of the}} killing and witnessed all four defendants with blood on their clothing.

5000|$|<b>Hunting</b> <b>knives</b> are {{traditionally}} designed for cutting rather than stabbing, and {{usually have a}} single sharpened edge. The blade is slightly curved on most models, and some <b>hunting</b> <b>knives</b> may have a blade that has both a curved portion for skinning, and a straight portion for cutting slices of meat. Some blades incorporate a guthook. Most <b>hunting</b> <b>knives</b> designed as [...] "skinners" [...] have a rounded point as to not damage the skin as it is being removed.|$|R

In March 1983 George was convicted at the Old Bailey under the pseudonym of 'Steve Majors' for the February 1982 attempted rape of a woman in Acton, for which he served 18 months of a 33-month sentence. On 10 January 1983, as was revealed after his arrest for the Dando murder, George had been found in the grounds of Kensington Palace, at that time the home of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales.

500|$|Krueger's {{retirement}} was {{marred by}} family tragedies. His son James was dismissed from the army in 1947 for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman after a drunken incident. Grace's health deteriorated, and she suffered from heart disease and high blood pressure. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} in 1955, and died on 13 May 1956. Most dramatically, on 3 October 1952, a lonely and depressed Dorothy fatally stabbed her husband, Colonel Aubrey D. Smith, with a <b>hunting</b> <b>knife</b> while he slept in their Army quarters in Japan. Dorothy, who felt that her husband now regarded her no more than [...] "a clinging handicap to his professional career", had turned to alcohol and drugs.|$|E
500|$|Having {{finished}} work early, Parker and Toms were walking {{to visit her}} friend's house when they were confronted by a gang of around ten Pakistani youths, {{some of whom were}} wearing balaclavas; the 2002 trial judge concluded that they had planned to find [...] "a white male to attack simply because he was white" [...] in the context of [...] "hostility {{on the part of some}} of the younger white residents of the city against the Asian community". They warned Parker he had [...] "better start running", but then blocked his path and quickly sprayed him in the face with CS gas.

500|$|The École Polytechnique massacre, {{also known}} as the Montreal massacre, [...] {{occurred}} on December 6, 1989, at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Twenty-five-year-old Marc Lépine, armed with a Mini-14 rifle and a <b>hunting</b> <b>knife,</b> shot 28 people, killing 14 women, before committing suicide. He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university, where he separated the male and female students. After claiming that he was [...] "fighting feminism" [...] and calling the women [...] "a bunch of feminists," [...] he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targeting women to shoot. Overall, he killed fourteen women and injured ten other women and four men in just under 20 minutes before turning the gun on himself. His suicide note claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life. The note included a list of 19 Quebec women whom Lépine considered to be feminists and apparently wished to kill. It is the deadliest mass shooting in Canadian history.|$|E

500|$|In 1991 a {{group of}} white {{supremacy}} skinheads attacked a couple on a street in Prague after a man called on them to cease nazi salutes. The commotion was witnessed by Pavel Opočenský, a former anti-communist dissident, émigré and famous sculptor, who immediately rushed to help the victims. During the fight, Opočenský used his <b>hunting</b> <b>knife</b> and killed a 17-year-old metal-bar-wielding skinhead. Opočenský was first charged with murder and spent 2 months in a remand prison. He was released from remand prison after the charges were diminished to intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter). He was first convicted by the Municipal Court in Prague and conditionally sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with 4 years probation period. After a lengthy legal proceedings in which higher court repeatedly overturned the Municipal Court's convictions and ordered retrial, Opočenský's actions were finally cleared as legitimate self-defense by the High Court in Prague's decision four and half years later. The trial attracted attention of WP skinheads who conducted various protests. A neo-nazi band Agrese 95 released a song titled [...] "We shall go together and kill Opočenský." ...|$|E

He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen other people, including four men.|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-nine {{inconsistencies}} {{have been}} found between his confession and the known facts of the crime. It has since become the understanding {{that the nature of}} these inconsistencies is a clear indicator of false confessions. Some details did seem to match, like the police theory that Suzanne Degnan was dismembered by a <b>hunting</b> <b>knife</b> and Heirens confessed to throwing a <b>hunting</b> <b>knife</b> onto a section of the Chicago Subway [...] "El" [...] trestle near the Degnan residence. However, it was never determined scientifically that it was at least the dismemberment tool and Heirens had an alternate explanation for it. Further, it was not initially recovered by the police, but members of the press, who recovered it from the transit track gang who found it.|$|E
