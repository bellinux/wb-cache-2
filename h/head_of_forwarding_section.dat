40|$|The {{differential}} cross sections and decay angular distributions for coherent ϕ-meson photoproduction from helium- 4 have been measured {{for the first}} time at forward angles with linearly polarized photons in the energy range E_γ = 1. 685 - 2. 385 GeV. Thanks to the target with spin-parity J^P = 0 ^+, unnatural-parity exchanges are prohibited, and thus natural-parity exchanges can be investigated clearly. The decay asymmetry with respect to photon polarization is shown to be very close to the maximal value. This ensures the dominance (> 94 %) of natural-parity exchanges in this reaction. To evaluate the contribution from natural-parity exchanges to the <b>forward</b> cross <b>section</b> (θ = 0 ^∘) for the γ p →ϕ p reaction near the threshold, the energy dependence <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> cross <b>section</b> (θ = 0 ^∘) for the γ^ 4 He→ϕ^ 4 He reaction was analyzed. The comparison to γ p →ϕ p data suggests that enhancement <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> cross <b>section</b> arising from natural-parity exchanges, and/or destructive interference between natural-parity and unnatural-parity exchanges is needed in the γ p →ϕ p reaction near the threshold.

500|$|On October 3, 2015, in {{a preseason}} {{game against the}} Ducks, Torres was {{assessed}} a match penalty for a late, illegal check to the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> Jakob Silfverberg. The NHL stated the hit would be under review, and, on October 5, Torres was suspended a record 41 games by the league, half of the regular season. Torres forfeited $440,860.29 in salary, which was deposited into the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund. While the record for longest suspension is held by Billy Coutu, who was suspended for life in 1927, Torres holds the distinction of the longest non-lifetime ban, which was previously held by Chris Simon for an incident in 2007. This is also the longest-ever NHL suspension for a hit on another player. Torres did not appeal the suspension and apologized to Silfverberg. Sharks general manager Doug Wilson supported the suspension, saying Torres' hit was [...] "unacceptable and {{has no place in}} our game." ...|$|R

50|$|Filming for Yamato {{took place}} from March to June 2005 at a closed-down {{shipyard}} of Hitachi Zosen Corporation in Onomichi, Hiroshima Prefecture. Approximately JPY 600 million {{was spent in}} building a 1:1 scale set <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> and the portside anti-aircraft guns. The starboard side, aft section and the barrels of the A turret were not built since the film only required scenes on the port side. However, compliance issues with Japan's Building Standards Act prevented the reproduction of the Yamato's pagoda tower. Instead, photographs of the Yamato Museum's own 1:10 Yamato model was used for post-production. The interior scenes were made on a sound stage, but a hall near the set shows the various rooms and props reproduced for the film.|$|R

5000|$|On July 24, 1986, the FAA of United States and NASA {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of agreement to formally begin the Airborne Wind-Shear Detection and Avoidance Program (AWDAP). As a result, a wind-shear program {{was created in the}} Flight Systems Directorate of NASA's Langley Research Center.

They chose an extensively modified Boeing 737, which was equipped with a rear research cockpit in place <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the passenger cabin. A modified Rockwell Collins model 708 X-band ground-based radar unit was used in the AWDAP experiments.

The vessels are held in place simply with wood packing. The smaller air vessels are a proprietary design that took some heavy research to perfect. They are sealed by {{the pressure of the}} gas, as the pressure rises, a slackly threaded cap presses up against a sealing ring which is screwed down with another cap, thus making an airtight seal. Directly aft of the air vessels is the fuel tank which is ringed by the main forward trim tanks. The fuel tank is lightly constructed and contains baffles to prevent sloshing. Just behind this are the 4 steering air bottles.|$|R

50|$|The block {{instrument}} {{consists of a}} small cabinet; its front face displays two indicators — telegraph needles — and has a commutator handle (some early designs of {{block instrument}}s had miniature semaphore arms instead of needles). The upper indicator shows the state <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>section,</b> on the line leading away from the signal box.

All indications are repeated on a similar instrument {{at the other end of}} the block section, in the associated signal box. The commutator has three positions and each of the two indicators has three positions: normal (or line blocked), line clear, and train on line. Either integral to the instrument or separately mounted, there is a single-stroke bell and a bell operating device, either a tapper or a plunger.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} is an uncovered tube structure, {{with the}} exposed pilot's {{seat on a}} pair of tubes which form the basis <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>section</b> with a curved reinforcing girder under it. The primary wing bracing, V-struts from the wing spars, are attached to them. They meet at the nose, where another tube joins them to the forward spar. Behind the wing the lower fuselage member is a single tube, braced at its forward end by a pair of tubes upwards to the rear spar and at its rear by another long pair to the rear spar. A horizontal pair of tubes from the rear spar to a vertical rudder post, which joins the lower fuselage tube at its base, complete the rear frame. The upper frame supports a straight-edged tailplane with balanced elevators and a balanced rudder which extends from the keel to above the tailplane via an elevator cut-out.|$|R
