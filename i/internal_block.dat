40|$|This report {{documents}} the design procedure of a SerDes Transmitter module for PCI e-gen 1 applications. The Transmitter module has programmable features: impedance, amplitude and pre-emphasis. Design {{was performed in}} 130 nm CMOS technology (process IBM cmrf 8 sf). The design of the Transmitter module is divided in three stages as follow: First, a behavioral model of Transmitter module was created in Verilog-A language. This model has 2 inputs and two complementary outputs. This behavioral model was used to verify the proper system-level response of the Transmitter module alone. Simulations based on behavioral model were performed using Spectre simulator in Virtuoso-Cadence. Simulations {{results show that the}} three features: impedance, amplitude and pre-emphasis could be properly modulated with the developed Verilog-A code. The behavioral model of Transmitter module was also assembled with other modules of SerDes system in order to perform mixed-signal simulations and validate the correct response of the entire SerDes system for PCI-e gen 1 specifications. As second stage, the Transmitter module was designed at transistor level with two complementary outputs. For this, we used pCells (transistors, resistors and capacitors, and vias for interconnecting devices) from CMRF 8 SF technology process. Transmitter module is composed by several blocks such as Mux, Decoders, basic digital cells, buffers, and pseudo-analog cells among others. Transistors of digital cells were sized by applying the basic scaling theory while transistors of pseudo-analog cells were sized by analytic calculations in an iterative way. Mux and Decoders were assembled with digital cells. To validate the correct response of each designed <b>internal</b> <b>block,</b> test-benches were created to test each block. Transient simulations were performed using Spectre in Virtuoso Cadence. After verifying the proper response of <b>internal</b> <b>block</b> alone, they were assembled to form more complex blocks such as Decoders, ZAP UNIT and others and they were also tested. Finally, all internal blocks of Transmitter module were assembled and tested at nominal PVT conditions. Critical PVT corners were evaluated and it was verified that response was under tolerance range. The third stage of design was the layout creation in a custom way. A similar bottom-up methodology followed to design at schematic-level of internal modules was applied to design the layout of each <b>internal</b> <b>block</b> of the Transmitter module. Keeping in mind the integration of internal blocks, the low–level digital cells were designed with the same height. The layout of each <b>internal</b> <b>block</b> was verified for DRC and LVS using Calibre tool and design rules of CMRF 8 SF process. Extraction of parasitics from layout using Calibre-PEX was done for each <b>internal</b> <b>block.</b> Post-layout response was compared to the pre-layout one; for this, Spectre simulation was performed of each internal blocks using simultaneously the extracted Calibre view and schematic view. Once the correct response was verified, the internal blocks were assembled and routed in order to build the entire layout of Transmitter module. Finally, the layout of Transmitter module was folded in order to generate the two complementary outputs. At this top level, the layout of Transmitter module was also checked for DRC and LVS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Multistage {{buffered}} switching fabrics are {{the most}} efficient method for scaling packet switches to very large numbers of ports. The Benes network is the lowestcost switching fabric known to yield operation free of <b>internal</b> <b>blocking.</b> Backpressure inside a switching fabric can limit the use of expensive off-chip buffer memory to just virtual-output queues (VOQ) {{in front of the}} input stage. This paper extends the known backpressure architectures to the Benes network. To achieve this, we had to successfully combine per-flow backpressure, multipath routing (inverse multiplexing), and cell resequencing. We present a flow merging scheme that is needed to bring the cost of backpressure down to O(N) per switching element. We prove freedom from deadlock for a wide class of multipath cell distribution algorithms. Using a cell-time-accurate simulator, we verified operation free of <b>internal</b> <b>blocking,</b> we evaluated various cell distribution and resequencing methods, we found that delay under bursty traffic is only 25 to 50 percent higher than ideal output queueing, and we showed that the delay of well-behaved flows remains unaffected by the presence of congested traffic to oversubscribed output ports...|$|R
