5|$|Although water <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>for</b> life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale.

5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>for</b> rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can {{be at risk for}} life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E
5|$|Archeological {{data from}} the Late Pleistocene in South Asia <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>for</b> our {{understanding}} of the evolution of modern human behavior and how early humans spread through the Old World. In prehistoric times, the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over the continental shelf shared between the two countries, which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. Being only around 70 m deep, significant reductions in sea level due to climate change, in at least the past 500,000 years, periodically caused the continental shelf to be exposed, forming a land bridge approximately 100km wide and 50km long.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{friction}} <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>for</b> minimizing wear on {{mechanical components}} and preventing overheating. As the relative {{speed of the}} components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} in the physics of {{accretion}} disks is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high effective viscosity. The turbulent viscosity {{is thought to be}} responsible for the transport of the mass to the central protostar and momentum to the periphery of the disk. This <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>for</b> accretion, because the gas can be accreted by the central protostar only if it loses most of its angular momentum, which must be carried away by the small part of the gas drifting outwards. The result of this process is the growth of both the protostar and of the disk radius, which can reach 1,000AU if the initial angular momentum of the nebula is large enough. Large disks are routinely observed in many star-forming regions such as the Orion nebula.|$|E
5|$|Water is a {{chemical}} substance that {{is composed of}} hydrogen and oxygen and <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>for</b> all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% {{in the air as}} vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.|$|E
