Our purpose {{was to determine the}} accuracy of multi-section CT angiography in detecting cerebral aneurysms compared with <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> or surgery. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients who underwent multi-section CT <b>angiography</b> and either <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> or surgery were included in the study. Multi-section CT <b>angiography</b> and <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> results were evaluated independently by different neuroradiologists who performed aneurysm detection, quantitation, and character-ization by using 2 D multiplanar reconstructions, 3 D maximum intensity projection, and volume-rendered techniques. RESULTS: When using intra-arterial <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> or surgery, 113 aneu-rysms (true positives and false negatives) were detected in 83 of the 100 patients.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{radiation}} dose delivered at four- and 16 -detector row computed tomography (CT) with a dose-modulation program and that delivered at <b>digital</b> <b>angiography</b> {{for evaluation of}} pulmonary embolism (PE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The {{part of the study}} involving patients (seven women, four men; mean age, 62 years +/- 16 [standard deviation]; range, 41 - 85 years) was approved by the institutional review board. Patients gave written informed consent. Exposure was performed with an anthropomorphic phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeters for four-detector row CT without the dose-modulation program and 16 -detector row CT without and with the dose-modulation program with standard protocols for pulmonary CT angiography (120 kV, 144 mAs, four and 16 detector rows with 1. 00 - and 0. 75 -mm section thickness, respectively). Digital angiograms were acquired with four standard projections at 80 kV. For <b>digital</b> <b>angiography,</b> {{radiation dose}} was calculated according to phantom measurements and adapted to acquisition and fluoroscopy times. Distribution of dose was compared for CT and <b>digital</b> <b>angiography.</b> RESULTS: During pulmonary CT angiography, mean radiation dose delivered at middle of chest was 21. 5, 19. 5, and 18. 2 mGy for four-detector row CT and for 16 -detector row CT without and with dose-modulation program, respectively. At the same level, a mean dose of 91 mGy was delivered with <b>digital</b> <b>angiography.</b> The dose adjusted to clinical conditions was 139. 0 mGy for <b>digital</b> <b>angiography</b> and could be reduced after technical adjustment. Ratios of maximum dose to mean dose were 1. 15 and 2. 96 for CT and <b>digital</b> <b>angiography,</b> respectively. With application of the dose-modulation program at 16 -detector row CT, radiation dose was reduced 15 %- 20 % at the upper chest. CONCLUSION: Multi-detector row CT delivers a lower radiation dose, with better spatial distribution of dose, than does pulmonary CT angiography.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{time-of-flight}} and contrast-enhanced- magnetic resonance angiography techniques in a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance unit with <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> {{with the latest}} flat-panel technology and 3 D reconstruction {{in the evaluation of}} embolized cerebral aneurysms. INTRODUCTION: Many embolized aneurysms are subject to a recurrence of intra-aneurismal filling. Traditionally, imaging surveillance of coiled aneurysms has consisted of repeated <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography.</b> However, this method has a small but significant risk of neurological complications, and many authors have advocated the use of noninvasive imaging methods for the surveillance of embolized aneurysms. METHODS: Forty-three aneurysms in 30 patients were studied consecutively between November 2009 and May 2010. Two interventional neuroradiologists rated the time-of-flight-magnetic resonance angiography, the contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance angiography, and finally the <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography,</b> first independently and then in consensus. The status of aneurysm occlusion was assessed according to the Raymond scale, which indicates the level of recanalization according to degrees: Class 1 : excluded aneurysm; Class 2 : persistence of a residual neck; Class 3 : persistence of a residual aneurysm. The agreement among the analyses was assessed by applying the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement was excellent for both methods (K = 0. 93; 95 % CI: 0. 84 - 1). Inter-technical agreement was almost perfect between time-of-flight-magnetic resonance <b>angiography</b> and <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> (K = 0. 98; 95 % CI: 0. 93 - 1) and between time-of-flight-magnetic resonance angiography and contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance angiography (K = 0. 98; 95 % CI: 0. 93 - 1). Disagreement occurred in only one case (2. 3 %), which was classified as Class I by time-of-flight-magnetic resonance angiography and Class II by <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography.</b> The agreement between contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance <b>angiography</b> and <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> was perfect (K = 1; 95 % CI: 1 - 1). In three patients, in-stent stenosis was identified by magnetic resonance angiography but not confirmed by <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography.</b> CONCLUSION: <b>Digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> and both 3 T magnetic resonance angiography techniques have excellent reproducibility for the assessment of aneurysms embolized exclusively with coils. In those cases also treated with stent remodeling, <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> may still be necessary to confirm eventual parent artery stenosis, as identified by magnetic resonance angiography...|$|R

40|$|Two {{uncommon}} {{cases of}} paragangliomas {{arising from the}} vagus nerve are described. The first patient underwent surgery for suspected carotid body tumour. In the second patient, computed tomography scan and <b>digital</b> <b>angiography</b> allowed a correct pre-operative diagnosis to be made. These cases confirm the prevalence of vagal paragangliomas in female sex and middle age, {{and the possibility of}} multiple similar tumours in the same patient. Histological benign features, absence of neurological symptoms, of local invasion or intracranial extension confirm the frequent benign behaviour of these neoplasms. Lack of catecholamine secretion confirms the low incidence of functioning tumours. Contrast computed tomography and <b>digital</b> <b>angiography</b> still remain the gold standard reliable instruments for diagnosis despite the success of magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography and octreotide scintigraphy to detect head and neck paragangliomas. A transcervical approach, without mandibulotomy, is suitable too for large tumours but complete removal, with sparing of involved segments of the vagus nerve, is rarely possible.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accuracy}} of catheter-based intravascular ultrasonography to define luminal size in humans in vivo and its sensitivity to describe lesion morphology {{have not been}} previously reported. Vessel diameter, cross-sectional area and lesion characteristics assessed by <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> and intravascular ultrasonography (20 MHz) were compared in 86 human arterial segments. The same arterial segments were imaged and analyzed by <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> and intravascular ultrasonography at 49 femoral, 3 renal, 5 iliac, 7 pulmonary and 22 aortic sites. Digital subtraction angiographic diameter and area were determined geometrically by an automated algorithm. Intravascular ultrasonographic diameter and area were determined by planimetry. Linear correlation for diameter by the two techniques was 0. 97, standard error of the estimate (SEE) = 1. 83 mm, and for cross-sectional area it was 0. 95, SEE = 0. 65 cm 2. Intravascular ultrasonography identified 24 sites in which plaque was present; 11 (46 %) of these segments appeared normal by <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography.</b> Conversely, <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> demonstrated irregularities in 18 segments of which 5 (28 %) appeared normal by intravascular ultrasonography. These data indicate an excellent correlation between intravascular ultrasonography and <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> for in vivo assessment of human arterial dimensions in normal and minimally diseased segments.

40|$|Background: Computed {{tomography}} (CT) angiography is {{used for}} preoperative evaluation of living kidney donors, but its correlation with intraoperative findings during the transplant operation remains unknown. Methods: Between April 1997 and October 2008, 34 consecutive pairs of living kidney transplants were carried out. Conventional <b>digital</b> <b>angiography</b> was employed for the preoperative assessment in the first 19 pairs, and CT angiography in the subsequent 15 pairs. The radiological reports and operative findings during kidney harvest were carefully examined and compared. Results: Among the 34 cases in our cohort, we found 9 early branching renal arteries (26. 4 %) and 6 double renal arteries (17 %). Venous and ureteral anomalies were rare, with only 1 case (2. 9 %) of each. CT angiography offered excellent and equal accuracy (accuracy 100 %) when compared with conventional <b>digital</b> <b>angiography</b> for renal arterial anatomy. CT angiography showed superior performance compared with conventional angiography {{in the domain of}} venous and collecting system anomalies (accuracy 100 % vs. 94. 7 %, respectively). No contrast nephropathy or allergy was documented in our series. Conclusions: CT angiography showed excellent correlations with surgical findings in the Chinese population. It is associated with minimal risk of contrast nephropathy as well as lower cost and therefore should be adopted as the standard preoperative assessment of living kidney donors. © 2010 Società Italiana di Nefrologia. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
