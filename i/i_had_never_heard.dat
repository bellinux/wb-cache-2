25|$|The {{primitive}} southern Negro, as he sang, {{was sure}} to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, {{it was always the}} same. Till then, however, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major..., and I carried this device into my melody as well... This was a distinct departure, but as it turned out, it touched the spot.|$|E
500|$|Eddie Condon, Hoagy Carmichael, and Mezz Mezzrow, {{all of whom}} hyperbolically {{raved about}} his playing, also saw Beiderbecke play live or {{performed}} alongside him. Condon, for instance, wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke's piano playing: [...] "All my life I had been listening to music [...] But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> anything remotely like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn't all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds" [...] "I tried to explain Bix to the gang," [...] Carmichael wrote, but [...] "t was no good, like the telling of a vivid, personal dream [...] the emotion couldn't be transmitted." ...|$|E
500|$|Vocalist Karl Willetts of {{the death}} metal band Bolt Thrower asserts the record was an {{inspiration}} for the band: [...] "When Slayer's Haunting the Chapel came out <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> anything like that before with that style of guitar playing. We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing. And other bands we heard like Venom, Slaughter and Metallica. So we took the elements of musicianship from metal and the aggression of punk and poured it all together." [...] Chuck Schuldiner of the band Death said the record was [...] "life changing at the time" [...] asserting, [...] "That was {{some of the early}} stuff that gave me that push." ...|$|E

500|$|A jazz fusion album, Song of Innocence {{combines}} jazz elements with impressionistic musical {{figures and}} hard rock guitar solos. Its music also incorporates funk, rock, theatre, and pop styles. Music journalists categorized the record as jazz-rock, baroque pop, and psychedelic R. John Murph of JazzTimes magazine said the music {{could be better}} characterized as art pop than jazz. Axelrod, who had produced bebop albums before working for Capitol, asserted that jazz {{played a crucial role}} in the music: [...] "For years, all I did was jazz. When I first got in the record business, I was so into jazz that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> Elvis Presley. I still probably listen to jazz more than anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Danke Schoen" [...] {{is one of}} the {{recurring}} motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the [...] "most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{included}} in Pitchforks list of their staff's favorite music books. Contributing writer Matthew Perpetua said the book's writers—either top critics at the time or those who have since become important figures in music journalism—outline the [...] "alternative sensibility" [...] by recognizing and connecting music from disparate genres in [...] "an inclusive, open-minded survey, but it's defined as much by what's left out—pretty much all Boomer-oriented rock—as what it includes." [...] According to Perpetua, the [...] "number of young readers [...] pursued music criticism" [...] because of the book was far greater than the copies it sold. Matthew Schnipper, editor of The Fader, bought the book after it was published and said he {{used it as a}} consumer guide for 10 years. Along with its influence on future critics, the book was cited by guitarist William Tyler as his only source of music education growing up, having found it in a bookstore around the time it was published: [...] "They had entries for all these different people that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of: Can, John Zorn, [...] Fahey, whatever... That was before any sort of Internet presence".|$|E

500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{write this}} novel, Grimwood did {{extensive}} research into brain surgery and epilepsy. Film producer William Castle {{took an interest}} in adapting Breakthrough for a movie, but the project was never realized. Breakthrough has certain parallels with David Williams' Second Sight (Simon and Schuster, 1977), coincidentally written the same year and later adapted for the TV movie, The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan (1979). Williams has commented, [...] "As the author of Second Sight, I {{have to tell you that}} until I read this Wikipedia page in 2004, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Ken Grimwood or his novel Breakthrough." ...|$|E

Numbers from the Fibonacci sequence surface repeatedly in Elliott wave structures, including motive waves (1,3,5), a single full cycle (8waves), and the completed motive (89 waves) and corrective (55 waves) patterns. Elliott developed his market model before he realized that it reflects the Fibonacci sequence.

In his memoir, Dublin Made Me, Andrews {{described}} Clancy's personality: [...] "I was overcome by the extraordinary impact which Clancy’s personality had on me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> or seen Clancy before nor indeed did I ever see him again but he left an indelible impression of the superman, a man whose commands I at least would have a compulsion to obey as if I had been hypnotised ...

2500|$|When I was {{at first}} asked to attend the St. Louis World's Fair I {{did not wish to}} go. Later, when I was told that I would receive good {{attention}} and protection, and that the President of the United States said that it would be all right, I consented ... Every Sunday the President of the Fair sent for me to go to a wild west show. I took part in the roping contests before the audience. There were many other Indian tribes there, and strange people of whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> ... I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people. They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried to harm me in any way.

2500|$|When Scruggs was 21, Monroe {{was looking}} for a banjo player for his group because David Akeman, known as Stringbean, was quitting. At the time, banjo players often functioned in the band as comedians, and the {{instrument}} was often held as a prop — their clawhammer playing was almost inaudible. Monroe, along with band member Lester Flatt, auditioned several banjo players who had the same traditional playing style as Akeman. When Scruggs auditioned for them at the Tulane Hotel in Nashville, Flatt said," [...] I was thrilled. It was so different! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> that kind of banjo picking". [...] Scruggs joined Monroe in late 1945, earning $50 a week. After they accepted Scruggs as one of the Blue Grass Boys, the roster consisted of Bill Monroe (vocals/mandolin), Lester Flatt (guitar/vocals), Earl Scruggs (banjo), Chubby Wise (fiddle), and Howard Watts (stage name Cedric Rainwater) on bass. This group of men became the prototype of what a bluegrass band would be.|$|E
2500|$|Ólafur Arnalds won a British Academy Television (BAFTA) Craft Award for Original Television Music in April 2014. It was {{his first}} {{composition}} for television. Ólafur's music was widely praised. Mike Hale, writing in The New York Times, called it [...] "a tasty icing of gloom and foreboding", and noted that the show leaned very heavily on the mood that the music created. Cast members were equally as impressed with the music. Actress Jodie Whittaker has said that [...] "hearing the music by Ólafur Arnalds just broke me every time." [...] Actor Andrew Buchan was equally effusive. [...] "The power of music can draw people in more than they realise. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> {{a piece of music}} like it. They deliberately went left-field with Ólafur Arnalds. I found it haunting, beautiful and desolate. It can make or break a show. If you think about your reasons for watching The Killing, the music that swells at the end draws you into watching another one. Same with Broadchurch— the music can't be ignored." ...|$|E
