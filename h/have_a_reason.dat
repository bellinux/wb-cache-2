5|$|By the mid-1970s, Ike Turner's {{excessive}} cocaine habit {{had gotten}} out of hand. During this period, Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo to help her deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal with Cream Records. The deal was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina got into a fight during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} {{established}} on West 58th Street in 1929 by Sherman Billingsley, a former bootlegger from Enid, Oklahoma. After an incident when Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by Mad Dog Coll, a rival of his mobster partners, {{he became the}} sole owner of the Stork Club. The club remained at its original location until it was raided by Prohibition agents in 1931. After the raid, it moved to East 51st Street. From 1934 until its closure in 1965, it was located at 3 East 53rd Street, just east of Fifth Avenue, when it became world-renowned with its celebrity clientele and luxury. Billingsley {{was known for his}} lavish gifts, which brought a steady stream of celebrities to the club and also insured that those interested in the famous would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to visit.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] {{revolves}} around a break-in, which, {{combined with an}} argument between {{the people living in}} the house, means that the characters all <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to be silent. At 18 pages of stage directions, the script contained every joke in the episode, an exercise in planning atypical for Shearsmith and Pemberton. The story contains multiple [...] "reveals"; Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith [...] "hope there's an 'oh my God' moment. There is always a desire to wrong-foot the viewer. That's what you strive to do". Pemberton said that writing for a silent episode [...] "makes you inventive in a completely different way".|$|E

500|$|The episode premiered to near {{universal}} critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave it 9.6/10, {{and thought}} it was [...] "one of the most balanced and well-executed episodes of the series, Fringe fans get action, suspense, emotion, and best of all, some revelations!... This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But {{the most important thing is}} that the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a pretty damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off.

500|$|Walter Afanasieff, long-time Mariah Carey collaborator, {{worked with}} Simpson on three cuts from Irresistible. One of the songs, [...] "When You Told Me You Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul. The message is there's so much in life that can get you discouraged, but if you trust that you're being watched over, you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to live and a sense of freedom.

500|$|The {{episode was}} devised {{following}} a lecture given by writer Mike Bullen {{and executive producer}} Andy Harries at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference in November 2000. Bullen and Harries already knew that actress Fay Ripley {{did not want to}} renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted [...] "for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go". The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1. As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, [...] "One of them , whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters." [...] Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country. The direction of the fourth series, and thus the finale, changed significantly when Helen Baxendale announced that she was pregnant.|$|E

2500|$|The time {{difference}} {{is also a}} problem facing traditional advertisers. When social events occur and are broadcast on television, {{there is often a}} time delay between airings on the east coast and west coast of the United States. Social networking sites have become a hub of comment and interaction concerning the event. This allows individuals watching the event on the west coast (time-delayed) to know the outcome before it airs. The 2011 Grammy Awards highlighted this problem. Viewers on the west coast learned who won different awards based on comments made on social networking sites by individuals watching live on the east coast. Since viewers knew who won already, many tuned out and ratings were lower. All the advertisement and promotion put into the event was lost because viewers didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to watch.|$|E

While on the airplane, the two became embroiled in an altercation, {{which led to a}} physical fight in their limousine. The duo presented different accounts as to what went on that day. Ike accused Tina of being negligent to help him with a nose bleed due to constant cocaine use. Tina claimed Ike was annoyed that Tina was eating chocolates while wearing an all-white outfit, causing Ike to slap her. The couple agreed, however, that Ike had been up for five days straight on a cocaine binge. Following Ike's slap, Tina recalled fighting him back, scratching him and kicking him. Ike Turner alleged to a musician associate friend that the two [...] "went around like prizefighters for awhile". Both Ike and Tina were bleeding by the time they arrived at the hotel. After going up to their suite, Ike retired to a sofa.

2500|$|To {{a modern}} {{physicist}} working with Einstein's {{general theory of}} relativity, the situation is even more complicated than is suggested above. Einstein's theory suggests that it actually is valid to consider that objects in inertial motion (such as falling in an elevator, or in a parabola in an airplane, or orbiting a planet) can indeed be considered to experience a local loss of the gravitational field in their rest frame. Thus, in {{the point of view}} (or frame) of the astronaut or orbiting ship, there actually is nearly-zero proper acceleration (the acceleration felt locally), just as would be the case far out in space, away from any mass. It is thus valid to consider that most of the gravitational field in such situations is actually absent {{from the point of view}} of the falling observer, just as the colloquial view suggests (see equivalence principle for a fuller explanation of this point). However, this loss of gravity for the falling or orbiting observer, in Einstein's theory, is due to the falling motion itself, and (again as in Newton's theory) not due to increased distance from the Earth. However, the gravity nevertheless is considered to be absent. In fact, Einstein's realization that a pure gravitational interaction cannot be felt, if all other forces are removed, was the key insight to leading him to the view that the gravitational [...] "force" [...] can in some ways be viewed as non-existent. Rather, objects tend to follow geodesic paths in curved space-time, and this is [...] "explained" [...] as a force, by [...] "Newtonian" [...] observers who assume that space-time is [...] "flat," [...] and thus do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for curved paths (i.e., the [...] "falling motion" [...] of an object near a gravitational source).|$|E
