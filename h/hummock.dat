40|$|Mineral earth <b>hummocks</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} forms of patterned ground in the permafrost areas of the world, yet little is known of their hydrological role in the drainage of hillslopes. The impact of earth <b>hummocks</b> on subsurface drainage was studied at three hillslope plots during the snow-free periods of 1993 and 1994 at a small hummock-covered Arctic tundra watershed (Siksik Creek) in north-western Canada. Subsurface drainage occurs preferentially through the unfrozen saturated layer of the inter-hummock area, owing to its relatively high permeability and connected nature. The inter-hummock area is composed of primary channels, oriented in the downslope direction, and secondary channels, obstructed from conducting water directly downslope. Because of their very low hydraulic conductivity, earth <b>hummocks</b> obstruct hillslope drainage. As a result, the spatial distribution of earth <b>hummocks</b> on a hillslope influences the average tortuosity of the individual inter-hummock channels that comprise the hillslope drainage network. The time required for runo water to reach the streambank increases with increasing tortuosity of inter-hummock channels. Earth <b>hummocks</b> attenuate subsurface flows owing to seepage between the <b>hummocks</b> and the inter-hummock area. <b>Hummocks</b> als...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{comparation}} of frost <b>hummocks</b> in the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. and in the Mosfellsheiði area in Iceland {{in terms of their}} external and internal characteristics as well as their thermal characteristics. Field work in Mosfellsheiði provided height, length, and width data of more than 120 frost <b>hummocks</b> which were analyzed and compared to frost <b>hummocks</b> in Keprník and Tabulové skály location in the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. Soil samples from frost <b>hummocks</b> were taken to determine frost susceptibility of soils. Based on ground temperature measurements at depth of 15 and 30 cm in the frost <b>hummocks</b> in Iceland and the Hrubý Jeseník Mts., freeze-thaw cycles were investigated. The results show that frost <b>hummocks</b> in the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. are larger but less domed-shaped than those in Mosfellsheiði. Further, soils in frost <b>hummocks</b> are frost susceptible. The highest numbers of freeze-thaw cycles were identified in Iceland. It was also found out that freeze-thaw processes occurred in the frost <b>hummocks</b> in Tabulové skály but in Keprník location were very few freeze-thaw cycles observed. Short term freeze-thaw cycles at the end of regelation seasons mostly show diurnial frequency. At the 30 cm depths only one or two regelations were observed during a single season.

5|$|Until 2003, US 113 {{continued}} {{north from}} Milford concurrently with DE 1 along four-lane divided Bay Road to Dover. The U.S. Highway crossed the Murderkill River while passing {{to the east}} of Frederica. At the north end of Frederica, the highway met the eastern end of DE 12 (Frederica Road). US 113 passed by historic Barratt's Chapel, the birthplace of Methodism in the United States. The highway met the southern end of US 113 Alternate (Clapham Road) at a Y intersection in the village of Little Heaven. US 113 crossed the St. Jones River and curved northwest at its intersections with the southern end of DE 9 (Bayside Drive) and the western end of Kitts <b>Hummock</b> Road. The highway became a freeway along the edge of Dover Air Force Base. US 113 had a diamond interchange with Old Lebanon Road, which served the main gate of the air force base to the northeast and base housing to the southwest. At the next interchange, a partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of DE 10 (Lebanon Road) next to the military base's north gate, US 113 exited onto Bay Road while DE 1 continued on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway. The U.S. Highway had ramps from northbound US 113 to northbound DE 1, from southbound US 113 to southbound DE 1, and from southbound DE 1 to US 113 just south of its partial interchange with the Puncheon Run Connector, which connected DE 1 and US 113 with US 13 {{on the south side of}} Dover. US 113 entered the city of Dover and passed between the DelDOT headquarters and the Blue Hen Corporate Center, which was transformed into a corporate center from the defunct Blue Hen Mall in 1995. The route intersected Court Street (named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard since 2013), which headed west into the Dover Green Historic District and by the Delaware State Capitol, before reaching its northern terminus at a Y intersection with US 13 and the northern end of US 113 Alternate (DuPont Highway).|$|E

25|$|Swainson's hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, {{watching}} for prey activity from a perch {{such as a}} tree, bush, pylon, telephone pole, <b>hummock</b> or other high object. Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over the ground like a northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a rough-legged hawk (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the broad-winged hawk (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.|$|E
25|$|For {{the third}} {{lighthouse}} {{built by the}} Queensland colonial government (Lady Elliot Island Light erected on Lady Elliott's Island in 1872/73), Colonial Architect FDG Stanley designed a structure which utilised readily available local timber, specifying a hardwood frame clad with plated iron sheeting. This reduced the cost of construction, and despite problems of termite infestation and rusting, this type of construction, or its derivative, a wooden frame with corrugated galvanised iron sheeting, became the standard for subsequent nineteenth century Queensland lighthouses. Between 1873 and 1901, 14 lighthouses were constructed in Queensland using hardwood framing and plated iron sheeting, and another 7 were constructed with hardwood frames and corrugated iron cladding. The latter were associated mostly with harbour entrances and included: Little Sea Hill Light (1876 – relocated); Grassy Hill Light (1886 – active); Goods Island Light (1886 – active); Bay Rock Light (1886 – inactive – relocated); Caloundra Head Light (1896 – inactive); North Point <b>Hummock</b> Light (1899 – demolished); Gatcombe Head Light (1900 – demolished).

40|$|Heterogeneity {{can boost}} biodiversity, {{as well as}} {{increase}} the resilience of an ecosystem to changing environmental conditions; therefore, {{it is important to}} understand how topographic heterogeneity in ecosystems is formed. Sandy tidal marshes have a repetitive pattern of higher elevated <b>hummocks</b> surrounded by lower elevated depressions, representing topographic heterogeneity at the scale of a few square meters. The aims of this study were to determine when this topographic heterogeneity forms, how it is structured, and whether it persists during marsh development. The soil topography of marshes consists of coarse-grained sediment formed before marsh vegetation development, with an overlaying fine-grained sediment layer formed after initial marsh development. To gain insight into the formation of topographic heterogeneity, we studied the underlying soil topography of four European sandy marshes, where topographic heterogeneity at a scale of a few square meters was present. The differences in elevation between <b>hummocks</b> and depressions can either be caused by heterogeneity in the coarse-grained sediment or by heterogeneity in the top layer containing the fine-grained sediment. Our results showed that the largest percentage of elevational differences between <b>hummocks</b> and depressions could be attributed to heterogeneity in the underlying coarse-grained substratum. Therefore, we conclude that the patterns in all four marshes were primarily formed before marsh development, before fine-grained sediment was deposited on top of the coarse-grained sediment. However, a smaller percentage of the elevational difference between <b>hummocks</b> and depressions can also be explained by the presence of thicker fine-grained sediment layers on top of <b>hummocks</b> compared with depressions. This implies that marsh accretion rates were higher on <b>hummocks</b> compared with depressions. However, this result was limited to very early stages of marsh development, as marsh accretion rates estimated on marshes ranging between 15 - and 120 -years-old showed that depressions actually accreted sediments at a significantly faster rate than <b>hummocks.</b> Eventually, the patterns of heterogeneity stabilized and we found similar marsh accretion rates on <b>hummocks</b> and in depressions in the 120 -year-old marsh, which resulted in the persistency of these topographic patterns...|$|R

The results showed (i) CH 4 flux increased in the order E. <b>hummocks</b> ≤ E. lawns S. hollows corresponding to the increasing water table level at the relief microforms as adjusted to field conditions. (ii) Plant-mediated CH 4 flux accounted for 38, 31 and 51 % of total CH 4 at E. <b>hummocks,</b> E. lawns and S. hollows, respectively.
