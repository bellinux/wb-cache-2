25|$|If a rock unit of low {{porosity}} {{is highly}} fractured, {{it can also}} make a good aquifer (via fissure flow), provided the rock has a hydraulic conductivity sufficient to facilitate movement of water. Porosity is important, but, alone, it does not determine a rock's ability {{to act as an}} aquifer. Areas of the Deccan Traps (a basaltic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock formations with high porosity but low permeability, which makes them poor aquifers. Similarly, the micro-porous (Upper Cretaceous) Chalk of south east England, although having a reasonably high porosity, has a low grain-to-grain permeability, with its good water-yielding characteristics mostly due to micro-fracturing and <b>fissuring.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{included}} consecutive 318 pairs of posteroanterior (PA) and left lateral (LL) chest radiographs taken under routinely used conditions with {{the patients in}} erect position. Major, minor and accessory <b>fissures</b> visualized on these radiographs were described according to their visibility, position, length and shape.

30|$|To {{simulate}} {{the development of}} the ground <b>fissures</b> when exploiting the thick coal seam with shallow buried depth, Fan et al. (2011) used physical simulation to analyze the dynamic propagation and distribution of ground <b>fissures</b> that caused by longwall mining in shallow coal seams. Their results show that: (1) the ground <b>fissures</b> expand along the two directions that are parallel to and perpendicular to the direction of mining; (2) open <b>fissures</b> are oval-shaped distributed around the boundary of the mining area, while open–closed <b>fissures</b> are mainly distributed above the mined-out area; (3) in the process of mining, open <b>fissures</b> develop along the mining direction, and open–closed <b>fissures</b> are gradually closed and a new open–closed <b>fissure</b> appears in front of the working face. Wang et al. (2015 b) conducted real-time monitoring on the surface <b>fissures</b> during the mining of the shallow depth seam. They thought the development of surface <b>fissures</b> generally goes through the following four stages: (1) surface <b>fissure</b> generation stage; (2) <b>fissure</b> expansion stage; (3) surface step subsidence stage; and (4) surface <b>fissure</b> closure stage.|$|R
25|$|January 23, 1812, 1515 UTC (9:15 a.m.); (M ~7.3) {{epicenter}} around New Madrid, {{although this}} is disputed.

Johnston and Schweig attributed this earthquake to a rupture on the New Madrid North Fault. A minority viewpoint holds that this earthquake's epicenter was in southern Illinois. A 2011 expert panel urged further research to clarify this point, stating that the Illinois hypothesis would mean that an extended section of fault exists, perhaps still loaded and capable of hosting a great earthquake in the future.|$|E

The fractal theory is applied to model the permeability and porosity of a natural <b>fissured</b> rock.

40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} {{control the}} behaviour of many unstable slopes, and their importance for landslide activity is generally accepted. The presence of <b>fissures</b> influences the storage {{capacity of a}} soil and affects the infiltration processes of rainfall. The effectiveness of the <b>fissure</b> network depends upon <b>fissure</b> size, their spatial distribution, and connectivity. Moreover, <b>fissure</b> connectivity is a dynamic characteristic, depending {{on the degree of}} saturation of the medium. This research aims to investigate the influence of the <b>fissure</b> network on hydrological responses of a landslide. Special attention is given to spatial and temporal variations in <b>fissure</b> connectivity, which makes <b>fissures</b> act both as preferential flow paths for deep infiltration (disconnected <b>fissures)</b> and as lateral groundwater drains (connected <b>fissures).</b> To this end, the hydrological processes that control the exchange of water between the <b>fissure</b> network and the matrix have been included in a spatially distributed hydrological and slope stability model. The ensuing feedbacks in landslide hydrology were explored by running the model with one year of meteorological forcing. The effect of dynamic <b>fissure</b> connectivity was evaluated by comparing simulations with static <b>fissure</b> patterns to simulations in which these patterns change as a function of soil saturation. The results highlight that <b>fissure</b> connectivity and <b>fissure</b> permeability control the water distribution within landslides. Making the <b>fissure</b> connectivity function of soil moisture results in composite behaviour spanning the above end members and introduces stronger seasonality of the hydrological responses...|$|R
40|$|Surface mining-induced <b>fissures</b> {{formed in}} shallow coal seam mining have serious impact on safety mining and water {{resources}} protection. This paper proposes {{a novel approach}} to study the formation mechanism and dynamic development of surface mining-induced <b>fissures</b> in shallow coal seam mining. This approach combines field tests, theoretical analysis, and numerical simulations based on the geological condition of shallow coal seam mining in Chuancao Gedan Coal Mine. Two typical surface mining-induced <b>fissures,</b> step-type <b>fissures</b> and collapse-type <b>fissures,</b> are generated in shallow coal seam mining. The <b>fissures</b> with large vertical throw or horizontal opening severely impact water resource protection and surface ecological environment. Surface mining-induced <b>fissures</b> are generated periodically and changed dynamically with the advancing of working face. The vertical throw and horizontal opening of surface <b>fissures</b> are changed dynamically with the movement of loading key strata. The movement forms of loading key strata determine the morphological development of surface <b>fissures.</b> Downward sliding movement of broken rocks causes step-type <b>fissures,</b> while downward rotation movement leads to collapse-type <b>fissures.</b> The degree of the downward sliding and rotation of broken rocks determines the vertical throw and horizontal opening of surface <b>fissures.</b> This paper proposes mining technologies to reduce damaging ground <b>fissures</b> in shallow coal seam mining and analyzes their control effects...|$|R

Under the conditions of multiple seams mining, this paper discusses the distribution of residual <b>fissure</b> in overlying strata by means of the similar material experiment. The results show that, after the end of mining, the distribution of residual <b>fissure</b> in goaf displays obvious characteristics in different zones. From both sides to the middle of goaf, it can be divided into three zones: residual <b>fissure</b> zone, compacted <b>fissure</b> zone, and surface tensile <b>fissure</b> zone.
