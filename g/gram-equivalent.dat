40|$|Introduction: Pain {{processing}} is polygenically modulated and varies as {{a function}} of sex, body habitus, modality, and genotype. Human pain has been positively correlated with obesity (J Pain 8 : 430, 2007) and both pain processing and self-reports of pain vary between men and women (J Pain 13 : 228, 2012; J Pain 101 : 259, 2003). Rats selectively bred to have features of metabolic syndrome (Science 307 : 418, 2005) may provide an animal model that can help elucidate the underlying neurochemical mechanisms contributing to differences in pain that are sex-specific and associated with obesity/metabolic syndrome (Anesthesiology 113 : 1176, 2010). As an initial step prior to pharmacological studies of chronic pain, this experiment is testing the hypothesis that rats with features of metabolic syndrome exhibit sex-specific differences in nociception. Materials and methods: To date we have used multimodal pain testing to evaluate nociceptive responses in male (n = 3) and female (n = 3) rats with features of metabolic syndrome. The experiments quantified hind paw withdrawal latency to a heat stimulus using the Hargreaves method (Pain 32 : 77, 1988). <b>Gram-equivalent</b> responses to mechanical stimuli were quantified using the up-down method (J Neurosci Methods 53 : 55, 1994). Duration of response to the acetone spray test was used to characterize the response to a cold thermal stimulus (Anesth Analg 101 : 457, 2005). Results: Responses were quantified (mean ± SD) for male and female rats on each of the three pain modalities tested. Paw withdrawal latencies (PWL) in seconds for females (7. 26 ± 1. 45) and males (5. 98 ± 1. 51) differed by 21. 4 %. Responses to mechanical stimuli (in grams) for females (8. 66 ± 6. 35) and males (5. 40 ± 5. 21) differed by 60. 4 %. Duration of response to the acetone spray test in seconds for females (0. 5 ± 0) and males (0. 67 ± 0. 26) differed by 33. 3 %. Discussion: Previous studies found that lean rats selectively bred for enhanced aerobic fitness had higher thresholds for heat nociception than did rats bred to promote features of metabolic syndrome (Neurosci Lett 443 : 37, 2008). Lean/fit rats also recover more rapidly from neuropathic pain caused by chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (Anesthesiology 113 : 1176, 2010). The present results indicate that in obese rats with features of metabolic syndrome the females had a longer PWL, a greater threshold for mechanical nociception, and a longer duration of response to the acetone test. These data imply a lower pain threshold in the obese, male rats. The preliminary results also suggest that rats selectively bred to enhance the polygenic modulation of obesity/metabolic syndrome offer a unique resource for studies aiming to elucidate mechanisms contributing to sex-specific differences in nociceptive processing...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the relationship between myocardial infarct size es-timated by serum CK-MB methods {{and the extent of}} irreversible injury in acute myocardial infarction. In 321 consecutive patients, infarct size was estimated by different mathematical models, and in 22 patients who died in hospital, the extent of myocardial necrosis was determined by autopsy. We also investigated the depletion of CK-MB in infarcted tissue, the recovery of CK-MB in the plasma volume, and the elimination ofCK-MB from plasma. Myocardial CK-MB depletion was relatively greater in the larger infarcts, whereas the recovery of enzyme in plasma was independent of the infarct size. Correction of serum CK-MB for changes in plasma volume im-proved the estimate significantly (p < 0. 05). The correlation between the measured infarct size (g) and the es-timated infarct size (units per liter and <b>gram-equivalents)</b> was highly significant (r = 0. 85 - 0. 89, SEE = 23 - 27 %, p < 0. 001). Thus, a semiquantitative expression of the extent of myocardial necrosis can be deter-mined in vivo. THE REASON for developing methods to assess the extent of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) arises from the hypothesis that infarct size (IS) is a majo...|$|R
40|$|Summary: For {{troponin}} T {{a characteristic}} biphasic {{change in the}} plasma time-concentration curve has been de-scribed, especially in patients with early reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy. As troponin T is bound to myofibril-lar structures, treatment strategy or treatment outcome could influence the cumulative plasma release of this protein {{in a different way}} compared to the cumulative release of free cytoplasmic cardiac enzymes. The present study is the first study comparing the total quantity of troponin T released by the heart during the first 168 hours after acute myocardial infarction, both in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy (n = 16) and in patients not treated with thrombolytic therapy (n = 7). On the basis of clinical symptoms and coronary arteriogram within 24 hours, the patients treated with thrombolytic therapy were divided into two groups, reperfused (n = 9) and non-reperfused (n = 7). In the patients not treated with thrombolytic therapy, absence of spontaneous early reperfusion was judged only from clinical symptoms. Cumulative troponin T release into plasma was compared to the cumulative release of the cytoplasmic cardiac enzymes creatine kinase (EC 2. 7. 3. 2) and hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 27). Cumulative release, i. e., infarct size, was calculated using a two-compartment model for circulating proteins. Mean tissue contents, per gram wet weight, of 156 U/g for hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, 2. 163 U/g for creatine kinase and 234 g/g for troponin T, were used to express infarct size in <b>gram-equivalents</b> of healthy myocardium per litre plasma (g-eq/ 1) ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{contribution}} some {{characteristics of}} an unusual crystallized triphormic, trioctahedral, swelling layer silicate are presented. The saponite-mineral may well {{be similar to the}} macroscopic fibrous material which occurs as an alteration product in a soil, as described by Brown & Stephen (1959). The mineral (Plate 1) occurs as a vein-filling in recently exposed tholeiite near Winnweiler, Pfalz, West Germany. It consists of lustrous brown to dark olive-green, friable, columnar masses (1000 - 500 mm ~) of densely packed, parallel, rod-like, anhedral particles (1 - 11 mm long • 0 " 01 mm 2 section). From scanning electron-optical examination the well-exposed edges of the aggregate xhibit many sharp, linear oriented rims. The base of the columnar aggregates is in a plane parallel to that of the surface of the vein and parallel to the mutual (001) crystal plane. The aggregates consist essentially of saponite; a few very thin random interleaves of calcite and some small grains of quartz and feldspar were observed. Single saponite particles (0 - 1 - 2 ram long) isolated by ultrasonic dispersion are partially transparent and vary slightly in eolour. From X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and elee-tronoptical evidence these particles are free from impurities. Preliminary single-crystal studies showed the material to be unsuitable for crystal structure analysis; although the particles look like single crystals (showing optical continuity), only preferred orientation patterns could, in fact, be obtained. Ultimate chemical analyses howed the material to be iron-rich and the following mean structural chemical formula was derived by calculation on a basis of a total of 44 <b>gram-equivalents</b> of cationic onstituents: 1. 04 M + (Si~. ~o + + +) w + + Alt. trFe 0. 24 (Mgt [...] s 4 Fe 0. t 4 Fe~ 9 ~ +Tio~ 2) v 102 o(OH) 4. The interlayer cation population consists of 67 % calcium, 31 % magnesium, 1...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The recent {{international}} GUSTO {{trial of}} 41, 021 patients with {{acute myocardial infarction}} demonstrated improved 90 -min infarct related artery patency as well as reduced mortality in patients treated with an accelerated regimen of tissue plasminogen activator, compared to patients treated with streptokinase. A regimen combining tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase yielded intermediate results. The present study investigated the effects of treatment on infarct size and enzyme release kinetics in a subgroup of these patients. METHODS: A total of 553 patients from 15 hospitals {{were enrolled in the}} study. Four thrombolytic strategies were compared: streptokinase with subcutaneous heparin, streptokinase with intravenous (i. v.) heparin, tissue plasminogen activator with i. v. heparin, and streptokinase plus tissue plasminogen activator with i. v. heparin. The activity of alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) in plasma was centrally analysed and infarct size was defined as cumulative HBDH release per litre of plasma within 72 h of the first symptoms (Q(72)). Patency of the infarct-related vessel was determined by angiography in 159 patients, 90 min after treatment. RESULTS: Infarct size was 3. 72 g-eq. 1 (- 1) in patients with adequate coronary perfusion (TIMI- 3) at the 90 min angiogram and larger in patients with TIMI- 2 (4. 35 g-eq. 1 (- 1) or TIMI 0 - 1 (5. 07 g-eq. 1 (- 1) flow (P = 0. 024). In this subset of the GUSTO angiographic study, early coronary patency rates (TIMI 2 + 3) were similar in the two streptokinase groups (53 and 46 %). Higher, but similar, patency rates were observed in the tissue plasminogen activator and combination therapy groups (87 and 90 %). Median infarct size for the four treatment groups, expressed in <b>gram-equivalents</b> (g-eq) of myocardium, was 4. 4, 4. 5, 3. 9 and 3. 9 g-eq per litre of plasma (P = 0. 04 for streptokinase vs tissue plasminogen activator). Six hours after the first symptoms, respectively 5. 3, 6. 6, 14. 0 and 13. 6 % of total HBDH release was complete (P < 0. 0001 for streptokinase vs tissue plasminogen activator). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and complete coronary reperfusion salvages myocardial tissue, resulting in limitation of infarct size and accelerated release of proteins from the myocardium. Treatment with tissue plasminogen activator, resulting in earlier reperfusion was more effective in reducing infarct size than the streptokinase regimens, which contributes to the differences in survival between treatment groups in the GUSTO trial...|$|R
