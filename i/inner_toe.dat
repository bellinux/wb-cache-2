5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their <b>inner</b> <b>toe</b> (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
25|$|Each front limb bore five toes, {{with the}} <b>inner</b> <b>toe</b> having a large {{sharpened}} claw. Like most sauropods, the front limbs were {{shorter than the}} hind legs, but the high position of the shoulders meant there was little slope in the back.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{birds in}} New Guinea are the flightless cassowaries, of which all three species are native to New Guinea. Two of these species: the {{southern}} cassowary (Casuarius casuarius) {{and the northern}} cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus) reach heights of 1.8 metres (6ft). The southern cassowary is also native to northern Australia. The cassowary {{is one of the}} world's most dangerous birds, for it is capable of inflicting fatal injuries with its powerful legs and the dagger-like claw on its <b>inner</b> <b>toe.</b> It is known to have killed humans.|$|E

50|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} Cuculidae family are the feet, which are zygodactyl, meaning that the two <b>inner</b> <b>toes</b> point forward and the two outer point backward.|$|R
50|$|In more {{primitive}} dromaeosaurids and in troodontids, the feet {{were not as}} specialized and the claws were not as large or as hooked. Additionally, the toe joints allowed more range of motion than the simple up-down movements of advanced dromaeosaurids. This makes it likely that these species specialized in smaller prey that could be pinned using only the <b>inner</b> <b>toes,</b> not requiring the feet to be as strong or sturdy.|$|R
500|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's small bill is {{used for}} {{plucking}} feathers and pulling prey apart, rather than killing or cutting. Its long legs and toes are an adaptation for catching and eating birds. The outer toe is [...] "fairly long and slender"; the <b>inner</b> <b>toe</b> and back toe are relatively short and thick. The middle toe is very long {{and can be used}} to grasp objects, while a protuberance {{on the underside of the}} toe means that the digit can be closed without leaving a gap, which helps with gripping.|$|E
2500|$|Their skin {{varies in}} colour {{depending}} on the subspecies, with some having light or dark gray skin and others having pinkish or even reddish skin. The strong legs of the common ostrich are unfeathered and show bare skin, with the tarsus (the lowest upright part of the leg) being covered in scales: red in the male, black in the female. The tarsus of the common ostrich is the largest of any living bird, measuring [...] in length. The bird has just two toes on each foot (most birds have four), with {{the nail on the}} larger, <b>inner</b> <b>toe</b> resembling a hoof. The outer toe has no nail. The reduced number of toes is an adaptation that appears to aid in running, useful for getting away from predators. Common ostriches can run at a speed over [...] and can cover [...] in a single stride. The wings reach a span of about 2 metres (6ft 7 in), and the wing chord measurement of [...] is around the same size as for the largest flying birds.|$|E
6000|$|The vizcachas are cleanly {{in their}} habits; and the fur, {{though it has}} a strong earthy smell, is kept {{exceedingly}} neat. The hind leg and foot afford a very beautiful instance of adaptation. Propped by the hard curved tail, they sit up erect, and as firmly on the long horny disks on the undersides of the hind legs as a man stands on his feet. Most to be admired, on the middle toe the skin thickens into a round cushion, in which the curved teeth-like bristles are set; nicely graduated in length, so that [...] "each particular hair" [...] may {{come into contact with}} the skin when the animal scratches or combs itself. As to the uses of this appendage there can be no difference of opinion, as there is about the serrated claw in birds. It is quite obvious that the animal cannot scratch himself with his hind paw (as all mammals do) without making use of this natural comb. Then the entire foot is modified, so that this comb shall be well protected, and yet not be hindered from performing its office: thus the <b>inner</b> <b>toe</b> is pressed close to the middle one, and so depressed that it comes under the cushion of skin, and cannot possibly get before the bristles, or interfere their coming against the skin in scratching, as certainly be the case if this toe were free as outer one.|$|E
50|$|The foot of Chanaresuchus {{differs from}} other related archosaurs {{in that the}} <b>inner</b> <b>toes</b> are inlarged, whereas other {{primitive}} archosaurs retain a more symmetrical pattern. The first digit is reduced but robust, the second digit is the thickest, and the third digit is the longest, although somewhat slender {{in comparison to the}} others. The fourth digit is very slim and the fifth consists of only a metatarsal spur.|$|R
50|$|More {{advanced}} therizinosaurids {{have four}} functional toes, but {{the feet of}} Beipiaosaurus still have reduced <b>inner</b> <b>toes,</b> showing that the derived therizinosaurid condition may have evolved from a three-toed therizinosauroid ancestor. Beipiaosaurus had a toothless beak with cheek teeth.The head was large relative to other therizinosaurs, with the lower jaw measuring about same length as the femur. In 2003 the pygostyle, consisting of the fused five last vertebrae of the tail, was described in greater detail.|$|R

50|$|Sexes are similar, {{but young}} birds have a buff head, underparts and underwing coverts.The wing shape helps to {{distinguish}} this species {{from the dark}} form of crested hawk-eagle, (Spizaetus cirrhatus). The tarsi are fully feathered and the toes are relatively stout and short with long claws (particularly on the <b>inner</b> <b>toe)</b> that are less strongly curved than in other birds of prey.|$|E

5000|$|Plectrohyla cyanomma is a large, robust frog. Adult males measure 52 - 56 mm {{and females}} 52 - 65 mm in snout-vent length. The {{tympanum}} is partly or completely concealed. The fingers have vestigial webbing whereas the toes are moderately webbed. The dorsum is uniform olive-green with few tiny, bright yellow spots; the olive-green fades to pale blue around vent and along {{outer edge of}} forearm and tarsus. The venter and chin are greenish-yellow, as are the outer toes and fingers. The ventral surfaces of limbs to the <b>inner</b> <b>toes</b> and fingers bright are yellow-orange. The iris is pale bluish-gray. Males have enlarged non-projecting prepollex (the [...] "spikethumb") but not nuptial excrescences.|$|R
5|$|Rollers {{resemble}} crows in {{size and}} build, but are {{more closely related to}} the kingfishers and bee-eaters. They share the colourful appearance of those groups with blues and browns predominating. The two <b>inner</b> front <b>toes</b> are connected, but the outer toe is not.|$|R
50|$|C. thwaitesi has small {{eyes with}} scaly lower eyelids. The midbody scales are smooth, in 24-26 rows. The body and tail are elongate, and the tail is {{as wide as}} the body.

5000|$|The {{black-collared hawk}} has the basal {{phalanges}} of the <b>inner</b> <b>toe</b> fused, {{which may be}} an adaptation to prevent the toe from bending back when catching prey. This feature is shared with Ictinia and with the group of true milvine kites and sea eagles (Milvus, Haliastur, Haliaaetus, and Icthyophaga). [...] Research in molecular phylogenetics during the early 21st century indicates {{that there is a}} clear milvine-haliaetine clade that is related to a large group of buteonine hawks and their relatives. Within the buteonine group, Ictinia is near-basal, and Busarellus is a member of a clade shared with Geranospiza, Rostrhamus, and Helicolestes.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{commonly}} {{confused with the}} Long-thumbed Frog (Limnodynastes fletcheri), with {{which there is a}} regional overlap. The two frogs can be distinguished by a disproportionately long second digit of the <b>inner</b> front <b>toes</b> in the case of L. fletcheri. The long-thumbed frog also has larger irregular shaped spots on the back and a red/purple eyelid, which is uncommon in L. tasmaniensis.|$|R
50|$|The rollers are an Old World family, Coraciidae, of near {{passerine}} birds. The group {{gets its}} name from the aerial acrobatics some of these birds perform during courtship or territorial flights. Rollers resemble crows in size and build, and share the colourful appearance of kingfishers and bee-eaters, blues and pinkish or cinnamon browns predominating. The two <b>inner</b> front <b>toes</b> are connected, but not the outer one.|$|R
50|$|Cuckoos are {{medium-sized}} {{birds that}} {{range in size}} from the little bronze cuckoo, at 17 g and 15 cm (6 inches), to the channel-billed cuckoo, at 630 g (1.4 lbs) and 63 cm (25 inches). There is generally little sexual dimorphism in size, but where it exists, it can be either the male or the female that is larger. One of the most important distinguishing features of the family are the feet, which are zygodactyl, meaning that the two <b>inner</b> <b>toes</b> point forward and the two outer backward. There are two basic body forms, arboreal species (like the common cuckoo) which are slender and have short tarsi, and terrestrial species (like the roadrunners) which are more heavy set and have long tarsi. Almost all species have long tails which are used for steering in terrestrial species and as a rudder during flight in the arboreal species. The wing shape also varies with lifestyle, with the more migratory species like the black-billed cuckoo possessing long narrow wings capable of strong direct flight, and the more terrestrial and sedentary cuckoos like the coucals and malkohas having shorter rounded wings and a more laboured gliding flight.|$|R
50|$|The dwarf {{cassowary}} {{is a large}} bird but {{is slightly}} smaller than other living cassowaries (the southern cassowary and northern cassowary). It is between 99 and 150 cm long and weighs between 17.6 and 26 kg. It is a flightless bird with hard and stiff black plumage, a low triangular casque, pink cheek and red patches of skin on its blue neck. Compared to other cassowaries, the dwarf cassowary is shorter, with a tarsi length of 24.5 cm, with a slightly smaller bill, at 11 to 12.2 cm. The feet are large and powerful, equipped with dagger-like claws on the <b>inner</b> <b>toe.</b> Both sexes are similar. Females have longer casques, brighter bare skin color and are larger in size.|$|E
50|$|It has {{hard and}} stiff black plumage, blue facial {{skin and a}} casque {{on top of the}} head. It has a bright red or yellow colored neck and wattle. The feet are huge and strong with long, dagger-like claw on its <b>inner</b> <b>toe.</b> The sexes are similar. The male, at 30 to 37 kg, is smaller than female, at an average of 58 kg, making it the world's fourth-heaviest living bird species after the common ostrich, Somali ostrich and the similarly-sized {{southern}} cassowary. These birds measure 149 cm long and stand 1.5 - 1.8 m in height. Compared to the southern cassowary, the northern cassowary has a slightly shorter bill, at 12 to 13.7 cm, but a slightly longer tarsal length, at 28 to 33.2 cm.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{different}} Phelsuma species varies between about 6.5 and 30 cm, but the extinct Rodrigues giant day gecko was even larger. Day geckos have toe pads consisting of tiny lamellae which allow them to walk on plain vertical and inverted surfaces like bamboo or glass. The <b>inner</b> <b>toe</b> on each foot is vestigial. Males have well-developed femoral pores on the undersurface of their rear limbs. These pores are less developed or absent in females. Females often have well-developed endolymphatic chalk sacs {{on the sides of}} their necks. These sacs store calcium, which is needed for egg production. Those eggs can often be seen through the ventral surface of the female's body shortly before they are laid. The hatchlings reach sexual maturity between six and 12 months old. Smaller species may live up to 10 years, whereas the larger species have been reported to live more than 20 years in captivity.|$|E
50|$|The ibisbill is 38 - 41 cm {{long and}} is quite unmistakable in appearance. The adult is grey {{with a white}} belly, a crimson, long down-curved bill {{similar to that of}} the {{unrelated}} ibis, and a black face and black breast band. The sexes are similar, but young birds lack the black on the face and breast, and the bill is duller. The bill is 6.8 - 8.2 cm long and is slightly longer in females. The legs are greyish purple in the breeding adults and dull sepia in juveniles or greenish in younger or non-breeding adults. The legs of deceased ibisbills change color to a crimson similar to the bill shade shortly after death. The tarsi is short and reticultated. The ibisbill has three toes, lacking the hind toe. The outer and middle toes are connected by a small, idented web, while the middle and <b>inner</b> <b>toes</b> possess no webbing. The Ibisbill typically weighs 270 - 320 g and females weigh slightly more than males. In spite of its spectacular appearance it is inconspicuous in its stony environment. The call is a ringing Klew-klew similar to that of a greenshank. In flight, its outstretched neck and rounded wings give an ibis-like appearance.|$|R
50|$|Sensation to {{the skin}} of the toes is {{provided}} by five nerves. The superficial fibular nerve supplies sensation {{to the top of the}} toes, except between the hallux and second toe, which is supplied by the deep fibular nerve, and the outer surface of the fifth toe, supplied by the sural nerve. Sensation to the bottom of the toes is supplied by the medial plantar nerve, which supplies sensation to the great <b>toe</b> and <b>inner</b> three-and-a-half <b>toes,</b> and the lateral plantar nerve, which supplies sensation to the little toe and half of the sensation of the fourth toe.|$|R

The reduced number of toes is an adaptation that appears to aid in running, useful for getting away from predators. Common ostriches can run at a speed over 70 km/h and can cover 3 to 5 m in a single stride. The wings reach a span of about 2 metres (6 ft 7 in), and the wing chord measurement of 90 cm is around the same size as for the largest flying birds.|$|E
5000|$|Vomerine {{teeth in}} two strong oblique series {{commence}} {{from the inner}} anterior angle of the choanae; lower jaw with two not very prominent bony processes in front. Head moderate; Snout more or less pointed; canthus rostralis obtuse; nostril a little nearer {{to the end of}} the mouth than to the eye; interorbital space narrower than the upper eyelid; tympanum distinct, about two thirds the size of the eye. Fingers rather short, first extending beyond second; toes moderate, obtuse, nearly entirely webbed a much developed membranaceous fringe along the fifth toe; sub-articular tubercles moderate; inner metatarsal tubercle very variable, small and blunt, or (var. ceylanica, Ceylon and S. India) nearly as long as the <b>inner</b> <b>toe,</b> strongly compressed, crescent shaped, shovel-shaped; no outer tubercle, a tarsal fold. Tibio-tarsal articulation reaching the ear, the eye, or a little beyond. Skin of back with longitudinal folds; a strong fold above the tympanum. Green or olive above, with dark spots; often a light vertebral line. Male with two subgular vocal sacs, conspicuous externally by folds of the skin on the sides of the throat; these regions generally blackish.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} cassowary has stiff, bristly black plumage, a blue face and neck, red on the nape and two red wattles measuring around 17.8 cm in length hanging down around its throat. A horn-like brown casque, measuring 13 to 16.9 cm high, sits atop the head. The bill {{can range from}} 9.8 to 19 cm. The three-toed feet are thick and powerful, equipped with a lethal dagger-like claw up to 12 cm on the <b>inner</b> <b>toe.</b> The plumage is sexually monomorphic, but the female is dominant and larger with a longer casque, larger bill and brighter-colored bare parts. The juveniles have brown longitudinal striped plumage. It is the largest member of the cassowary family and is the second heaviest bird on earth, at a maximum size estimated at 85 kg and 190 cm tall. Normally, this species ranges from 127 to(-) 170 cm in length. The height is normally 1.5 to(-) 1.8 m; females average 58.5 kg, while males average 29 to(-) 34 kg. Most adult birds will weigh between 17 and 70 kg. It is technically the largest Asian bird (since the extinction of the Arabian ostrich, and previously the moa of New Zealand) and the largest Australian bird (though the emu may be slightly taller).|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} curious and {{interesting}} reptiles which I met with in Borneo was a large tree-frog, which was brought me {{by one of the}} Chinese workmen. He assured me that he had seen it come down in a slanting direction from a high tree, as if it flew. On examining it, I found the toes very long and fully webbed to their very extremity, so that when expanded they offered a surface much larger than the body. The forelegs were also bordered by a membrane, and the body was capable of considerable inflation. The back and limbs were of a very deep shining green colour, the undersurface and the <b>inner</b> <b>toes</b> yellow, while the webs were black, rayed with yellow. The body was about four inches long, while the webs of each hind foot, when fully expanded, covered a surface of four square inches, and the webs of all the feet together about twelve square inches. As the extremities of the toes have dilated discs for adhesion, showing the creature to be a true tree frog, {{it is difficult to imagine}} that this immense membrane of the toes can be for the purpose of swimming only, and the account of the Chinaman, that it flew down from the tree, becomes more credible. This is, I believe, the first instance known of a [...] "flying frog," [...] and it is very interesting to Darwinians as showing that the variability of the toes which have been already modified for purposes of swimming and adhesive climbing, have been taken advantage of to enable an allied species to pass through the air like the flying lizard. It would appear to be a new species of the genus Rhacophorus, which consists of several frogs of a much smaller size than this, and having the webs of the toes less developed.|$|R

50|$|This is an {{autosomal}} mutation {{that gives}} embryos webbing between the <b>inner</b> two front <b>toes</b> on each foot, {{in addition to}} the usual characteristics of diplopodia. Almost all of the embryos survive to the end of incubation, but they are unable to clear the fluid from their lungs or absorb the blood from their extraembryonic vessels. These problems always prevent them from hatching. Almost all diplopodia-5 embryos have only one or two extra toes on each foot, so this mutation causes the least extreme foot malformation.|$|R
