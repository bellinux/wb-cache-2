5|$|Even {{though to}} me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform {{is kind of}} like blackface, I am just in {{acceptance}} over it, because something is better than nothing. An ugly picture is better than a blank space, and it means that one day, we will have another display at the Museum of Asian Invisibility, that <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> will crowd around in disbelief, because once upon a time, we weren’t there.|$|E

5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E

5|$|According to {{researcher}} Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, {{there were}} three stages {{in the production of}} the show. The first stage was pre-production research, which identified basic education needs for {{children under the age of}} six. The second stage involved the creation of a pilot reel to test children on the show's effects and for review by educators, sociologists, psychologists, and other experts, who were invited to a seminar. Finally, the series was filmed and aired. Research began in August 1977; the team was led by an educator and included a linguist and a psychologist, all of whom were on the faculty of Kuwait University. The show was tested on different socioeconomic <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> between the ages of three and six, in kindergartens and preschools in four representative cities from Arab countries. The team proposed curriculum goals based upon the research and, during a seminar, Arab and CTW educators agreed on ten final goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of philanthropy, Bosh {{established}} the Chris Bosh Foundation in 2004. Remembering the challenges he faced as a youth, Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics. The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with {{organizations such as the}} Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects. Bosh's mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation. As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> about the benefits of reading, and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas {{during the course of the}} NBA campaign. In November 2008, Bosh pledged to donate $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada. He is also an advocate for increased computer literacy in schools, supporting the non-profit code.org.|$|E

40|$|The {{transient}} {{and variable}} nature of abnormal or deviant neuro-developmental signs {{during the early}} post-term months of ‘high risk’ infants, has been recognized. Careful longitudinal follow-up <b>of</b> these <b>children</b> is indicated. This study investigates the neuro-sensory-motor and general developmental progress over four years, <b>of</b> a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> who were identified as ‘dystonic’ at the adjusted age of four months. The developmental performance <b>of</b> these 15 <b>children</b> was compared with a matched <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> The results indicated that at four years of age the ‘dystonic’ <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> were developmentally less competent and more variable in all areas assessed than their ‘non-dystonic’ peers. Only one child was ultimately diagnosed as cerebral palsy indicating the transient nature of quite marked early signs. The implications for possible problems at school emphasize the need for continued follow-up <b>of</b> this <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R

25|$|Institutions {{were run}} by state governments, charities, welfare and {{religious}} organisations or private individuals. They included orphanages and children's homes, {{as well as}} industrial or training schools. There were at least 800 of these institutions operating between the 1920s and the 1980s. They varied in size from large institutions housing several hundred children to 'cottages' within the grounds of an institution where smaller <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> were cared for by 'cottage parents'.|$|E
25|$|These {{possible}} triggers {{were reported}} as MMR in eight cases, and measles infection in one. The paper was instantly controversial, leading to widespread publicity in the UK and the convening of a special panel of the UK's Medical Research Council the following month.

25|$|The {{buildings}} were listed as Grade II in 1975 for their importance {{as a site}} of historic school architecture. Mrs Jill Grey, a local educational historian, opened a small museum {{in one of the}} Edwardian classrooms. In July 1990 North Herts College left the site and Hertfordshire County Council put the buildings up for sale. The Hitchin British Schools Trust was formed and by 1994 were successful in purchasing the buildings. The Trust, mainly through the efforts of volunteers, has restored the schoolrooms to reflect their original condition, and work continues to improve them. The museum is visited by adults and <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> {{from all over the country}} who are interested in seeing how their ancestors were taught.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a custom}} {{in the region}} of Banat that, after Christmas Eve dinner, <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> go from house to house of their {{neighborhood}} and sing to neighbors. This custom is called korinđanje, and the children who participate in it are called korinđaši. They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity. As a reward, the neighbor gives them candies or even money; more traditional gifts include walnuts, prunes, apples, and cakes. Not only can Serbian children be korinđaši, but also Romanian and Hungarian ones.|$|E

In autumn 1933, three different <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and staff set out on an educational trip for the Netherlands, leaving from the south, the north and the east of Germany. Anna Essinger boarded a train with one group; her sister Paula took a group through Switzerland, where they picked up two pupils who had been on vacation with their mother. All three groups arrived on the ferry in Dover and were picked up in red buses and brought to Kent, where classes began the next day. In addition, there were three children from a Berlin family fleeing Germany that had pre-arranged for their children to meet the ferry and continue on to the school.|$|E

25|$|The CPTSD-RI, {{along with}} all other {{assessments}} attempting to measure the severity of child PTSD, had several limitations. First, the CPTSD-RI did not assess {{for all of the}} PTSD symptoms and thus could not provide an accurate assessment of PTSD severity. Additionally, the CPTSD-RI did not assess for functional impairment related to experience with trauma, a limit of many other self-report assessments. These limitations can be combatted by structured interviews given by trained therapists in schools or in a clinical setting. This, however, is problematic because personal interviews are expensive for the families or schools that take part in them, especially when large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> are studied, and time consuming. Thus, the CPSS was created to combat these limitations without the need for a supplemental interview. Validated screening tests like the CPSS tests the efficacy of treatment techniques. Without CPSS, the treatments would have no valid test, and children who have experienced trauma will not get the help they require.|$|E

500|$|In {{research}} during later {{seasons of}} Sesame Street, verbal measurements, {{in the form}} of letter-recognition tests, were introduced. These reinforced earlier results, providing more insight into children's knowledge, reactions, and responses than behavioral measures alone. The distractor method was modified by Workshop researchers Lewis Bernstein and Valeria Lovelace into an [...] "eyes-on-screen" [...] method, which collected simultaneous data from larger <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> Their method also tested for more [...] "natural" [...] distractions, such as those provided by other children in group-viewing situations; up to 15 children were tested at a time.
