5|$|Body piercing, a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E

Because Confucian teachings regarded the body as sacred and surgery was considered a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> mutilation, surgery was strongly discouraged in ancient China. Because of this, despite Hua Tuo's reported success with general anesthesia, the practice of surgery in ancient China ended with his death.|$|E
25|$|A tattoo is a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> {{modification}} where {{a design}} {{is made by}} inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). Brought to Europe from Polynesia in the early 19th century through naval routes, it was originally largely restricted to naval use, and was a male-only domain. By the later 20th century its use was more widespread and extended to female users. By {{the end of the}} 20th many stigmas of the tattoo culture had gone and it moved into the realm of being a fashion accessory for both men and women.|$|E

25|$|Catfish do {{not have}} scales; their bodies are often naked. In some species, the mucus-covered skin is used in {{cutaneous}} respiration, where the fish breathes through its skin. In some catfish, the skin is covered in bony plates called scutes; some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> armor appears in various ways within the order. In loricarioids and in the Asian genus Sisor, the armor is primarily made up {{of one or more}} rows of free dermal plates. Similar plates are found in large specimens of Lithodoras. These plates may be supported by vertebral processes, as in scoloplacids and in Sisor, but the processes never fuse to the plates or form any external armor. By contrast, in the subfamily Doumeinae (family Amphiliidae) and in hoplomyzontines (Aspredinidae), the armor is formed solely by expanded vertebral processes that form plates. Finally, the lateral armor of doradids, Sisor, and hoplomyzontines consists of hypertrophied lateral line ossicles with dorsal and ventral lamina.|$|E

According to the assistant director of the Frankfurt University Teaching Hospital for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, some sexual abuse survivors choose body piercing as a means of [...] "reclaiming body parts from memories of abuse". Piercing can also be chosen for simple aesthetic value, to highlight particular areas of the body, as a navel piercing may reflect a woman's satisfaction with the shape and condition of her stomach. Some people pierce, permanently or temporarily, to enhance sexual pleasure. Genital and nipple piercings may increase sexual satisfaction. Some people participate in a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> play known as play piercing, in which piercings may be done temporarily on the genitals or elsewhere on the body for sexual gratification.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the rubber}} hand {{illusion}} (RHI), human participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while {{they feel a}} series of identical brushstrokes applied to their own hand, which is hidden from view. If this visual and tactile information is applied synchronously, and if the visual appearance and position of the dummy hand is similar to one's own hand, then people may feel that the touches on their own hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand. This is an early <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> transfer illusion. The RHI is an illusion of vision, touch, and posture (proprioception), but a similar illusion can also be induced with touch and proprioception. It has also been found that the illusion may not require tactile stimulation at all, but can be completely induced using mere vision of the rubber hand being in a congruent posture with the hidden real hand. [...] The very first report {{of this kind of}} illusion may have been as early as 1937 (Tastevin, 1937).|$|E

60|$|There {{are several}} {{other species of}} petrels, but I will only mention one other kind, the Pelacanoides Berardi, which offers an example of those {{extraordinary}} cases, of a bird evidently belonging to one well-marked family, yet both in its habits and structure allied to a very distinct tribe. This bird never leaves the quiet inland sounds. When disturbed it dives to a distance, and on coming to the surface, with the same movement takes flight. After flying by the rapid movement of its short wings for a space in a straight line, it drops, as if struck dead, and dives again. The form of its beak and nostrils, length of foot, and even the colouring of its plumage, show that this bird is a petrel: on the other hand, its short wings and consequent little power of flight, its <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> and shape of tail, {{the absence of a}} hind toe to its foot, its habit of living, and its choice of situation, make it at first doubtful whether its relationship is not equally close with the auks.

60|$|The Penguin duck is {{the most}} {{remarkable}} of all the breeds; the thin neck and body are carried erect; the wings are small; the tail is upturned; and the thigh-bones and metatarsi are considerably lengthened in proportion with the same bones in the wild duck. In five specimens examined by me there were only eighteen tail-feathers instead of twenty as in the wild duck; but I have also found only eighteen and nineteen tail-feathers in two Labrador ducks. On the middle toe, in three specimens, there were twenty- seven or twenty-eight scutellae, whereas in two wild ducks there were thirty-one and thirty-two. The Penguin when crossed transmits with much power its peculiar <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> and gait to its offspring; this was manifest with some hybrids raised in the Zoological Gardens between one of these birds and the Egyptian goose (Anser aegyptiacus) (8/18. These hybrids have been described by M. Selys-Longchamps in the 'Bulletins (tome 12 No 10) Acad. Roy. de Bruxelles.'), and likewise with some mongrels which I raised between the Penguin and Labrador duck.

60|$|Of land-birds I {{obtained}} twenty-six kinds, all {{peculiar to}} the group and found nowhere else, {{with the exception of}} one lark-like finch from North America (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) which ranges on that continent as far north as 54 degrees, and generally frequents marshes. The other twenty-five birds consist, firstly, of a hawk, curiously intermediate in structure between a Buzzard and the American group of carrion-feeding Polybori; and with these latter birds it agrees most closely in every habit and even tone of voice. Secondly there are two owls, representing the short-eared and white barn-owls of Europe. Thirdly a wren, three tyrant-flycatchers (two of them species of Pyrocephalus, one or both of which would be ranked by some ornithologists as only varieties), and a dove--all analogous to, but distinct from, American species. Fourthly a swallow, which though differing from the Progne purpurea of both Americas, only in being rather duller coloured, smaller, and slenderer, is considered by Mr. Gould as specifically distinct. Fifthly there are three species of mocking-thrush--a form highly characteristic of America. The remaining land-birds form a most singular group of finches, related to each other in the structure of their beaks, short tails, <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> and plumage: there are thirteen species which Mr. Gould has divided into four sub-groups. All these species are peculiar to this archipelago; and so is the whole group, {{with the exception of one}} species of the sub-group Cactornis, lately brought from Bow Island, in the Low Archipelago. Of Cactornis the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers of the great cactus-trees; but all the other species of this group of finches, mingled together in flocks, feed on the dry and sterile ground of the lower districts. The males of all, or certainly of the greater number, are jet black; and the females (with perhaps one or two exceptions) are brown.|$|E
6000|$|He was twenty-eight when {{he started}} on this tour. It has been {{suggested}} that he did so in fear of the resentment of Sulla, with whose favorites and with whose practices he had dealt very plainly. There is no reason for alleging this, except that Sulla was powerful, that Sulla was blood-thirsty, and that Sulla must have been offended. This kind of argument is often used. It is supposed to be natural, or at least probable, that in a certain position a man should have been a coward or a knave, ungrateful or cruel; and in the presumption thus raised the accusation is brought against him. [...] "Fearing Sulla's resentment," [...] Plutarch says, [...] "he travelled into Greece, and gave out that the recovery of his health was the motive." [...] There is no evidence that such was his reason for travelling; and, as Middleton says in his behalf, it is certain that he [...] "continued for a year after this in Rome without any apprehension of danger." [...] It is best to take a man's own account of his own doings and their causes, unless there be ground for doubting the statement made. It is thus that Cicero himself speaks of his journey: [...] "Now," [...] he says, still in his Brutus[47], [...] "as you wish to know what I am--not simply what mark I may have on my body from my birth, or with what surroundings of childhood I was brought up--I will include some details which might perhaps seem hardly necessary. At this time I was thin and weak, my neck being long and narrow--a habit and <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> which is supposed to be adverse to long life; and those who loved me thought the more of this, because I had taken to speaking without relaxation, without recreation with all the powers of my voice, and with much muscular action.
