40|$|The {{effects of}} 4 {{different}} pyrethroid insecticides on sodium channel gating in internally perfused, cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells (N 1 E- 115) were studied using the suction pipette, voltage clamp technique. Pyrethroids increased the amplitude of the sodium current, sometimes {{by more than}} 200 %. Activation of the sodium current occurred at more hyperpolarized potentials than under control conditions. The declining phase of the sodium current during depolarization was markedly slowed down and after repolarization of the membrane a large, slowly decaying sodium tail current developed. Pyrethroids {{did not affect the}} sodium current reversal potential, steady-state sodium inactivation or recovery from sodium channel inactivation. The amplitude of the pyrethroid-induced slow tail current was always proportional to the sodium current {{at the end of the}} preceding depolarizing pulse. The rate of decay of the slow tail current strongly depended on pyrethroid structure and increased in the order deltamethrin, cyphenothrin, <b>fenfluthrin</b> and phenothrin. The rate of decay further depended on membrane potential and temperature. Below − 85 mV the instantaneous current-voltage relationship of the slow tail current showed a negative slope conductance. The tail current decayed more slowly at low temperatures. Arrhenius plots indicated that the relaxation of open sodium channels to a closed state involved a higher energy barrier for pyrethroid-affected than for normal channels. The energy barrier was higher after deltamethrin than after the non-cyano pyrethroid <b>fenfluthrin.</b> It is concluded that in mammalian neuronal membrane pyrethroids selectively reduce the rate of closing of sodium channels both during depolarization and after repolarization of the nerve membrane...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMutations in the DIIS 4 –S 5 linker and DIIS 5 have {{identified}} hotspots of pyrethroid and DDT {{interaction with the}} Drosophila para sodium channel. Wild-type and mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and subjected to voltage-clamp analysis. Substitutions L 914 I, M 918 T, L 925 I, T 929 I and C 933 A decreased deltamethrin potency, M 918 T, L 925 I and T 929 I decreased permethrin potency and T 929 I, L 925 I and I 936 V decreased <b>fenfluthrin</b> potency. DDT potency was unaffected by M 918 T, but abolished by T 929 I and reduced by L 925 I, L 932 F and I 936 V, suggesting that DIIS 5 contains {{at least part of}} the DDT binding domain. The data support a computer model of pyrethroid and DDT binding...|$|E
