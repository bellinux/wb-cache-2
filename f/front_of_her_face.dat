5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears at a vanity, putting Curious on and {{earrings}} by Bulgari. She is then seen holding a top hat in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> while doves {{fly out of}} another hat. Spears starts singing in the vanity but stands up and puts on a ringmaster jacket. She walks through an aisle while dancing suggestively with several circus dancers. Throughout the video, there are interspersed scenes of different circus performers, including ribbon dancers, contortionists, clowns and a mime on stilts. There are also scenes of Spears singing with the top hat, wearing a nude body stocking {{in front of a}} red curtain, with a spotlight on her. This is followed by a group dance scene {{in the middle of a}} circus ring, where Spears wears the ringmaster jacket, sequined hot pants and a feathered top hat. In the second verse, she dances with a chair and a whip wearing a nude bra covered in leaves. The video continues with a series of intercut scenes, such as Spears in slow motion in front of a shower of sparks, her surrounded by a pair of lions and in front of an elephant. During the bridge, Spears and her dancers perform a routine in front of flames. In the last chorus, Spears returns to the circus ring, surrounded by two elephants, many more circus performers, dancers and fire breathers. The video ends with Spears in the spotlight, laughing with the top hat over her head.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} Stan {{and some of}} her male back-up dancers being {{presented}} in a dark white room. Subsequently, the room becomes enlightened and Stan is seen wearing transparent sunglasses, a white sweatband and a silver jacket. Following this, she retrieves a tennis racket from one of her background dancers and holds it in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> before returning the racket to a nearby dancer. Next, Stan performs the pre-refrain of the song, while two female performers clutch a hair dryer in their hands. For the refrain, she and ten other female background dancers are performing synchronized dances, with them having wigs on, and dressing white clothing and red accessories. Following this, Stan is presented standing on a yellow plate which is kept in the air by two threads. She wears a silver leotard and a multicolored wig. Next, Stan is shown walking into a tennis field, whereon she plays a tennis match against herself. For the breakdown of [...] "Cherry Pop", the video gets introduced into a dark-lighted room. There, [...] her previously shown male background dancers are presented; the video continues with Stan dancing accompanied by her dancers. The clip finally ends with a pink tennis ball dropping out of the ceiling, while the screen becomes black.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at length {{had the good}} fortune to obtain a full <b>front</b> view <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> It was exquisitely lovely--this, of course, my heart had told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the point--but still the unintelligible something disturbed me. I finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance, only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with an interest tenfold.|$|R

The fresco on the right wall shows the female deceased. On the far left of the scene is a boat steered by Charon (known as Charun by the Etruscans), the Greek ferryman of the dead. A ribbon hangs on the prow of the boat. A woman holding a branch stands on the shore. She has one hand placed {{on the head of}} a young boy in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> They <b>face</b> and greet another woman towards their right, flanked by two demons. One demon appears to lead her towards the woman and the boy, but the other holds her around her waist, trying to stop her. On the far right of the scene, two larger demons are shown. The blue demon is {{on the left}}, seated on a rock with two snakes in his hands. He faces the black demon on the right, who approaches with exposed teeth, claws and intimidating eyes. The rear wall shows a symposium scene with four or five couples reclining on benches.|$|R
40|$|World War I Memorial Plaque (17 ½ cm in diameter). This is {{a bronze}} plate {{encased in a}} 26 ½ cm x 24 cm wooden frame.

50|$|After dinner has ended, {{the mother}} {{gets up from}} the table and {{retrieves}} a trifle from a cabinet, which she holds up in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The camera then gets distorted and jerky, the view filling up with a variety of colorful, loud filters applied to the film. The family looks at the mother with a mixture of apprehension and excitement as the film gets more distorted and layered with effects. As the song ends, the camera cuts back to a clear shot of the worm crawling in the grass.l again.|$|E
50|$|Fairest {{explores the}} themes of self-image, self-acceptance, and {{societies}} beauty constructs {{within the framework of}} a fairy tale setting. Aza is described as unattractive—ugly even, and one can see the effects this label has on Aza. Her self-conscious demeanor and self-loathing are evident in her voice as a character. The way she holds her hand in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> out of habit and her anger when she is mocked show how other’s judgments are affecting her. Throughout the text we watch her begin to improve and respect herself, especially when Prince Ijori shows that he loves Aza despite her looks.|$|E

This is followed by them performing on her head, her knee, back to her backside, and walking across her breasts. She begins swaying to the music as the band performs around her. Shortly afterword she starts eyeing them as she holds them in her hand, A. Jay swings his arm and Pamela's hair whips in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> that seems to imply he struck her, though she seems otherwise unaffected.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the door which faced them {{opened and a}} {{singular}} procession filed out. First came two dozen footmen, walking in pairs, all carrying halberds, and clad in the same maroon-coloured liveries. After them a huge bearded man, with his tunic off, and {{the sleeves of his}} coarse shirt rolled up over his elbows, strode along with a great axe over his left shoulder. Behind him, a priest with an open missal pattered forth prayers, and in his shadow was a woman, clad in black, her neck bared, and a black shawl cast over her head and drooping in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bowed <b>face.</b> Within grip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> walked a tall, thin, fierce-faced man, with harsh red features, and a great jutting nose. He wore a flat velvet cap with a single eagle feather fastened into it by a diamond clasp, which gleamed in the morning light. But bright as was his gem, his dark eyes were brighter still, and sparkled from under his bushy brows with a mad brilliancy which bore with it something of menace and of terror. His limbs jerked as he walked, his features twisted, and he carried himself like a man who strives hard to hold himself in when his whole soul is aflame with exultation. Behind him again twelve more maroon-clad retainers brought up the rear of this singular procession.|$|R
5000|$|As Ingrid hits {{adolescence}} {{she begins}} to compulsively scratch <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and body inflicting sores upon herself. This is obviously a sign <b>of</b> <b>her</b> inner anxiety and pain. During her high school years she is known as [...] "Doll Girl" [...] as she sleeps around and openly gives herself {{to much of the}} school's male population. She is incredibly lonely and doesn't have any real friends. She does excel at English though and her poetic ability is recognised by her English teacher who gives her an award and she is asked to read one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> poems for the school's closing/graduation ceremony. The prospect of being ridiculed by her peers and her belief that the poem is no good, brought on by her low self-esteem, causes her to appear in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the school, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> bloody from scratching, and reading not her own, but another poet's work.|$|R
6000|$|Several {{years ago}} I made a {{campaign}} on the platform with Mr. George W. Cable. In Montreal we were honored with a reception. It began {{at two in the}} afternoon in a long drawing-room in the Windsor Hotel. Mr. Cable and I stood at one end of this room, and the ladies and gentlemen entered it at the other end, crossed it at that end, then came up the long left-hand side, shook hands with us, said a word or two, and passed on, in the usual way. My sight is of the telescopic sort, and I presently recognized a familiar face among the throng of strangers drifting in at the distant door, and I said to myself, with surprise and high gratification, [...] "That is Mrs. R.; I had forgotten that she was a Canadian." [...] She had been a great friend of mine in Carson City, Nevada, in the early days. I had not seen <b>her</b> or heard <b>of</b> <b>her</b> for twenty years; I had not been thinking about her; there was nothing to suggest her to me, nothing to bring her to my mind; in fact, to me she had long ago ceased to exist, and had disappeared from my consciousness. But I knew her instantly; and I saw her so clearly that I was able to note some of the particulars <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress, and did note them, and they remained in my mind. I was impatient for her to come. In the midst of the hand-shakings I snatched glimpses <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and noted her progress with the slow-moving file across the end of the room; then I saw her start up the side, and this gave me a full <b>front</b> view <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> I saw <b>her</b> last when she was within twenty-five feet of me. For an hour I kept thinking she must still be in the room somewhere and would come at last, but I was disappointed.|$|R

You know, I was really never anything to write home about. I was a plain girl. But Life magazine ran a picture calling me Gorgeous Gussie, and the British {{picked it up and}} did a real job with it. Then people would see me and I'd hear them say, 'I've seen better-looking waitresses at the hot-dog stand.' I just went to pieces. Emotionally, I couldn't handle it." ...|$|E

50|$|In A Beginner (1894) Broughton devises a young {{writer who}} has her work {{secretly}} published and then later torn apart by unknowing people right in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The novel deals with the moral issues of writing and whether it is appropriate for a young woman to write romantic or even erotic fiction. Scylla or Charybdis? (1895) has a mother hiding her infamous past from her son and obsessing about his love even {{to the extent of}} being jealous of other women, a plot to some extent anticipating Lawrence's Sons and Lovers (1913). The novel questions social conventions in revealing how destructive they can be to quiet people who might have once stepped aside from the proper path. In a different way the same criticism is being made in Foes in Law (1900), where the main question is which lifestyle is the one productive of the highest degree of happiness: the conventional one or one that accordings with private needs.|$|E
6000|$|It was easy, now, to see {{the change}} which had come over Lucy's position, in the attentions she received. All the ladies in the {{principal}} boxes had nods and smiles for her and half the fashionable-looking young men in the house crowded round her box, or actually entered it to pay their compliments. I fancied Andrew Drewett had a self-satisfied air that seemed to say, [...] "you are paying your homage indirectly to myself, in paying it to this young lady." [...] As for Lucy, my jealous watchfulness could not detect the smallest alteration in her deportment, so far as simplicity and nature were concerned. She appeared in a trifling degree more womanly, perhaps, than when I saw her last, being now in her twentieth year; but the attentions she received made no visible change in her manners. I had become lost in the scene, and was standing in a musing attitude, my side face towards the box, when I heard a suppressed exclamation, in Lucy's voice. I was too near her to be mistaken, and it caused the blood to rush to my heart in a torrent. Turning, I saw the dear girl, with her hand extended over the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the box, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> suffused with blushes, and her eyes riveted on myself. I was recognised, and the surprise had produced a display of all that old friendship, certainly, that had once existed between us, in the simplicity and truth of childhood.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{she gave}} a great start--the colour faded out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>Her</b> eyes, fascinated, gazed in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> the pupils dilated.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she began}} to speak again, low, quickly, and with {{suppressed}} passion, but acting wonderfully all the while. Knowing that eyes were on her, her gestures and the expression <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> were such as might have been those of any young lady of fashion who was talking of everyday affairs, such as dancing, or flowers, or jewels. She smiled and even laughed occasionally. She played with the golden salt-cellar in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and, upsetting {{a little of the}} salt, threw it over her left shoulder, appearing to ask me if I were a victim of that ancient habit, and so on.|$|R
