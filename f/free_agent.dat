30|$|The issue arises {{that the}} {{regulations}} governing business practices, standards, and employee classification are outdated relics {{of the industrial}} era where the standards were meant to protect workers from factory exploitation [37]. Today, many workers work remotely as <b>free</b> <b>agents</b> and up to 90 % of workers in the USA want more freedom in their choice of employment [37]. One estimate states that up to one third of American workers are in some way <b>free</b> <b>agents</b> (whether part-time or full-time, primary or secondary, etc.) [37]. Identifying how big this group is can be challenging as different definitions encompass full-time and part-time <b>free</b> <b>agents,</b> 1099 workers, freelancers, employers, etc. This diversity of types of <b>free</b> <b>agents</b> makes it cumbersome to draft new laws regulating businesses that employ <b>free</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
