5|$|The {{others were}} called Eldar, the People of the Stars by Oromë, {{and they took}} Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë as their leaders, and became {{respectively}} the Vanyar, Noldor and Teleri. On their journey, some of the Teleri feared the Misty Mountains and <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> cross them. They turned back and stayed in the vales of the Anduin, and became the Nandor; these were led by Lenwë.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|After {{his first}} {{marriage}} Ambrose Dudley remained childless. His second wife, Elizabeth Tailboys, suffered a phantom pregnancy in 1555. Anne Russell, though nearly 20 years her husband's junior, {{turned out to be}} a congenial partner. Through their paternal grandmother the Dudley brothers descended from the famous 15th century earls, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. The Beauchamp descent especiallywhich was represented by the earldom of Warwickfilled them with pride. Ambrose's childlessness deeply concerned the widowed Robert Dudley, who for many years <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> to remarry for fear of the Queen's displeasure, and eventually died without direct heirs himself in September 1588. Most of Leicester's estateand debtspassed on to Warwick and encumbered his remaining lifetime. He also took care of his deceased brother's illegitimate teenage son Robert, who was his godson and whom Leicester had willed to inherit after Warwick's death.|$|E

5|$|United {{then went}} back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren, who <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> dive in for a tackle and risk a second yellow card. Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off {{the foot of the}} post. Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot across the face of the goal and out for a goal kick. With their very next attack, United sent Ronaldo away down the left wing again; he sent over another cross, but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy.|$|E
5|$|Asad {{arrived in}} Khurasan with 20,000 Syrian troops, and {{immediately}} took the offensive against Harith. Asad's campaign was costly, but {{after his first}} successes the Khurasani Arabs began to flock to him. Asad's success was aided by his long-standing personal relations with the local Arab tribal leaders, {{as well as by}} the continuing tribal rivalries: as a Yamani opposed to the Mudari Harith, he could count on the support of his fellow tribesmen—thus most of the Rabi'ah, the traditional enemies of Harith's Tamim tribe, son defected to him. Asad divided his forces, sending the Kufan and Syrian troops under Abd al-Rahman ibn Na'yum towards Marw Rudh, where Harith's main army was located, while he himself with the Basrans and remaining Khurasanis marched on the fortresses of Amul and Zamm. The rebel forces at Amul surrendered and were pardoned, and the garrison of Balkh followed soon after. Harith himself abandoned Marw Rudh and retreated across the Oxus before Abd al-Rahman, finding refuge with the princes of Tokharistan. With their aid, he laid siege to the major crossing point over the Oxus at Tirmidh. In the face of Harith's forces, Asad's troops <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> cross the Oxus but retreated to Balkh. However, the Tirmidh garrison managed to defeat Harith, who was weakened after a quarrel with the king of Khuttal, and who now retired eastwards to the mountains of Badakhshan. Asad followed up this success by persuading the garrison of Zamm to surrender on promises of amnesty and double pay, and by an unsuccessful expedition to recover Samarqand, which had been lost in the aftermath of the Defile.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} {{children}} placed large amounts of leaves into the track on 20 October 1955 a. Tram no. 24 up Eidsvolls gate could not handle the leaves, and started sliding backwards without breaking power. The conductor tried to spread sand on the tracks, {{but that did not}} help either. The tram behind, no. 19, noticed this just after leaving Vollabakken, but <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> back up due to the traffic. There were large material damages from the impact, but no-one was seriously injured. Since the two trams were to be taken out of traffic soon, both were withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the king}} {{repeated}} his invitation to Casaubon {{to settle in}} Paris, {{and gave him a}} pension. No more was said about the university. The recent reform of the University of Paris closed its doors to all but Catholics; and though the chairs of the Collège de France were not governed by the statutes of the university, public opinion ran so violently against Protestants, that Henry IV <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> appoint a Calvinist to that position. When the king's sub-librarian Jean Gosselin died of extreme old age in 1604, Casaubon succeeded him, with a salary of 400 livres in addition to his pension.|$|E

25|$|In Spring 1201 Sverre sailed {{out from}} Bergen {{with a large}} leidang force in what {{would be his last}} {{campaign}} season. With this army he could demand war taxes without opposition {{on both sides of the}} Oslofjord during the summer. In September he set up camp at Tønsberg and laid siege to Tønsberg Fortress, which was garrisoned by Reidar Sendemann and his men. The siege dragged on because the other Bagler leaders <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> send a relief force and the garrison did not fall for any of Sverre’s tricks. At last, on 25 January, Reidar and his men surrendered, and Sverre decided to sail back to Bergen.|$|E
25|$|In 1828, Shaka {{was assassinated}} by his half brother Dingane, who lacked the {{military}} genius and leadership skills of Shaka. Voortrekkers tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In {{the early months}} they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the Ncome River and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother Mpande took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 the Zulu Kingdom was invaded by Britain in a quest to control all of South Africa. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the Battle of Isandlwana but was defeated at the Battle of Ulundi.|$|E
25|$|From 1932 to 1935, White {{lived in}} England, {{studying}} French and German literature at King's College, Cambridge University. His homosexuality took {{a toll on}} his first term academic performance, {{in part because he}} developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.|$|E

25|$|The decrees of {{the council}} were {{acknowledged}} in Italy, Portugal, Poland and by the Catholic princes of Germany at the Diet of Augsburg in 1566. Philip II of Spain accepted them for Spain, the Netherlands and Sicily inasmuch as they did not infringe the royal prerogative. In France they were officially recognised by the king only in their doctrinal parts. The disciplinary sections received official recognition at provincial synods and were enforced by the bishops. No {{attempt was made to}} introduce it into England. Pius IV sent the decrees to Mary, Queen of Scots, with a letter dated 13 June 1564, requesting her to publish them in Scotland, but she <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> do it in the face of John Knox and the Reformation.|$|E
25|$|A {{new party}} of regime supporters, the Revolutionary National Union (Unión Nacional Revolucionaria), {{was founded in}} November 1936. Although the new party called for {{representative}} democracy, rights for peasants and workers, and socialization of key industries, it failed to broaden Franco's political base. In the end, Franco lost his popular support because he failed to keep his promises to the poor. He <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> expropriate the properties of foreign landowners, who were mostly Argentines. In addition, the Liberals, who still had influential support in the army, agitated constantly for Franco's overthrow. When Franco ordered Paraguayan troops to abandon the advanced positions in the Chaco that they had held since the 1935 truce, the army revolted in August 1937 and returned the Liberals to power.|$|E
25|$|Port Royal {{was once}} home to privateers {{encouraged}} to attack Habsburg Spain's vessels when smaller European powers <b>dared</b> <b>not</b> directly make war on Spain. As a port city, it was notorious for its gaudy displays {{of wealth and}} loose morals. It was a popular homeport for the English and Dutch-sponsored privateers to spend their treasure during the 17th century. When those governments abandoned the practice of issuing letters of marque to privateers against the Spanish treasure fleets and possessions in the later 16th century, many of the crews turned pirate. They continued to use the city as their main base during the 17th century. Pirates {{from around the world}} congregated at Port Royal, coming from waters as far away as Madagascar.|$|E
