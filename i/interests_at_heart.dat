25|$|Since {{the crown}} and the nobility {{essentially}} {{had the same}} <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart,</b> military commissioning of great magnates was not in itself disruptive to society. The civil wars of the 15th century were caused by personal factors (particularly the failings of Henry VI), not by institutional ones. Recent historical {{research has shown that}} payment for military service goes back much further than the reign of Edward I, further discrediting the ideas of Stubbs.|$|E
25|$|The team at Thorness {{is joined}} by the {{biologist}} Madeline Dawnay (Mary Morris). The computer is outputting instructions {{for the creation of}} living cells. Fleming becomes nervous, worried that whatever life-form they are creating may not have humanity's best <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart.</b> Dawney proceeds with the experiment, however, synthesising a primitive protoplasmic life-form. In the meantime, Bridger's leaking of Thorness' secrets has been discovered. Bridger is confronted by Ministry of Defence agent Judy Adamson (Patricia Kneale); fleeing he tumbles over a cliff to his death.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterwards, he was {{contacted}} by Yorkshire's secretary Frederick Toone following {{a request to}} Yorkshire by John Kaye. Toone recommended the engagement with MCC rather than Warwickshire, suggesting that Bowes would find greater scope for development at Lord's and, with Yorkshire's <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart,</b> pointed out {{that he would be}} available to play for Yorkshire when not required by MCC. Bowes was impressed and turned down the Warwickshire offer. He quit his job at the estate agency and joined MCC on 15 April 1928, having negotiated a raise in his wage to £6 a week.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Vicki {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with her 46-year-old college lecturer, Tommy Grant (Robert Cavanah); her family, particularly stepmother Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman), are outraged. Tommy feigns love for Vicki and they talk about leaving Walford to go travelling. Knowing that Tommy is untrustworthy, Chrissie attempts to seduce him. After a brief kiss, Chrissie strips him naked in the toilets of The Queen Victoria public house, on the promise that she will soon join him. She steals his clothes and forces Vicki to see him for the lying cheat he is. Vicki is devastated and initially furious with Chrissie but eventually realizes she had her best <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mormons often {{respond to}} these accusations by {{questioning}} whether critics like Johnson and Cannon really have Mormons' best <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart.</b> For Brigham Young University's 100 Hour Board, the [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] label serves the purpose of warning Latter-day Saints away from individuals who espouse [...] "hatred and bigotry". It is better, says the Board, for a confused Saint to [...] "talk to someone... that (1) has your best <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart,</b> and (2) actually understands what the Church teaches." ...|$|E

50|$|Cyprus {{was sold}} in 1489 to Venice by the Cypriot Queen Catherine Cornaro. The Venetians did not have Cyprus' best <b>interest</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart,</b> they were only {{interested}} in receiving the taxes and in exploiting the country’s resources. The Venetians strengthened the Castle of Limassol.|$|R
2500|$|Dowding {{was known}} for his humility and great sincerity. Fighter Command pilots came to characterise Dowding as one who cared for his men and had their best <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart.</b> Dowding often {{referred}} to his [...] "dear fighter boys" [...] as his [...] "chicks": indeed his son Derek was one of them. Because of his brilliant detailed preparation of Britain's air defences for the German assault, and his prudent management of his resources during the battle, Dowding is today generally given the credit for Britain's victory in the Battle of Britain.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 May, as {{the fleet}} was finally {{preparing}} to leave Corunna, the men demanded their six months of pay or threatened to strike. Houblon refused to acquiesce to these demands, but Admiral O'Byrne, seeing {{the seriousness of the}} situation, wrote to England asking for the money owed to his men. However, on 6 May some of the sailors were involved in an argument with Admiral O'Byrne, and it was probably around this time that they conceived of a plan to mutiny and began recruiting others. One of the men recruiting others was Henry Every. As William Phillips, a mariner on the Dove, would later testify, Every went [...] "up & down from Ship to Ship & persuaded the men to come on board him, & he would carry them where they should get money enough." [...] Since Every {{had a great deal of}} experience and was also born in a lower social rank, he was the natural choice to command the mutiny, as the crew believed he would have their best <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most {{people will}} {{remember}} Bo Ackal {{as a state}} official -- I will remember him {{not only as a}} dedicated public servant, but as a dear friend. Bo always had the state's best <b>interest</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart,</b> and he worked tirelessly for his constituents and all citizens of Louisiana. Bo Ackal touched many lives during his lifetime, and I am so grateful that he touched mine. He will be sorely missed.|$|R

5000|$|Student Teacher Relationships: The {{theme of}} Student-Teacher Relationship {{within the context}} of CRP aligns itself closely with the {{concepts}} of [...] "caring, relationships, interaction, and classroom atmosphere." [...] Educators must combine the willingness to bond with their students with the desire to grow that relationship into one vested in personal care and professional vigilance. Students must feel that the teacher has their best <b>interest</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart</b> to succeed in implementing CRP.|$|R
50|$|Although he is gone, Bo Ackal {{will always}} be an icon in Louisiana politics. He {{is a perfect example}} of the {{sacrifice}} and untiring work public servants do, and that we hear so little about. Bo was a giving person who genuinely cared about our state and her citizens. He always had his fellow man's <b>interest</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart.</b> He will live forever in our memories and we will certainly feel his loss.|$|R
5000|$|To Daddy {{is said to}} {{describe}} the pain Parton's mother experienced as she ignored her husband's occasional affairs and his lack of affection. It relates to how her mother, in having the family's best <b>interest</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart</b> and {{to be the best}} possible mother she could to her children, that she stood by her husband through difficult times. (Unlike Parton's parents, however, who remained together, the mother in the song ultimately leaves the family.) ...|$|R

6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh, don’t be so solemn about it, or I {{shall be}} obliged to leave a card on you. In England I suppose that would hardly be {{considered}} en règle.

Hasmukh tries desperately to balance his work and family, but neither seem to have his best <b>interest</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Hastings asked no more questions. She {{believed}} that she understood the situation, and she had Agatha's <b>interests</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart,</b> for she had grown very fond of the girl. There was certainly one slight difficulty {{in the way of}} what she meant to do, but she determined to disregard it, though she admitted that it might, cause Agatha some embarrassment afterward. When she found the girl alone, she sat down beside her.|$|E

I wish it could be otherwise, and I will speak {{to him on the}} subject; but it will not do to interfere with him too much. A good overseer is not easy to get, and the slaves are always ready to take advantage of leniency. An easy master makes bad work, but an easy overseer would mean ruin to an estate.

Too long had a proud and sovereign State writhed under the heel of an all-devouring corporation! Too long had the Northeastern Railroads elected, for their own selfish ends, governors and legislatures and controlled railroad commissions The spirit of 1776 was abroad in the land. It was eminently fitting that the Honourable Humphrey Crewe of Leith, who had dared to fling down the gauntlet {{in the face of an}} arrogant power, should be the leader of the plain people, to recover the rights which had been wrested from them.

40|$|Between the First and Second World Wars, Australia {{was under}} {{significant}} social, {{political and economic}} pressures. It has been generally argued that these problems stifled environmental debate, encouraging governments to look to large-scale development schemes for solutions. In turn, the few critics of these schemes were ruthlessly attacked as not having the national <b>interest</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart.</b> This article contests this interpretation of the period. It argues {{that there was an}} environmental debate, {{with a wide range of}} interests pushing for conservation, the development of National Parks and limits on these development schemes...|$|R

50|$|Constant did {{not join}} SI at that time. He objected to the SI {{on the ground that}} the {{movement}} seemed to be established mainly by artists who have their own <b>interest</b> <b>at</b> <b>heart</b> more than a common goal. When SI openly pleaded for 'unitary urbanism', as defined by Constant and Debord, Constant joined. An intensive correspondence between him and Debord followed. Constant wrote several theoretical articles for the French SI journal and staged events at several museums in Paris as well as the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where he showed his New Babylon series in 1959.|$|R
