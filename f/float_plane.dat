5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} bail out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 <b>float</b> <b>plane</b> based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, {{he was sent to}} a field hospital. I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E

5000|$|Early 20th-century {{flights to}} Fort McMurray were {{primarily}} <b>float</b> <b>planes</b> that used the Snye River, a waterway that linked Clearwater River {{to the larger}} Athabasca River (private <b>float</b> <b>planes</b> still use the waterway). The first landing strip for light planes was built in 1936 to connect Fort McMurray with Edmonton.|$|R
5|$|In the 1930s, {{all three}} members of the class were {{modified}} to carry a pair of <b>float</b> <b>planes</b> for reconnaissance. They were equipped with an aircraft catapult to launch the planes and cranes to recover them after they landed in the water. The ships initially carried two Heinkel He 60 biplane <b>float</b> <b>planes,</b> replaced later in the decade with two Arado Ar 196 monoplane <b>float</b> <b>planes.</b> Only one aircraft could be stored on the catapult at a time; the second plane had to be disassembled and placed in storage, and the ships did not have a hangar to store it in.|$|R

25|$|Immediately on {{completion}} on 31 August 1941, Aikoku Maru {{was officially}} requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy. She was converted into an {{armed merchant cruiser}} from 5 September while still at Tamano, with the installation of four 15 cm/50 41st Year Type guns, two QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval guns, two Type 93 13.2-mm machine guns and two quad-mount 533-mm torpedo tubes. She was also fitted with powerful searchlights and boom for handling a Kawanishi E7K <b>float</b> <b>plane</b> (with one additional aircraft as a spare).|$|E
25|$|Vancouver {{is served}} by Vancouver International Airport (YVR), located on Sea Island {{in the city of}} Richmond, {{immediately}} south of Vancouver. Vancouver's airport is Canada's second-busiest airport, and the second-largest gateway on the west coast of North America for international passengers. HeliJet and <b>float</b> <b>plane</b> companies operate scheduled air service from Vancouver harbour and YVR south terminal. The city is also served by two BC Ferry terminals. One is to the northwest at Horseshoe Bay (in West Vancouver), and the other is to the south, at Tsawwassen (in Delta).|$|E
25|$|In May 1943, No. 12 Squadron {{was ordered}} to move to Merauke in western New Guinea, where it would come {{under the command of}} No. 72 Wing. The squadron's 270-man strong advance party arrived in Merauke on 8 July but found that no {{facilities}} had been constructed for the unit. As a result, its aircraft were stationed at Cooktown, Queensland, where they were used for anti-submarine patrols and the escort of shipping. No. 12 Squadron gradually moved to Merauke between September and November 1943, and continued to be employed mainly in maritime patrols. The squadron's only contact with the Japanese during its period at Merauke took place on 9 October when a Vengeance unsuccessfully attacked a <b>float</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E

25|$|Currently {{there are}} no {{airports}} on Little Diomede Island because of the island's rocky, steep slopes. Most winters, a temporary ice runway is cleared {{on top of the}} sea ice just off of the coast of the village, however in some years (winter 2009) ice conditions prevent construction. Some bush pilots have occasionally landed {{on the top of the}} tuya which is rocky, but has a somewhat flat surface during the snowy winter. The only way to land with an airplane during the few summer months is on water with a <b>float</b> <b>plane.</b> Any type of airplane landing on the island is very rare due to the high risk and severe weather. There have been thoughts and studies regarding the construction of a permanent runway.|$|E
25|$|Off Portland harbour, 87 Squadron intercepted Ju87s without result and 64 Squadron {{shot down}} a Heinkel He 115 <b>float</b> <b>plane</b> mining the Thames Estuary. III./KG 55 lost a bomber to 145 Squadron and against Bf109s, 1 and 32 squadrons lost a Hurricane each, 43 Squadron lost two and one damaged, two pilots were seriously wounded {{and one was}} killed; 141 Squadron lost ten crew killed and one wounded. Although the losses on this day were small numerically, the British fighters had been {{defeated}} in each engagement. The Germans were more experienced, operating in greater numbers and the Bf109 units were fighting with greater flexibility. Operating at generally higher altitudes, the Finger-four formation tactic used by German fighter pilots proved far more effective than close British formations of British pilots. All the German pilots could scan the air but the British {{had to rely on}} the formation leader, while concentrating on tight formation-flying.|$|E
25|$|Shipping at Manokwari Harbor and {{aircraft}} on Kamiri Airfield on Noemfoor Island were the targets for 12 planes on 19 May {{was one of}} the most outstanding missions ever flown by the 8th Bombardment Squadron as far as damage to the enemy is concerned. The strike resulted in the sinking or damaging of seven Japanese ships from 150–800 tons, direct hits on a 1000–1500 ton ship, and damage to several smaller luggers and a power launch by misses and strafing in Manokwari Harbor. Nine of the twelve planes made strafing passes on parked aircraft on Kamir Airfield, destroying four planes definitely and causing heavy damage to at least ten others. Many Japanese infantry of a group of approximately 100 working on the Kamiri airstrip were seen to fall after a strafing pass had been made on them. Four trucks were heavily strafed, probably rendering them completely unserviceable. Anti-aircraft Artillery fire, first at Manokwari was of all calibers, ranging from moderate to intense, but inaccurate. At Kamiri Airfield, medium and light AAA fire was received, inaccurate as to lead. One enemy Mitsubishi F1M <b>float</b> <b>plane,</b> attempted to intercept, but was shot down by a P-38 Lightning escort about one mile west of Kamiri. All of our planes returned safely.|$|E

25|$|Kepford's {{next big}} day arrived on 19 February. VF-17 was {{assigned}} fighter escort duty, shepherding single engine bombers to strikes on Lakunai Airfield. Kepford was again assigned as division leader, {{this time for}} one of two groups flying high cover. His wingman had engine problems and was quickly forced to return to Piva. Arriving at the target site, Kepford decided there was enough fighter cover {{and that he was}} too vulnerable without a wingman, so he too headed back for home base. En route, he spotted a Rufe flying low on the water. Kepford pounced on the vulnerable <b>float</b> <b>plane</b> and easily shot it down. Immediately after, a mass of 20 or so enemy fighters spotted Kepford flying alone beneath them and dove on the vulnerable pilot. He was quickly penned in by four enemy aircraft and forced to head north, away from his base. He used his plane's water injection—a new feature installed on a small number of Corsairs—to help him pull as far ahead of the enemies as possible, but the device worked fitfully. He tried to lose them flying low over land, without success. Deciding he was moving too far afield to return to base on remaining fuel reserves, Kepford quickly cut to the left and reversed direction south over the water. The plane following Kepford on the left side attempted to turn inside to shoot him down, but the pilot misjudged his altitude and struck his wing into the water below, crashing. Those on the right side lost too much ground when Kepford reversed, so they gave up the chase.|$|E
500|$|In December 1926, Whitehead was {{assigned}} as the co-pilot for Major Herbert A. Dargue, leading the [...] Pan American Good Will Flight touring South America. During a landing at Buenos Aires in March 1927, their aircraft, a Loening OA-1A <b>float</b> <b>plane</b> nicknamed New York, {{was involved in}} a mid-air collision with the Detroit, another OA-1A, forcing both Dargue and Whitehead to bail out. Whitehead suffered only a sprained ankle, but the pilot and co-pilot of the Detroit were killed. The remaining four planes of the flight completed the tour, for which all ten airmen including Whitehead received the first awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
500|$|At about 2 pm on 4 October, as the Home Fleet was sailing westwards, three German {{reconnaissance}} aircraft approached Ranger. At this time {{two pairs of}} Wildcats were providing a combat air patrol over the fleet, and were guided to intercept the German aircraft by Rangers fighter director. Two of the fighters shot down a Junkers Ju 88 bomber [...] from the carrier, and the other pair downed a Heinkel He 115 <b>float</b> <b>plane</b> [...] from Ranger. The remaining aircraft, a Ju 88, was not sighted by the fighter pilots and managed to escape. These were the first German aircraft to have been shot down by US Navy aircraft.

500|$|After {{completing}} more convoy runs, Nevada {{set sail}} for the United Kingdom {{to prepare for}} the Normandy Invasion, arriving in April 1944. Her <b>float</b> <b>plane</b> artillery observer pilots were temporarily assigned to VOS-7 flying Spitfires from RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus). She was chosen as Rear Admiral Morton Deyo's flagship for the operation. During the invasion, Nevada supported forces ashore from 6–17 June, and again on 25 June; during this time, she employed her guns against shore defenses on the Cherbourg Peninsula, [...] " [...] to lean back as [...] hurled salvo after salvo at the shore batteries." [...] Shells from her guns ranged as far as [...] inland in attempts to break up German concentrations and counterattacks, even though she was straddled by counterbattery fire 27 times (though never hit). Nevada was later praised for her [...] "incredibly accurate" [...] fire in support of beleaguered troops, as some of the targets she hit were just [...] from the front line. Nevada was the only battleship present at both Pearl Harbor and the Normandy landings.|$|E
