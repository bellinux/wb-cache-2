40|$|Problem statement: Rhanterium epapposum, locally called Arfaj is the {{national}} flower of&# 13; Kuwait. The current situation of Rhanterium epapposum is quite critical in most areas of Kuwait. In&# 13; fact it has completely disappeared from {{most parts of the}} country due to a combination of overgrazing,&# 13; collecting for firewood and off road driving. Approach: Rhanterium epapposum is an excellent&# 13; species for rangeland restoration and information on its germination ecology is meager. The&# 13; considerable variations in germination between years lead us to study the variation in the size, mass&# 13; and number of filled achenes in the capitulum. The variation in capitulum size, mass, number of&# 13; achenes per capitulum and also the effect of dry heat (1 - 5 months), Moist chilling (1 - 5 months) and&# 13; <b>hydration</b> <b>dehydration</b> <b>cycles</b> (1 - 5 cycles) on germination of the 6 different year collected Rhanterium&# 13; epapposum (2002 - 2007) seeds were studied under laboratory condition. Results: The seed size,&# 13; weight, the number of achenes per capitulum of Rhanterium epapposum varied considerably from one&# 13; year to another. Climatic condition significantly decreased seed quality and germination when the&# 13; precipitation is lower. Heat and moist stratification substantially improved the germination of 2003,&# 13; 2004 and 2005 seeds. However <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> treatment had very little effect on&# 13; germination. Conclusion: It is concluded that results of germination tests differed depending on the&# 13; presence of filled achenes in the capitulum. There was a strong correlation between the presence of&# 13; filled achenes in capitulum and the precipitation during the growing season. This suggested that under&# 13; natural condition precipitation plays key role in the formation of achenes in capitulum of the&# 13; Rhanterium epapposum seeds...|$|R

40|$|Recent geomorphological {{observations}} {{as well as}} {{chemical and}} thermodynamic studies demonstrate that liquid water should be stable today on the Martian surface at some times of the day. In Martian conditions, brines would be particularly more stable than pure water because salts can depress the freezing point and lower the evaporation rate of water. Despite this evidence, no clear spectral signature of liquid has been observed so far by the hyperspectral imaging spectrometers OMEGA and CRISM. However, past spectral analysis lacks a good characterization of brines׳ spectral signatures. This study thus aims to determine how liquid brines can be detected on Mars by spectroscopy. In this way, laboratory experiments were performed for reproducing <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> <b>cycles</b> of various brines while measuring their spectral signatures. The resulting spectra first reveal a very similar spectral evolution for the various brine types and pure water, with the main difference observed {{at the end of}} the dehydration with the crystallization of various hydrated minerals from brines. The main characteristic of this spectral behavior is an important decoupling between the evolution of albedo and hydration bands depths. During most of the wetting/drying processes, spectra usually display a low albedo associated with shallow water absorption band depths. Strong water absorption band depth and high albedo are respectively only observed when the surface is very wet and when the surface is very dry. These experiments can thus explain why the currently active Martian features attributed to the action of a liquid are only associated with low albedo and very weak spectral signatures. Hydration experiments also reveal that deliquescence occurs easily even at low temperature and moderate soil water vapor pressure and could thus cause seasonal darkening on Mars. These experiments demonstrate that the absence of water absorptions in CRISM in the middle afternoon does not rule out water activity and suggest future spectral investigations to identify water on the Martian surface...|$|R

40|$|International @ ENERGIE+AJH:SBE:AAUInternational audienceNowadays, several {{researches}} {{are investigating}} the possibility to store thermo-chemically the heat produced by renewable energies [1] for various applications. In order to increase the stored energy density, new composite materials should be developed. Often these materials are composed of a host material and a hygroscopic salt [2]. This combination can double the heat storage properties by optimizing the water sorptiondesorption cycles [3]. In this work, porous silica-alumina powders with different quantities of alumina were selected, impregnated with 10 wt. % of calcium chloride and tested as heat storage materials. Composite materials were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of commercial silica-alumina powders (containing respectively 13, 25 or 75 wt. % of alumina) with calcium chloride and labelled as S 13 ACa, S 25 ACa, and S 75 ACa. The composite materials were calcined at 260 °C and their surface area was measured by means of N 2 adsorption at - 196 °C. The heats of water sorption-desorption on the silica-alumina composites were determined using a Setaram TG-DSC 111 apparatus. Moreover, successive cycles of hydration (at 20 °C) / dehydration (at 150 °C) were performed to check the cyclability of the system. The <b>hydration</b> / <b>dehydration</b> <b>cycles</b> and the corresponding recorded heats for the three porous silica-alumina powders and their composites are reported in the figure. The S 75 A sample provides the lower heat per gram of material if compared to S 13 A and S 25 A. We can observe that the heat released per gram of material decreases by increasing the Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 ratio. Once the calcium chloride is deposited on the silica-alumina powders, the quantity of generated heat increased {{with respect to the}} corresponding bare silica-alumina support. The S 13 ACa composite shows the highest heat released during the hydration step (457 J. g- 1 of material) compared to S 25 ACa and S 75 ACa composites (342 and 274 J. g- 1 of material respectively). In conclusion we can observe that to obtain good thermal energy storage materials, both the Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 ratio and the salt hydrates deposition have to be optimized. More composites with tuned AlO 3 /SiO 2 ratio and different types and concentration of salt hydrates are under study; the systematic adjustment of the composites composition is pursued starting from the feed-back data obtained by TG-DSC analysis.

40|$|Fluids {{entering}} the subduction zone {{are a key}} factor in the subduction process. They determine the onset of melting, weakening and changes in the dynamics and thermal structure of subduction zones and trigger earthquakes when being released from the subducting plate in a series of metamorphic processes. However, the amount of water carried into the subduction zone and its distribution are not well constrained by existing data and are subject of vigorous current research in SFB 574 (Volatiles and Fluids in Subduction Zones: Climate Feedback and Trigger Mechanisms for Natural Disasters). Electromagnetic methods like magnetotellurics have been used widely to recognize fluid release and melt production through enhanced electrical conductivities. Here we present an image of the <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> <b>cycle</b> down to 120 km depth in one setting derived by an onshore-offshore transect of magnetotelluric soundings in Costa Rica. An electrically conductive zone in the incoming plate outer rise is associated with sea water penetrating down extensional faults and cracks into the upper mantle possibly causing serpentinization. Along the downward subducting plate distinct conductive anomalies identify fluids from dehydration of sediments, crust and mantle. A conductivity anomaly at a depth of approx. 12 km and at a distance of 65 km from the trench is associated with a first major dehydration reaction of minerally-bound water. This is of importance in the context of mid-slope fluid seeps which are thought to significantly contribute to the recycling of minerally-bound water. The position of the conductivity anomaly correlates with geochemical and seismic evidence stating that mid-slope fluids are originated at >= 12 km depth before rising up through deep faults to the seeps. The conductivity anomaly is therefore associated with a fluid accumulation feeding the mid-slope seeps. Another fluid accumulation is revealed by a conductivity anomaly at 20 - 30 km depth and a distance of approximately 30 km seaward from the volcanic arc. This lower crustal fluid accumulation could likely be caused by trapping of fluids released due to de-serpentinization processes or due to other mineral dehydration processes. While we are at the moment not able to attribute one specific process causing the anomaly based on electromagnetic data alone, this feature is however of fundamental importance. A comparison with other electromagnetic studies from subduction zones around the world reveal that such a conductivity anomaly is a global feature suggesting the presence of a global fluid sink. Based on very simplified assumptions we are able derive rough estimates for the amount of water being stored in the overriding plate. Relating seismic evidence as well as petrological results collected in the multi-disciplinary study on the Costa Rican subduction zone we introduce budget estimations for the water cycle in the subduction zone...|$|R
40|$|Author(s) 2015. In {{this study}} we {{describe}} the hygroscopic properties of accumulation- and coarse-mode aerosol particles sampled at the Zotino Tall Tower Observatory (ZOTTO) in central Siberia (61 ° N, 89 ° E) from 16 to 21 June 2013. The hygroscopic growth measurements were supplemented with chemical analyses of the samples, including inorganic ions and organic/elemental carbon. In addition, the microstructure and chemical compositions of aerosol particles were analyzed by x-ray micro-spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A mass closure analysis indicates that organic carbon accounted for 61 and 38 % of particulate matter (PM) in the accumulation mode and coarse mode, respectively. The water-soluble fraction of organic matter {{was estimated to be}} 52 and 8 % of PM in these modes. Sulfate, predominantly in the form of ammoniated sulfate, was the dominant inorganic component in both size modes: ∼ 34 % in the accumulation mode vs. ∼ 47 % in the coarse mode. The hygroscopic growth measurements were conducted with a filter-based differential hygroscopicity analyzer (FDHA) over the range of 5 - 99. 4 % RH in the <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> operation modes. The FDHA study indicates that both accumulation and coarse modes exhibit pronounced water uptake approximately at the same relative humidity (RH), starting at ∼ 70 %, while efflorescence occurred at different humidities, i. e., at ∼ 35 % RH for submicron particles vs. ∼ 50 % RH for supermicron particles. This ∼ 15 % RH difference was attributed to higher content of organic material in the submicron particles, which suppresses water release in the dehydration experiments. The kappa mass interaction model (KIM) was applied to characterize and parameterize non-ideal solution behavior and concentration-dependent water uptake by atmospheric aerosol samples in the 5 - 99. 4 % RH range. Based on KIM, the volume-based hygroscopicity parameter, κ v, was calculated. The κ v,ws value related to the water-soluble (ws) fraction was estimated to be ∼ 0. 15 for the accumulation mode and ∼ 0. 36 for the coarse mode, respectively. The obtained κ v,ws for the accumulation mode is in good agreement with earlier data reported for remote sites in the Amazon rain forest (κ v ≈ 0. 15) and a Colorado mountain forest (κ v ≈ 0. 16). We used the Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule to predict the chemical composition dependent hygroscopicity, κ v,p. The obtained κ v,p values overestimate the experimental FDHA-KIM-derived κ v,ws by factors of 1. 8 and 1. 5 for the accumulation and coarse modes, respectively. This divergence can be explained by incomplete dissolution of the hygroscopic inorganic compounds resulting from kinetic limitations due to a sparingly soluble organic coating. The TEM and STXM-NEXAFS results indicate that aged submicron (> 300 nm) and supermicron aerosol particles possess core-shell structures with an inorganic core, and are enriched in organic carbon at the mixed particle surface. The direct FDHA kinetic studies provide a bulk diffusion coefficient of water of ∼ 10 - 12 cm 2 s - 1 indicating a semi-solid state of the organic-rich phase leading to kinetic limitations of water uptake and release during <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> <b>cycles.</b> Overall, the present ZOTTO data set, obtained in the growing season, has revealed a strong influence of organic carbon on the hygroscopic properties of the ambient aerosols. The sparingly soluble organic coating controls hygroscopic growth, phase transitions, and microstructural rearrangement processes.

40|$|At {{continental}} margins, {{the water}} content and its distribution {{play an important}} role in the subduction process. Water is released from the subducting slab in a series of metamorphic reactions and may trigger the onset of melting, cause crustal weakening and changes in the dynamics and thermal structure of subduction zones. However, the amount of water carried into the subduction zone and its distribution are not well constrained by existing data. They are subject of vigorous current research in the special research initiative (SFB 574) at University of Kiel and IFM-GEOMAR “Volatiles and Fluids in Subduction Zones: Climate Feedback and Trigger Mechanisms for Natural Disasters”. Electromagnetic methods like magnetotellurics have been widely used to recognize fluid release and melt production through enhanced electrical conductivities. In the framework of SFB 574, an offshore magnetotelluric experiment was performed in 2007 - 2008 along a profile crossing the trench, where the Cocos plate is thrust beneath the Caribbean plate. The marine profile was extended onshore by the Free University of Berlin, yielding a large-scale amphibious data set across the subduction zone with a profile length of 370 km. The main goal of the experiment is to image the fluid content and its distribution along the subducting plate and deeper Earth structure. The recorded electromagnetic time series have been processed to electromagnetic sounding curves (apparent resistivity & phase, and Tipper) at each station. As most of the stations lay on a cliffy continental shelf, they were highly susceptible to water enforced movement (tidal currents hitting the shelf). The data quality of the recorded electromagnetic time series therefore ranges from very good to noisy, depending on the instrument’s position and stability. Only quiet sections are used for the processing. In the subsequently derived marine transfer functions a distortion due to the so-called “coast effect” is visible at specific period and distance to the coast (apexes in apparent resistivity curves occur in the transvers-electric (TE) mode, accompanied by phases wandering through all four quadrants and abnormally high Tipper values). A detailed modeling study is performed in order to explain and quantify the coastal distortion. The modeling study reveals that the presence of a coast affects the marine transfer functions with a specific signature, which depends on several physical parameters, such as distance from the coast, period, ocean depth and bulk resistivity. Approximations are derived that define a “characteristic period” and “characteristic distance” from the coast at which the distortion is expected to be most pronounced in the transfer functions. The distortion due to the coast is shown to be helpful as it allows the estimation of the bulk resistivity of the subsurface and furthermore increases the sensitivity of the electromagnetic response to conductivity anomalies at depth. The recorded marine transfer functions were inverted together with the land transfer functions to an electrical resistivity model of the subduction zone down to a depth of approximately 120 km. Based on the model the <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> <b>cycle</b> of a subduction zone may be derived. An electrically conductive zone in the incoming plate outer rise is associated with sea water penetrating down extensional faults and cracks into the upper mantle. Along the downward subducting plate, distinct conductive anomalies identify fluids from dehydration processes in the sediments, crust and mantle. A conductivity anomaly at a depth of approximately 12 km and at a distance of 65 km from the trench is associated with a first major dehydration reaction of minerally-bound water. This is of importance in the context of mid-slope fluid seeps which are thought to significantly contribute to the recycling of minerally-bound water.

Hydration of three different paddy samples (Sherpa low and high head rice yield and Reiziq) were performed below (60 °C) and above (90 °C) the gelatinization temperature. The hydration period ranged from 5 to 300 minutes at 60 °C and 5 to 90 minutes at 90 °C. All of the paddy samples showed different hydration behavior below and above the gelatinization temperature, discerned with two different stages at 60 °C and three stages at 90 °C. Dehydration was carried out at 40 °C just after hydration (without tempering the kernel), which mostly took place at the falling rate period. The <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> pattern was not different between the high HRY and low HRY paddy, indicating a limited contribution of microfissures to the diffusion rate in the paddy. Five commonly used semi-empirical models were used to predict the <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> behavior of paddy and, among them, the Page model was found to be the most suitable. The effective diffusivity during hydration was dependent on the temperature of hydration, which was 1. 83 × 10 - 11 to 2. 11 × 10 - 11 m 2 /s at 60 °C and 6. 68 × 10 - 11 to 7. 94 × 10 - 11 m 2 /s at 90 °C.

40|$|Layered double {{hydroxides}} (LDH) {{are extremely}} important materials for industrial processes {{and in the}} environment, and their physical-chemical behavior depends {{in large part on}} their hydration state, but the characterization of these hydration effects on their properties are incomplete. The present study was designed to explore the interpolytype transitions induced by variation in the ambient humidity among LDHs. The cooperative behavior of intercalated water molecules resulted in a sudden, single-step, reversible dehydration of the [Zn-Cr-SO 4] LDH. The [Zn-Al-SO 4] LDH provided an interesting contrast with (1) the coexistence of the end members of the hydration cycle over the 40 - 20 % relative humidity range during the <b>dehydration</b> <b>cycle,</b> and (2) a random interstratified intermediate in the hydration cycle. These observations showed that the [Zn-Al-SO 4] LDH offered sites having a range of hydration enthalpies, whereby, at critical levels of hydration (20 - 40 %), the non-uniform swelling of the structure resulted in an interstratified phase. The variation in domain size during reversible hydration was also responsible for the differences observed in the <b>hydration</b> vs. the <b>dehydration</b> pathways. This behavior was attributed to the distortion in the array of hydroxyl ions which departs from hexagonal symmetry on account of cation ordering as shown by structure refinement by the Rietveld method. This distortion was much less in the [Zn-Cr-SO 4] LDH, whereby the nearly hexagonal array of hydroxyl ions offered sites of uniform hydration enthalpy for the intercalated water molecules. In this case, all the water molecules experienced the same force of attraction and dehydrated reversibly in a single step. The changes in basal spacing were also accompanied by interpolytype transitions, involving the rigid translations of the metal hydroxide layers relative to one another...|$|R

The principal reactions expected of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, {{and some of their}} precursors in this environment are discussed. The model is based on the concept of a fluctuating system in which <b>hydration</b> and <b>dehydration</b> processes occur in a cyclic manner, with allowance for high concentrations of soluble salts, such as chlorides and sulfates. It is concluded that the proposed prebiotic environment with its dynamical characteristics is a plausible model for the chemical evolution from biomonomers through random oligomers toward self-replicating chemical systems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOur {{ability to}} {{decipher}} the mechanisms behind metamorphic transformation processes depends {{in a major way}} {{on the extent to which}} crystallographic and microstructural information is transferred from one stage to another. Within the Leka Ophiolite Complex in the Central Norwegian Caledonides, prograde olivine veins that formed by dehydration of serpentinite veins in dunites exhibit a characteristic distribution of microstructures: The outer part of the veins comprises coarse-grained olivine that forms an unusual, brick-like microstructure. The inner part of the veins, surrounding a central fault, is composed of fine-grained olivine. Where the fault movement included a dilational component, optically clear, equant olivine occurs in the centre. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping reveals that the vein olivine has inherited its crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) from the olivine in the porphyroclastic host rock; however, misorientation is weaker and associated to different rotation axes. We propose that prograde olivine grew epitaxially on relics of mantle olivine and thereby acquired its CPO. Growth towards pre-existing microfractures along which serpentinisation had occurred led to straight grain boundaries and a brick-like microstructure in the veins. When dehydration embrittlement induced slip, a strong strain localisation on discrete fault planes prevented distortion of the CPO due to cataclastic deformation; grain size reduction did not significantly modify the olivine CPO. This illustrates how a CPO can be preserved though an entire metamorphic <b>cycle,</b> including <b>hydration,</b> <b>dehydration,</b> and deformation processes, and that the CPO and the microstructures (e. g. grain shape) of one phase do not necessarily record the same event...|$|R
40|$|Background: Water-loss {{dehydration}} {{in older}} people {{is associated with}} increased mortality and disability. We aimed to assess the prevalence of dehydration in older people living in UK long-term care, and associated cognitive, functional and health characteristics. Methods: The Dehydration Recognition In our Elders (DRIE) cohort study included people ≥ 65 years living in long-term care without heart or renal failure. In a cross-sectional baseline analysis we assessed serum osmolality, previously suggested dehydration risk factors, general health, markers of continence, cognitive and functional health, nutrition status and medications. Univariate linear regression {{was used to assess}} relationships between participant characteristics and serum osmolality, then associated characteristics entered into stepwise backwards multivariate linear regression. Results: DRIE included 188 residents (mean age 86 years, 66 % women) of whom 20 % were dehydrated (serum osmolality > 300 mOsm/kg). Linear and logistic regression suggested that renal, cognitive and diabetic status were consistently associated with serum osmolality and odds of dehydration, while potassium-sparing diuretics, sex, number of recent health contacts, and bladder incontinence were sometimes associated. Thirst was not associated with hydration status. Conclusions: DRIE found high prevalence of dehydration in older people living in UK long-term care, reinforcing the proposed association between cognitive and renal function and <b>hydration.</b> <b>Dehydration</b> is associated with increased mortality and disability in older people, but trials to assess effects of interventions to support healthy fluid intakes in older people living in residential care are needed to enable us to formally assess causal direction and any health benefits of increasing fluid intakes...|$|R

In the absence of a catalyst, the equilibrium is reached quite slowly. The rate constants are 0.039s−1 for the forward reaction (CO2+H2O→ H2CO3) and 23s−1 for the reverse reaction (H2CO3→ CO2+ H2O). The addition of two molecules of water to CO2 would give orthocarbonic acid, C(OH)4, which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution.|$|R
