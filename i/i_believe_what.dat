2500|$|Moyer {{cut short}} {{his visit to}} the strike zone to confer with Governor Woodbridge Nathan Ferris on September 3. Joining him was Clarence Darrow, who had {{previously}} defended Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone in the Steunenberg murder case. Moyer and Darrow asked the governor to again try to arbitrate the strike. The strikers would not insist on mentioning the WFM in any settlement, but would insist on the right to organize and select representatives. Ferris was skeptical, saying it resembled his earlier rejected proposals: [...] "When James MacNaughton says that he will let grass grow in the streets before he will ever treat with the Western Federation of Miners or its representatives, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> he says." [...] Moyer countered: [...] "I'm not willing to admit yet that James MacNaughton will not recognize organized labor before he dies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pure Mule {{received}} a favourable {{reaction from the}} critics, with some praising it for being the first RTÉ drama of the decade to portray issues such as Alzheimer's disease though locals said it portrayed midlanders in a bad light. Tom Parlon, a TD, spoke of the upset Pure Mules themes of cocaine and other issues caused to [...] "a lot of people" [...] in his constituency of Laois–Offaly, saying: It does make for uncomfortable viewing especially for someone like me whose has lived all their life in rural Ireland. But let's not be naive here. I believe the programme has also performed a valuable service by highlighting in stark and uncomfortable terms the challenges facing rural Ireland today in particular increased drug use amongst our young population. [...] Pure Mule has shown to all who watch it that young people {{in every corner of}} this country are experimenting with and using drugs on a large scale. Teenage sex and sexual promiscuity are other uncomfortable issues that are dealt with. It is fiction but it has also struck a raw nerve because it is telling an unpalatable truth. As a rural TD and as a parent, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> we are facing is a ticking time bomb in rural Ireland, where our young people feel increasingly dislocated from their community, where a lack of recreational and social outlets is fuelling the increase in drink and drug use. The last 20 years has brought unprecedented economic growth and social change across Ireland. What we must now do is face up to the social challenges.|$|E

5000|$|I regret Hillsborough. It was a {{fundamental}} mistake. The mistake was <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> an MP said. It was a Tory MP. If {{he had not}} said it and the chief superintendent (David Duckenfield) had not agreed with it, {{we would not have}} gone with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! no, that {{is clear}} enough. One can guess {{what will happen}} there. He is always with them; half lives in the family, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>What</b> a very good-looking man!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How d'ye do, Miss Spruce? I declare you're always first. It's to get {{a chance}} of having one of the young gentlemen to yourself, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>What's</b> the news in the city to-day, Mr Eames? In your {{position}} now of course you hear all the news." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I {{will try}} you, I think. Perhaps, as you say, {{you have never}} had a fair chance yet, and I will give you one. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you say, that you will be faithful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do I {{hear all}} this, then, about the {{difficulty}} of my marrying? Or if I hear so much, why do I not hear more? I know pretty well, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>what</b> is my father's income." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{man must}} be terribly weak and profoundly desperate to be able, under such circumstances, to beard the Warden in solitary. Or {{he may be}} both, and, in addition, he may have faith. I know now that I had the faith and so acted on it. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> Morrell had told me. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> in the lordship of the mind over the body. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> that not even a hundred days in the jacket could kill me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> see <b>what</b> you mean,' he said, {{studying}} {{her with a}} gravity that was amusing. 'There's your youngest sister, Octavia, is not she?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About Miss Bracy--I thought wrong things, if I {{did not say}} them. To her, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>I</b> said <b>what</b> was true, {{though it}} was harsh of me to say it, and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} will. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you told me. But you can't blame me for wantin' to find out. You don't see many girls smokin' {{cigarettes}} {{in places like}} Rooney's after midnight that are like you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I find to be true, whether I like or dislike it. And I teach {{other people}} that the chief of all wickednesses is to tell lies in God's service, and to disgrace our Master and destroy His sheep as {{involuntary}} Wolves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} heard," [...] said he, bowing, [...] "that if the Lady Gyda {{had been born}} a man, England would have had another all-seeing and all-daring statesman, and Earl Godwin a rival, instead of a helpmate. Now <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> I have heard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I saw her {{the morning}} {{following}} her marriage. I {{do not remember}} what I said, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>what</b> was in my mind. She fainted, and I left her." ...|$|R

60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. [Holding her hand.] Margaret, I thought Mrs. Erlynne {{was a woman}} more sinned against than sinning, as {{the phrase}} goes.

She is bad--as bad as a woman can be.|$|R
6000|$|Israel glanced inquiringly {{upon the}} Squire; then upon his companions; and meeting the expressive, enthusiastic, candid countenance of Horne Tooke--then {{in the first}} honest ardor of his {{political}} career--turned to the Squire, and said, [...] "Sir, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> you have said. Tell me now what I am to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Ursula, 'it isn't. Love is too {{human and}} little.

It isn't so merely HUMAN.' ...|$|E

"Sir Robert," [...] {{she went}} on calmly, [...] "everyone here is, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>what</b> is called a financier, that is except myself and Major Vernon, who only tries to be and will, I am sure, fail, since Nature made him {{something}} else, a soldier and--what else did Nature make you, Alan?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay," [...] cried Bingley, [...] "this is too much, to {{remember}} at night all the foolish {{things that were}} said in the morning.
