5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food {{is estimated to}} be less than 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is <b>dental</b> <b>restoration,</b> from which the uptake of palladium {{is estimated to be}} less than 15µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a <b>dental</b> <b>restoration</b> may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
25|$|Once a lesion has cavitated, {{especially}} if dentin is involved, remineralization {{is much more}} difficult and a <b>dental</b> <b>restoration</b> is usually indicated ("operative treatment"). Before a restoration can be placed, all of the decay must be removed otherwise it will continue to progress underneath the filling. Sometimes a small amount of decay can be left if it is entombed and there is a seal which isolates the bacteria from their substrate. This can be likened to placing a glass container over a candle, which burns itself out once the oxygen is used up. Techniques such as stepwise caries removal are designed to avoid exposure of the dental pulp and overall reduction of the amount of tooth substance which requires removal before the final filling is placed. Often enamel which overlies decayed dentin must also be removed as it is unsupported and susceptible to fracture. The modern decision-making process with regards the activity of the lesion, and whether it is cavitated, is summarized in the table.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>restorations</b> can {{be divided}} into two broad types: direct restorations and {{indirect}} <b>restorations.</b> All <b>dental</b> <b>restorations</b> can be further classified by their location and size.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the influence of patient age, gender, body mass index (BMI), amount of <b>dental</b> <b>restorations,</b> and implants on image quality of cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT). Methods: Fifty CBCT scans of a preretail version of Galileos (Sirona, Germany) were investigated retrospectively by 4 observers regarding image quality of 6 anatomic structures, pathologic findings detection, subjective exposure quality, and artifacts. Patient age, BMI, gender, amount of <b>dental</b> <b>restorations,</b> and implants were recorded and statistically tested for correlations to image quality. Results A negative effect on image quality was found statistically significantly correlated with age and the amount of <b>dental</b> <b>restorations.</b> None of the investigated image features were garbled by any of the investigated influence factors. Conclusions: Age and the amount of <b>dental</b> <b>restorations</b> appear to {{have a negative impact on}} CBCT image quality, whereas gender and BMI do not. Image quality of mental foramen, mandibular canal, and nasal floor are affected negatively by age but not by the amount of <b>dental</b> <b>restorations.</b> Further studies are required to elucidate influence factors on CBCT image quality...|$|R

500|$|Occlusal trauma often {{occurs when}} a newly placed <b>dental</b> <b>restoration</b> is built too [...] "high", concentrating the biting forces on one tooth. Height {{differences}} measuring less than a millimeter can cause pain. Dentists, therefore, routinely check that any new restoration is {{in harmony with the}} bite and forces are distributed correctly over many teeth using articulating paper. If the high spot is quickly eliminated, the pain disappears and there is no permanent harm. Over-tightening of braces can cause periodontal pain and, occasionally, a periodontal abscess.|$|E
500|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, {{fluorescent}} lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. [...] Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for <b>dental</b> <b>restoration</b> in some locales. It is used in fluorescent lighting. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|E

2500|$|Invented in 1955, acid-etching employs dental etchants {{and is used}} {{frequently}} when bonding <b>dental</b> <b>restoration</b> to teeth. [...] This {{is important}} for long-term use of some materials, such as composites and sealants. By dissolving minerals in enamel, etchants remove the outer 10nbsp&micrometers on the enamel surface and make a porous layer 5ndash&50 micrometers deep. [...] This roughens the enamel microscopically and results in a greater surface area on which to bond.|$|E
2500|$|In general, early {{treatment}} is quicker {{and less expensive}} than treatment of extensive decay. Local anesthetics, nitrous oxide ("laughing gas"), or other prescription medications may be required {{in some cases to}} relieve pain during or following treatment or to relieve anxiety during treatment. A dental handpiece ("drill") is used to remove large portions of decayed material from a tooth. [...] A spoon, a dental instrument used to carefully remove decay, is sometimes employed when the decay in dentin reaches near the pulp. Some dentists remove dental caries using a laser rather than the traditional dental drill. A Cochrane review of this technique looked at Er:YAG (erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet), Er,Cr:YSGG (erbium, chromium: yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet) and Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers and found that although people treated with lasers (compared to a conventional dental [...] "drill") experienced less pain and had a lesser need for dental anaesthesia, that overall there was little difference in caries removal. Once the caries is removed, the missing tooth structure requires a <b>dental</b> <b>restoration</b> of some sort to return the tooth to function and aesthetic condition.|$|E
2500|$|Occlusion {{is defined}} most simply as [...] "contacts between teeth", {{and is the}} meeting of teeth during biting and chewing. The term does not imply any disease. Malocclusion is a medical term {{referring}} to less than ideal positioning of the upper teeth relative to the lower teeth, which can occur both when the upper jaw is ideally proportioned to the lower jaw, or {{where there is a}} discrepancy between the size of the upper jaw relative to the lower jaw. Malocclusion of some sort is so common that the concept of an [...] "ideal occlusion" [...] is called into question, and it can be considered [...] "normal to be abnormal". An occlusal interference may refer to a problem which interferes with the normal path of the bite, and is usually used to describe a localized problem with the position or shape of a single tooth or group of teeth. A premature contact is one part of the bite meeting sooner than other parts, meaning {{that the rest of the}} teeth meet later or are held open, e.g., a new <b>dental</b> <b>restoration</b> on a tooth (e.g., a crown) which has a slightly different shape or position to the original tooth may contact too soon in the bite. A deflective contact/interference is an interference with the bite that changes the normal path of the bite. A common example of a deflective interference is an over-erupted upper wisdom tooth, often because the lower wisdom tooth has been removed or is impacted. In this example, when the jaws are brought together, the lower back teeth contact the prominent upper wisdom tooth before the other teeth, and the lower jaw has to move forward to allow the rest of the teeth to meet. The difference between a premature contact and a deflective interference is that the latter implies a dynamic abnormality in the bite.|$|E

40|$|Alumina- and zirconia-based ceramic <b>dental</b> <b>restorations</b> are {{designed}} to repair functionality as well as esthetics of the failed teeth. However, these materials exhibited several performance deficiencies such as fracture, poor esthetic properties of ceramic cores (particularly zirconia cores), and difficulty in accomplishing a strong ceramic–resin-based cement bond. Therefore, improving the mechanical properties of these ceramic materials is of great interest {{in a wide range}} of disciplines. Consequently, spatial gradients in surface composition and structure can improve the mechanical integrity of ceramic <b>dental</b> <b>restorations.</b> Thus, this article reviews the current status of the functionally graded dental prostheses inspired by the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ) structures and the linear gradation in Young's modulus of the DEJ, as a new material design approach, to improve the performance compared to traditional dental prostheses.
