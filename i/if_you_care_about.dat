Although funded directly by the IAAF, the editorial staff has a free rein with the content - which typically combines serious debate with more light-hearted features and pop cultural references.

5000|$|Diana Furchtgott-Roth, {{a senior}} fellow and {{director}} of Economics21, has written extensively in support of tax reform. She argues specifically for {{a reduction in the}} corporate tax rate and a move to a territorial tax system, {{in order to make the}} U.S. more economically competitive on the world stage. In 2015, Roth, together with former fellow Jared Meyer, published the book, Disinherited: How America Is Betraying America's Young, arguing that millennials' plight is the result of government policies that are systematically stacked against young Americans to the benefit of older generations. The book was praised by Elaine Chao: [...] "This is the book you absolutely need to read if you are a millennial or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> one!

At a meeting, when Cluck questioned the Freeh report, Frazier directed a fiery criticism at Cluck and Paterno defenders, saying, [...] "I believe that we are entitled to look at the words and contemporaneous emails and other documents that draw the conclusions that we need to draw as a university.
