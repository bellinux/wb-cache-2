50|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used in the industries today, and hence maintenance of these bearings becomes an important task for the maintenance professionals. The rolling-element bearings wear out easily due to metal-to-metal contact, which creates faults in the outer race, inner race and ball. It {{is also the most}} vulnerable component of a machine because it is often under high load and <b>high</b> <b>running</b> <b>speed</b> conditions. Regular diagnostics of rolling-element bearing faults is critical for industrial safety and operations of the machines along with reducing the maintenance costs or avoiding shutdown time. Among the outer race, inner race and ball, the outer race tends to be more vulnerable to faults and defects.|$|E
50|$|His {{development}} and {{mastery of the}} Petrov/Bubka technical model is also considered a key to his success. (A technical model is a sequence of positions and pressures which describe the method and style form of pole vaulting.) The Petrov/Bubka model is considered superior to many others today, because it allows the vaulter to continuously put energy into the pole while rising towards the bar. Most conventional models focus on creating maximum bend in the pole before leaving the ground, by planting the pole heavily on the landing pad. The Petrov/Bubka model follows the technique used by Kjell Isaksson, which concentrates on driving the pole up, rather than bending it while planting it on the landing pad, combined with <b>high</b> <b>running</b> <b>speed.</b> While the traditional models depended on the recoil by bending the pole, the Petrov/Bubka model may exploit the recoil of the pole and exert more energy on the pole during the swinging action.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Against the {{deficiencies}} of traditional time domain and {{frequency domain analysis}} in detecting wheel-rail (W-R) system hidden risks which wheel flats generate, the time-frequency characteristics of W-R shock caused by wheel flat are analyzed and the vehicle-rail dynamic model with wheel flat is investigated. The 10 degrees of freedom (DOF) vehicle model is built up. 90 -DOF rail model is constructed. The wheel flat excitation model is built up. The vehicle-track coupling dynamic model including wheel flat excitation is set up through nonlinear Hertzian contact theory. The vertical accelerations of axle box are calculated at different speeds and flat sizes based on the vehicle-track coupling dynamic model with wheel flat. Frequency slice wavelet transform (FSWT) is employed to analyze time-frequency characteristics of axle box accelerations to detect the W-R noncontact risks s which the traditional time domain or frequency domain method does not analyze. The {{results show that the}} small flat size and <b>high</b> <b>running</b> <b>speed</b> lead to high frequency W-R impact. Large flat size and <b>high</b> <b>running</b> <b>speed</b> result in momentary loss of W-R contact, and there exist security risks between wheel and rail.

40|$|Journal {{bearings}} {{are commonly}} used in large rotary machineries because they have excellent mechanical and geometric properties as well as large load-carrying capacities. Nevertheless, the oil whirl and oil whip instabilities limit their applications due to their insufficient stiffness at <b>high</b> <b>running</b> <b>speeds.</b> This paper presents a method to increase the stiffness of a rotating machine using an electromagnetic exciter (EE), which can raise the threshold of instability of the rotating machine and eliminate fluid-induced instability. The EE is a controllable auxiliary device that can provide additional stiffness to the bearings to increase the operating ranges of a rotating machine, while the journal bearings act as load-carrying devices. Together, the EE complements the JB to stiffen the rotor system and raise the threshold of instability. A simple control scheme {{is used to calculate}} the amount of supplemental stiffness supplied by the EE. The experimental results demonstrate that the oil whirl and oil whip instabilities of the rotating machine can be eliminated effectively, even at <b>higher</b> <b>running</b> <b>speeds.</b> The advantage of the EE is to offer a faster, more stable method to eliminate fluid-induced instability. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of animal locomotion has fascinated man for centuries. In particular, we {{have sought to}} understand why certain species are able to reach such prodigious <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> (perhaps due to our woeful inadequacy in this area (Bramble & Lieberman, 2004)). Such investigations {{have focused on the}} role that functional anatomy and morphology play in facilitating the attainment of <b>high</b> <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> (Williams, Payne & Wilson, 2007; Hudson et al., 2011). Canis lupus familiaris, or the domestic dog, serves as an excellent model for such investigations due to the great variation in <b>running</b> <b>speeds</b> exhibited across breeds, and there is a dense body of literature that has considered how the anatomy of certain canines has been adapted to the task of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>running.</b> Similarly, a great deal is known about the dog genome, and thus adaptations that are thought to be advantageous in the context of sprinting can be linked to their genetic basis (Mosher et al., 2007). Aerodynamics is one aspect of morphology that is known to be important for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>running</b> (Lull, 1904), yet despite this, the association between a dog’s coat phenotype and the ability to run fast has not been determined.

Within the limitation of the present study, the folowing conclusions were drawn: 1) Group SS was much inferior to the other groups in many tests representing power, agility, balance, coordination, and leg muscular endurance. This group also possessed higher body fat. And scores in such traits as power and agility were significantly higher in FF group than in SF group. 2) Factor analysis showed that physical fitness domain represented by 30 variables would be divided into six factors. While group SS possessed greater body bulk (F 1) than the other groups, it had much inferior ability in power and agility (F 5).
