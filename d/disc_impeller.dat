40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the new approach to dense particulate systems proposed by Jop et al. [1], in the dense regions of a High Shear Granulator (HSG). Wet granulation in high shear mixers is a common process in pharmaceutical technologies and a good understanding of the local mixing and flow patterns are a pre-requisite for this step. In the aforementioned model a dense granular flow is characterized as a visco-plastic fluid. Therefore the local rheology of the system can be predicted assuming averaged and virtual properties and a constant solid volume fraction. A simple <b>disc</b> <b>impeller</b> granulator with glass spheres was chosen for this study. The dynamics of the system have been studied using several techniques including PIV analyses, CFD simulation and image processing. The flow behaviour has been characterized for various impeller speeds and particle loads. Several cases have been analyzed from different aspects both in experiments and through equivalent simulations to evaluate the validity of the model in these particular applications. Results look promising in spite of the simplicity of the model. The model was found to give a good general description of the flow field and bed shape. On the other hand the model is insufficient in some aspects; mostly related to the regions with low volume fraction. The next step would be to combine the model with conventional models on rapid granular flow such as Kinetic Theory of Granular Flows (KTGF) ...|$|E
40|$|High shear {{granulation}} is {{an important}} process {{in a wide variety}} of applications, more specifically in pharmaceutical industries as a basic step in the tableting process. The process includes two major steps: dry high shear granulation and wet high shear granulation. It aims at producing granules with a specific size and material composition. The quality of the process is determined by the flow regime. Therefore, a better understanding of the flow regime is required. Computational simulation of such systems is traditionally performed by tracking each particle and resolving its binary collision and interaction with other particles. This approach is not feasible for industrial granulators with billions of particles. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possibility of applying various continuum modeling options in studying dense or multi-regime granular flows. Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow formulates the dilute parts of the system, whereas there is no strong agreement on any approach to modeling dense granular flows. In this study, a recent model proposed by Jop et al. is applied as an alternative to the model by Schaeffer, traditionally used for such flow regimes. The results show that the present model is not only simple, but also clearly predictive. Besides, considering the simplicity of the model compared to its alternatives (KTGF or DEM), adding more details to develop the model can be performed with fewer obstacles. In order to validate the model proposed in this study, model results are compared with experiments performed in a <b>disc</b> <b>impeller</b> granulator. The experimental results were analyzed using advanced techniques including a high speed camera and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).

40|$|High shear {{granulation}} (HSG) is {{a common}} process in the pharmaceutical industry. A {{better understanding of the}} flow conditions of powders and granulates in large-scale HSG equipment is crucial for constructing predictive models. The staggering amount of particles in the process makes the use of continuum flow models highly attractive. This article discusses the possibilities and problems in using continuum modelling in HSG systems and evaluates some of the available modelling approaches. We examine several dense granular flow models studying both the underlying theory and how they perform in practice. The studied models are the frictional model by Shaeffer [1], modifications to the transport coefficients that describe the solid phase stresses similar to those used in Khain and Meerson [2], and the framework developed by Jop et. al. [3] using a depth-averaged flow model for constant solid volume fraction flows. The model by Shaeffer has previously been used with the conclusion that the solid phase stresses are underestimated [4]. We show theoretically and in practice that this approach is not appropriate due to the strong resolution dependence of the model. The approach taken by Khain and Meerson, among others, to try to modify expressions from rapid granular flow to also be valid in the dense region is attractive from a theoretical point of view. Making use of the rigorous framework of kinetic theory, the applicability of a number of such models to HSG has been evaluated. The modelling framework developed by Jop et. al was used in <b>disc</b> <b>impeller</b> HSG equipment. The results show that the model can well predict the behaviour of the solid-phase viscosity of the dense granular flow. The model is nevertheless restricted to constant volume fraction flows and needs to be expanded to include a varying volume fraction. We conclude in this paper that continuum modelling of HSG has a promising outlook but {{there is a need to}} develop better models for the dense regions of the flow. We also give and evaluate some of the options available for treating these regions...|$|E

40|$|The global poultry {{industry}} generates at least 2 million tonnes of chicken feather every year. Feathers are currently hydrolysed into meal used for animal feed and fertilizer. Feather consists of 91 % keratin, 1 % lipid and 8 % water. Raw feather also contains preen oil, offal, faecal matter and poultry processing water. Its morphology consists of barbs extending {{at an angle}} from a central hollow rachis. Impurities coat the entire feather, and particulates are trapped by layers of barbules and hooked barbicels holding adjacent barbs together. These substructures present an extensive and tortuous hydrophobic surface. Feather fibre is a multipurpose, cost effective reinforcement for polymer composites. Its incorporation in plastic, wood, concrete and cardboard makes the product lighter, insulate from heat loss and improve sound attenuation properties. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a process to produce clean fibre recovered from chicken feather. In the treatment process, the heterogeneous characteristics of feather had to be considered. Raw feather was suspended in 25 L water in a pulper to be decontaminated using 2 stages of 0. 1485 % sodium hypochlorite adjusted to pH 10. 0 with 1 M sodium hydroxide and cleaned in 3 stages of 0. 15 % hydrogen peroxide. The pulper <b>disc</b> <b>impeller</b> agitated the suspension at 10 Hz for 30 minute at each stage. Bacteriological tests confirmed pathogens such as Campylobacter, Salmonella and Enterobacteriaceae were removed during treatment. Off-white clean feathers were more than 10 % whiter than dull yellow raw feather. Cleaned feather was comminuted in 300 L water using a centrifugal pump at a flow rate of 30 Hz on full recycle for 4 hours. Rachis and partially cut feather were removed using a 5 mm aperture filter and fibre was recovered using a 1 mm filter. Wet fibre was dried to constant mass in an air-forced oven at 70 Â°C. Fibre yield was 27 % of feather input, or 54 % of theoretical yield. Surface morphology showed no damage...|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} method for fertilizer spread pattern determination was developed based on predicting where individual fertilizer particles {{land on the}} ground, {{in contrast to the}} traditional method of collecting the particles in bins (ASAE Standard S 341. 2). A small broadcast granular fertilizer spreader (Lowery 300) was equipped with an optical sensor designed to measure the velocity and diameter of individual fertilizer particles shortly after they leave the <b>impeller</b> <b>disc.</b> The measured velocity and diameter of individual particles were input into a ballistic model that predicted where particles land on the ground. A total of over 1000 landing spots revealed the spread pattern.

Optimization of chitinase production by Trichoderma virens was conducted using batch cultures of Trichoderma Minimal Medium (TM medium) that consists of 2. 0 % (w/v) colloidal chitin as substrate. Fermentation was performed at agitation speed of 200 rpm and incubated at 30 ÃÂºC in 250 ml shake flasks. Optimum chitin concentration was obtained at 4. 0 % (w/v). The addition of a stimulant, methanol, at 0. 2 % (v/v) enhances chitinase production by 71. 4 %. Higher concentrations of methanol would inhibit chitinase production. Works for optimizing agitation speed {{was carried out in}} a 2. 0 L batch culture using B. Braun Biostat-B bioreactor. The optimum conditions for chitinase productions were performed in the same bioreactor using <b>disc</b> turbine <b>impellers</b> (diameter of 5. 5 cm) with air flow rate of 1. 0 l/m and agitation speed of 250 rpm resulting in an increased chitinase activity of 0. 447 U/ml compared to 0. 052 U/ml in shake flask fermentation. This improvement of 88. 4 % might be due to efficient mixing and high oxygen transfer rate which is essential for fungal growth. Characterization of crude chitinase was carried out to determine the optimal conditions for the crude chitinase activity to hydrolyze chitin and the crude enzyme stability. The crucial physical factors affecting the optimum and stability of chitinase activity were pH and temperature. pH optimum was achieved at pH 4. 0 in citrate phosphate buffer and chitinase was very stable at pH 3. 0 - 7. 0, with 350 % of residual activity is retained at pH 7. 0. Optimum temperature for chitinase activity was achieved at 50 ÃÂºC while its stability decreases with the increment of temperature.

40|$|In this research, a {{bioreactor}} experimental rig was designed, {{constructed and}} finally commissioned {{in order to}} measure the kLa and kap of oxygen in Newtonian fluid. Distilled water was used as a sample of Newtonian fluid. The design of the rig was based on the standard geometry of a stirred tank reactor. Standard geometrical ratios of a stirred tank reactor with two Rushton <b>disc</b> turbine (RDT) <b>impellers</b> was used to design a system that can provide good mixing for a gas-liquid system. Two sets of RDT impellers were used to disperse the gas sparged by a ring sparger into the liquid content in the tank. The construction of this rig was done {{with the help of the}} Assistant Training Vocational Officer in the engineering workshop. The tank was built using transparent Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) while the two impellers and four equally spaced baffles were constructed using stainless steel. The effect of two variables, namely impeller speed and air flow rate on the volumetric transfer coefficient of oxygen from gas to the bulk liquid, kLa and on the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen from bulk liquid to the oxygen electrode, kap were studied. From the result, the increase in impeller speed and air flow rate will both increase the value of kLa and kap. The values of kLa and kap were predicted by fitting the mass transfer equation of oxygen to the experimental data by using sum of squared error minimization of the difference between the actual and predicted data using MATLAB programming...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 59 - 70 The {{reliability}} of centrifugal compressors {{for the most}} part depends on the reliable operation of impellers. Most of the time, damage to impellers is due to mechanical fatigue. Fatigue damage has been observed in blades, discs, and covers. The damage is due to alternating stress resulting from vibration of structure. Alternating force can excite natural mode(s) of vibration that in turn may result in high alternating stresses. Analysis of a blade by itself, or for that matter a disc or cover by themselves, is easier. However, in reality, the impeller is a system that combines the blade, <b>disc,</b> and cover (<b>impeller</b> with shroud). The dynamic behavior of such a system becomes complex compared to that just for blades or just a disc. Understanding the dynamic behavior is important to rationalize fatigue failures and thus design a reliable impeller. The paper presents: The results of the finite element analysis (FEA) of a simple impeller. These results help in the understanding of the behavior without the complexity of the results, thus paving the way to understand the behavior of similar complex systems. Specifically, it helps to: -	Rationalize the results of the system {{based on the results of}} blade alone and of disc alone. -	Describe a method to create an interference type diagram. -	Explain the results based on the diagram.

40|$|In this work, {{three-dimensional}} phase-resolved Laser-Doppler {{measurements were}} {{performed in a}} standard baffled stirred tank reactor, filled with water and driven by a Rushton turbine at a Reynolds number of 2. 9 - 10 ''. By discrimination between data measured at different angles {{with respect to the}} impeller blades, averaged phase-resolved flow fields were obtained. The three-dimensional set-up facilitated an accurate velocity bias correction scheme and measurement of the full set of Reynolds stresses. Three-dimensional Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA) requires alignment of the six incident laser beams. To achieve accurate alignment a new, high resolution alignment system was developed. It consists of a small mirror, 50 fim in diameter, attached onto a sheet of glass and meets high demands concerning accuracy, time needed for alignment and water resistance. Due to strict demands on data validation, data rates were very low. To compensate for this as much as possible, several tests were carried out to optimize data quantity and quality. Velocity measurements were carried out in a dense grid in a vertical plane midway between two baffles. Velocity vector plots from three planes of view are presented and showed common features of the flow past Rushton impeller blades. The vorticity of the flow field was calculated to find the position of the core of the traihng vortices, which originate at the inner tips of the impeller blades. The Reynolds stress tensor was used to determine the rate of anisotropy of the turbulent flow according to the Lumley triangle. Turbulent flow in the vortex core tends to ID anisotropy.
