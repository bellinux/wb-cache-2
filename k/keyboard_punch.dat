5000|$|Herman Hollerith's first {{device for}} {{punching}} cards from the 1890s was ...any ordinary ticket punch, cutting a round hole 3/16 {{of an inch}} in diameter. Use of such a punch was facilitated by placing the holes to be used near {{the edges of the}} card. Hollerith soon developed a more accurate and simpler to use <b>Keyboard</b> <b>Punch,</b> using a pantograph to link a punch mechanism to a guide pointer that an operator would place over the appropriate mark in a 12 by 20 matrix to line up a manual punch over the correct hole in one of 20 columns. [...] In 1901 Hollerith patented a mechanism where an operator pressed one of 12 keys to punch a hole, with the card automatically advancing to the next column. This first-generation Type 001 keypunch used 45 columns and round holes. In 1923 The Tabulating Machine Company introduced the first electric keypunch, the Type 011 Electric Keypunch, a similar looking device where each key closed an electrical contact that activated a solenoid which punched the hole. The 80 column punched card format was introduced in 1928; existing keypunches and other products could be modified for this new format while keeping the same model numbers. [...] Later Hollerith keypunches included the Type 016 Motor-Driven Electric Duplicating Keypunch (1929), the Type 31 Alphabetical Duplicating Punch (1933), and the Type 32 Alphabetical Printing Punch (1933).|$|E
40|$|In principal, the {{computer}} only recognizes numbers as {{the representation of}} a character. Therefore, there are many encoding systems to allocate these numbers although not all characters are covered. In Europe, every single language even needs more than one encoding system. Hence, a new encoding system known as Unicode has been established to overcome this problem. Unicode provides unique id for each different characters which {{does not depend on}} platform, program, and language. Unicode standard has been applied in a number of industries, such as Apple, HP, IBM, JustSystem, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Sun, Sybase, and Unisys. In addition, language standards and modern information exchanges such as XML, Java, ECMA Script (JavaScript), LDAP, CORBA 3. 0, and WML make use of Unicode as an official tool for implementing ISO/IEC 10646. There are four things to do according to Balinese script: the algorithm of transliteration, searching, sorting, and word boundary analysis (spell checking). To verify the truth of algorithm, some applications are made. These applications can run on Linux/Windows OS platform using J 2 SDK 1. 5 and J 2 ME WTK 2 library. The input and output of the algorithm/application are character sequence that is obtained from <b>keyboard</b> <b>punch</b> and external file. This research produces a module or a library which is able to process the Balinese text based on Unicode standard. The output of this research is the ability, skill, and mastering of 1. Unicode standard (21 -bit) as a substitution to ASCII (7 -bit) and ISO 8859 - 1 (8 -bit) as the former default character set in many applications. 2. The Balinese Unicode text processing algorithm. 3. An experience of working with and learning from an international team that consists of the foremost experts in the area: Michael Everson (Ireland), Peter Constable (Microsoft US), I Made Suatjana, and Ida Bagus Adi Sudewa...|$|E

5000|$|The 2250 {{was housed}} in a desk with an {{alphanumeric}} (QWERTY) keyboard and a separate programmed function keyboard which had keys, indicator lights and switches. A plastic overlay label could be placed over the function <b>keyboard.</b> <b>Punches</b> on {{the top edge of}} the overlay could be sensed by the computer so the keys, lights and switches could be reprogrammed simply by changing overlays. The 2250s CRT measured 21" [...] diagonal, but the useful display area was 12 inch by 12 inch. A light pen was provided as a pointing device, serving the function of the modern computer mouse.|$|R

25|$|The Z3 computer, {{invented by}} Konrad Zuse (1941) in Germany, was a digital and {{programmable}} computer. A digital computer uses electricity as the calculating component. The Z3 contained 2,400 relays {{to create the}} circuits. The circuits provided a binary, floating-point, nine-instruction computer. Programming the Z3 was through a specially designed <b>keyboard</b> and <b>punched</b> tape.|$|R
5000|$|... an operator’s {{teleprinter}} device (with a slow {{paper tape}} punch built-in) permitting programs to display {{information to the}} operator, and the operator to use the <b>keyboard</b> to <b>punch</b> up short program or data items on paper-tape. This teleprinter {{could not be used}} to input data directly to the computer, all operator commands had to be input through the operator’s console.|$|R
2500|$|Before the {{computer}} mass storage era, most RTTY stations stored text on paper tape using paper tape punchers and readers. The operator would type the {{message on the}} TTY <b>keyboard</b> and <b>punch</b> the code onto the tape. The tape could then be transmitted at a steady, high rate, without typing errors. A tape could be reused, {{and in some cases}} - especially for use with ASCII on NC Machines - [...] might be made of plastic or even very thin metal material in order to be reused many times.|$|R

As it exits the machine, the tape passes under a triangular lip that allows the tape to be easily torn by lifting against the sharp edge of the lip.|$|R
5000|$|This font is an {{exception}} to the rule: it has character of different widths, [...] "unit values". Therefore, a special wedge was needed to cast it. The keyboard also needed additional equipment: the key bars, a kind of mechanical arrangement to translate the keystrokes on the <b>keyboard</b> into the <b>punches</b> in the ribbon. For the print shop it was a very expensive font to purchase.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{development}} of disk files, text editors and terminals, programs were most often entered on a keypunch <b>keyboard</b> onto 80-column <b>punched</b> cards, one line to a card. The resulting deck of cards would be fed into a card reader to be compiled. Punched-card codes included no lower-case letters or many special characters, and special versions of the IBM 026 keypunch were offered that would correctly print the repurposed special characters used in Fortran.|$|R
25|$|This gallery holds {{machinery}} {{from the}} last of the hot metal typesetting printshops as used in the newspaper industry. The monotype <b>keyboard</b> produces <b>punched</b> 31-level tape for casting on the monotype caster. The keyboard comprises seven QWERTY arrangements (Roman upper and lower case, bold upper and lower case, italic upper and lower case and SMALL CAPITALS). It is operated by compressed air and produces a wide paper tape that contains perforations that when transferred to the caster give full instructions for each character to be cast. The monotype system was widely used in the commercial printing sector. There is a forme (text lines produced on a Linotype typesetting machine) made up into {{the front page of the}} last edition of the Yorkshire Sports, 2 May 1981. The assembled forme is ready to be moulded and cast into a curved printing plate.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 28 was {{a machine that}} would run at 100 words-per-minute with less maintenance than that required by a contemporary teletypewriter running at 60 words-per-minute. Additional design criteria included the requirements to run quieter and be lighter than previous teleprinters. The Model 28 equipment was also designed to successfully operate in {{a wider range of}} temperatures and operate in moving vehicles. [...] The Model 28 equipment adjustments are made by turning screws and not by bending metal bars and levers as is done in the later Model 32 and Model 33 series of teleprinters. The Model 28 printing unit frame is lighter due to the use of stamped sheet metal instead of cast iron. The Model 28 ASR allowed the user to operate the <b>keyboard</b> to <b>punch</b> tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing an incoming message.|$|R
50|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 33 was {{a machine that}} would fit into a small office space, match with other office equipment {{of the time and}} operate up to two hours per day on average. Since this machine was designed for light duty use, adjustments that Teletype made in previous teleprinters by turning screws were made by bending metal bars and levers. Many Model 33 parts were not heat treated and hardened. However, the base was die cast, but self-tapping screws were used, along with parts that snapped together without bolting. In another cost saving measure, the paper tape equipment was dependent on the keyboard and page printer mechanisms. Earlier Teletype machine designs, such as the Model 28 ASR, allowed the user to operate the <b>keyboard</b> to <b>punch</b> tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing something else. Independent use of the paper tape punch and reader is not possible with the Model 33 ASR.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. {{military}} {{had their own}} system of identifying the various models, often identifying various improvements, included options / features, etc. The TT-47/UG was the first Model 28 KSR, and while Teletypes designation for the basic machine remained the same over the next 20+ years, the TT-47/UG took on suffixes to identify the specific version. The last TT-47/UG was the TT-47L/UG. The U.S. Navy also assigned some [...] "set" [...] designations using the standard Army/Navy system, such as the AN/UGC-5, a Teletype Model 28 ASR which has a <b>keyboard,</b> printer, tape <b>punch</b> and reader facilities all in one cabinet.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{story about}} the birth, growth and life of Processing Modflow. It was 1987 in Southern Germany when I {{encountered}} my first groundwater model {{as a member of a}} team headed by Wolfgang Kinzelbach at the University of Stuttgart. The model was based on a two dimensional finite element code FINEM[67] for simulating transient flow and transport with approximately 3500 nodes. Although the team had access to supercomputers, it took a significantly long time to construct the model by drafting the model mesh over a map and by keying in the model data column-by-column and row-by-row. Back in those days we were lucky to have access to networked main-frame computers with monitors and <b>keyboards</b> instead of <b>punch</b> cards or paper tapes. However, it was frustrating for me to see brilliant colleagues (including Thomas Franz, who co-authored Visual Modflow in 1995) sitting in front of a monitor typing number after number until midnight. It happened so often that we nicknamed our IBM computers: Immer Bis Mitternacht, which means Always Till Midnight. Bearing that experience in mind and with the encouragement of Wolfgang, I started coding my first graphical user interface FEMNET for support of data inpu...|$|R
40|$|The switch can be {{seen not}} only as the primary {{interface}} with digital technology but also {{as part of its}} essential make up. In the form of an electronic transistor, the switch provides the irreducible building block for the modern computer. In the form of a mechanical object it takes converting a physical action into a definite digital instruction. SPDT (single pole double throw) draws its inspiration from early computing where these two aspects were closely linked. Before computer <b>keyboards</b> or even <b>punch</b> cards, programmers would enter their code into the machines line by line through vast arrays of switches. This action, the flicking of a switch, spoke directly to the computer in its own binary language: on and off, ones and zeros; an intimate dialogue with no translation needed. In SPDT there is no computer as such, only the switches. Each switch responds to a physical action. Flick down and it illuminates, flick up and it goes dark. Here the viewer is the programmer and the code is on the wall. -Heat Exchanger focuses on the viewer’s presence as an active role in implicating engagement -Dimmer presents a closed circuit where the illumination is the viewer’s movement. Action and reaction are both intimately linked and inseparable...|$|R
5000|$|Although he wove himself {{seamlessly}} {{among some}} of the most notable jazz legends of the 20th century, he was perhaps best known for his collaboration and stormy relationship with bassist and composer, Charles Mingus.Knepper was twice {{on the receiving end of}} Mingus' legendary temper. Once, while onstage at a memorial concert in Philadelphia, Mingus reportedly attempted to crush his pianist's hands (Toshiko Akiyoshi) with the instrument's <b>keyboard</b> cover, then <b>punched</b> Knepper. Later, Mingus reportedly punched Knepper in the mouth while the two men were working together at Mingus's apartment on a score for Epitaph, at what became his disastrous concert at New York Town Hall, on October 12, 1962. The blow broke one of Knepper's teeth, ruined his embouchure and resulted in the loss of the top octave of his range on the trombone for almost two years. This attack ended their working relationship and Knepper was unable to perform at the concert. Charged with assault, Mingus appeared in court in January 1963 and was given a suspended sentence. According to his daughter, Robin, Mingus also later mailed heroin to Knepper's home, and made an anonymous phone call to the police. A little girl, she remembers the police questioning her father after the mailman delivered the package. [...] Nevertheless, in the 1970s, the two eventually reconciled enough to play together in concert and on at least one of Mingus' last albums. Following Mingus' death, and the death of the first Mingus Dynasty bandleader, drummer Dannie Richmond, he led the Mingus Dynasty Orchestra, and toured the Middle East and Europe.|$|R
