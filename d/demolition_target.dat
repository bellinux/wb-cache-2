40|$|Long-term {{population}} loss {{is recognized}} as a major challenge in older industrial cities throughout the Rust Belt, marked by widespread vacant and abandoned properties. Policies and programs at every conceivable level are attempting to address how to 2 ̆ 2 rightsize 2 ̆ 2 cities: how to transform them into physically smaller places with a higher quality of life. Yet historic preservation is rarely included. This thesis asserts that preservation can contribute an essential perspective to reshaping cities by helping articulate their unique identity—an integral part of cities 2 ̆ 7 efforts to redefine themselves for brighter futures, retain population, {{improve the quality of}} life, and attract new businesses and residents. It attempts to articulate a role for the field in rightsizing by outlining its absence in the literature review, recognizing programs in other fields that build on existing resources, and recommending an approach to reshaping cities that explicitly draws on preservation. The thesis explores how city planners, preservationists, and community development organizations in seven older industrial cities are using preservation to inform strategic <b>demolition,</b> <b>targeted</b> reinvestment, and broad planning efforts. Case studies include code enforcement in Cincinnati, investment in stable neighborhoods in Cleveland, homeownership programs in Detroit, land banking in Flint/Genesee County and Cuyahoga County, historic resource surveys in Philadelphia, preservation advocacy in Saginaw, and proactive municipally-led preservation in Syracuse. Finally, the thesis proposes an expanded role for preservation in making all cities stronger, more viable places to live and work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether house demolitions are {{an effective}} counterterrorism tactic against suicide terrorism. We link original longitudinal micro-level data on houses demolished by the Israeli Defense Forces with {{data on the}} universe of suicide attacks against Israeli targets. By exploiting spatial and time variation in house demolitions and suicide terror attacks during the second Palestinian uprising, we show that punitive house <b>demolitions</b> (those <b>targeting</b> Palestinian suicide terrorists and terror operatives) cause an immediate, significant {{decrease in the number}} of suicide attacks. The effect dissipates over time and by geographic distance. In contrast, we observe that precautionary house demolitions (demolitions justified by the location of the house but not related to the identity or any action of the house’s owner) cause a significant increase in the number of suicide terror attacks. The results are consistent with the view that selective violence is an effective tool to combat terrorist groups, whereas indiscriminate violence backfires. ...|$|R

During the elimination tag team match at the 1988 Survivor Series, Mr. Fuji attacked Demolition and joined forces with the Powers of Pain. A double turn took place as Demolition turned face while the Powers of Pain turned heel.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of {{refurbishment}} projects, providing a safety and health checklist can assist in reducing noncompliance with health and safety regulations and would lead to communication improvement between different participants in refurbishment projects. The practical checklist is developed by revising current demolition checklist {{as there is no}} specific checklist applicable for refurbishment work at the moment. To achieve this <b>target,</b> <b>demolition</b> techniques, methods and accident reports on the refurbishment project is critically reviewed and investigated. A semi-structured interview based on reviewed literature and existing demolition checklist is organized which addresses a panel of Malaysian refurbishment experts and workers. The final results are provided by analyzing the response of interviewees in listing the common hazards occurring in the site and their recommendations regarding to appropriate precautions to prevent accidents in work site. Finally, refurbishment checklist is developed based on different categories of work phase, activities, precautionary actions and recommendations in which contents directly extracted from data collection and literature review...|$|R

40|$|From the <b>targeted</b> <b>demolition</b> of Mostar&# 039;s Stari-Most Bridge in 1993 to the {{physical}} and social havoc caused by the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, the history of cities {{is a history of}} destruction and reconstruction. What is the capacity for the design profession to assist in {{the physical}} and social rebuilding of cities and communities destroyed by war? This paper will examine the multiple roles of design professionals (which here includes architects, planners, urban designers and landscape architects) in the rebuilding of a range of cities decimated by armed conflict. By working &# 039;sans frontiers&# 039;, I suggest that architects and design professionals have a significant opportunity to assist peace-making and reconstruction efforts in the period immediately after conflict or disaster, when much of the housing, hospital, educational, transport, civic and business infrastructure has been destroyed. The aim of my exploration is to expand the traditional role of the architect from &# 039;hero&# 039; to &# 039;social reformer&# 039; and discuss how design practitioners and design educators can stretch their wings to encompass the proliferating agendas and sites of uncivil unrest...|$|R
40|$|Refurbishment is any upgrade, alteration, {{modification}} in {{the current}} status of the building to improve performance and efficiency of the structure. Refurbishment projects involve structural alteration, retention and partial demolition which merely coincide with different risks. The importance of considering safety issues and developing management strategies applicable for refurbishment practice arise as a result of increase in the total number of the refurbishment projects and growth of the fatality rate caused by refurbishment work. Increase in the number of accidents may affect project team in many aspects. Financial losses and delay in the completion of work are the typical consequences caused by refurbishment activities. On the critical cases, the public image of the contractors, clients, and management team as general, will be damaged. Therefore, providing a safety and health check list may assist to reduce incompliance with health and safety regulations and to improve communication flow in refurbishment projects. Further, this check list may be used as a basis for the health and safety trainings for the workers. To achieve this <b>target,</b> <b>demolition</b> techniques, methods and accident reports on the refurbishment project has been identified and reviewed. Next, a semi-structured interviewed was conducted to provide a list of common hazards occurring in the site and appropriate precautions that can be applied in the project to prevent accidents in working place. The obtained result was organized in a check list of activities, preventive actions and recommendations...|$|R
30|$|Our data {{collection}} procedure is as follows: (1) {{we used the}} keyword “demolition” to conduct a full-text search on “Chinese Core Newspapers Full-Text Data Base” from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (www.cnki.net) and retrieved 13, 024 news reports; (2) we read through all the reports and filtered out cases which had been reported by at least two media outlets {{to be included in}} our dataset; (3) considering that a few protests were primarily exposed through the internet and had significant impacts on Chinese society but failed to receive mainstream media coverage, we synthesized information about these cases via mainstream web portals such as Sina.com.cn to supplement our database. All selected cases have the following features: the selected protests were caused by land acquisition for a public project or commercial development and the core demand was <b>demolition</b> compensation; the <b>targets</b> of the protests were governments or developers; there were antagonistic relations between anti-demolition protestors and their opponents because solving the disputes would alter both sides’ interests; and every selected protest involved more than two people. The coding of our cases was based on reading through relevant media reports and reviewing the second-hand literature and documents such as documented interview records, court pleadings (and rulings), banner slogans, pictures, open letters, texts from blogs/microblogs, and academic articles. Depending on information availability, the number of available documents for most cases ranged from ten to dozens, and the number for a few cases even reached hundreds. Our {{data collection}} process lasted more than 6  months, during which time we triangulated the information. Therefore, our data is both credible and valid.|$|R
