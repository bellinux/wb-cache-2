5|$|Fishing Creek drains most of Columbia County {{north of}} the Susquehanna River except for an area {{in the eastern part}} of the county, which is drained by Briar Creek. It also drains {{southern}} Sullivan County and western Luzerne County. Minor tributaries drain small portions of Montour County and southeastern Lycoming County. The upper part of the watershed is 85 percent forest and 13 percent farmland. Near its source, the other two percent is residential; closer to Benton, the remainder is urban. The creek's <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> consists of a number of sub-watersheds. The largest ones are the Huntington Creek watershed, with an area of 114 square miles; the Little Fishing Creek watershed, with an area of 68.1 square miles; the Green Creek <b>drainage</b> <b>basin,</b> with an area of 36.9 square miles; and the West Branch Fishing Creek <b>drainage</b> <b>basin,</b> with an area of 32.9 square miles.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. According to the {{division}} into subareas of water-resource distribution in China, {{and based on}} the Glacier Inventory of China (GIC), China’s total glacier water storage is 5040. 2 � 10 9 m 3, 33. 0 % of which is distributed in the southwest <b>drainage</b> <b>basins</b> and 64. 1 % in the northwest inland <b>drainage</b> <b>basins,</b> forming enormous solid reservoirs with plentiful freshwater storage. Glacier change in China is estimated for the periods from the Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum to about 1960 and from 1960 to 1995. The relative glacierized area loss is 23 % and 8. 9 % respectively for maritime glaciers and 15 % and 4. 9 % respectively for continental glaciers. The normal annual glacier meltwater runoff is estimated at 60 465 � 10 6 m 3 by the climate parameter temperature-index method, 38. 7 % of which is distributed in the northwest inland <b>drainage</b> <b>basins,</b> and at 61 574 � 10 6 m 3 by the glacier system temperature-index method, 41. 5 % of which is distributed in the northwest inland <b>drainage</b> <b>basins.</b> Simulation of glacier meltwater runoff under the temperature change ratio of 0. 03 K a – 1 by the glacier system model in west China between 1980 and 2000 indicates that the total glacier meltwater runoff increment is 10. 8 % overall, 14. 3 % in the inland <b>drainage</b> <b>basins</b> of northwest China and 9. 0 % in the outflow <b>drainage</b> <b>basins</b> of southwest China. 1...|$|R
5|$|Most of the Columbia's <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> (which, at , {{is about}} the size of France) lies roughly between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade Mountains on the west. In the United States and Canada the term {{watershed}} is often used to mean <b>drainage</b> <b>basin.</b> The term Columbia Basin is used to refer not only to the entire <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> but also to subsets of the river's full watershed, such as the relatively flat and unforested area in eastern Washington bounded by the Cascades, the Rocky Mountains, and the Blue Mountains. Within the watershed are diverse landforms including mountains, arid plateaus, river valleys, rolling uplands, and deep gorges. Grand Teton National Park lies in the watershed, as well as parts of Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and North Cascades National Park. Canadian National Parks in the watershed include Kootenay National Park, Yoho National Park, Glacier National Park, and Mount Revelstoke National Park. Hells Canyon, the deepest gorge in North America, and the Columbia Gorge are in the watershed. Vegetation varies widely, ranging from western hemlock and western redcedar in the moist regions to sagebrush in the arid regions. The watershed provides habitat for 609known fish and wildlife species, including the bull trout, bald eagle, gray wolf, grizzly bear, and Canada lynx.|$|E

5|$|The <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> of Nanticoke Creek is {{designated}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.

5|$|The <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> of Spring Brook is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters downstream to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476).

Wild trout naturally reproduce in Spring Brook from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. A 2.4-mile (4-kilometer) section of the stream from the Watres Dam downstream to the Nesbitt Reservoir is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout. The tributaries Green Run and Panther Creek are Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout {{and part of the}} tributary Rattlesnake Creek is Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout.|$|E
