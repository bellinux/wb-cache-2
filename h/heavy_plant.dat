25|$|Where the Tongue River now {{flows in}} Montana and Wyoming, the {{sedimentary}} rock formation that is today {{known as the}} Tongue River sandstone began to form about 60 million years ago, when mountain uplifts began rising from a shallow sea. The Black Hills uplift on the east, the Hartville uplift on the southeast, and the Big Horn Block on the west created a flat, swampy low lying plain, with slow moving rivers flowing northwest to deltas along a shallow sea. At this time the climate in the area was subtropical, averaging about 120inches (3,000mm) of rainfall a year. For some 25 million years, the floor of this plain {{was made up of}} thick deposits of sandy silt from the surrounding mountains, with many rivers, deltas, backwaters and swamps, all covered by forests and vegetation. At that time, from 35 to 60 million years ago, the area where the Tongue River now flows would have appeared as a dense swampy jungle. Over long periods of time, the <b>heavy</b> <b>plant</b> growth died and accumulated as peaty layers in the large backwaters and swamps all across the basin. Periodically more sandy silt deposits would wash in from the mountains, completely burying the layers of organic peaty materials. Eventually the climate became drier and cooler. The area passed through more long periods of geologic time, during which new sedimentary layers buried this entire sandy silty layer along with its deposits of peat, under thousands of feet of newer sediments, compressing the sandy silty deposits into the Tongue River sandstone of today, and also compressing and changing the layers of peaty organic material into thinner layers of lignite coal. Over the last several million years, much of the overlying sediment has eroded away, bringing the sandstone layer with its seams of coal to the surface again in the Tongue River area.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1946, on {{the orders}} of Manny Shinwell (the then Labour Party's Minister of Fuel and Power) a [...] "column of lorries and <b>heavy</b> <b>plant</b> machinery" [...] arrived at Wentworth. The {{objective}} was the mining of {{a large part of}} the estate close to the house for coal. This was an area where the prolific Barnsley seam was within [...] of the surface and the area between the house and the Rockingham Mausoleum became the largest open cast mining site in Britain at that time: 132,000 tons of coal were removed solely from the gardens. Ostensibly the coal was desperately needed in Britain's austere post-war economy to fuel the railways, but the decision has been widely seen as useful cover for an act of class-war spite against the coal-owning aristocracy. A survey by Sheffield University, commissioned by Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, the 8th Earl, found the coal to be [...] "very poor stuff" [...] and [...] "not worth the getting"; this contrasted with Shinwell's assertion that it was [...] "exceptionally good-quality." ...|$|E

Water use, based on soil moisture depletion, {{was the lowest}} under the light, and the highest under the <b>heavy</b> <b>planting</b> densities of both cultivars. Water use efficiency of medium and <b>heavy</b> <b>planting</b> densities were greater than the light planting densities in both cultivars. The canopy radiation extinction coefficients of both cultivars increased with increases in planting density. Efficiency of operation interception of photosynthetically active radiation by both cultivars improved {{from the time of}} jointing until anthesis, and then decreased during senescence. The efficiency of the conversion of intercepted radiation to dry matter (biochemical efficiency) decreased throughout the growing season both cultivars. The interception, biochemical, and photosynthetic efficiencies improved as planting density increased...|$|R
