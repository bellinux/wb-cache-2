Wright was highly regarded by the public at this point, and his changes brought enhanced status to the building, making the Rookery {{one of the most}} sought after buildings of Chicago.

Butler left Scunthorpe in June 2008, turning down a new three-year contract offer, so he could move to a club {{that would be more}} suitable for his family needs. In six years with the club, Butler made a total of 153 appearances scoring 13 times, playing for them in all three divisions of The Football League.|$|R
50|$|The A.F. Cappelli Block is a {{historic}} mixed-use commercial and residential building at 263 Atwells Avenue, facing DePasquale Plaza in the Federal Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island.

It is faced in red brick, with tan bricks at the corners giving it a quoined appearance. The store fronts feature original cast <b>iron</b> <b>finishes.</b> It was built in 1909 by Antonio Cappelli, and was (then as now) one of the tallest buildings in the Federal Hill area.|$|R

50|$|On 2 July 1888 the Kilsyth and Bonnybridge railway opened. It was {{intended}} mainly for the <b>iron</b> ore and <b>finished</b> <b>iron</b> products of Bairds' plant at Kilsyth, and the NBR was grudging about {{the potential of the}} line for other purposes. It was in effect an extension of the Kelvin Valley Railway at Kilsyth, although the Caledonian Railway exploited it connection at the eastern end, which connected through to Larbert.|$|R
50|$|In February 1997, {{following}} {{the end of}} Mick Buxton's second spell in charge of Scunthorpe United, Brian Laws, one of Buxton's signings to the club as a player, was appointed manager, with Mark Lillis (another Buxton signing) as his assistant. In 1997-98, his first full season in charge, the <b>Iron</b> <b>finished</b> one point outside the play-offs. The following season, the club finished fourth in Division Three. This ensured qualification to the play-offs, which they won after a 3-2 aggregate win in the semi-finals over Swansea City and a 1-0 win over Leyton Orient in the final at Wembley with an early goal from Alex Calvo-Garcia. They were unable to maintain their Division Two status the following season however, and were relegated after finishing in 23rd place.|$|R
50|$|The Iron {{were unable}} to cement {{a place in the}} Third Division, and relegation back to the Fourth Division {{followed}} immediately in 1973. At the same time Ron Ashman departed to manage local rivals Grimsby Town, only to return during 1976. The period between his two tenures saw several management changes and a disastrous league campaign which saw the <b>Iron</b> <b>finish</b> rock bottom of the Football League in 1975. The next five years saw United stagnate in the bottom-half of Division Four, with the club finishing second-bottom {{at the end of the}} 1981-82 campaign. Promotion to Division Three was achieved under the guidance of manager John Duncan in 1983, but immediate relegation was to follow under his successor Allan Clarke in 1984, with United then entering a further period of stagnation in the middle of the Fourth DIvision table.|$|R

50|$|After {{moving on}} to Auburn in 2004, David again injured his knee in {{pre-season}} practice and did not play in the Tigers' undefeated season. He was able to return and start in eleven games in 2005 and {{was named to the}} AP All-SEC Second-Team with 48 tackles (36 solo, 12 assists) and 11 pass break-ups. Due to his knee injuries, Irons applied for and was granted an additional year of eligibility by the NCAA. He had already graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, but began coursework towards a master's degree in the fall semester of 2006 to maintain his eligibility. Prior to the 2006 season, David was named to the Coaches All-SEC First Team and the Jim Thorpe Award Preseason Watch List. <b>Irons</b> <b>finished</b> the regular season with 39 tackles (22 solo, 17 assists), 11 pass break-ups and two interceptions and was named to the Coaches All-SEC Second Team.|$|R

50|$|Although Robins {{had saved}} the club from relegation during the 2014-15 season, the club's {{performances}} {{during the first}} half of the 2015-16 season were viewed as disappointing and inconsistent by many. On 18 January 2016, Robins was sacked after a 5-0 away defeat to Blackpool. Nick Daws and Andy Dawson were placed in temporary charge of the club, with their first game (a 3-0 home win over Colchester United) coming on 23 January. A spell of positive results followed, and on 22 February it was announced that Nick Daws had been installed as the Iron's manager until the end of the season, with Dawson being appointed his assistant. Just over a month later however, Graham Alexander was appointed as the club's new manager in a shock announcement on 22 March 2016. Alexander's first game in charge was a 0-0 draw away to Barnsley on 25 March, followed by an emphatic 6-0 home victory over Swindon Town a week later. Alexander's appointment continued the revival of Scunthorpe's season which had originated with Robins' departure. The club were to mount a late charge towards the League One play-off positions, only narrowly missing out to Barnsley on goal difference alone. The <b>Iron</b> <b>finished</b> the season in seventh place with 74 points, 5 points clear of eighth-placed Coventry City.|$|R
50|$|Shipton's {{operation}} as {{a carrier}} of anything, but specialising in <b>finished</b> <b>iron</b> products, grew through several acquisitions {{until it was}} taken over by the North Staffordshire Railway in 1847.

50|$|In American Colonial history, the Iron Act, {{passed in}} 1750, {{was part of}} the British {{legislation}} designed to encourage the production of raw materials (including pig iron) in colonial America, but to restrict their manufacture there into <b>finished</b> <b>iron</b> goods. Existing manufacturing works could continue, but new ones for certain processes were prohibited.|$|R

These supplied iron from manufacture into <b>finished</b> <b>iron</b> goods mainly in the Black Country. Charcoal burning continued into the 20th century.|$|R

50|$|In 1846 the North British Railway {{opened its}} first line, between Edinburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. It saw {{itself as a}} trunk line, joining with English {{railways}} to form a through route to London. Subsequent acquisitions and openings emphasised the easterly orientation, until on 1 August 1865 the NBR amalgamated with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, so that it now had a Glasgow terminal, at Queen Street. The Monkland Railways had been absorbed by the E&GR the previous day, so now the NBR had a presence at Coatbridge as well. The amalgamations gave the NBR excellent connectivity eastwards from Coatbridge, but the awkward route towards Glasgow remained; this was important because much <b>iron</b> ore and <b>finished</b> <b>iron</b> was exported from quays in Glasgow, and from Ayrshire ports. Moreover, {{the best of the}} Monklands coal and iron deposits had been worked out; the emphasis on the mineral extraction was shifting to south Lanarkshire, in Caledonian Railway territory.|$|R
