Her career choice was met with controversy in the Middle East, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> video in which she performed sexual acts while wearing the Islamic hijab. She was nevertheless disillusioned with the pornographic industry and left it after three months.|$|E

It consists of a Stone of Remembrance flanked by tall twin obelisks, each adorned {{with a pair of}} painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a Stone of Remembrance, and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it particularly significant among his works.|$|E

In 1979 Honiara was still a relatively small town in terms of population, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> capital city, with 18,346 people, of which 10,870 were men, and 7,476 were women. In July 1978, Honiara became the new capital of the independent Solomon Islands.|$|E

5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews.

5|$|Alonso quickly progressed {{through the}} youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad (winning the regionalised fourth tier in his single {{season with the}} latter) and {{impressed}} enough to earn a first team debut {{at the age of}} 18. He made his first senior appearance against Logroñés in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match. Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, Javier Clemente sent him to Segunda División team Eibar to gain experience. Alonso's father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player. A quick turnover of managers, however, including a two-month period with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in a dire situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and its new manager, John Toshack, turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team's fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made the 20-year-old the team captain, a position traditionally held by more senior players. By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place. Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> player from the youth team.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 2001 season, star {{free agent}} shortstop Alex Rodriguez, {{was signed by}} the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in {{baseball}} history: a 10-year, $252 million contract.

25|$|In October 2009, {{the bridge}} option again {{surfaced}} in the public eye, {{with a group of}} backers again suggesting that a bridge would be a better option from an urban design, and even from a transport point of view. Critics noted that the proposal would delay other transport plans in the region due to the funding required for it, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 2015 target. The then mayor of North Shore City, Andrew Williams, and the then Chairman of the Auckland Regional Council, Mike Lee, both opposed the reconsideration of existing decisions that had been in favour of a tunnel. The then mayor of Auckland City, John Banks, also favoured the tunnel option, though he did not outright oppose the bridge idea, while the then mayor of Manukau City, Len Brown, considered the bridge proposal worthy of consideration.|$|E
25|$|Going {{home for}} rural {{healthcare}} in China is not ideal either. Over the past 30 years, {{that part of}} the health system has run down because government funding has fallen while everything else has become more expensive. Health facilities attempted to make up shortfalls by charging ever larger fees for diagnosis and treatment, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> difficult disease like tuberculosis. In China today, patients' payments keep the health services running and the medical staff have been encouraged to supply profitable health goods and services, especially drugs. Their own jobs depend on adequate operational funds, which are largely generated through user fees. Meanwhile, over the same 30 years, the socialist system of universal rural health-insurance collapsed and was not replaced apart from some pilot tests of an under-resourced community-based scheme in the 1990s. Until recently, virtually all rural residents, 900 million in all, had no health insurance at all. This situation will change if the current experiments with community-based health-insurance succeed and are then adopted nationally, but in the meantime as many as 10% of rural households have catastrophic medical payments (exceeding 40% of their disposable income) every year.|$|E
