60|$|The real {{mistake of}} the Moslems is {{something}} much more modern in its application than any particular or passing persecution of Christians as such. It lay in {{the very fact that}} they did think they had a simpler and saner sort of Christianity, as do many modern Christians. They thought it could be made universal merely by being made uninteresting. Now a man preaching what he thinks is a platitude is far more intolerant than a man preaching what he admits is a paradox. It was exactly because it seemed self-evident, to Moslems as to Bolshevists, that their simple creed was suited to everybody, that they wished in that particular sweeping fashion to impose it on everybody. It was because Islam was broad that Moslems were narrow. And because it was not a hard religion it was a <b>heavy</b> <b>rule.</b> Because it was without a self-correcting complexity, it allowed of those simple and masculine but mostly rather dangerous appetites that show themselves in a chieftain or a lord. As it had the simplest sort of religion, monotheism, so it had the simplest sort of government, monarchy. There was exactly the same direct spirit in its despotism as in its deism. The Code, the Common Law, the give and take of charters and chivalric vows, did not grow in that golden desert. The great sun was in the sky and the great Saladin was in his tent, and he must be obeyed unless he were assassinated. Those who complain of our creeds as elaborate often forget that the elaborate Western creeds have produced the elaborate Western constitutions; and that they are elaborate because they are emancipated. And the real moral of the relations of the two great religions is {{something much more}} subtle and sincere than any mere atrocity tales against Turks. It {{is the same as the}} moral of the Christian refusal of a Pagan Pantheon in which Christ should rank with Ammon and Apollo. Twice the Christian Church refused what seemed like a handsome offer of a large latitudinarian sort; once to include Christ as a god and once to include him as a prophet; once by the admission of all idols and once by the abandonment of all idols. Twice the Church took the risk and twice the Church survived alone and succeeded alone, filling the world with her own children; and leaving her rivals in a desert, where the idols were dead and the iconoclasts were dying.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{different}} forms of exclusion specifically related to the mobility of children in Japan by examining the role of their parents as gatekeepers and existing systems of protection and control as producers, regulators and organizers of their mobilities. Article I examines the everyday feelings of exclusion experienced by immigrant parents of preschool aged children in public park playgrounds in Tokyo. These parental feelings of exclusion arose from unsuccessful encounters between children, {{in part due to}} visible bodily differences. The article argues that this sense of exclusion is socially problematic as immigrant parents turn away from local public space mobilities towards virtual mobilities in online play dates with their countries of origin, and focus more on private home centered play through a style of self-segregation as coping techniques. Article II focuses on school based systems of protection and attitudes of parental protection in Kanagawa regarding stranger danger. These systems involve processes utilizing a visual pedagogy in which the stranger becomes known and is read as being ‘out of place’ in public space if their corporeal appearance transgresses a ‘regime of visuality’ through a form of networked regulation. The article argues that these systems and attitudes are creating a self-perpetuating embedded narrative of excessive risk and fear which impacts negatively on children’s independent mobility and is socially counterproductive in public space. Article III focuses on a controversially redeveloped urban park in Tokyo where factors such as ‘pay to play’ access to sports amenities and <b>heavy</b> <b>rule</b> sets are in place to regulate the space. The article illuminates contradictions which arose between the official redevelopment discourse and what then ultimately unfolded socially on the ground. It argues that the current park structures limit children’s and young people’s everyday access and mobilities, and further, that they direct their focus towards resisting adult structures. The combined findings of the thesis are that opportunities must be taken and implemented across parental, institutional and official scales to promote the everyday mobilities of children in urban public space in order to prevent them becoming mobile and political anomalies in public...|$|E

40|$|At the TSR storage-ring {{recombination}} {{experiments have}} been carried out on beryllium-like ions with the merged-beam technique. In addition to the dominant dielectronic recombination (DR), the process of trielectronic recombination (TR) has been observed for N = 0 transitions for the first time. In this case the radiationless electron-capture is accompanied by a simultaneous excitation of two core-electrons. The strength of the TR-cross-section depends strongly on the absence of allowed loss-channels, through which the triply excited intermediate TR-state can decay into the continua of singly excited core-electrons. Along a TR-Rydberg series the resonance{strength drops by several orders of magnitude crossing the DR-series-limits. The experimental spectra show a prefered decay of the core-states to states with identical spin-multiplicity. Thus above the triplet DR-series-limits no triplet TR-resonances and above the singlet DR-series-limits also no singlet TR-resonances can be observed within the experimental sensitivity.

40|$|The {{debate on}} {{governance}} issues has put significant {{emphasis on the}} role of institutions in the development process. Few attempts, however, have been made to systematically analyse specific potentials and comparative advantages of different types of institutions. This books opts for a triangle sphere model »state actors – market actors – civil society actors« for understanding the role of different types of actors in the development process. The model is based on a distinction between different logics of functioning of organisations: hierarchy and the rule of procedures in the case of state actors, competition, transactions and contract culture in the case of market actors, and solidarity, relation-based interaction, interest articulation and activism in the case of civil society organisations. This work focuses on the contributions of civil society organisations to development, particularly {{on the role of}} so called »Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) « as advocacy networks and service providers. Following theoretical reflections on the terms »innovation«, »development«, »civil society«, and »NGOs«, this book offers four different empirical approaches. First, it analyses NGOs and their contributions to development and change in two different countries (Bangladesh and the Republic of Congo). Second, it looks at the role of NGOs in two different sectors (employment generation in Ghana and improvement of social and labour standards in South Asia). The third empirical study examines the evolution of two individual organisations, one transnational NGO with focus on advocacy work (Transparency International) and one local NGO with focus on service delivery activities (Sadguru Water and Development Foundation). The fourth empirical study focuses on the role of NGOs in different types of development projects: building micro-infrastructure in Cameroon, providing of health care services in the Philippines, combating child labour in India and Nepal and promoting alternative employment generation in Ghana. The different empirical perspectives present ample evidence that it is possible and relevant to develop a theory of typical strengths and weaknesses, potentials and pro-blems of civil society organisations and their partnerships with other organisations, especially donor agencies. This contradicts the conclusions of those within the research community who consider the concept of civil society too vague to arrive at meaningful general explanations on the performance of such organisations in development policy making and programme management. The empirical studies underscore the significant potential of NGOs for promoting innovation and development. The strength of NGOs lies primarily in their ability to reach out to politically and economically marginalized sections of society and to put development issues on the global development and governance agenda. However, in the process of so-called »professionalisation« many organisations are tempted to either develop into bureaucracies governed by <b>heavy</b> <b>rules</b> and procedures or profit-oriented commercial outfits when they grow in age and size. Thus, they tend to lose such typical comparative advantages of NGOs such as access and intensive relations with marginalized groups of society, mobilising of voluntary work, flexibility, experimental approaches and freedom in agenda setting, including shaming activities and performing a critical watch-dog role on abuses of state and market power. A good legislative framework that defines the parameters of public benefit versus commercial activities may prevent that NGOs turn away from their original mission and social priorities. However, deficits in law making on NGOs are not only obvious in developing countries, as the case of Bangladesh shows, but also in many developed countries, as for example the case of the economically powerful NGO Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobilclub (ADAC) in Germany illustrates. NGOs may themselves contribute to halting trends of bureaucratisation or commercialisation as the cases of Transparency International and Sadguru Water and Development Foundation demonstrate. Both managed to strike a conscious balance between professionalism and voluntarism and/or transaction-based orientation (»contract culture«) and relation-based orientation (»solidarity culture«) with a sufficient number of diverse public and private donors. While drawing conclusions on typical innovation potentials, comparative advantages, dilemmas of orientation and dysfunctionalities of civil society organisations, this book also aimed to contribute to the theoretical debate on how to best operationalise the term civil society for the implementation of development policies...|$|R
