2500|$|Citroën SM non-US market {{vehicles}} were equipped with heating of the <b>headlamp</b> <b>cover</b> glasses, this heat supplied by ducts carrying warm {{air from the}} radiator exhaust to {{the space between the}} headlamp lenses and the cover glasses. This provided demisting/defogging of the entire interior of the cover glasses, keeping the glass clear of mist/fog over the entire surface. The glasses have thin stripes on their surfaces that are heated by the headlight beams; however, the ducted warm air provides demisting when the headlamps are not turned on. The glasses' stripes on both D and SM cars appear similar to rear windshield glass electric defogger heating strips, but they are passive, not electrified ...|$|E
5000|$|A faster edition {{called the}} 111S, {{named after the}} Lotus type-number of the Elise (Type 111), was {{introduced}} in early 1999 and had a VVC Rover K-Series engine with a modified head and VVT technology, producing a declared [...] rather than the standard Rover 1.8 L K-series [...] inline-four unit, along with a closer ratio manual gearbox and lower ratio final drive. It also had more padding in the seats. The 111S had <b>headlamp</b> <b>covers,</b> rear spoiler, cross drilled brake discs, alloy window winders and a six-spoke road wheel design.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the entry}} into {{production}} of the [...] "unibody" [...] Citroën Traction Avant in 1934 using Budd technology, Budd worked in 1940 with Nash Motors on the development and production of North America's first mass-produced unibody passenger vehicle, the Nash 600. In the mid-1980s, Budd's Plastics Division introduced sheet moulding compound, a reinforced plastic in sheet form, suitable for stamping out body panels {{in much the same}} way, and as quickly, as sheet metal equivalents are made. Pontiac Fiero has some exterior SMC body parts manufactured by Budd Plastics - such as the quarter panels, roof skin, <b>headlamp</b> <b>covers,</b> and trunk decklid.|$|R
50|$|Neale {{resigned}} from Jensen in 1966 following Jensen's decision to drop his P66 design {{in favour of}} the Touring design for the new Jensen Interceptor although he {{played an important role}} in amending the Italian Interceptor design so as to improve its appearance and make it suitable for production. His reputation as a stylist was somewhat negatively affected for many years by the headlamp design for the C-V8, however he was too loyal to his former employer to reveal that the teardrop-shaped <b>headlamp</b> <b>covers</b> of his original design had been removed prior to production by Richard Jensen, thereby leading to the controversial appearance of the production cars.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: 1968 Volkswagen 411L 4-door saloon. 1968 {{models are}} {{distinguished}} by their single rectangular <b>covered</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{front of}} the C-V8 was styled with <b>covered</b> <b>headlamps,</b> similar to those on the Ferrari 275 GTB and Jaguar 3.8 E-type as {{a key element of}} the design. But because of {{concerns}} that they might reduce the effectiveness of the <b>headlamps,</b> the <b>covers</b> were deleted for the production cars. As a consequence the C-V8's front-end appearance was compromised and proved controversial for decades. Owners are now starting to return their cars to the original streamlined styling intended by the car's designer Eric Neale. The model was discontinued in 1966 after a total production run of 500. The fibreglass body, {{and the fact that the}} twin-tube frame was set in from the perimeter of the car, have contributed to the model's comparatively high survival rate.|$|R
2500|$|Station wagon {{models for}} 1970 were offered {{initially}} {{in three different}} levels: the Fairlane 500 wagon, the Torino wagon, and the Torino Squire wagon. Mid-year 1970, the Falcon wagon became the new base station wagon. The sheetmetal on the station wagons was not changed as drastically as 2-door and 4-door models. The majority of the sheetmetal behind the front doors was carried over from the 1968-69 body style. As a result, the wagons appeared more upright and square than the sedans and coupes. The Torino Squire was the top level wagon and it featured simulated woodgrain sides, <b>headlamp</b> <b>covers</b> and a trim level similar to the Torino Brougham sedan. The Squire came standard with a 302-2V V8 engine, as well as power front disc brakes; other wagons had 4-wheel drums and the 250 CID I-6. All wagons still featured Ford's [...] "Magic Doorgate" [...] two-way tailgate, while the power rear window, rear-facing third seat and roof rack remained options. Ford offered a trailering towing package for all Torinos that would allow Torino to have a Class II tow rating (...) [...] This package included heavy-duty suspension, heavy-duty battery and alternator, extra cooling package, and power front disc brakes. The [...] or [...] engine, power steering and the Cruise-O-Matic transmission were required options.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was significantly revised including a widened track, softer torsion bars {{and the addition}} of a unique Z-configuration equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360 watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the flywheel. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed windscreen wipers, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass <b>headlamp</b> <b>covers</b> were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to {{the leading edge of the}} front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. (Throughout the rest of the world markets the 1967 model sold in Europe et.al. still retained the older headlights (including its counterparts in Latin America - especially the Brasilian market model retaining the pre-1965 bodystyle). Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (towel rails) - the overriders have a different shape unlike the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the concept}} car was already unofficially known as The Montreal, Alfa Romeo kept the model name in production.Stylistically, the most eye {{catching}} {{feature is the}} car's front end with four <b>headlamps</b> partly <b>covered</b> by unusual [...] "grilles", that retract when the lights are switched on. Another stylistic element is the NACA duct on the bonnet. The duct is actually blocked off since its purpose is not to draw air into the engine, but to optically hide the power bulge. The slats behind the doors contain the cabin vents, but apart from that only serve cosmetic purposes. Paolo Martin is credited for the prototype instrument cluster.|$|R
50|$|After trials by the Army, in May 1940 the {{armoured}} car was standardised, adopted {{with the official}} designation Autoblinda 40, and a first batch of 176 vehicles ordered.At {{the request of the}} Army the prototype had undergone numerous changes before it was adopted: redesigned front hull, recessed <b>headlamps</b> under armoured <b>covers,</b> improved ventilation, new cast spoked wheels, and flat, shortened mudguards. The first AB 40s were delivered in March 1941.|$|R
50|$|The 1974 Pontiac Banshee III was {{developed}} from the Pontiac Firebird platform with a long sloping front end and more aerodynamic rear styling. The front was a smooth blend of bumper sheet metal and <b>covered</b> <b>headlamps</b> for improved aerodynamics. The soft face bumper system consisted of body color urethane over an energy absorbing foam base, and the quartz halogen rectangular headlamps had a three-beam system, low, freeway and high.|$|R
25|$|An AMX Turbo Pace car {{was built}} {{to be one of}} four {{official}} safety cars in the PPG IndyCar World Series for the 1981 auto-racing season. There were two design proposals, both using the Spirit liftback body and designed by Richard A. Teague, AMC's Vice President of Automotive Design. One car was shown by PPG Industries featuring a white/red/blue/black painted production 1979 Spirit AMX with <b>covered</b> <b>headlamps</b> and integrated and smoothed front bumper and air dam unit.|$|R
50|$|On 23 August 2014, a {{photo of}} a near production-ready Proton Iriz was leaked online. Apart from the masked badge and {{partially}} <b>covered</b> <b>headlamps,</b> the car is completely undisguised, and sports a new bright green paint colour. A second silver coloured Proton Iriz is also partially visible in the background, identical to the green unit but without the Daytime Running Light (DRL) housing. On 14 September 2014, Mahathir Mohamed, then the Chairman of Proton, pulled a publicity stunt by driving an undisguised Proton Iriz to a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur.|$|R
5000|$|Once again Romani {{took the}} lead shaping the body. He {{produced}} a shape with completely <b>covered</b> <b>headlamps,</b> smooth sides with front and rear wheel spats and a smooth underfloor with a section towards {{the rear of the}} car shaped like a diffuser in an early use of [...] "effet de sol" [...] or [...] "ground effect" [...] to produce down-force. A more obvious feature was the two large vertical fins at the rear for stability at high speeds. The result of this work was that the LM64s had a drag coefficient even lower than that of the Panhard CD, with a [...] of just 0.12.|$|R
50|$|US {{regulations}} at {{the time}} also banned one of the car's more advanced features: its composite <b>headlamps</b> with aerodynamic <b>covered</b> lenses. Based on legislation that dated from 1940, all automobiles sold in the U.S. were required to have round, sealed beam headlamps that produced a meager 75,000 candlepower. The powerful quartz iodine swiveling headlamps designed for the 1968 model DS represented so many performance improvements at once that they were far beyond what the regulations could allow. Even the aerodynamic headlight covers were illegal - as seen on the 1968 Jaguar E-Type. It took the lobbying muscle of Ford {{to point out that}} the government was requiring two contradictory things - safety, by ensuring that all headlights were best-of-breed circa 1940, and fuel economy through the CAFE standard - by definition, cars with poor aerodynamics are sacrificing fuel economy. Composite bulb lamps and aerodynamic covered headlights were not permitted until 1983.|$|R
