5|$|Elsewhere in town, Mike meets up {{with his}} friends, the Terenzi {{brothers}} (Michael Siegel and Peter Licassi), and using the intercom on an ice cream truck, they drive around town attempting to warn people of the invading klowns. At Debbie's house, popcorn stuck to her clothes from her earlier encounter with the klowns mutates into monsters and attack her. She fends off the creatures, but another group of klowns arrive and trap her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzis witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to an amusement park, and the relocated circus tent. Journeying through a funhouse leading to the klowns' lair, the Terenzi brothers become separated and meet two female-looking klowns. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a crazy straw to drink liquefied townspeople, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of tricks and traps.|$|E
5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a rowing boat trying to pass underneath was caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting hawser snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{adventure}} {{is divided}} into 27 encounters across a 16-page module. Encounters are varied and each presents its own challenges. Encounter seven necessitates characters jumping from platform to platform above a sea of hot mud whilst evading erupting geysers; this in turn leads to encounter eight and a room of permanent darkness where a vampire guards Whelm. Encounter 17 occurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> but fragile bubble located above a boiling lake, with the players needing to defeat a giant crab and retrieve Wave without damaging the bubble. Encounter 26 involves negotiating a magical ziggurat populated by various monsters (including sea lions, giant crayfish, giant scorpions, and manticores) before encounter 28, a battle against an ogre mage who possesses Blackrazor. A final challenge on departing is an encounter with two to four efreet if the characters have succeeded in taking {{two or three of}} the magical weapons.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{takes place}} {{primarily}} on the four continents of a world named Gaia. Most of Gaia's population reside on the Mist Continent, named so because the entire continent is blanketed in thick Mist. Lands outside the Mist Continent—the Outer, Lost and Forgotten continents—are uncharted territories not explored until midway through the game. Several locations in the parallel world of Terra and the dream land of Memoria round out the game's areas. The Mist Continent features four nations: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra. Alexandria is a kingdom to the northeast of the Mist Continent ruled by a monarchy located in Alexandria Castle. The technologically advanced Lindblum, governed by a regent, is nestled on a plateau to the southwest where airships regularly fly by. The Kingdom of Burmecia, whose capital is showered by eternal rain is to the northwest and nearby to the isolated Cleyran civilization, which is nestled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> tree in the desert, protected by a powerful sandstorm. Treno, a large, perpetually dark city, heavily populated by both aristocrats and paupers, {{is located in the}} southeast part of the continent. The Mist Continent is extremely mountainous resulting in a natural barrier between many of the ruling nations.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

25|$|Chlorocruorin is an oxygen-binding hemeprotein whose {{affinity}} for oxygen is weaker {{than that of}} most hemoglobins. A dichromatic compound, chlorocruorin is noted for appearing green in dilute solutions, though it appears light red when found in concentrated solutions.

25|$|Enrolled at the Ginnasio Giulio Cesare in 1929, he {{made friends}} with Luigi ‘Titta’ Benzi, later a {{prominent}} Rimini lawyer (and the model for young Titta in Amarcord (1973)). In Mussolini’s Italy, Fellini and Riccardo became members of the Avanguardista, the compulsory Fascist youth group for males. He visited Rome with his parents {{for the first time}} in 1933, the year of the maiden voyage of the transatlantic ocean liner SS Rex (which is shown in Amarcord).

Kizaru and the navy confront Zephyr and the Straw Hats but the ex-Admiral allows the Neo Marines, Kuzan and the Straw Hats to escape the island. As Zephyr fights to his death and Ain and Binz mourn their loss, the Straw Hats return to Dock Island, giving their gear and weapons back to Mobston, before going their separate ways.|$|E
25|$|Silicon crystallises <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> {{covalent}} structure at standard conditions, {{specifically in}} a diamond cubic lattice. It thus {{has a high}} melting point of 1414°C. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure, culminating in a hexagonal close-packed allotrope at about 40gigapascals known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265°C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes (3642°C) and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon, consistent {{with the fact that}} the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Godzilla {{appears in}} search of a source of nuclear energy, despite the edict {{shutting}} down all such attractants after its three previous appearances. While Godzilla is fighting the G-Graspers, who are assisted by rebellious scientist Hajime Kudo, the swarm of Meganula are attracted in turn to Godzilla's energy, and attack it. During the course of the battle, the Dimension Tide is launched, but Godzilla survives the attack. Most of the Meganula are killed by both Godzilla and the Dimension Tide, but a few manage to drain off some of Godzilla's energy and return to the sewer. With the last of their strength, the Meganula inject Godzilla's energy into a huge, sleeping larva that is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giant,</b> pulsating cocoon. It molts and appears from the water as Megaguirus, the queen of the Meganula.|$|E
