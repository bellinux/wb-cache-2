Out of the 300 Southern Rhodesians who had joined the KRRC in Egypt, only three officers and 109 other ranks remained {{at the end of}} the Tunisian Campaign. The Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery retraced many of the movements it had taken during the campaign as it returned to Egypt. [...] "Left for Matruh at 0830 hours today," [...] one Rhodesian gunner wrote.

This goes unison with the wider blogosphere and review scene where foremost the touch bar was criticized for providing {{a negative impact on}} a user's concentration and usability: [...] "The cognitive footprint of direct second screen interactions is significantly higher than that of indirect interactions". Other items of critique were non-compatibility between Thunderbolt 2 and 3 devices, frequently unpleasant fan whine noises in idle CPU states on the larger screen (15") models were reported, where the two integrated fans run all the time by default. Responsible for this behaviour are the Co-Processor powering the touch bar and higher TDP of the stronger CPU models.|$|E

2500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{has been criticized}} for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed, and for frequent use of the 3.5-star rating. For example, Led Zeppelin was largely written off by Rolling Stone magazine critics during the band's most active years in the 1970s, but by 2006, a cover story on the band honored them as [...] "the Heaviest Band of All Time". A critic for Slate magazine described a conference at which 1984's The Rolling Stone Record Guide was scrutinized. As he described it, [...] "The guide virtually ignored hip-hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal, the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts.

2500|$|Hussey {{joined the}} Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917's Weddell Sea {{party as a}} meteorologist, keeping a leather-bound diary of the entire expedition. He was a popular {{member of the group}} due to his humour and {{perpetual}} playing of his five-string banjo, in company with Dr. James McIlroy's imitations of the trombone and bagpipes. [...] Frank Worsley stated [...] "Hussey was a brilliant wit, and his keen repartee {{was one of the few}} joys left to us. Often we would combine to provoke him just for the pleasure of hearing his clever retorts and invariably he would emerge the victor, no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> tried to best him." [...] On 22 June 1915, Hussey and the crew staged a four-hour [...] "smoking concert" [...] and costume party, during which Hussey dressed as a black minstrel.

2500|$|This {{approach}} earned {{praise from}} two influential intellectual {{figures of the}} Romanian diaspora, critics Monica Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca, whose letter to the author read: [...] "the distances you take from your own background are of most-rare authenticity and tact. You accomplish a radical break, being {{at the same time}} participative, negating things only after you have understood them, being dissociated from both roles of judge and defense counsel." [...] Cioroianu also notes: [...] "He is not the only son of (relatively) well-known communists; but {{he is one of the}} few to have reached the level of detachment needed in order to X-ray, in a cold and precise way, a political system. Does this seem easy to you? I do not know <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would be capable of introspecting with such lucidity our own parents' utopias, phantasms and disappointments". The historian opposes Tismăneanu's approach to that of Petre Roman, Romania-s first post-1989 Premier, whose attempts at discussing the public image of his father, the communist politico Valter Roman, are argued by Cioroianu to have [...] "failed".|$|E

30|$|To date, hazard and {{disaster}} scholarship has been preoccupied mostly with the flare and glamour of rapid, sudden onset events. This {{is not entirely}} unexpected or unreasonable given the dramatic impacts that in particular, large-scale {{events such as the}} 2014 – 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the 1971 Bay of Bengal tropical cyclone disaster, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and the 2011 Japan earthquake–tsunami–nuclear events have on people and places. Modern classifications and analyses of hazards {{and disaster}}s focus on what Rickards and Kearnes (2016) refer to as ‘“bounded events” that explode out of the assumed substrate of normal day-to-day life, triggering efforts to extinguish them as quickly as they appear’. This construct has in turn informed <b>how</b> some (<b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us?)</b> think about hazards and disasters in the Anthropocene, leading to a sense of what will the Anthropocene future hold in relation with the sudden occurrence of disaster? However, critical hazard and disaster scholarship should rupture this thinking. The “Anthropocene turn” demands that scholars consider the smooth background against which short-term fluctuations including emergencies, hazards, and disasters are manifest. We need to be attentive to the conditions that enable and facilitate apparent short-term, rapid onset events.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} issues of {{corporate}} governance {{in the light of}} the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation passed in the USA. Corporate governance is a major issue in business globally and though it has received much attention in the business press there has been nothing specific about the apparel industry and little to draw attention to its importance for such a significant global industry. The paper contrasts the UK approach to corporate governance with its comply or explain ethic and the new legislative approach adopted by the <b>US,</b> more <b>of</b> a comply or go to jail ethic. It also outlines the widening power <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> legislation and its impact on companies and businesses outside <b>of</b> the <b>US.</b> The paper makes an analysis of apparel/textile companies registered on the New York Stock Exchange to show <b>how</b> <b>many</b> are non-US and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> are <b>of</b> <b>US</b> origin with operations outside the US - making the point that all these operations all fall within the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. The results of this analysis show that for the apparel industry it does not encompass huge numbers of companies it does, however, include some significant players, like TK Maxx, GAP and Asda (George at Asda) etc. The paper was published in the proceedings of the 83 rd Textile Institute World Conference, and presented at that conference in Shanghai May 2004. The Textile Institute has a Royal Charter and its conference proceedings are refereed internationally. This research led the author to invitations to give a seminar at the Association of International Accounts in Manchester. This research also led the author to invitations to give guest MBA lectures at Hochschule Albstadt-Sigmaringen, Germany. ...|$|R

40|$|Citation: Stewart, Effie L. Psychology of music. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: There {{are many}} {{beautiful}} arts today and many which are perhaps more highly developed than music, {{but to my}} mind music as an art {{is the most beautiful}} and touches the hearts of more people than any other one art. In this work I wish to use the term music in its broadest sense and for a working definition, I will say that any sound or modulation of sounds which is pleasing to the ear, is music. From this use of the term we can say that music in some form has existed since the creation of man. The first music then was the music of nature and from this music, musical instruments were invented. The poets have written of the "sighing of the wind", "lowing of cattle", "chirping of crickets", of the deep voices of the ocean, etc., and some think this merely a fancy of poets, and yet, <b>how</b> <b>many</b> there are <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who enjoy going into the, woods and sitting down under the trees listen to the wind as it whistles and sighs through the leaves, or on a still summer evening do we not enjoy going into the country and listening to the crickets, katydids, and frogs? Some may say this is not music but I think it truly is. have never been fortunate enough to the near the ocean, but have talked with many who have and they always express a longing to be near it again, but it is almost invariably for the roar or music of the ocean rather than the beauty of the great expanse itself. I have heard a few persons say that the roar of the ocean is more to them even than the beautiful scenery of the mountains and they say, while they miss the mountains, they do not fill the place in their hearts that the ocean does...|$|R
