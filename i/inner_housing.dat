50|$|A {{centrifugal}} oil cleaner is a rotary sedimentation device using {{centrifugal force}} rather than gravity to separate contaminants from the oil, {{in the same}} manner as any other centrifuge.

40|$|Numerous {{excitation}} {{sources for}} disk vibrations {{are present in}} optical drives. For increasing rotation speeds, airflow-housing-induced vibrations have {{become more and more}} important. Currently, drives are designed in which rotation speeds are so high that critical speed resonances may show up. The presence of these resonances depends on the layout of the <b>inner</b> <b>housing</b> geometry of the drive. The influence of the drive <b>inner</b> <b>housing</b> geometry is investigated systematically by means of a numerical-experimental approach. An analytical model is derived, containing disk dynamics and the geometry-induced pressure distribution acting as the excitation mechanism on the disk. The Reynolds' lubrication equation is used as a first approach for the modeling of the pressure distribution. The model is numerically implemented using an approach based on a combination of finite element and finite difference techniques. An idealized, drive-like environment serves as the experimental setup. This setup resembles the situation in the numerical model, {{in order to be able}} to verify the numerical model. Wedge-like airflow disturbances are used in order to obtain insight into the influence of drive inner geometry on the critical speed resonances of optical disks. A disk tilt measurement method is designed that yields a global view of the disk deformation. By means of two newly proposed types of plots, numerical and experimental results can be compared in a straightforward way. A qualitative match between the numerical and experimental results is obtained. The numerical and experimental methods presented provide insight into airflow-housing-induced vibrations in optical drives. Additionally, reduction of some critical speed resonances is found to be possible for certain drive inner geometry configurations...|$|E

The powertrain concept consists of a single-shaft engine with a ceramic inner shell for containment of hot gasses and support of twin regenerators.

The engine is coupled to the vehicle through a widerange continuously variable transmission, which utilizes gearing and a variable-ratio metal compression belt. A response assist flywheel is used to achieve acceptable levels of engine response. The package offers a 100 lb weight advantage in a Chrysler K Car front-wheel-drive installation.

Spatial distribution {{of the value of}} synthetic variable varies in a moderate aspect. Since there is left asymmetry absolute numeric ascendancy in the districts with high degree of that measure (> 30) is observed. This proves bed and very bed housing conditions. They are typical for central city regions. Thirteen diagnostic variables were selected for construction of municipal building spatial typology. The typology was constructed according to Czekanowski methodology, which is classified as a cluster analysis. Optimal effect of municipal housing services districts ranking was accomplished when index distance function was used and thanks to sorting Czekanowski diagram according to simple autoalgorithm.
