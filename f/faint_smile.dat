2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfatherâ€“ his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A <b>faint</b> <b>smile</b> was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never {{count it}} lost whilst I am living," [...] he replied. She {{considered}} him a moment, {{and there was}} the <b>faintest</b> <b>smile</b> on her lips.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush!' {{said the}} secretary, {{suffering}} the <b>faintest</b> <b>smile</b> to play upon his face. 'Hush! God bless me, Dennis! We associate, you know, for strictly peaceable and lawful purposes.' ...|$|R

60|$|I thanked him--but not in such warm {{terms as}} I should have employed, if I had seen even the <b>faintest</b> <b>smile</b> on his face, or had heard {{any change in}} his steady, {{deliberate}} tones, as he spoke. While his words attracted, his immovable looks repelled me, in spite of myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Marius, {{you are not}} drinking," [...] said she.
