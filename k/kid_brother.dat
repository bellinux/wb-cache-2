5|$|Murphy {{continued}} to make films in the 1960s. Murphy and Huston worked together one {{more time in the}} 1960 film The Unforgiven, in which Murphy took second billing as Burt Lancaster's racist <b>kid</b> <b>brother</b> who was bent on the destruction of the Kiowa.Writer Clair Huffaker had success in a number of his works being adapted for the films, including his 1958 novel Flaming Lance being filmed as the Elvis Presley western Flaming Star. Two of his works retained their original titles when Huffaker wrote the screenplays for them as Murphy's films in 1961, Seven Ways from Sundown and Posse from Hell. Author Bob Herzberg deemed the scripts two of the best Murphy worked with in that decade. Herbert Coleman directed Posse from Hell as well as the black and white World War II drama Battle at Bloody Beach set in the Philippines.|$|E

25|$|Lloyd and Roach parted ways in 1924, and Lloyd {{became the}} {{independent}} producer {{of his own}} films. These included his most accomplished mature features Girl Shy, The Freshman (his highest-grossing silent feature), The <b>Kid</b> <b>Brother,</b> and Speedy, his final silent film. Welcome Danger (1929) was originally a silent film but Lloyd decided late in the production to remake it with dialogue. All of these films were enormously successful and profitable, and Lloyd would eventually become the highest paid film performer of the 1920s. They were also highly influential and still find many fans among modern audiences, {{a testament to the}} originality and film-making skill of Lloyd and his collaborators. From this success {{he became one of the}} wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood.|$|E

He orders his henchmen to kill Walter and Jesse. After he is abducted by the henchmen, Walter instructs Jesse over the phone to kill Gale in order to force Gus not to kill Walter (and, by extension, Jesse) lest he eliminate his only remaining trained chemist.|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{character}} is well received by manga readers; {{in each of}} the popularity polls made by Monthly Shōnen Gangan he has ranked first. Edward also won the Twenty-sixth Annual Animage Readers' Poll, Anime Grand Prix, in the [...] "Favorite Male Character"; Romi Park, who voices Edward in Japanese, won in the [...] "Favorite Seiyu" [...] category. Edward maintained a high place in the next year's poll in the same category. In the July 2009 issue of Newtype, Edward ranked {{at the top of the}} survey Male Character Rankings. In the August 2009 issue his rank changed to fourth. In a Newtype poll from March 2010, Edward was voted as the fourth most popular male anime character from the 2000s. In the Anime Awards 2006 from About.com, Edward won in the category [...] "Best Lead Character – Male". He was also seventh in IGN's 2009 Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie saying, [...] " [...] and his <b>kid</b> <b>brother</b> Al make one of the best action-comedy teams in recent memory". In 2014, IGN ranked him as the eighth greatest anime character of all time, saying that [...] "In Edward we had a character who was truly multidimensional. He could be comedic and pull off wild takes and sight gags. He could be placed in the most tragic circumstances and portray the deepest kind of sadness. He could be a complete badass, but he could also be the nicest guy on the planet." [...] Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Edward's likeness, including plush toys, action figures, and key-chains. Vic Mignogna, who performs the voice of Edward in the English dub, was the winner in American Anime Awards in the category [...] "Best Actor" [...] for voicing Edward. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted as the 5th best [...] "guy".|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Enfield {{developed}} his BBC sketch show, Harry Enfield's Television Programme, later called Harry Enfield and Chums, with Whitehouse and Kathy Burke. Eschewing the alternative comedy style prevalent at the time, both {{versions of the}} show were indebted to early '70s comedians such as Dick Emery and Morecambe and Wise. Enfield and his co-performers created another group of nationally recognised characters for these shows, such as Stan and Pam Herbert, who use the catchphrase [...] "We are considerably richer than you" [...] (in an exaggerated West-Midlands accent), Tim Nice-But-Dim, The Scousers, Smashie and Nicey, Wayne and Waynetta Slob, Annoying <b>Kid</b> <b>Brother,</b> who grew into Kevin the Teenager, and two old-fashioned presenters, Mr Cholmondley-Warner and Grayson.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, MacDonald {{starred in}} two of the highest-grossing films of that year. In Rose-Marie (1936), MacDonald played a haughty opera diva who learns her <b>kid</b> <b>brother</b> (James Stewart) has killed a Mountie and is hiding in the northern woods; Eddy is the Mountie sent to capture him. [...] Nelson Eddy and she sang Rudolf Friml's [...] "Indian Love Call" [...] {{to each other in the}} Canadian wilderness (actually filmed at Lake Tahoe). Eddy's definitive portrayal of the steadfast Mountie became a popular icon. When the Canadian Mounties temporarily retired their distinctive hat in 1970, photos of Eddy in his Rose Marie uniform appeared in thousands of U.S. newspapers. [...] San Francisco (1936) was also directed by W.S. Van Dyke. In this tale of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, MacDonald played a hopeful opera singer opposite Clark Gable as the he-man proprietor of a Barbary Coast gambling joint, and Spencer Tracy as his boyhood chum who has become a priest and gives the moral messages.|$|E
2500|$|Highlights of the 1950s {{included}} the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, {{the birth of}} their son [...] "Honest Abe" [...] Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long lost <b>kid</b> <b>brother</b> Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both Life and TV Guide. 1956 saw the debut of the Bald Iggle, considered by some Abner enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the [...] "Square Eyes" [...] Family—Capp’s thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This fable-like story was collected into an educational comic book called Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!, and distributed by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith later that year.) Two years later, Capp's studio issued Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story, a biographical comic book distributed by the Fellowship of Reconciliation.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1957, Chrysler {{president}} Lester Lum [...] "Tex" [...] Colbert {{established a}} committee to develop a competitor for the increasingly popular VW Beetle, the new American Motors Rambler and upcoming [...] "compact" [...] cars from GM and Ford for 1960. Virgil Exner designed a car that was smaller and lighter than a full-size car without sacrificing passenger and luggage space. Originally named the Falcon after Exner's 1955 Chrysler Falcon concept car, the vehicle was renamed the 'Valiant' honoring Henry Ford II's request to use the name for the Ford Falcon. The Valiant debuted at the 44th International Motor Show in London on October 26, 1959. It was introduced as a 1960 model and was officially considered a distinct brand, advertised with the tagline 'Nobody's <b>kid</b> <b>brother,</b> this one stands on its own four tires.' For the 1961 model year, the Valiant was classified as a Plymouth model. The 1961–62 Dodge Lancer was essentially a rebadged Valiant with different trim and styling details. For the 1962 model year, the Valiant returned without Plymouth or Dodge branding but was sold only in Plymouth Chrysler, Chrysler Dodge, or the rare standalone Plymouth dealerships. For model year 1963 and onwards the car was sold in the United States only as a Plymouth Valiant. In Canada (1960–66) the car was marketed as a separate brand, with [...] "Valiant by Chrysler" [...] appearing on the rear trunklids of cars sold there. The Valiant was also built and sold as a [...] "Valiant" [...] in Argentina (1962–68).|$|E
