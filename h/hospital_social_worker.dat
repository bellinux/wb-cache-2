40|$|This thesis explores {{factors that}} {{influence}} professional discretion in Swedish hospital professionals’ assessment of children who {{may be at risk}} of harm. It is based on two data samplings, interviews with fourteen <b>hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and a questionnaire with 295 responding physicians, nurses, nurse assistants and <b>hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> The theoretical frame consists of theories of professions, sociology of emotions and normativity. Although all professionals are mandated to report suspicions about children who may be at risk to social services, the findings show {{that a majority of the}} participants had never made a report. However, there were major differences between the professions: <b>hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and physicians made most reports, while it was unusual for nurses and nurse assistants to report. This is explained by children at risk being everyone’s but no single profession’s responsibility within health care – which shapes an informal pattern of jurisdiction, split between physicians and <b>hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> The professional group to which a person belongs was shown to affect how other factors influence assessment. The lower the status of the group, the less knowledge about the issue and the available organisational support its members have, and the more emotions influenced the decisions not to report. While <b>hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> are less strongly affected by emotions in decisions not to report, the deeper qualitative analysis shows that assessment tended to follow a ‘logic of normativity’ where their worries stuck to ‘warning signs’ associated with gender stereotypes or unprivileged groups of parents. Critical reflexivity could disturb this logic as well as the silence of normality, meaning that children from privileged groups may not be given enough attention. <b>Hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> were also found to take different positions in their inter-professional teams – active, reflective or passive – relating to three institutionalized norms of action – juridical, therapeutic and medical. A small number followed the medical norm, but that had the most dangerous consequences for children who sometimes were not dealt with appropriately despite severe signs of harm. The overall analysis in this thesis suggests that theories of professional discretion should take into account factors such as the context, inter-professional relations, emotions and normativity to enhance the understanding of what influences assessment and decisions...|$|R

40|$|The {{contents}} of this thesis {{are focused on}} relationships between social integration, social network and social support, on the one hand, and perceived ill health and care utilization on the other. The aims of the thesis were to: investigate the relationship between social network, perceived ill health and utilization of an emergency department (ED); relate the frequency of ED use to socio-demo g rap h ic risk indicators for social disintegration; describe the psycho-social and medical situation {{of a group of}} heavy users of ED services In comparison to the general population; relate changes in social network in a group of heavy users to utilization of ED; evaluate the effects of <b>hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> intervention for heavy users of ED; The hypothesis was that if the informal network fails or becomes insufficient or if the work sector is deleteriously affected, the individuals may choose to turn to public agencies such as health care and social welfare for help. This hypothesis was tested in one such agency, the somatic ED of a general hospital. The main findings were that social network variables such as perceived loneliness, lack of close friend, less contact with extended family, living alone, beeing outside the lab our force and having economic problems were related to a higher utilization of ED resources. It was demonstrated that subjects living in areas characterized by high geographical mobility, high proportions of unemployed and of immigrants used ED services to a higher extent than those who lived in areas which did not show these socio-demographic risk indicators for social disintegration. Heavy users of ED were medically and psycho-socially more burdened than the general population of the catchment area. Individuals who originally recurrently visited the ED but whose access to support giving networks improved, reduced their number of ED visits in the cou rse of time. <b>Hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> intervention for a group of heavy ED users reduced the effect of age, health problems and living alone on ED use, but did not affect total utilization rate. In conclusion, use of emergency care is a complex product of many, sometimes concomitant factors; medical, social, psychological and structural. Some of these factors lay within the reach of individual or professional actions and interventions, but some, such as employment opportunities, geographical mobility and organization of care, are only amenable on societal level...|$|E

All patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria: with a new diagnosis (not older than three months) of RA, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 classification criteria (Levin et al. 1996); aged 18 to 65  years; and able to communicate in Swedish; were {{invited to participate in the}} study. Altogether 123 patients (90 women) were eligible and received verbal and written information about the study. However, 19 of these declined to participate before the study started, and four dropped out during the data collection (two died, one was diagnosed with cancer and the fourth declined during the first part of the data collection). These 23 patients (15 women) were excluded from the study (Gafvels et al. 2012). No significant differences were found as regards age and sex between the participants and non-participants.

40|$|Family {{involvement}} {{is important in}} improving outcomes for stroke survivors. Stroke rehabilitation can be an emotionally and physically draining experience. The researcher, a <b>hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>worker,</b> conducted a literature review to analyse material on the purpose and benefits of family conferences for an inpatient caseload. The literature indicated that family conferences {{are important to the}} rehabilitation process, although much more can be done to ensure professionals provide the best possible care throughout the inpatient admission and on return to the community. There appears to be a need for better education and ongoing support from rehabilitation interdisciplinary teams for patients and their caregivers, and intervention should be more proactive to reduce strain. Social workers are well positioned through their skills, theoretical frameworks and approaches to determine what might be best practice for each stroke survivor and to predict practical and emotional care requirements for caregivers. This qualitative research project explored the information needs of caregivers and the trial of a new resource, a personalised ‘Mid-Term Report Card’. This report card was provided to participants half-way through the admission and contained results of assessments and therapies. Four weeks after discharge from rehabilitation each caregiver participated in a semi-structured interview focusing on the perceived benefit of provision of the report card, and the information they felt most adequately prepared them to assume their caregiving role. The study provided an opportunity to gain some preliminary insights into the caregiver experience beyond their need for information, and offers suggestions for the content of future Mid-Term Report Cards. There was clear feedback that caregivers of stroke survivors need to be supported to engage effectively with rehabilitation teams, and this study highlights the role of social work in addressing these identified areas of need...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes, analyses, {{and compares}} {{the means by}} which hospital social work associations in Sweden and Germany pursue their members’ professionalization through ‘jurisdictional work’. The time period covered by the research is 1989 through 2008. The analysis starts from the observation that jurisdictional work represents an ongoing effort by hospital social workers’ professional bodies to establish and maintain formalized professional jurisdiction, both internally within the profession and externally vis-à-vis outside stakeholders. The research questions guiding the investigation focus on the kind of activities these professional bodies perform, {{and the way in which}} they are performed, to promote hospital social workers’ professionalization in the two countries in question. The question will also be asked as to the reasons why hospital social work bodies perform the specific activities under consideration. This dissertation is a cross-national comparative case study on jurisdictional work performed by a social work subgroup operating in organizational settings where social work represents a minority occupation subordinate to other professional fields. The research materials used for the study include, in the first place, various documents obtained from professional hospital social work bodies in Sweden and Germany. In addition, two focus group interviews with board members of two of the associations studied were conducted. The theoretical framework used for the analysis and comparison of the empirical data draws on theories of the sociology of professions (Abbott 1988, 2005), complemented by theorizing on compliance in voluntary organizations (Etzioni 1961) and on social identity (Jenkins 2004). Additionally, argumentation analysis is drawn upon Karlsen (2012). The results obtained show there to have been major differences between the jurisdictional work strategies resorted to by the Swedish and German social work bodies. The differences mainly involved the ways in which these organizations supported their members, related to their social work knowledge base, positioned themselves vis-à-vis their trade union, and concretely sought to advance formal protection. The findings point to both internal (i. e., associational, related to the organization’s size and resources) and external (national context, specific healthcare setting, and degree of subordination to other occupational categories within the professional context and the specific healthcare setting) factors behind the differences in the studied social work bodies’ use of jurisdictional work strategies. Altogether, two different jurisdictional work strategies were found to be used by professional <b>hospital</b> <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> groups operating in subordination in Sweden and Germany. A mimetic strategy was used by the Swedish hospital social workers, to allow them, as a professional group, to better “blend in” with their hospital settings; in this case, similarities between the hospital social workers and their working environment, including other professions present in it, were emphasized, especially as concerns their knowledge base, professional identity, and disciplinary affiliation. In contrast, the German hospital social workers relied on an aposematic strategy stressing differences between the social workers’ and their hospital co-workers’ knowledge base, professional identity, and disciplinary affiliation, so as to make their subprofession “stand out” from its enveloping hospital settings...|$|E

The study involved different cadres of hospital staff including; clinicians, nurses, radiologists, dental officers and hospital nutritionist. The study findings generally have shown that hospital health care workers have positive attitudes towards social work professionals attached to the hospitals; this was true to both those who were aware of the existence of this cadre within the hospital premises which is 52 % and those who were not aware of their existence which is 48 %. Moreover, health care workers recommended that the number of social work professionals should be increased so that they can manage patients and clients requiring their care.
