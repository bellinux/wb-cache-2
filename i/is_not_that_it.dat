25|$|All {{the accusations}} of gerrymandering, {{practically}} all the complaints about housing and regional policy, and a disproportionate {{amount of the}} charges about public and private employment come from this area. The area – which consisted of Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh, Londonderry County Borough, and portions of Counties Londonderry and Armagh – had {{less than a quarter}} of the total population of Northern Ireland yet generated not far short of three-quarters of the complaints of discrimination...The unionist government must bear its share of responsibility. It put through the original gerrymander which underpinned so many of the subsequent malpractices, and then, despite repeated protests, did nothing to stop those malpractices continuing. The most serious charge against the Northern Ireland government <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was directly responsible for widespread discrimination, but that it allowed discrimination on such a scale over a substantial segment of Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of L'Orfeo <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was the first}} work of its kind, {{but that it was}} the first attempt to apply the full resources of the art of music, as then evolved, to the nascent genre of opera. In particular, Monteverdi made daring innovations in the use of polyphony, of which Palestrina had been the principal exponent. In L'Orfeo, Monteverdi extends the rules, beyond the conventions which polyphonic composers, faithful to Palestrina, had previously considered as sacrosanct. Monteverdi was not in the generally understood sense an orchestrator; Ringer finds that it is the element of instrumental improvisation that makes each performance of a Monteverdi opera a [...] "unique experience, and separates his work from the later operatic canon." ...|$|E

500|$|On Niall Caille's {{death in}} 846, the kingship of Tara passed to Flann Sinna's father Máel Sechnaill. Feidlimid {{died in the}} {{following}} year, and Máel Sechnaill proceeded to expand his power by war and diplomacy. What is noteworthy about Máel Sechnaill's expansionism, normal for Irish kings, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> happened, but the language used to describe it. The Annals of Ulster refer to Máel Sechnaill's armies, not as the [...] "men of Mide", or of the Clann Cholmáin, but as the [...] "men of Ireland" [...] (an expedition co feraib Érenn is recorded in 858). Alongside this innovation, the terms goídil (gael), gaill (foreigners) and gallgoídil (Norse-Gaels) become more common, along with phrases such as the Gaíll Érenn (the foreigners of Ireland, {{used to refer to}} the Norse-Gaels of the Irish coasts).|$|E
500|$|Though {{largely ignored}} upon its initial release, Spiderland has {{attracted}} greater attention through time. The album has sold over 50,000 copies, though Kory Grow of the College Music Journal {{suggested that the}} album [...] "has inspired countless bands (and therefore fans) far beyond its SoundScan numbers". Spiderland has become a landmark indie rock album and is considered, along with Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock, {{to have been the}} primary catalyst of the post-rock genre. The album is also regarded as being essential to [...] "the fabric of math-rock genre". David Peschek said that the album is [...] "the ur-text for what became known as post-rock, a fractured, almost geometric reimagining of rock music stripped of its dionysiac impulse." [...] Rachel Devine of The List called Spiderland [...] "arguably the most disproportionately influential [...] in music history". The List |last=Devine |first=Rachel |date=August 16, 2007 |work=list.co.uk |accessdate=October 14, 2012}} Pitchfork Media reviewer Stuart Berman commented: [...] " [...] Spiderland's greatest legacy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> motivated a cluster of semi-popular bands in the late-90s and early 2000s to adopt its whisper-to-scream schematic. It's the boundless inspiration it perpetually provides for all the bands that have yet to emerge from the basement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rorty's Achieving Our Country uses Snow Crash as {{an example}} of modern culture that [...] "express the loss of what he [...] calls [...] "national hope"...the problem with Snow Crash <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> isn't true—after all, it's a story—but that it isn't {{inspiration}}al." [...] This lack of inspiration is offset by something else Snow Crash and other works like it offer: [...] "These books produce in their readers the 'state of soul' that Rorty calls 'knowingness,' which he glosses as a 'preference for knowledge over hope' (37)"; this preference for knowledge [...] "contribute to a more fundamental failure to appreciate the value of inspiration—and hence of literature—itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Khalīl further {{argues that}} the only reason the hamza in al- is ever dropped <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{volatile}} but that it is used too much. When asked why the lām in al- was not simply given a vowel if it is so heavily used {{and it needs to be}} easier to pronounce, followers of Khalīl said that if the lām had been given a fatḥa, it would have been confused with the asseverative-cum-precative particle. Had it been given a kasra, it would have been confused with the genitival particle. It could not have been given a ḍamma for fear of the following vowel being a kasra or ḍamma (which would result in awkward pronunciations as in [...] *lu-ibil or [...] *lu-‘unuq).|$|E

2500|$|The {{essential}} {{point of}} this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein's point <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is impossible to define [...] "game", but that we don't have a definition, and we don't need one, because even without the definition, we use the word successfully. Everybody understands what we mean {{when we talk about}} playing a game, and we can even clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game. The German word for [...] "game", [...] "", has a different sense than in English; the meaning of [...] "Spiele" [...] also extends to the concept of [...] "play" [...] and [...] "playing." [...] This German sense of the word may help readers better understand Wittgenstein's context in the remarks regarding games.|$|E
2500|$|Noted {{for winning}} the Series of Younger Poets {{competition}} in 1983, The Evolution of the Flightless Bird {{is the first of}} four books that Kenney has published so far. Contest judge James Merrill praised its daring stylistic approach in the forward. Containing three sections of poetry ('The Hours of the Day,' 'First Poems,' and 'Heroes'), the book is made up of [...] "not well-wrought urns so much as complex molecules programmed to coalesce into larger structures" [...] (Merrill, Foreword). But what makes this book stand out <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> consists of multiple sonnets, but that the delivery is so original and so far-fetched that its publication sparked much discussion about Kenney's style. A book with images varying from sea to battle scenes, The Evolution of the Flightless Bird marks the beginning of Kenney's career as a poet.|$|E
