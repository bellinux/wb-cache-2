5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, <b>great,</b> <b>but</b> bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as <b>great),</b> <b>but</b> otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E

Here, at the Valley of the Kings the expedition moved into the tomb of Ramesses IV (of the 20th dynasty), where the air was cooler. They also located the tomb of Ramesses the <b>Great,</b> <b>but</b> it was badly looted. It was here that Champollion first received news of Young's campaign to vindicate himself as the decipherer of the hieroglyphs and to discredit Champollion's decipherments. He received this news {{only a few days}} after Young's death in London.|$|E

5|$|Loring Danforth, a {{professor}} of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the <b>Great,</b> <b>but</b> are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{is a town}} in South Derbyshire {{close to}} the River Trent, which may have {{originated}} as buildings associated with the royal manor {{to the south of}} the nearby settlement at Kings Newton. Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier manor house of unknown date; there is an old tradition that the manor was originally established in about the year 900, during the reign of Alfred the <b>Great,</b> <b>but</b> there is no evidence for this. As recorded in the Domesday Book, the manor of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King Edward the Confessor prior to the Norman Conquest. The property then passed into the hands of William I of England. After creating the Diocese of Carlisle in 1133, Henry I gave the manor for life to Æthelwold, the first bishop. Some time later, the diocese built a palace nearby on the site of what is now Melbourne Hall. When Bishop Æthelwold died in about 1156, the manor reverted to the crown.|$|E

25|$|Ignoring {{the third}} Winter Palace, the Empress on {{her return to}} Saint Petersburg took up {{residence}} at the neighbouring Apraksin Palace. In 1732, the Tsaritsa commissioned the architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli to completely rebuild and extend the Apraksin Palace, incorporating other neighbouring houses. Thus, {{the core of the}} fourth and final Winter Palace is not the palace of Peter the <b>Great,</b> <b>but</b> the palace of Admiral General Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin.|$|E

Shortly after, Gilles moved to Machecoul where, as the record of his confession states, he killed, or ordered to be killed, a <b>great</b> <b>but</b> uncertain number of children after he sodomized them.

He believed that good would triumph in the Parliament, and pushed for human rights legislation just as he wished for a unified Germany.|$|E

Most scholars view him as a literary fiction, but some have tried to harmonise the Book of Daniel with history by identifying him with various known figures, notably Cyrus or Ugbaru, the general who was first to enter Babylon when it fell to the Persians in 539 BCE.|$|E
25|$|Blackmore ceased writing epics for a {{time after}} Creation. In 1722 he {{continued}} his religious themes with Redemption, an epic on the divinity of Jesus Christ designed to oppose and confute the Arians (as he called the Unitarians). The next year, he released another long epic, Alfred. The poem was ostensibly about King Alfred the <b>Great,</b> <b>but</b> like his earlier Arthurian epics, this one was political. It was dedicated to Prince Frederick, the eldest son of King George II, but the poem vanished without causing any comment from court or town.|$|E

25|$|The Cossacks {{had fought}} {{in the past for}} {{independence}} from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and they were later involved in several uprisings against the tsar, in fear of losing their privileges and autonomy. In 1709, for example, the Zaporozhian Host led by Kost Hordiienko joined Hetman Ivan Mazepa against Russia. Mazepa was previously a trusted adviser and close friend to Tsar Peter the <b>Great</b> <b>but</b> allied himself with Charles XII of Sweden against Peter I.

Shivaji established an effective civil and military administration. After a lifetime of conquest and guerrilla warfare with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Shivaji died in 1680, leaving behind a kingdom of <b>great</b> <b>but</b> ill-defined extent. This was followed by a period of instability ending with Aurangzeb's death.|$|E
25|$|Some critics work largely with {{theoretical}} texts, {{while others}} read traditional literature; {{interest in the}} literary canon is still <b>great,</b> <b>but</b> many critics are also interested in minority and women's literatures, while some critics influenced by cultural studies read popular texts like comic books or pulp/genre fiction. Ecocritics have drawn connections between literature and the natural sciences. Darwinian literary studies studies literature {{in the context of}} evolutionary influences on human nature. Many literary critics also work in film criticism or media studies. Some write intellectual history; others bring the results and methods of social history to bear on reading literature.|$|E

Again, his principal goal was to sell his lottery scheme to other governments and repeat the great success he had with the French government. But a meeting with Frederick the Great bore no fruit and in the surrounding German lands, the same result. Not lacking either connections or confidence, Casanova went to Russia and met with Catherine the <b>Great</b> <b>but</b> she flatly turned down the lottery idea.|$|E
25|$|Joseon {{was founded}} on Korean Confucianism, and these {{scholars}} of the time took a very dim view of professional women and of the kisaeng class in particular. There were many calls for {{the abolition of the}} kisaeng, or for their exclusion from court, but these were not successful—perhaps because of the influence of the women themselves, or perhaps because of fear that officials would take to stealing the wives of other men. One such proposal was made during the reign of Sejong the <b>Great,</b> <b>but</b> when an advisor of the court suggested that the abolition of the class would lead to government officials committing grave crimes, the king chose to preserve the kisaeng.|$|E
