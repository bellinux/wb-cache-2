5|$|On November 29, 1934, {{while the}} rest of the team was playing in Omiya, Berg went to Saint Luke's Hospital in Tsukiji, ostensibly to visit the {{daughter}} of American ambassador Joseph Grew. Instead, Berg sneaked onto the roof of the hospital, one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, and filmed the city and harbor with his movie camera. He never <b>did</b> <b>see</b> the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unconditional release. Berg continued on to the Philippines, Korea and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{originally}} place {{heavy emphasis on}} ethical issues, it <b>did</b> <b>see</b> the family as the cornerstone of society. By 1994, it had become more conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put {{in the context of}} a moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E

5|$|Although Oklahoma {{was not yet}} a state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area <b>did</b> <b>see</b> its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and around the turn of the century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They <b>did</b> <b>see</b> some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{completed}} {{one of five}} {{passes for}} 15yards in his first professional game against the Houston Oilers after coming in for Spurrier late in the game. The following week, the Buccaneers faced the San Diego Chargers. In that game, Dickinson again came into the game, rushing three times for 54yards and throwing an interception that was returned by Tom Hayes for a touchdown. He did not play against the Buffalo Bills the following week, but Spurrier ended up getting injured, meaning that Dickinson was slated to possibly get his first NFL start against the Baltimore Colts. Spurrier ended up starting the game, but Dickinson <b>did</b> <b>see</b> playing time against the Colts, completing one of five passes for 12yards and throwing an interception in a 4217 loss; he attempted only one pass the following week {{in a game against}} the Cincinnati Bengals.|$|E

Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent <b>did</b> <b>see</b> these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E
5|$|For {{a little}} more than two years after her February 1899 arrival, Bennington served in the Philippine Islands in support of the Army's campaigns during the Philippine–American War. For the most part, her service in the islands {{consisted}} of patrol and escort duty – preventing rebel movement and stopping the importation of arms, as well as seeing American troops and supplies safely between the islands. Occasionally, Bennington <b>did</b> <b>see</b> action. On 10 September, she shelled a fort near Legaspi on the southeastern coast of Luzon. Two days later, she captured and destroyed the insurgent vessel Parao. Between 7 and 9 November, the warship supported an Army landing at San Fabian on the shores of Lingayen Gulf in northwestern Luzon. The gunboat began a four-month assignment as station ship at Cebu on 26 November and concluded that duty on 19 March 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Clock Tower {{games have}} {{generally}} received mixed reviews. They are often praised for their {{high levels of}} presentation and horror elements, but criticized for their cumbersome and archaic gameplay. The first game is particularly notable for solidifying Human Entertainment as a developer and influencing the survival horror genre. Although no Clock Tower titles have been released since 2002, the series <b>did</b> <b>see</b> two spiritual successors. The first was {{in the form of}} Haunting Ground (2005) for the PlayStation 2 which was similar to Clock Tower 3. The second was NightCry (2016) for Windows, which was directed by Kono and crowdfunded through Kickstarter. A film based on the series was rumored from 2006 to 2011, but never materialized.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} used approximately 20 Tetrarchs {{during the}} British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. The tanks were successfully landed by glider, {{but they did}} not perform well. Several were lost in accidents, and those that <b>did</b> <b>see</b> action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces. A few days after the beginning of the operation, the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support. By August 1944, most of the Tetrarchs in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks, and the remainder were replaced by the M22 Locust in December 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactions}} of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settler's presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants' lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the Aborigines approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars <b>did</b> <b>see</b> the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many Aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{a member}} of the {{international}} coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team; in total about 750 personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait. Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units <b>did</b> <b>see</b> combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no-fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003.|$|E

5|$|Bob Stoops {{returned}} for his eighth season as Oklahoma's head coach. During the off-season, {{he was once}} again mentioned {{as a candidate for}} positions outside of Oklahoma. While Stoops decided to stay in Norman, the rest of the Oklahoma coaching staff <b>did</b> <b>see</b> some changes. The biggest change came at the offensive coordinator position. Former offensive coordinator Chuck Long left Oklahoma to take the head coaching job at San Diego State University. Stoops chose somebody already on the staff to fill Long's spot. Kevin Wilson was named the new offensive coordinator after previously serving as the co-offensive coordinator along with Long as well as the offensive line coach. Rejoining the staff was former Sooner quarterback Josh Heupel, who led Oklahoma to the 2000 National Championship. Heupel had served two years as a graduate assistant before taking a position with Mike Stoops, Bob Stoops's brother, at the University of Arizona in 2005. Heupel took over Long's old position of quarterback coach. Leaving the staff was Darrell Wyatt, who spent four years as the wide receivers coach. He took a position with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. This move launched another reshuffle of duties on Stoops's staff. Coach Kevin Sumlin took over Wyatt's duties with the wide receivers and was also named co-offensive coordinator with Wilson. Coach James Patton was hired on from Northwestern to take over Wilson's duties with the offensive line.|$|E
5|$|Burnley's league {{campaign}} {{began on}} 28August 1920 {{with a home}} match against Bradford City, who had finished 15th {{in the league in}} 1919–20. The season began inauspiciously for Burnley, beaten 1–4, but the match <b>did</b> <b>see</b> eventual top scorer Joe Anderson score the first of his 25league goals of the campaign. Two further away defeats followed, 0–1 at Huddersfield Town and 0–2 at Bradford City, leaving Burnley {{at the bottom of the}} league table. This run of defeats was Burnley's worst start to a league season since 1906–07, when they also lost their opening three matches. Manager Haworth subsequently made several changes to the team; goalkeeper Jerry Dawson and defender Tommy Boyle were reinstated, while Bert Freeman and James Lindsay were dropped in favour of Billy Nesbitt and Benny Cross respectively. Burnley picked up their first win on 6September 1920, beating Huddersfield Town 3–0 at Turf Moor; the goalscorers were Bob Kelly, Tommy Boyle, and Billy Nesbitt. They went on to defeat Middlesbrough 2–1 at home, and to draw with them 0–0 at Ayresome Park. On 25September 1920, four players scored in a 4–0 victory against a weakened Chelsea team, giving Burnley their third successive home win.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{some good}} {{performances}} in the 1972–73 season, notably a 5–0 home win against Manchester United in December, Palace succumbed to the drop in their fourth season in the top division. Arthur Wait, having overseen {{the rise of the}} club from Fourth to First, was replaced as Chairman by Raymond Bloye in November 1972 and the club appointed Malcolm Allison in March the following year, replacing Bert Head. Although the club saw a record average attendance over the season, neither the crowd nor the managerial change were able to keep the club at the top level. Allison's first game in charge <b>did</b> <b>see</b> some changes, however. He gave young Scottish defender Jim Cannon his debut in the home game against Chelsea. Palace had never won a London derby in the top flight to this point, but Cannon, who had risen through the youth ranks at Palace, marked Blues striker Peter Osgood out of the game and then scored the second goal in a 2–0 win to begin a long career in SE25.|$|E

5|$|From 1870 until 1901, {{each of the}} six colonial governments was {{responsible}} for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s—including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units—they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently <b>did</b> <b>see</b> action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with the colonies raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China.|$|E
5|$|In September 1906, Jean Cras was {{assigned}} to the ship. By 1908, Masséna had been withdrawn from service and placed in the Reserve Squadron, along with five other old battleships. Masséna remained on active duty until 1913, when she was withdrawn and placed out of service. She was reduced to a hulk in 1915. That year, the Triple Entente had launched an invasion at Gallipoli in an attempt to capture Constantinople, knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war, and open a route to supply Russia via the Dardanelles. Too old for active service, Masséna did not take part in the ensuing Gallipoli Campaign, which had stalled by the end of 1915, having made no significant progress. The Entente decided to withdraw from the operation, and the old battleship <b>did</b> <b>see</b> some use here. Masséna was towed from Toulon to Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula {{at the end of the}} year, and scuttled there on 9 November to form a breakwater to protect the evacuation effort that withdrew the Allied expeditionary force in January 1916.|$|E
5|$|SMS Kaiser was a 92-gun {{wooden ship}} {{of the line}} of the Austrian Navy, the last vessel of the type, and the only screw-driven example, to be built by the Austrians. She was built by the naval {{shipyard}} in Pola; she was laid down in March 1855, was launched in October 1858, and was completed the following year. The ship took part in the Second Schleswig War of 1864, but saw no action during her deployment to the North Sea. Kaiser <b>did</b> <b>see</b> action during the Seven Weeks' War two years later, during which she took part in the Battle of Lissa as the flagship of Anton von Petz, commander of the Austrian 2nd Division. Kaiser engaged several Italian ironclads simultaneously, rammed oneand damaged anotherwith gunfire. In doing so, she became the only wooden ship of the line to engage an ironclad warship in battle.|$|E
