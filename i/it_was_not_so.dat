Another prominent building exhibiting this style is the former Times Furnishing Company store on the High Street in Birmingham, now a Waterstone's store. The building was completed in 1938 to a design by Burnett and Eprile.|$|E

Kawaguchi invented a welding-free ball joint to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the frame on the ground before raising it using jacks.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Díaz was never sympathetic to all Indians. In fact, {{he stated that}} the Yaquis and the Mayas {{had always been a}} pest for Mexico and that they needed to be dealt with. This {{is not to say that}} Díaz loved the rest of Mexico’s Indians. Perhaps, it could be argued that Díaz’s ultimate drive was that of economic expansion. Once Díaz amassed absolute legislative power, his indigenismo went out of the picture. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much about elevating the lower classes into modern society and thus integrating them, but more about the economic and power status of the nation. After all, Indians composed less than half of Mexico’s population and their unwillingness to participate in the dominant culture made them political enemies of the state, especially those who persistently refused assimilation like the Yaqui and the Maya.|$|E
25|$|In Milan, Neoclassicism began a {{few years}} later than in its main European counterparts, mainly {{as a result of the}} {{problems}} of succession to the thone of the Austrian empire, with Maria Theresa's lengthy reign. Initially, Neoclassicism in Milan, like the artists who practiced <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much inspired by the classical models of Ancient Rome or Roman Neoclassicism as by developments in London, Paris and Parma. It was a period of great public works covering theatres, libraries and schools, and more generally of important works for the public good, reflecting the ambitions of an enlightened government. It was a period in which the State and the government itself led the city's cultural life and progress, promoting and funding new activities and rewarding the most deserving citizens and achievements. During this initial period, Neoclassicism was characterized by a more sober and austere approach, resulting in symmetrical, well-ordered structures.|$|E

25|$|The GT5 Time Trial Demo was {{released}} on December 17, 2009 on the PlayStation Network; it was only playable while the user was signed into the PlayStation Network. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much a demo of GT5 itself, but actually {{the first part of}} the 2010 GT Academy, with the fastest drivers from the time trial eventually getting the chance to drive a real racing car in a real racing series. Nevertheless, it showed what progress had been made since Polyphony Digital's latest game, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in terms of graphics, physics and other aspects of gameplay and design. It featured stock and tuned versions of the Nissan 370Z. The track featured in the demo was the Indianapolis GP circuit, which is new to the Gran Turismo series. This demo was praised for its graphics and updated physics, however it has been criticised for its stiff camera, and confusion over what aspects of the final game the demo represents. The Time Trial demo is no longer playable now that the 2010 GT Academy is complete.|$|E

Writing in The American Prospect, Robert Kuttner argued <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of capital controls, which allowed capital flight from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to Gresham's law phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong currencies).|$|E

Only the [...] "draft" [...] characters' names remained of them when Kuroda has rewritten the script. A total of three character designers collaborated on Madlax cast: Satoshi Ohsawa (who also worked on Noir cast) created the central heroines Margaret and Madlax; Minako Shiba drew Friday Monday and Carrossea Doon; and Satoko Miyachi was entrusted with the [...] "mysterious" [...] characters, Laetitia and Poupee.|$|E
500|$|The film shows novel {{techniques}} in film production {{that were used}} to assist the viewer in understanding the narrative. In the beginning of the film, when Harry and the thief struggle, a closeup shot is used to show the thief placing the purse into Harry's pocket. While the two struggle in the previous scene, the close-up shot has both men standing still. Charlie Keil, author of Early American Cinema in Transition, cites this as an attempt to improve the narrative by allowing a complex sequence of events to be examined intelligibly by the viewer. Keil also states that shot may have been done to lessen trade press objections to the close-up views by showing the value to the narrative development. When Harry is in jail, he imagines his mother, and this is shown by an inset at the upper right of film. Months after the film had been released, Robert Grau wrote a column in the Moving Picture World which praised the attention to detail in the production for a newspaper which was shown on camera for only a few seconds. Grau states, [...] "I was unable to discern in the few seconds the effect was on view, what means were taken to create the illusion ... and it is consoling to know that the producers of photoplays are aspiring to reach great heights in such matters." [...] An analysis of the frame shows that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much an illusion as pasting the headline on the edition of August 27, 1910 of the New York City Herald Tribune. The film also shows a real and dangerous stunt executed by Crane, where he is seen [...] "sliding 40 feet down a washline to liberty in a scene that couldn't have been faked." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the verdict}} of a {{successful}} D-Day for the 3rd CID, the failure of Canadian units to reach their final objectives has proven more disputed than {{the reasons for their}} success. Terry Copp places the blame on Keller, who committed the entirety of the 9th Brigade reserve to land on the narrower beaches of the 8th Brigade—which was itself still fighting to clear the seaside towns—after receiving reports of poor progress by the 7th Brigade. Dutch historian Dan Van der Vat notes that [...] "the planned breakout of the 9th Brigade was held up by a huge jam of vehicles". Wilmot also places the blame with logistical difficulties of the landing, saying that [...] "on the whole <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much the opposition in front as the congestion behind—on the beaches and in Bernières—that prevented the Canadians from reaching their final D-Day objective". Stacey offers a different view, suggesting that it was not impossible for the 3rd CID to reach its D-Day objectives, and that the failure to do so rests in the fact that [...] "British and Canadian forces were usually better at deceiving the enemy and achieving initial success in an assault than they were at exploiting surprise and success once achieved. Perhaps they were rather too easily satisfied". Copp disagrees with Stacey's assessment, suggesting that such caution was not the result of poor planning but of the fact that [...] "the British and Canadians fought the way they had been trained, moving forward to designated objectives in controlled bounds and digging in {{at the first sign of}} a counterattack". He also disputes whether the capture of the final objectives would have been strategically intelligent, observing that [...] "if 9th Brigade had reached Carpiquet and dug in, with artillery in position to offer support, the commander of the 26th Panzer Grenadiers might have followed orders and waited until a coordinated counterattack with other divisions had been organized. Such an attack might well have done far more damage to the Allied beachhead than the hastily improvised operation actually carried out [...] ".|$|E
