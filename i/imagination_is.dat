His {{interest}} is further {{fueled by the}} tales of a sailor's life that Augustus tells him. Pym decides to follow Augustus as a stowaway aboard the Grampus, a whaling vessel commanded by Augustus's father that is bound for the southern seas. Augustus helps Pym by preparing a hideout in the hold for him and smuggling Tiger, Pym's faithful dog, on board. Augustus promises to provide Pym with water and food until the ship is too far from shore to return, at which time Pym wants to reveal himself.|$|E
25|$|In the sequels it is {{made clear}} that the {{language}} of the hrossa is the primary Old Solar language, and that the languages of the other two species are late derivatives of it. This represents Lewis' view that the symbolic and mythopoeic <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> the primary language of the human mind and that scientific and technological analysis is a later development. In the essay Bluspels and Flalansferes: A Semantic Nightmare he argues that, though reason is the organ of truth, <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> the organ of meaning.|$|E
25|$|Reason and {{imagination}} rely on similar mental processes. <b>Imagination</b> <b>is</b> not only found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that phantasia (imagination: that which can hold images or phantasmata) and phronein (a type {{of thinking that}} can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both {{are related to the}} primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order {{of the things that are}} perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or logos. But this is not yet reason, because human <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> different.|$|E

[...] Geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> <b>are</b> constituted by shared assumptions and representations of power relations and conflicts in world politics within a certain geographical territory. [...] By critically analyzing how and why these <b>imaginations</b> <b>are</b> constructed, it is possible to reveal underlying power relations and to get a better understanding of various conflicts. Therefore, geopolitical <b>imaginations</b> <b>are</b> closely connected to the academic field of critical geopolitics.|$|R

25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} use {{memory and}} imagination to envision others’ experiences in their minds. As they do, possibilities {{come to the}} mind of the therapist that might not present themselves to the client: possibilities for potential re-interpretation, healing, meaning, relating, and discovery (knowledge). It is for these reasons that hermeneuts consider <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> so vital to not only reflexive development but it is vital to therapists as an intersubjective tool to help promote growth in clients by bringing “to mind what is presently absent", which helps establish some stability to one's knowledge and, in turn, establish personal truth and meaning about a self and his or her experiences. Finally, the knowledge produced from <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> only constitutive of a person's (client's) identity and experiences when that person marks that knowledge as meaningful to his- or herself, thus reinforcing the impact of co-created meaning in counseling.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the enemy}} is forced to attack the {{defensive}} trenches with conventional infantry assault (as during World War I) {{at the cost of}} terrible losses, without assistance of armored forces or line-of-sight firing guns. Because of the possibility of redeployment, significantly less manpower is required than the Maginot-like defenses. The semi-mobile engagement also psychologically preferable than the claustrophobic feeling of Maginot-like bunkers in long term. This type of defensive line required 5-10 times less manpower and concrete per kilometer than the Maginot or Siegfried line with equal (or more) effectiveness, but far more <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> required from the builders because every part of the line were inevitably unique design adapted to local conditions.|$|E
25|$|Another primary {{advantage}} to <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> that, {{though it is}} contextualized by physical elements and time, it is not entirely subject to them, therefore enabling the kind of creativity they need to imagine possibilities not readily visible in their physical world and further weigh alternatives. Put otherwise, imagination provides “the means for navigating between our experiences in conversations and practices, and the theories we develop about our selves, our lives, and our world.” Through discourse, it also enables people to envision the experiences of others in their minds and by so doing invoke a deeper understanding and empathy toward others. Martin and Sugarman write {{that this kind of}} empathic envisioning is instrumental to therapeutically conceptualizing and understanding the clients with which therapists work.|$|E

25|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding these reports are somewhat obscure and inconsistent. Several reports of “volcanic eruptions” in the Lassen area {{had appeared in}} Northern California newspapers in the 1850s, but Harkness was probably unaware of them. In the earliest of these, published in the August 21, 1850, edition of the Daily Pacific News, a San Francisco newspaper, an unnamed observer reported seeing an erupting volcano with “burning lava still running down the sides.” In 1859, the San Francisco Times printed an article in which Wozencraft and a companion were purported to have seen, from a position somewhere west of the Lassen area, flames in the sky that they attributed to a volcanic eruption. This article was widely reprinted and popularized in other papers, but no specific date or location was given for their sighting. The Shasta Republican noted on several occasions in April 1859 (referring to Wozencraft) that the Dr.’s <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> far more active than any volcano in our County or State. It was in Harkness’ 1875 report that the date of Wozencraft’s observation is first mentioned to be the winter of 1850–1851.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his <b>imagination.</b> <b>Is</b> it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
500|$|Jassin {{writes that}} [...] "Langit Makin Mendung", {{as a result}} of its author's <b>imagination,</b> <b>is</b> not dogma, history, ethics, or an {{objective}} reality, but a work within its own world. As a result, Allah, Muhammad, and other religious figures are fictional characters and not representative of their counterparts. He further argues that [...] "Langit Makin Mendung" [...] is not written as an insult, but social criticism on perceived mistakes and corruption during the Sukarno period. He draws on parallels between [...] "Langit Makin Mendung", Dante's Divine Comedy, and Allama Muhammad Iqbal's Javid Nama, focusing on the journey of a person and a guide, with objections being raised due to readers identifying imagination with religion.|$|E

Lanois took adverse measures to encourage his writing, such as destroying his much-used telephone in the nearby woods and, on one occasion, nailed the studio door shut to lock him inside.|$|E
500|$|French {{researcher}} Victor T. Junod was {{the first}} to describe symptoms of narcosis in 1834, noting [...] "the functions of the brain are activated, <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> lively, thoughts have a peculiar charm and, in some persons, symptoms of intoxication are present." [...] Junod suggested that narcosis resulted from pressure causing increased blood flow and hence stimulating nerve centers. Walter Moxon (1836–1886), a prominent Victorian physician, hypothesized in 1881 that pressure forced blood to inaccessible parts of the body and the stagnant blood then resulted in emotional changes. The first report of anesthetic potency being related to lipid solubility was published by Hans H. Meyer in 1899, entitled Zur Theorie der Alkoholnarkose. Two years later a similar theory was published independently by Charles Ernest Overton. What became known as the Meyer-Overton Hypothesis may be illustrated by a graph comparing narcotic potency with solubility in oil.|$|E

The critic for The Times was largely unimpressed with You Only Live Twice, complaining that [...] "as a moderate to middling travelogue what follows will just about do... the plot with its concomitant sadism does not really get going until more than half way through". In contrast to the previous novels, The Times continued, [...] "though Mr. Fleming's macabre <b>imagination</b> <b>is</b> as interesting as ever, some of the old snap seems to have gone".
