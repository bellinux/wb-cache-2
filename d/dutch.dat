5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of <b>Dutch,</b> English and Federal styles, {{although}} <b>Dutch</b> brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the <b>Dutch</b> style was said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it would {{have been one of the}} last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative <b>Dutch</b> culture of Albany at that time.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Dutch</b> forces massacred 10,000 ethnic Chinese in Batavia (now Jakarta), a {{group of}} {{survivors}} led by Khe Pandjang headed east for Semarang. Despite being warned of the impending uprising, {{the head of the}} <b>Dutch</b> East India Company's military Bartholomeus Visscher ignored his advisers and did not prepare reinforcements. As the situation developed, the court of , Sunan of Mataram, decided to tentatively support the Chinese while seemingly helping the <b>Dutch.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements {{from the}} colonial headquarters at Batavia, the <b>Dutch</b> launched an attack in 1635 {{and were able}} to crush opposition and bring the area around present-day Tainan fully under their control. After seeing Mattau and Soulang, the most powerful villages in the area, defeated so comprehensively, many other villages in the surrounding area came to the <b>Dutch</b> to seek peace and surrender sovereignty. Thus the <b>Dutch</b> were able to dramatically expand the extent of their territorial control in a short time, and avoid the need for further fighting. The campaign ended in February 1636, when representatives from twenty-eight villages attended a ceremony in Tayouan to cement <b>Dutch</b> sovereignty.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in August 1945, {{a number}} of native Indonesian employees of Nippon Eigasha formed Berita Film Indonesia, which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly proclaimed Indonesian government. During the ensuing revolution, allied <b>Dutch</b> and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The <b>Dutch</b> took over the studio, and production of newsreels at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the <b>Dutch</b> established a subsidiary company to produce fictional films. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised {{in part by the}} Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, a continuation of the former <b>Dutch</b> colonial government of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|After {{the devastating}} bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe, the Germans {{threatened}} to bomb other <b>Dutch</b> cities if the <b>Dutch</b> forces refused to surrender.

5|$|Against this {{background}} the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor {{participants in the}} negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free English shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the <b>Dutch</b> even being consulted. The <b>Dutch</b> ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the <b>Dutch</b> plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the <b>Dutch</b> colonies, and that France had promised {{not to make a}} separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the <b>Dutch</b> were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt to deduct the value of the <b>Dutch</b> fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Dutch</b> forces {{conquered the}} {{towns and cities}} in Republican heartlands on Java and Sumatra, they could not control villages and the countryside. Republican troops and militia led by Lt. Colonel (later President) Suharto {{attacked}} <b>Dutch</b> positions in Yogyakarta at dawn on 1 March 1949. The <b>Dutch</b> were expelled from the city for six hours but reinforcements were brought in from the nearby cities of Ambarawa and Semarang that afternoon. Indonesian fighters retreated at 12:00pm and the <b>Dutch</b> re-entered the city. The Indonesian attack, later known in Indonesia as Serangan Oemoem (new spelling: Serangan Umum '1 March General Offensive'), is commemorated by a large monument in Yogyakarta. A similar attack against <b>Dutch</b> troops in Surakarta was led by Lt. Col. Slamet Riyadi on 7 August the same year.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought hard, they were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while the <b>Dutch</b> sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled House of Orange. In addition, the <b>Dutch</b> were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and the <b>Dutch</b> ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a shallower draught, a necessity in the shallow waters of the <b>Dutch</b> coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. The <b>Dutch</b> did, however, have the advantage of weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between their larger companions.|$|E

5|$|As for {{the battle}} losses, sources vary. The Flemish Protestant Guillaume Baudart set <b>Dutch</b> losses at 88 horses, 83 prisoners and 24 killed. The Italian Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio claimed {{that more than}} 300 <b>Dutch</b> {{soldiers}} were slain as opposed to about 60 Spanish casualties. The Roman Jesuit Angelo Gallucci also wrote of 300 <b>Dutch</b> casualties. The Spanish soldier and writer Carlos Coloma set the Spanish loss as 19 men killed and claimed that the <b>Dutch</b> force lost three flags and about 400 serviceable horses. On the Spanish side the only soldiers of note among the casualties were Caraffa, Martinengo and Caracciolo, {{all of whom were}} wounded, but not mortally. Joseph de La Pise stated that the <b>Dutch</b> took seven Spanish prisoners and 15 horses. According to Antonio Carnero, accountant in the Spanish army, an envoy of the King of France to the <b>Dutch</b> camp was present at the battle and found later among the fatalities.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} <b>Dutch</b> were winning the action, but after {{they put in}} {{disorder}} two or three Spanish squadrons, Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a <b>Dutch</b> squadron, which allowed Córdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack, this time with success. Despite the stubborn resistance offered by the <b>Dutch</b> troops, they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river. Córdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up, and they found {{that some of the}} <b>Dutch</b> soldiers, having been unable to find a good place to ford the river, had drowned. The Spanish captives were freed, and the spoils taken by the <b>Dutch</b> recovered.|$|E
5|$|At {{midnight on}} 20 July 1947, the <b>Dutch</b> {{launched}} a major military offensive called Operatie Product, {{with the intent}} of conquering the Republic. Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the <b>Dutch</b> described the campaign as politionele acties ("police actions") to restore law and order. This used to be the task of the KNIL. However, at the time the majority of the <b>Dutch</b> troops in Indonesia belonged to the Royal Netherlands Army. Soon after the end of World War II, 25,000 volunteers (among them 5,000 marines) had been sent overseas. They were later followed by larger numbers of conscripts from the Netherlands. In the offensive, <b>Dutch</b> forces drove Republican troops out of parts of Sumatra, and East and West Java. The Republicans were confined to the Yogyakarta region of Java. To maintain their force in Java, now numbering 100,000 troops, the <b>Dutch</b> gained control of lucrative Sumatran plantations, and oil and coal installations, and in Java, control of all deep water ports.|$|E

5|$|Before Charles's restoration, the Navigation Acts of 1650 {{had hurt}} <b>Dutch</b> trade by giving English vessels a monopoly, and {{had started the}} First <b>Dutch</b> War (1652–1654). To lay {{foundations}} for a new beginning, envoys of the States General appeared in November 1660 with the <b>Dutch</b> Gift. The Second <b>Dutch</b> War (1665–1667) was started by English attempts to muscle in on <b>Dutch</b> possessions in Africa and North America. The conflict began well for the English, with the capture of New Amsterdam (renamed New York in honour of Charles's brother James, Duke of York) and a victory at the Battle of Lowestoft, but in 1667 the <b>Dutch</b> launched a surprise attack on England (the Raid on the Medway) when they sailed up the River Thames to where {{a major part of}} the English fleet was docked. Almost all of the ships were sunk except for the flagship, Royal Charles, which was taken back to the Netherlands as a trophy.

5|$|Between 23 and 27 September 1830, heavy {{fighting}} {{took place between}} <b>Dutch</b> forces and Brussels revolutionaries, who were reinforced by small contingents from across the country.

The Provisional Government of Belgium, led by Charles Rogier, was formed on 24 September and Belgian independence was officially proclaimed on 4 October while work began on creating a constitution. In December, international governments at the Conference of London recognized the independence of Belgium and guaranteed its neutrality. The <b>Dutch,</b> however, only recognized Belgium's independence and the terms of the Conference in 1839 and the Dutch-Belgian frontier was only fixed by the 1843 Treaty of Maastricht.|$|E
5|$|By March 1906 {{the other}} kingdoms had all fallen, leaving Tiku {{as the last}} Torajan lord.

Aware of Tiku's gathered forces and numerous fortresses, Kilian did not attempt a direct attack. Instead, in April 1906 he sent an expeditionary party to Tondon. Although the party's approach was not resisted, after nightfall Tiku's troops attacked the <b>Dutch</b> camp in Tondon; this forced the <b>Dutch</b> forces to retreat to Rantepao with Tiku's men in pursuit, suffering numerous casualties along the way.|$|E

5|$|By October 1797, {{the plan}} to attack Ireland had been {{abandoned}} and the British North Sea Fleet was again at full strength. During a brief period replenishing supplies at Yarmouth, news reached Duncan on 10 October that the <b>Dutch</b> had sailed on a raiding cruise and {{he returned to the}} <b>Dutch</b> coast, intercepting de Winter's fleet on its way back to the Texel. The <b>Dutch</b> formed a line of battle in shallow coastal waters to meet Duncan's attack, which was conducted in a confused mass, the British fleet separating into two groups that struck the vanguard and rear of the <b>Dutch</b> fleet, overwhelming each in turn and capturing eleven ships, including de Winter's flagship Vrijheid. On the return journey, three of the captured ships were lost, and none of the surviving <b>Dutch</b> prizes was ever suitable for active service again. Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the battle as each fleet had been trained to aim at the hulls of their opponents, maximising the damage to personnel.|$|E
5|$|Despite Swedish {{hopes that}} the <b>Dutch</b> would not enter the conflict, they honored their 1649 treaty by sending a 45-ship relief fleet.

Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard, the <b>Dutch</b> withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed the <b>Dutch</b> out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the <b>Dutch</b> signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed the fragility of the Belgian position, and although the <b>Dutch</b> finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg.
