40|$|<b>Hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> is {{frequently}} observed {{in patients with}} chronic liver diseases. However, the exact mechanism underlying {{the high level of}} antibody formation is not fully understood. In our study, we provide evidence for the functional role of the liver and the stimulation of plasma cell proliferation in <b>hyperimmunoglobulinemia.</b> We collected sera from patients with chronic liver diseases, and the level of serum immunoglobulins in patients was examined; this was also investigated in animal models of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. An end-to-side microsurgical portacaval shunt was used to mimic liver dysfunction in rats. We used portal vein serum and inferior vena cava serum to immunize healthy rats and mice in order to confirm the function of the healthy liver in disposing of antigens and endotoxins from the gut. For the analysis of the state of plasma cell activation, plasma cells from mice were stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD 138 and FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU for flow cytometry analysis. <b>Hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> was observed both in patients with chronic liver diseases and in related animal models, and high plasma LPS levels were also observed. There was {{a significant increase in the}} activation and proliferation of plasma cell in mice immunized with antigens or LPS-positive serum compared with controls that were immunized with antigens and LPS-negative serum. We confirmed that the healthy liver plays an important role in disposing of antigens and endotoxins derived from the gut. <b>Hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> in chronic liver diseases mainly arises due to the collateral circulation secondary to portal hypertension, gut antigens and endotoxins that bypass the liver and reach the antibody-producing cells...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: For {{some time}} {{it is known that}} cytokines and their receptors are encoded by highly {{polymorphic}} genes. These polymorphisms can be responsible for differences in the production of cytokines between individuals. Large number of the polymorphisms within the regulatory regions of the cytokine genes is in correlation with the production and there are variations among populations. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze association between polymorphisms in the IFN-gamma, IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 1 R, IL- 1 RA, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 4 Ralpha, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 12 B, TGF-beta 1 and TNF-alpha and <b>hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> E. Material and Methods: The study included 28 unrelated patients with high IgE levels in serum and the control group consisted of 301 unrelated healthy individuals. Cytokine genotyping was performed with PCR-SSP method. We analyzed the allele frequencies, genotypes, haplotypes and diplotypes of the cytokine genes. The differences were analyzed using χ 2 test, odds ratio and Confidence Interval. Results: Susceptible association with <b>hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> E was found for four different cytokine alleles (IL- 4 - 33 /T, TGF-beta 1 cdn 25 /C, IL- 1 alpha - 889 /T andTNF-alpha - 238 /A), ten different genotypes (IL 4 - 1098 /G:G, IL 4 - 33 /T:T, IL- 1 alpha - 889 /C :T, IFN gamma utr 5644 /A:T, TGF-beta 1 cdn 25 /C:G, IL- 6   - 174 /G:G, IL- 1 beta - 511 /C:T, IL- 10 - 1082 /A:G, TNF alpha - 238 /A:G andIL- 1 beta + 3962 /C:T) and five different combinations of haplotypes (IL- 4 /GTT, IL- 4 /TCT, IL- 6 /TCC, TNF-alpha/GA and TGF-beta 1 /CC). Protective association with <b>hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> E was found in four cytokine alleles (IL- 4 - 33 /C, TGF-beta 1 cdn 25 /G, IL- 1 alpha - 889 /C andTNF-alpha - 238 /G), three genotypes (IL- 10 - 1082 /A:A, IL- 1 alpha - 889 /C:C i IL 4 - 33 /C:C) and for only one haplotype (IL- 4 /GCC).

40|$|Leslie A Favier, Grant S Schulert Division of Rheumatology, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA Abstract: Mevalonate kinase {{deficiency}} (MKD) is a recessively inherited autoinflammatory disorder with {{a spectrum}} of manifestations, including the well-defined clinical phenotypes of <b>hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> D and periodic fever syndrome and mevalonic aciduria. Patients with MKD have recurrent attacks of hyperinflammation associated with fever, abdominal pain, arthralgias, and mucocutaneous lesions, and more severely affected patients also have dysmorphisms and central nervous system anomalies. MKD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding mevalonate kinase, with the degree of residual enzyme activity largely determining disease severity. Mevalonate kinase {{is essential for the}} biosynthesis of nonsterol isoprenoids, which mediate protein prenylation. Although the precise pathogenesis of MKD remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that deficiency in protein prenylation leads to innate immune activation and systemic hyperinflammation. Given the emerging understanding of MKD as an autoinflammatory disorder, recent treatment approaches have largely focused on cytokine-directed biologic therapy. Herein, we review the current genetic and pathologic understanding of MKD, its various clinical phenotypes, and the evolving treatment approach for this multifaceted disorder.

Mutations in the gene encoding mevalonate kinase constitute the molecular defect in HIDS. The cause of elevated IgA concentrations in HIDS patients remains to be elucidated. We studied the hyper-IgA response in serum of a group of HIDS patients. Elevated IgA concentrations result from increased IgA 1 concentrations.

40|$|Host versus graft {{disease is}} the fatal {{syndrome}} of altered immunity {{that follows the}} perinatal inoculation of related F 1 hybrid spleen cells to susceptible strains of inbred mice. The allogenic reaction results in severe depletion of T-lymphocytes, but causes hyperplasia and hypersecretion of B-cells. Among the long-term survivors of acute host versus graft reactions, {{there is a high}} incidence of nonthymic lymphomas associated with ecotropic murine leukemia virus that may be of donor F 1 origin. The present studies were done to determine whether ecotropic murine leukemia virus played any role in the pathogenesis of acute host versus graft disease in RFM mice perinatally inoculated with (T 6 X RFM) F 1 spleen cells. In RFM/(T 6 X RFM) F 1 chimeras, N-tropic murine leukemia virus can be detected as early as 3 days. The progression of the disease was accompanied by increasing viral expression. The inoculation of N-tropic virus of F 1 donor origin into RFM neonates failed to induce disease, although the virus proliferated. Detection of progressively rising titers of antibody to murine leukemia virus linked the virus to the development of <b>hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> by virtue of its ability to serve as a replicating source of antigens. These and other studies provided evidence that the seemingly paradoxical appearance of <b>hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> in T-cell-deficient mice with the host versus graft syndrome is due, at least in part, to the stimulation of presensitized F 1 donor B-cells, which are not destroyed in the allogenic reaction, as are the T-cells.

40|$|The {{hereditary}} autoinflammatory diseases {{arise from}} mutations of genes regulating the innate immune system. These rare disorders are well characterized, both clinically {{and in terms}} of their molecular pathogenesis. The recurrent attacks of febrile polyserositis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) are due to defective pyrin, a protein that down-regulates inflammation. The <b>Hyperimmunoglobulinemia</b> D Syndrome (HIDS), which mimics FMF, results from a genetically conferred deficiency of mevalonate kinase.

Three other hereditary disorders which overlap in their clinical expression - Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome, the Muckle Wells syndrome, and Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflamatory Disease (NOMID) - are a consequence of gain-of-function mutations of the gene encoding cryopyrin, the scaffolding protein of the inflammasome.
