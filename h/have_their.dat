40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the inflammatory response of potentially infected wounds treated with isotonic saline solution, chlorhexidine and PVP-I, seven days after surgery. METHODS: Thirty-two male rats were used, divided into 4 groups. All animals <b>had</b> <b>their</b> surgical wounds infected {{with a standard}} bacterial inoculum. Control group (A) : animals <b>had</b> <b>their</b> surgical wounds sutured without any kind of cleaning.
