50|$|A {{soft starter}} {{continuously}} controls the three-phase motor’s voltage supply during the start-up phase. This way, the motor is {{adjusted to the}} machine’s load behavior. Mechanical operating equipment is accelerated smoothly. This lengthens service life, improves operating behavior, and smooths work flows. Electrical soft starters can use solid state devices to control the current flow and therefore the voltage applied to the motor. They can be connected in series with the line voltage applied to the motor, or can be connected inside the delta (Δ) loop of a <b>delta-connected</b> <b>motor,</b> controlling the voltage applied to each winding. Solid state soft starters can control one or more phases of the voltage applied to the induction motor with the best results achieved by three-phase control. Typically, the voltage is controlled by reverse-parallel-connected silicon-controlled rectifiers (thyristors), but in some circumstances with three-phase control, the control elements can be a reverse-parallel-connected SCR and diode.|$|E

Power consumption is therefore {{lower than in}} unregulated operation.

It will be shown in this paper that, the zero-sequence current waveform can be reliably used for identifying the induction motor's iron core saturation level. So in this work, simulations with the Finite Element Method and experimental testing are carried out, with the healthy induction motor operating under different load levels. The paper proposes a novel method called SLIM for reliable induction motor saturation level determination...|$|R
40|$|Lately, a new {{diagnostic}} mean {{has been}} introduced for reliable fault diagnosis in <b>delta-connected</b> induction <b>motors.</b> This diagnostic mean is the zero-sequence current frequency spectrum. Since this diagnostic mean successfully answers {{to a variety of}} reliability demands, a thorough investigation of its harmonic index has to be performed {{as a function of the}} rotor geometry. In this work, FEM sinulations have been performed for motors of different rotor slot numbers and the zero-sequence current spectra are studied with the application of the FFT. Finally, experimental testing is applied to verify the simulations results...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new {{diagnostic}} mean {{is introduced}} for accurate, reliable, and effective diagnosis of faults in <b>delta-connected</b> induction <b>motors.</b> This mean is the zero-sequence stator current spectrum. The study {{is carried out}} with analytical calculations and finite-element method simulations. Most common faults are examined for a 4 -kW cage induction motor. The analysis will reveal that the proposed mean is able to successfully identify the static eccentricity fault, even in induction motors which produce principal slot harmonics, the broken bar fault, the unbalanced voltage supply, and the stator interturn short-circuit. It will also be shown that through the proposed method, {{it is possible to}} distinguish the interturn short-circuit from the unbalanced voltage supply...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a fault {{mitigation}} {{method for}} delta-connected induction motor-drive systems under a two-phase open-delta faulty operating condition is analyzed and verified. More specifically, this fault mitigation technique {{can provide a}} set of almost balanced motor line currents, and significantly reduce torque ripples, even when the machine runs under the aforementioned two-phase open-delta faulty operating condition. This condition is analyzed using a Magnetic Equivalent Circuit (MEC) model. This model is developed for a <b>delta-connected</b> induction <b>motor</b> which is coupled to its drive system, including the fault mitigation controller. That is, the MEC model is linked to its associated PWM inverter to include the electronic switching effects. This global motor-inverter model was simulated in a Matlab-Simulink environment, under both healthy and faulty operating conditions, while the inverter is operated in both the open-loop scalar control and closed-loop vector control modes. The results obtained from the global model are compared in this thesis to the results obtained from the corresponding Time-Stepping Finite Element (TSFE) simulation and experimental motor-drive test data. A comparative analysis of the motor performance obtained from these results, under the two-phase open-delta faulty operating case, is presented in this work. The simulation an...|$|R
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this dissertation is the conception {{and development of}} a new control strategy that allows <b>Delta-connected</b> induction <b>motors</b> to operate under a faulty two-phase open-Delta mode of operation with a resulting performance characterized by nearly balanced line currents and acceptable levels of torque pulsations in either the open-loop mode of operation, or the vector-controlled closed-loop mode of operation. The main aim and accomplishment of this control strategy is to maintain a quality of performance of a two-phase open-Delta mode of operation of a faulty motor {{as close as possible to}} the quality of performance of such a motor under normal healthy three-phase Delta-connection. Hence, one anticipates that such a procedure would be triggered after the process of isolating the faulty phase is accomplished successfully. Typical applications that can rely on the benefits of this newly introduced control strategy are in cases that involve open-coil faults that may occur due to internal winding rupture, loose internal connections, or in cases that involve an inter-turn short-circuit fault that has been diagnosed and successfully isolated in an incipient stage. This control topology does not require any hardware modification or even oversizing of the drive. However, oversizing of the motor may be necessarily if it is required to develop the motor 2 ̆ 7 s rated power under this faulty two-phase open-Delta mode of operation. Another advantage of this newly conceived control strategy is that it can be enabled in the three-phase normal mode of operation as well as the two-phase open-Delta mode of operation with hardly any transient disturbance affecting the quality of the torque or the balanced line currents. Thus, this newly conceived control strategy enhances the 2 ̆ 2 robustness 2 ̆ 2 of the system. This is because this control strategy avoids transients that may occur during the transfer between a control algorithm that is provided to control the machine under a healthy operating condition, and another control algorithm that is provided to control the machine under a faulty operating condition 2 ̆ 2 fault mitigation algorithm 2 ̆ 2. The newly conceived control strategy was thoroughly explained and successfully verified through numerous results obtained from several simulation runs and corresponding experimental tests in this dissertation...|$|R
40|$|Household {{appliances}} utilize {{single-phase motors}} to perform everyday jobs {{whether it is}} to run a fan in an air conditioner or the compressor in a refrigerator. With {{the movement of the}} world going “green” and trying to make everything more efficient, it is a logical step to start with the items that we use every day. This can be done by replacing single-phase motors with three-phase motors in household appliances. Three-phase motors are 14 % more efficient than single-phase motors when running at full load and typically cost less over a large range of sizes [1]. One major downside of incorporating three-phase motors in household appliance is that three-phase power is not readily available in homes. With the motor replacement, a single to three-phase converter is necessary to convert the single-phase wall power into the required three-phase input of the motor. One option is active conversion, which uses switches and introduces different stages that produce power loss [2]. An alternative solution is passive conversion that utilizes the resistances within the motor windings along with additional capacitors and inductors, which in theory are lossless. This study focuses on three different single to three-phase passive converters to run both wye and <b>delta-connected</b> three-phase induction <b>motors,</b> and a possible third winding configuration that utilizes one of the three converters. There will be an emphasis on proving the equivalency of two converters, one proposed by Stuart Marinus and Michel Malengret [11] and the other by Otto Smith [12]. Sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effects of variation of torque and converter component tolerances on the system...|$|R
