2500|$|Over 121,000 {{people in}} need of an organ are on the U.S. {{government}} waiting list. This crisis within the United States is growing rapidly because on average there are only 30,000 transplants performed each year. More than 8,000 people die each year from lack of a donor organ, an average of 22 people a day. Between the years 1988 and 2006 the number of transplants doubled, {{but the number of}} patients waiting for an organ grew six times as large. It has been estimated that the number of organs donated would double if every person with suitable organs decided to donate. In the past presumed consent was urged to try to decrease the need for organs. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1987 was adopted in several states, and allowed medical examiners to determine if organs and tissues of cadavers could be donated. By the 1980s, several states adopted different laws that allowed only certain tissues or organs to be retrieved and donated, some allowed all, and some did not allow any without consent of the family. In 2006 when the UAGA was revised, the idea of presumed consent was abandoned. In the United States today, organ donation is done only with consent of the family or <b>donator</b> themselves. According to economist Alex Tabarrok, the shortage of organs has increased the use of so-called expanded criteria organs, or organs that used to be considered unsuitable for transplant. Five patients that received kidney transplants at the University of Maryland School of Medicine developed cancerous or benign tumors which had to be removed. The head surgeon, Dr. Michael Phelan, explained that [...] "the ongoing shortage of organs from deceased donors, and the high risk of dying while waiting for a transplant, prompted five donors and recipients to push ahead with the surgery." [...] Several organizations such as the American Kidney Fund are pushing for opt-out organ donation in the United States.|$|E

Definitions of the most commonly used terms in the first part help to organize these terms {{for the purposes of this}} work. Historical overview follows, bringing insight into development of some types of motivations in the context of the whole society of given era and their impact on present <b>donator?s</b> thinking. Motivations are declared on particular historical examples from our territory and abroad. The third part categorizes and describes the most frequent kinds of motivations of modern <b>donators</b> and presents representative examples. The aim of this work is to find and systematize the most common reasons <b>donators</b> have to donate funds, materials, know-how or time to the arts and culture. Creating compact overview of these motivations might be useful for cultural organizations in their endeavor to obtain and maintain donors...|$|R

It is true, Christ {{in the text}} speaks more like an {{arbitrator}} than an Advocate; more like a judge than one pleading at a bar. I will have it so; I judge that so it ought to be, and must. But there is also something of plea in the words both before his Father, and against our enemy; and therefore he speaketh like one that can plead and determine also; yea, like one that has power so to do. But shall the will of heaven stoop {{to the will of}} hell? Or the will of Christ to the will of Satan? Or the will of righteousness to the will of sin? Shall Satan, who is God's enemy, and whose charge wherewith he chargeth us for sin, and which is grounded, not upon love to righteousness, but upon malice against God's designs of mercy, against the blood of Christ, and the salvation of his people-I say, shall this enemy and this charge prevail with God against the well-grounded plea of Christ, and against the salvation of God's elect, and so keep us out of heaven? No, no; Christ will have it otherwise, he is the great <b>donator,</b> 8 and his eye is good. True, Satan was turned out of heaven for that he sinned there, and we must be taken into heaven, though we have sinned here; this is the will of Christ, and, as Advocate, he pleads it against the face and accusation of our adversary. Thus, [...] "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." [...] But, ...|$|E

40|$|Religious and lay fraternities {{played an}} {{important}} role on the religious, social and cultural scene of the towns as they could take part in activities of municipal administration authorities and also influence activities of municipal school. Activities of fraternities were mainly a matter of their own members, but some actions of ceremonial character grew into a „citywide“ event or at least they were reflected by most of the municipality. This contribution focuses on the fraternities in royal towns of the North-western Bohemia, which due to their different denomination, nationality and social-economical conditions provide a wide range of modifications of given topic. Five royal towns are concerned – {{from the point of view}} of its importance headed by the town of Litoměřice and Žatec, followed by the town of Kadaň, Most, Louny and Ústí nad Labem. The aim of this contribution is not a mapping of activities of these fraternities, but a mapping of their <b>donators</b> – it means those burghers, who decided to support the fraternities by a legacy of a part of their property regardless whether they were members of fraternities or just supporters. The method is based on studying burghers´testaments which were preserved in the form of documents or as records in municipal books in the particular localities from the period of the 16 and 17 century. For acquiring enough information on the <b>donators</b> of fraternities we used almost 1800 last wills, when about 5 % of testaments contain legacies to fraternities. The legacies were mostly of financial character. Amounts of money ranged from 2 to 130 threescores (1 threescore= 60 pieces) of Meissen groschen. Some of financial gifts were exactly intended for example for hymnbooks, wax, candles or books. Beside the money there were bequeathed also wages, real estates or beverages (beer, wine). Absolute majority of <b>donators</b> of municipal corporations came from middle class, they were mostly artisans with one house in a town or in a suburb, although legacies from socially lower class were registered too. In the town of Žatec an exceptional situation occured, where <b>donators</b> of literary fraternities came from families materially and intelectually belonging to municipal elites. More than half of <b>donators</b> did not have their own families. Widowed people, particularly widows comprised a distinct proportion among these people. Women comprised a half of <b>donators</b> in all studied towns, sometimes the number of them was slightly higher than a half. Half of the <b>donators</b> bequeathed certain part of their properties to the church, guild, they donated to the hospital or they supported realization of some buildings beneficial for public. For answering question such as how was activity of corporations reflected or appreciated by a municipal community, testaments could give only partial answer. If one tries to get more integral picture it is necessary to take into account also other types of resources...|$|R

Another variation concerns {{the information about the}} multiplier of donations where we compare the benchmark case with a commonly known multiplier to a condition where the multiplier is known for sure only by <b>donators.</b> Questions which we try to answer are: Will indirect reciprocity induce higher or lower donations?, will <b>donators</b> with the high multiplier "hide behind the small one?", how do receivers respond to the different situations...|$|R
