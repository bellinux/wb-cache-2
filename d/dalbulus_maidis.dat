VIRLA Anagrus breviphragma Soyka 1955 is a wide distributed and polyphagous species that, in northern Argentina is a common egg parasitoid of the corn leafhopper <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>Maidis</b> De Long & Wolcott. Considering {{the lack of information}} about this wasp and the economic significance of its hosts, the purpose of this contribution was to provide data of its biology. A. breviphragma culture was established in a climatic cell (25 ± 2 °C, 70 - 75 % RH and 14 L: 10 D h of artificial photoperiod). Data obtained from distinct matura-tion stages of the exposed host eggs were analyzed. The eggs-laying behavior was des-cribed. This wasp is solitary and proovigenic, without a preovipositional period. A. beviphragma parasitized eggs that were only 1 - 3 day-old, and was not able to mature in eggs containing advances embryos. In laboratory, the measured average of parasitims was 66. 5 %. The developmental time of A. breviphragma is around 16. 5 days, and fema-les reached the adult stage significantly faster than males. This species also developed faster in one-day-old eggs than in two-old, and in those of two-days-old faster than in three-days-old eggs. Adult longevity averages 5 days while few individuals surviving more than 12 days; females lived longer than males. The obtained sex ratio showed a predominance of melaes over males...|$|E
40|$|Maize Bushy Stunt and Corn Stunt are {{diseases}} of corn caused respectively by a phytoplasma (maize bushy stunt phytoplasma) and by Spiroplasma kunkelii. Both agents {{are restricted to}} the floem vessels of diseased plants. The leafhopper <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>maidis</b> is the vector of the diseases. The diseases are very harmfull to corn crops and can cause severe losses. Their importance increased {{very much in the}} last years mainly due to the continuous crops, which allow the perpetuation of corn, pathogens and vector over the year. Diseased plants show shortening, redening or yellowing and excessive proliferation of ears, among others symptoms. However, symptoms are variable according to the causal agent, environmental conditions and corn genotype. Correct diagnosis of the diseases has been reached with ELISA (“enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay”) and PCR (“polymerase chain reaction”). The use of resistant genotypes of corn is the main strategy of control of the diseases.

To study the losses it was used the crop life table. The average yield was high (3386. 59 kg/ha). The most productive cultivars were CO 34, Mitla 9742, XB 7012, HTEP 22, P 30 F 80, Hata 2025, and XB 7070. The total cumulative loss was 33. 92 %. The production component in which happened larger loss was the grain, followed by the ovules, plants, and ears. The critical component of losses was the grain. The key-factor of losses in the grains was the attack of Sitophilus zeamais (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) followed by the attack of Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Agromen 3150, CO 32, HTEP 22, Dina 1000, C 855, P 3027 and CO 9560 were the cultivars less attacked by S. zeamais, while AG 9010, XL 357, HTP 02, Agromen 3100, CO 9560 and P 30 F 80 were less damaged by H. zea. The cultivars HTEP 22 and P 30 F 80 were the most productive among the cultivars and less damaged by S. zeamais and H. zea, respectively. The insect-pests with highest densities on the canopies on the plant were <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>maidis</b> (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), Diabrotica speciosa adults (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and Spodoptera frugiperda larvae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The most abundant natural enemy was the predator Doru luteipes (Dermaptera: Forficulidae). The densities of these insects were similar among the cultivar...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how adults of the corn leafhopper, <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>maidis</b> (DeLong & Wolcott), and its {{congeners}} survive subfreezing temperatures at high elevations during the dry winter in Mexico. In the laboratory, duration of survival at- 5 ~ was measured for four Mexican Dalbulus species: D. maidis, D. elimatus (Ball), D. gelbus DeLong and D. quinquenotatus DeLong & Nault; and a closely related North American species, Baldulus tripsaci Kramer & Whitcomb. Adult leafhoppers eared under environmental conditions that simulated {{the beginning of the}} dry winter season during October in Mexico ('October-reared') were at least twice as tolerant of- 5 ~ than adults reared under environmental conditions that simulated the beginning of the wet summer season during June ('June-reared'). Dalbulus species found primarily at high elevations, uch as D. elimatus, were seven times more tolerant of- 5 ~ than D. quin-quenotatus, a species which overwinters at low to mid elevations on its Tripsacum hosts. October-reared D. maidis adults survived relatively short periods at- 5 ~ (LTs 0 = 8. 9 h) compared to October-reared D. elimatus adults (LTso = 42. 3 h). This suggests that in Mexico, D. maidis either overwinters inprotected habitats at higher elevations or it migrates to lower, frost-free regions. October-reared B. tripsaci adults, which overwinter in the egg stage, were intolerant of- 5 ~ (LTs 0 = 2. 6 h). A conditioning period for 1 h at + 5 ~ before and after exposure to- 5 ~ significantly improved survival for D. maidis. Super-cooling points (SCPs) were between- 23 and- 20 ~ indicating that mortality of these leafhoppers at- 5 ~ was due to cold shock injury rather than internal ice formation...|$|E

(Poaceae) and the {{specialist}} herbivore <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>maidis</b> (DeLong and Wolcott, 1923) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) {{were used to}} test the hypotheses that anti-herbivore defenses are affected by plant life-history evolution and human intervention through domestication and breeding for high yield. The suite of plants included a commercial hybrid maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.), a landrace maize, two populations of annual Balsas teosinte (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis Iltis & Doebley), and perennial teosinte (Z. diploperennis Iltis, Doebley & Guzman). Leaf toughness and pubescence, oviposition preference, and feeding and oviposition acceptance parameters were compared among the suite of host plants looking for effects of transitions in life history (perennial to annual teosinte), domestication (annual teosinte to landrace maize), and breeding (landrace maize to hybrid maize) on defenses against D. maidis. Observations on leaf toughness suggested that the life history and domestication transitions weakened the plant?s resistance to penetration by the herbivore?s mouthparts and ovipositor, as expected, while observations on pubescence suggested that the breeding transition led to stronger defense in hybrid maize compared to landrace maize, contrary to expectation. Observations on oviposition preference of D. maidis coincided with the expectations that life history and domestication transitions would lead to preference for Balsas teosinte over perennial teosinte, and of landrace maize over Balsas teosinte. A negative correlation suggested that oviposition preference is significantly influenced by leaf toughness. Observations on host plant feeding and iii oviposition acceptance under no-choice conditions suggested that D. maidis equally accepts all host plants considered in this study, thus these observations did not support the hypotheses associated with the life history, domestication, and breeding transitions evident in the herbivore?s host genus. Overall, {{the results of this study}} suggested that plant defenses against specialist herbivores are variably affected by plant life history evolution, domestication, and breeding. Additionally, the study?s results suggested that chemical defenses may play a role in Zea antiherbivore defense because the two physical defenses that were evaluated (i. e. leaf toughness and pubescence) only partially explained host preference of D. maidi...|$|E
40|$|Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV) {{was first}} {{isolated}} from the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi. RhPV, an icosahedral virus, belongs to the family Dicistroviridae. It has a 10 kb positive-sense RNA genome, with two viral open reading frames (ORFs). We have identified two cell lines, Z 10 - 2 and DMII derived from the homopterans, Homalodisca coagulata and <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>maidis</b> that are permissive for RhPV. Infection, viral replication and production of virions was confirmed by northern blot hybridization, RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunoelectron microscopy. A cell culture system that allows replication of the virus is crucial for further study of the biology of RhPV;The long term goal of this project is to produce aphid resistant transgenic plants that express RhPV. Acquisition of an infectious clone of RhPV is of primary importance for development of such an aphid resistance technology. A full-length cDNA clone of RhPV was constructed using overlapping reverse transcription PCR products. RNA transcribed from the full-length cDNA clone was infectious upon transfection into Z 10 - 2 and DMII cells, resulting in production of progeny virus phenotypically indistinguishable from the parent virus. The in vitro transcript caused the same cytopathic effects as those caused by transfection of cells with the viral RNA. The virus-like particles (VLPs) purified from the cells transfected with the full-length transcript were infectious to Z 10 - 2 cells and also to R. padi. The infectious cDNA clone of RhPV, together with the cell culture system, will provide valuable experimental tools {{for the study of}} replication and pathogenesis of RhPV;The recombinant baculovirus AcRhPV 6, which contains the cDNA of RhPV {{under the control of the}} polyhedrin promoter, was constructed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. Expression of the AcRhPV 6 in Sf 21 cells resulted in formation of RhPV VLPs, whose capsids are structurally and immunologically indistinguishable from the native virions. These results show that recombinant baculoviruses can be used to generate immunogenic VLPs of RhPV with some degree of infectivity to aphids. The baculovirus expression system represents an alternative tool for use in the study of the assembly and structure of viruses...|$|E
40|$|In one study, a {{suite of}} plants from the maize genus Zea L. (Poaceae) and the {{specialist}} herbivore <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>maidis</b> (DeLong and Wolcott, 1923) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) were {{used to test the}} hypotheses that anti-herbivore defenses are affected by plant life-history evolution and human intervention through domestication and breeding for high yield. The suite of Zea host plants included one Mexican commercial hybrid maize Zea mays ssp. mays L., a landrace variety of maize, two populations of Balsas teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis Iltis & Doebley), and perennial teosinte (Z. diploperennis Iltis, Doebley & Guzman). This suite of host plants includes three Transitions evident within the genus Zea: life history form perennial to annual life cycle evident between perennial teosinte and Balsas teosinte, domestication transition from wild annual to domesticated annual evident between Balsas teosinte and landrace maize, and; breeding transition from landrace cultivar to a hybrid cultivar. The transitions were correlated with differences in plant defenses, as indicated by corn leafhopper performance. Results showed a performance gradient, suggesting a pattern in which plant defense is stronger in perennial than annual plants, Balsas teosinte than landrace maize, and in landraces than in hybrid maize. Furthermore, results suggested that domesticated maize would be the least defended, most suitable host for corn leafhopper. In a second study, haplotype diversity was assessed to address structuring and interconnectedness among samples of corn leafhopper collected in the southwestern region of Mexico to address microevolution. The geographic focus of the study was maintained within an area encompassing the presumed centers of radiation of Dalbulus and its host genus Zea, and of maize domestication. Samples were complemented with samples of corn leafhopper sequences available at GenBank. Results revealed seven haplotypes from three host plants within Zea: perennial teosinte, Balsas teosinte, and maize. Furthermore, genetic differentiation was present and haplotype diversity appears to correlate with differences in genetic structure between perennial teosinte and maize. One haplotype was found to be present throughout all sites, which appears to parallel the spread of maize cultivation. As maize cultivation spread beyond its area of domestication, corn leafhoppers colonized perennial teosinte, further suggesting that subsequent decreases in maize cultivation in perennial teosinte habitat created a refuge where perennial teosinte- adapted haplotypes could persist. Altogether, my research suggests that the combination of historical expansion of maize cultivation expansion and the weaker anti-herbivore defenses associated within maize domestication appears to have favored genotypes particularly adapted for exploiting maize...|$|E
40|$|In one study, a {{suite of}} host plants from the genus Zea L. (Poaceae) and the {{specialist}} herbivore <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>maidis</b> (DeLong and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) were used to address whether plant tolerance to direct damage by the herbivore and seedling morphometry were mediated by plant domestication and genetic improvement. Additionally, the role of shoot: root ratios in plant tolerance was included in this study. Plant tolerance was measured as regrowth rate, and a trade-off between plant tolerance and resistance was predicted based on (i) the increasing investment in growth and productivity with evolutionary history in Zea and, (ii) its negative correlation with plant resistance. The effects of the domestication transition were assessed by contrasting Balsas teosinte (Z. mays L. ssp. parviglumis Iltis & Doebley) and maize (Z. mays L. ssp. mays), while breeding transition by contrasting maize landraces and maize inbred lines. The results showed that domestication and breeding mediated changes in seedling morphometry, but did not mediate changes in plant tolerance, with Balsas teosinte, maize landraces, and maize inbred lines similarly tolerant to feeding damage by D. maidis. In contrast, domestication mediated changes in shoot: root ratios, with larger roots in the maizes, suggesting increased storage capability in domesticated taxa. In another study, morphometrics analyses were performed on D. maidis specimens collected from Perennial teosinte [Zea diploperennis Iltis (Doebley & Guzman) ] and maize in western Mexico, {{to determine whether a}} correlation existed between previously documented genetic differentiation and morphological (morphometrical) differentiation. Traditional morphometrics was used to analyze body differences, and geometric morphometrics was applied for wing analysis. The results suggested that genetic and morphological differentiation are correlated in D. maidis, with individuals associated to Perennial teosinte exhibiting larger body size compared to individuals associated to maize. A strong host plant effect and a moderate habitat effect were detected, and body size was found to be as the variable explaining most of the variance between individuals. Wing differentiation between individuals associated with Perennial teosinte and maize was detected, but it was strongly correlated with allometry. It was hypothesized that different selection forces are acting on morphological and genetic differentiation because while morphological differentiation is maintained in locations where Perennial teosinte and maize coexist, genetic differentiation is lost in those locations. Overall, the study?s results suggested that evolutionary transitions in Zea have exerted changes in both the plant morphometry and insect morphology, with changes in the plant related to increased storage and productivity in roots, and changes in the insect related to overall body size...|$|E

Com esse objetivo, avaliaram-se em casa de vegetação, características fisiológicas de plantas de milho submetidas ou não à inoculação com molicutes e cultivadas sob diferentes níveis de água no solo, correspondentes à reposição de 40, 60, 80 e 100 % da disponibilidade total de água. Cada parcela {{experimental}} foi constituída por um vaso com duas plantas e repetida 6 vezes. Para inoculação, cigarrinhas <b>Dalbulus</b> <b>maidis,</b> vetor dos patógenos, coletadas em campo, foram confinadas nas plântulas por 7 dias. Foram avaliados os sintomas das doenças causadas por esses patógenos nas plantas de milho, sendo feita detecção de fitoplasma por PCR e de espiroplasma por Western blotting. A inoculação aumentou significativamente o potencial hídrico e a quantidade de água por unidade de matéria seca nas plantas. Esse efeito pode ser provavelmente atribuído à interferência dos patógenos na fisiologia das plantas, mediante produção de substâncias de crescimento, causando aumento na resistência estomática, redução na transpiração e conseqüentemente maior retenção de água nos tecidos. Esse mecanismo poderia evitar alterações na concentração osmótica das células, que são prejudiciais ao desenvolvimento desses procariontes sem parede celular. A inoculação aumentou também a proliferação de espigas, efeito geralmente causado pelo desbalanço hormonal, e reduziu a área foliar, altura da planta, matéria seca da planta e de grãos. Very {{few studies}} {{can be found}} concerning the mechanisms of pathogenicity {{and the effects of}} Mollicutes (spiroplasma and phytoplasma) on maize plants physiology. With this objective it was evaluated in greenhouse, physiological characteristics of plants submitted or not to inoculation with mollicutes and cultivated under different water levels in soil, corresponding to the reposition of 40, 60, 80 and 100 % of the total water availability. Each experimental plot was set up with a pot contained two plants and repeated six times. In order to accomplish the inoculation, the pathogens vectors leaf hoppers Dalbulus maydis, were collected at the field and confined on the seedlings by seven days. The plants symptoms were evaluated, as well as the detection of phytoplasma by PCR and spiroplasma by Western blotting. Inoculation increased significantly the leaf water potential and the amount of water by unity of dry matter in the plants. This effect is probably due to the interference of pathogens on plant physiology, by producing growth substances, which caused increment on stomatal resistance, leaf transpiration reduction and consequently greater water retention in the tissues. This mechanism could avoid alterations on osmotical concentrations of cells which affects the development of those procaryotes without cell wall. The inoculation increased also the number of ears, which is generally caused by hormonal imbalance and reduced the leaf area, plant height, plant dry weight and final grain weight...|$|E

Maistrello 11 University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Department of Agricultural& Food Sciences, via G. Amendola 2, Pad. Besta, 42100 Reggio Emilia, Italy 2 University of Padova, DAAPV - Entomology, v. le dell’Università 16, 35020 Legnaro (PD), ItalyEmail: lara. maistrello@unimore. itThe planthopper Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret (Homoptera, Cixidae) is vector of {{the grapevine}} yellow Bois Noir, {{one of the}} most important phytoplasmosis in Europe. Reduction of phytoplasma associated diseases incidence relies on the control of the insect vectors and on the eradication of affected host plants. Management of Bois Noir is especially difficult because 1) both the vector and the phytoplasma can develop also in plants other than grapevines and 2) the overwintering younger instars of the insect live underground feeding on the roots of wild plants normally nearby vineyards (like nettle and bindweed) and chemical treatments are ineffective and unsustainable (Mori et al., 2008). The aim of this work was to evaluate the possibility to control the young forms of the leafhopper by means of entomopathogenic agents applied to nettle roots (AAVV, 1997; Vanesa Toledo et al., 2007, Reggiani and Maistrello, 2010). A first semi-field test was performed on young leafhoppers obtained from hundreds of wild H. obsoletus adults that had been captured and allowed to breed in a greenhouse with nettle pots during the previous summer. In late spring, pots containing groups of these juveniles were treated by sprinkling the ground with selected strains of entomopathogenic fungi (Beauveria bassiana and Paecilomyces lilacinus) and nematodes (Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema feltiae). The mortality of H. obsoletus was recorded on day 7, 14, and 21 after the treatment. A second trial was made in field conditions selecting plots (3 m 2 surface) in proximity of vineyards with a high quantity of nettle. These plots were sprayed on the middle of July at the ground level with the same enthopathogenic agents strains used for the first test. The plots were isolated with proper cages and the number of emerged adults was monitored during the whole flight period using yellow sticky traps. The obtained results show a good activity of the tested biopesticides, in particular for B. bassiana in the semi-field trial, and for nematodes in the field trials. The experiments suggest that microbiological control of the planthopper vector could represent a promising option for the integrated management of Bois Noir.
