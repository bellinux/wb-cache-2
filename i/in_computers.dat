5|$|Alan Kotok {{was born}} in 1941 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was raised as an only child in Vineland, New Jersey. During his childhood, he played with tools in his father's {{hardware}} store and learned model railroading. He was a precocious child, skipping two grades at high school, and he matriculated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aged 16. Although his interest <b>in</b> <b>computers</b> began at Vineland High School, his first practical experience of computing came at MIT; there he developed a habit of working late at night when more computer time was available.|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>computers</b> {{began in}} high school when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A programmable calculator in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design a calculator kit.|$|E
5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes {{on one side of}} the binary point all the positive integer powers of 2, that are contained in the integer part of this number, and the negative powers to the other side of the binary point represent the fractional part. This system is consistently used to represent numbers <b>in</b> <b>computers</b> for hardware reasons.|$|E

5|$|Stoppelman {{was born}} in Arlington, Virginia in 1977. His mother, Lynn, was an English teacher, and his father, John, was a {{securities}} lawyer. Stoppelman is Jewish. He attended a Reform temple {{as a child and}} had a Bar Mitzvah. As a child Stoppelman had an interest <b>in</b> <b>computers</b> and business and began investing in stocks at the age of 14. Stoppelman aspired to be a video game developer and took computer programming classes, where he learned the Turbo Pascal software programming system. He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and obtained a bachelor's degree in computer engineering in 1999. After graduating he took a job with @Home Network.|$|E
5|$|The {{trading area}} is {{surrounded}} by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, Morse code operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined {{the walls of the}} trading hall and the advent of electronic trading resulted <b>in</b> <b>computers</b> being placed on desktops.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used <b>in</b> <b>computers</b> besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E

5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices <b>in</b> <b>computers</b> that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
