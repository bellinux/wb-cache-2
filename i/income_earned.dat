40|$|Reducing gender inequalities by {{enabling}} women's empowerment is a {{major focus}} of the literature and practices of gender and development. The work of this thesis contributes to debates about female empowerment, especially for peasant women in peripheral capitalist economies. The central themes of enquiry are power relations of gender and space in the socio-economic processes in which peasant households and their members are embedded. The focus of investigation {{is the extent to which}} commodity exchange outside the household reinforces, or reduces, women's position of power/disempowerment. The central question taken for analysis is whether <b>income</b> <b>earning</b> via trading empowers women, thus reducing their subordination. This hypothesis is widely accepted. Many NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and other development institutions base efforts around the notion that <b>income</b> <b>earning</b> is liberating for women. This hypothesis is investigated for rural Hausa women in Northern Nigeria who are secluded within their homes by the religio-cultural practice of purdah, but who engage in trade, often through the agency of children. The major empirical part of the study develops and applies an original framework for analysis of empowerment that identifies and maps gender divisions of labour and space in the spheres of production, reproduction and circulation in which rural Hausa men and women are embedded. The overall conclusion reached is that gender divisions of work, both inside and outside rural Hausa households, and especially in trade, reflect and sustain the subordination of women and their inferior position relative to men, especially through the control of space. The notion of <b>income</b> <b>earning</b> as universally empowering for women does not hold because rural Hausa women engaged in the market are not significantly empowered by their <b>income</b> <b>earning</b> because of the complex realities of patriarchy whereby women have weak bargaining powers. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was threefold: first, to {{identify}} factors which caused some rural women to obtain paid employment and not others; second, to discover the problems faced by those involved in <b>income</b> <b>earning</b> and third to find out what the economic and social impact had been on the lives of these women and their households. A single major hypothesis, an expression of the sociological approach adopted in this study, provides a continuous theme. It is that economic factors predominate the explanations sought in this thesis, more especially in explaining why women seek <b>income</b> <b>earning</b> and what kind of jobs they prefer. A sample of 158 women of a village, out of a total of 911, was selected on the basis of a systematic stratified random sampling technique and was studied by using social survey and ethnographic methods. Neelganj was one of the poorest villages of Bangladesh. Only a few villagers had agricultural land, the most important means of production in rural areas, the majority were engaged in occupations other than farming. Economic need was found to be the most important reason for women's <b>income</b> <b>earning.</b> It was the expressed reason given by women and their guardians. Inflation, death of the major breadwinner, dowry, divorce, in the absence of social security, aggravated the economic needs of women. Women of all ages were income earners. Widowed, divorced and separated women were more frequent among female income earners. Twenty two women had no male guardians and were the only income earners of their households. A variety of activities was pursued by women. Lack of capital, insufficient orders and seasonal work affected women's <b>income</b> <b>earning.</b> A large number of unemployed women was interested in working, some were desperately in need of money. Lack of job opportunities, shortage of capital and domestic responsibilities were the major reasons for women's unemployment. Though women's income was important and brought economic relief to their households, this did not make much difference to their social status or expectations about women's role in society. Attitudes of villagers were favourable towards women's <b>income</b> <b>earning.</b> Activities which could be done inside the home were preferred for women. Villagers generally were of the opinion that government should be much more active in the field of women's employment...|$|R
