50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the chilled beam system is its lower operating cost. For example, because the temperature of cooled water {{is higher than the}} temperature of cooled air, but it delivers the same cooling ability, the costs of the cooled water system are lower. Because cooling and heating of air are no longer linked to the delivery of air, buildings also save money by being able to run fewer air circulation fans and at lower speeds. One estimate places the amount of air handled at 25 to 50 percent less using chilled beam systems. By being able to target the delivery of clean outdoor air where it is needed (rather than injecting it into the entire system and heating or cooling it), there is a reduced need to treat large amounts of outdoor air (also saving money). In one case, the Genomic Science Building at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill lowered its HVAC costs by 20 percent with an active chilled beam system. This is a typical energy cost savings. Chilled beam systems also have some advantages in that they are almost noiseless, require little maintenance, and are highly efficient. Traditional fan-driven HVAC systems create somewhat higher air velocities, which some people find uncomfortable. Chilled beam HVAC systems also require less ceiling space than forced-air HVAC systems, which can lead to lower building heights and higher ceilings. Since they do not require high forced air flows, chilled beam systems also require reduced air <b>distribution</b> <b>duct</b> networks (which also helps to lower cost).|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of a low-cost, hoop-type swine building (3. 55 × 5. 7 × 10. 3 m) was evaluated under the winter weather conditions of Central Japan. The hoop building had two curved roofs made from 2. 5 cm diameter tubular steel pipes each covered with a reflective film. There was a 20 cm air space between {{the inner and outer}} covers through which the exhaust air flowed. A positive-pressure ventilation fan and an air <b>distribution</b> <b>duct</b> were used to supply the fresh air. The evaluation was conducted for three opening configurations of the air <b>distribution</b> <b>duct</b> (one, two, or four holes on a cross-section of the duct) and presence or absence of an internal curtain. Furthermore, the effect of replacing the reflective film with a PVC film for the east side cover on solar transmission and thus the internal temperature rise was quantified. The building was simulated to house 30 pigs at a body weight of 70 kg. Resistive heating wire was used to simulate the sensible heat generation of the pigs at 131. 5 W/pig at 10 °C temperature. The inside temperature averaged 6. 9 °C higher than the outside temperature during the minimum ventilation period. As the exhaust air passed through the double-layer air space, 25. 4 % of exhaust heat transferred back into the building and 74. 6 % lost to the outside. When replacing the reflective covers with the PVC film covers on the east side, the internal temperature rise increased to an average of 7. 6 °C with a maximum of 12. 7 °C. The magnitude of temperature rise was proportional to the transmitted solar radiation, as evidenced by the higher temperature rise during the day and significantly reduced temperature rise at night. To eliminate the effects of cold, nocturnal radiation, the PVC film cover should be covered by the regular reflective cover at night. One-holed air duct had a tendency to produce drafts in the pig occupied zone (POZ, 1. 2 × 0. 7 m), whereas four-holed air duct tended to have less mixing effects on the air. In comparison, the combination of two-holed air duct and use of the internal curtain was found to be the best in achieving warmer air temperature and minimizing drafts in POZ...|$|E

40|$|Currently, total {{electricity}} consumption of furnaces is unregulated, tested at laboratory conditions using the DOE test procedure, and is {{reported in the}} GAMA directory as varying from 76 kWh/year to 1, 953 kWh/year. Furnace blowers account for about 80 {{percent of the total}} furnace {{electricity consumption}} and are primarily used to distribute warm air throughout the home during furnace operation as well as distribute cold air during air conditioning operation. Yet the furnace test procedure does not provide a means to calculate the electricity consumption during cooling operation or standby, which account for a large fraction of the total electricity consumption. Furthermore, blower electricity consumption is strongly affected by static pressure. Field data shows that static pressure in the house <b>distribution</b> <b>ducts</b> varies widely and that the static pressure used in the test procedure as well as the calculated fan power is not representative of actual field installations. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important to address electricity consumption of furnaces and air conditioners. This paper compares the potential regional and national energy savings of two-stage brushless permanent magnet (BPM) blower motors (the blower design option with the most potential savings that is currently available in the market) to single-stage permanent split capacitor (PSC) blower motors (the most common blower design option). Computer models were used to generate the heating and cooling loads for typical homes in 16 different climates which represent houses throughout the United States. The results show that the potential savings of using BPM motors vary by region and house characteristics, and are very strongly tied to improving house <b>distribution</b> <b>ducts.</b> Savings decrease dramatically with increased duct pressure. Cold climate locations will see savings even in the high static pressure duct situations, while warm climate locations will see less savings overall and negative savings in the high static pressure duct situations. Moderate climate locations will see little or no savings...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid Photovoltaic Thermal (PVT) {{collectors}} are {{an emerging}} technology that combines PV and {{solar thermal systems}} in a single solar collector producing heat and electricity simultaneously. The focus of this thesis work is to evaluate the performance of unglazed open loop PVT air system integrated on a garage roof in Borlänge. As it {{is thought to have}} a significant potential for preheating ventilation of the building and improving the PV modules electrical efficiency. The performance evaluation is important to optimize the cooling strategy of the collector in order to enhance its electrical efficiency and maximize the production of thermal energy. The evaluation process involves monitoring the electrical and thermal energies for {{a certain period of time}} and investigating the cooling effect on the performance through controlling the air mass flow provided by a variable speed fan connected to the collector by an air <b>distribution</b> <b>duct.</b> The <b>distribution</b> <b>duct</b> transfers the heated outlet air from the collector to inside the building. The PVT air collector consists of 34 Solibro CIGS type PV modules (115 Wp for each module) which are roof integrated and have replaced the traditional roof material. The collector is oriented toward the south-west with a tilt of 29 ᵒ. The collector consists of 17 parallel air ducts formed between the PV modules and the insulated roof surface. Each air duct has a depth of 0. 05 m, length of 2. 38 m and width of 2. 38 m. The air ducts are connected to each other through holes. The monitoring system is based on using T-type thermocouples to measure the relevant temperatures, air sensor to measure the air mass flow. These parameters are needed to calculate the thermal energy. The monitoring system contains also voltage dividers to measure the PV modules voltage and shunt resistance to measure the PV current, and AC energy meters which are needed to calculate the produced electrical energy. All signals recorded from the thermocouples, voltage dividers and shunt resistances are connected to data loggers. The strategy of cooling in this work was based on switching the fan on, only when the difference between the air duct temperature (under the middle of top of PV column) and the room temperature becomes higher than 5 °C. This strategy was effective in term of avoiding high electrical consumption by the fan, and it is recommended for further development. The temperature difference of 5 °C is the minimum value to compensate the heat losses in the collecting duct and <b>distribution</b> <b>duct.</b> The PVT air collector has an area of (Ac= 32 m 2), and air mass flow of 0. 002 kg/s m 2. The nominal output power of the collector is 4 kWppv (34 CIGS modules with 115 Wppvfor each module). The collector produces thermal output energy of 6. 88 kWth/day (0. 21 kWth/m 2 day) and an electrical output energy of 13. 46 kWhel/day (0. 42 kWhel/m 2 day) with cooling case. The PVT air collector has a daily thermal energy yield of 1. 72 kWhth/kWppv, and a daily PV electrical energy yield of 3. 36 kWhel /kWppv. The fan energy requirement in this case was 0. 18 kWh/day which is very small compared to the electrical energy generated by the PV collector. The obtained thermal efficiency was 8 % which is small compared to the results reported in literature for PVT air collectors. The small thermal efficiency was due to small operating air mass flow. Therefore, the study suggests increasing the air mass flow by a factor of 25. The electrical efficiency was fluctuating around 14 %, which is higher than the theoretical efficiency of the PV modules, and this discrepancy was due to the poor method of recording the solar irradiance in the location. Due to shading effect, it was better to use more than one pyranometer...|$|E

The annual saving of primary energy obtained by the retrofitting will be assessed through dynamic simulations of the building before and after retrofitting, performed through a model implemented in TRNSYS 17 and calibrated by comparison with monitoring results. In this paper, the calibration of the building model in its present state is described. The 3 -D hourly simulation model of the building was obtained starting from 3 -D drawings performed through Google SketchUp. Four thermal zones were considered for each small apartment (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen-living room, entrance) and five thermal zones for a larger apartment. The characteristics of the building enclosure were determined by accurate inspections and tests, which included infrared thermography, blower door tests and direct measurements of the transmittance of the external vertical wall.

A recent field trial has identified key housing factors associated with the prevalence of respiratory disease in these calf barns during the winter. Key factors associated with reduced prevalence of respiratory disease included a solid panel between each calf, deep bedding to allow “nesting”, and low total airborne bacterial counts in air within the pens. Practical approaches to reducing airborne bacterial concentrations within the pens include expanding the area of each pen and {{reducing the number of}} solid sides enclosing the pen. Because total airborne bacterial concentrations were a significant factor associated with the prevalence of respirator disease, our clinical service has recommended positive-pressure air <b>distribution</b> <b>ducts</b> to direct a small quantity of fresh air into the microenvironment of each pen, insuring the dilution of the airborne organisms without creating perceptible drafts...|$|R

40|$|The {{so-called}} closed greenhouse (closed ventilation windows) is {{a recent}} innovation in Dutch greenhouse industry. The technical concept consists of a heat pump, underground (aquifer) seasonal energy storage as well as daytime storage, air treatment units with heat exchangers, and air <b>distribution</b> <b>ducts.</b> Savings of up to 30 % in fossil fuel and production increases by up to 20 %, {{mainly because of the}} continuously high CO 2 concentration, have been reported. Economic feasibility of this innovative greenhouse highly depends on the yield increase that can be obtained. In this simulation study the effects of greenhouse climate on tomato yield in a closed greenhouse are presented. The explanatory model INTKAM was used, which has several submodels e. g. for light interception, leaf photosynthesis and biomass partitioning. The closed greenhouse offers possibilities for combinations of light, temperature, air humidity and CO 2 concentration that are impossible in a conventional greenhouse. At high CO 2 concentration and high light intensity, leaf photosynthesis shows a more narrow optimum for temperature than at high CO 2 and moderate light intensity. However, the response of crop photosynthesis to temperature has a much broader optimum than that of leaf photosynthesis. Besides photosynthesis, temperature also influences aspects like partitioning, leaf area development and fruit development. Yield potential reduces at temperatures above 26 °C, with fruit set being one of the first processes that is negatively influenced by supra-optimal temperatures. Based on actual climatic conditions in a conventional and a closed greenhouse (same crop management) measured during two years, INTKAM predicts an increase in yield by about 17 %. Hence, in a closed greenhouse a higher stem density can be maintained for obtaining the same average fruit weight (size) as in a conventional greenhouse. In 2005 actual yield increase was similar to the simulated one (16 %), but in 2004 only a 9 % higher yield was realized, at least partly because of botrytis infection in the closed greenhouse...|$|R

Another key aspect of the simulations is that they are dynamic to account for cyclic losses from the HVAC system and the effect of cycle length on energy and comfort performance. To field test the effect of changes to residential HVAC systems requires extensive measurements to be made for several months for each condition tested. This level of testing is often impractical due to cost and time limitations. Therefore the Energy Performance of Buildings Group at LBNL developed a computer simulation tool that models residential HVAC system performance. This simulation tool has been used to answer questions about equipment downsizing, duct improvements, control strategies and climate variation so that recommendations can be made for changes in residential construction and HVAC installation techniques that would save energy, reduce peak demand and result in more comfortable homes. Although this study focuses on California climates, the simulation tool could easily be applied to other climates. This report summarizes the simulation tool and discusses the significant developments that allow the use of this tool to perform detailed residential HVAC system simulations. The simulations have been verified by comparison to measured results in several houses over a wide range of weather conditions and HVAC system performance. After the verification was completed, more than 350 cooling and 450 heating simulations were performed.

The pituitary structure in these genera, however, indicated that the duct was probably once present and has been subsequently lost. The duct was absent in the other galaxioid families, Retropinnidae and Lepidogalaxiidae. Mapping the <b>distribution</b> of the <b>duct</b> onto a DNA sequence-based phylogeny suggests that the embryological duct was retained in a galaxiid ancestral to Aplochiton, with subsequent losses in Aplochiton and Paragalaxias. # 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: galaxiid; galaxioid; hypophysial duct; neoteny; pituitary...|$|R
40|$|The general {{non-linear}} three-dimensional equation for acoustic {{potential is}} derived {{by using a}} perturbation technique. The linearized axisymmetric equation is then solved by using a finite element algorithm based on the Galerkin formulation for a harmonic time dependence. The solution is carried out in complex number notation for the acoustic velocity potential. Linear, isoparametric, quadrilateral elements with non-uniform <b>distribution</b> across the <b>duct</b> section are implemented. The resultant global matrix is stored in banded form and solved by using a modified Gauss elimination technique. Sound pressure levels and acoustic velocities are calculated from post element solutions. Different duct geometries are analyzed and compared with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Two {{mathematical}} {{models were}} developed to study the air distribution normal to and along an aeration <b>duct.</b> The airflow <b>distribution</b> normal to the duct was analyzed using a finite element model. Example simulations of airflow in grain piles were performed on triangular and trapezoidal pile cross sections because of their widespread use in flat storage. The equivalent radial grain depth representative of the triangular pile cross section was determined. ^ A model to predict the air distribution along the aeration duct was developed from basic principles of fluid mechanics and from experimental data for static pressure regain coefficients reported in the literature. The model handles both negative and positive pressure systems. ^ Experimental tests on a duct covered with grain were performed to verify the model for static pressure distribution along an aeration duct. ^ The predicted results using the same input data of the experimental test agreed favorably with the experimental results for both negative and positive pressure systems. ^ The effects of the various duct parameters on the uniformity of air discharge along grain aeration ducts were studied. ^ The performed analyses indicate that {{the problems of the}} static pressure <b>distribution</b> along aeration <b>ducts</b> operated under positive or negative pressure should be looked at as two different mathematical problems. This is due to the effect of the air intake or discharge on the velocity <b>distribution</b> across the <b>duct</b> diameter. ^ The total airflow delivered in a system is influenced by the duct length, duct diameter, air velocity in the duct, and grain depth. Increasing the air velocity at the duct entrance increases the airflow but contributes to the deterioration of the uniformity of air discharge along an aeration duct. The effect of the air velocity in the duct on the uniformity of air discharge is more pronounced on the negative pressure system than on the positive pressure one. ^ To deliver equal volumes of air, a large diameter duct is preferred to a small diameter one with regard to air discharge uniformity and power requirement. ^ Increasing the duct length while keeping the air delivered constant results in low airflow rate per metric ton of grain. It also results in deterioration of air distribution along a perforated duct operated under negative pressure. The air <b>distribution</b> along a <b>duct</b> operated under positive pressure may improve depending on the relative magnitudes of the friction loss and the static pressure regain. However, the airflow rate per ton of grain decreases with increase of duct length. ^ An increase in wall roughness results in deterioration of uniformity of air discharge along a duct operated under negative pressure. It slightly improves the air discharge <b>distribution</b> along a <b>duct</b> operated under positive pressure. Excessive increase in wall roughness reverses the problem of the air distribution without solving it, the end result being waste of energy. The increase in roughness of both duct wall and the perforations increases the static pressure requirement sharply. ^ Increasing the grain depth improves the air discharge uniformity for both negative and positive pressure systems. Delivering the recommended average airflow rate may be the limiting factor for increasing the grain depth beyond a certain depth using a particular duct diameter. ^ The main concern when operating positive or negative pressure systems should be the total airflow delivered together with the uniformity of air discharge and the power requirement. ^ Comparing the positive and negative pressure systems, it has been concluded that the positive pressure system gives better air uniformity at lower power requirement, assuming all other variables are the same. ...|$|R
