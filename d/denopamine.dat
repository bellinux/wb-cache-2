40|$|<b>Denopamine</b> {{is one of}} {{the oral}} 1 -adrenoceptor-selective partial agonists. <b>Denopamine</b> glucuronide is the most {{abundant}} metabo-lite in human, rat, and dog urine when administered orally. Species differences in <b>denopamine</b> glucuronidation were investigated with liver microsomes obtained from humans and experimental ani-mals. In rat and rabbit, only the phenolic glucuronide was detected, whereas in dog and monkey, not only the phenolic glucuronide but also the alcoholic glucuronide was found. In contrast, in humans, the alcoholic glucuronide was detected exclusively. The kinetics of <b>denopamine</b> glucuronidation in human liver microsomes showed a typical Michaelis-Menten plot.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} <b>denopamine,</b> a selective β 1 -adrenergic agonist, in a murine model of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to viral myocarditis. Background. Positive inotropic agents are used to treat severe heart failure due to myocarditis. However, sympathomimetic agents have not been found beneficial in animal models of myocarditis. Methods. In vitro: The effects of <b>denopamine</b> on lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production was studied in murine spleen cells. In vivo: Four-week-old DBA/ 2 mice were inoculated with the encephalomyocarditis virus (day 0). <b>Denopamine</b> (14 μmol/kg), <b>denopamine</b> (14 μmol/kg) with a selective β 1 -blocker metoprolol (42 μmol/kg), or <b>denopamine</b> (14 μmol/kg) with metoprolol (84 μmol/kg) was given daily, and control mice received the vehicle only. Survival and myocardial histology on day 14 and TNF-α levels in the heart on day 6 were examined. Results. In the in vitro study, TNF-α levels in treated cells were significantly lower than in controls (p < 0. 05). In the in vivo study treatment with <b>denopamine</b> significantly improved the survival of the animals (14 of 25 (56 %) treated, vs 5 of 25 (20 %) control mice), attenuated myocardial lesions, and suppressed TNF-α production (66. 5 ± 7. 5 pg/mg of heart in treated mice vs 113. 5 ± 15. 1 pg/mg of heart in control mice, mean ± SE). There was a strong linear relationship between mortality and TNF-α levels (r = 0. 98, n = 4, p < 0. 05). These in vitro and in vivo effects of <b>denopamine</b> were significantly inhibited by metoprolol. Conclusions. These results suggest that <b>denopamine</b> may exert its beneficial effects, in part, by suppressing the production of TNF-α via β 1 -adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|A 71 -year old man {{suffered}} from chest pain on effort. He frequently experienced chest {{pain in the}} early morning while sleeping. During Holter monitor recording, he {{suffered from}} chest pain that ceased with sublingual administration of nitroglycerin. The recording showed horizontal type depression of the ST segment over 0. 2 mV of channel CM 5 during chest pain. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with vasospastic angina pectoris. Administration of isosorbide dinitrate and extended-released nifedipine per os was started, and for a while,chest pain ceased. However, after about 1 month, chest pains reappeared during sleep and bathing. Isosorbide dinitrate- tape was added, but it was not effective in treating the chest pain. The β 1 selective adrenergic receptor stimulant, <b>denopamine,</b> was then administered to prevent angina attacks. In the following month, there was no chest pain. The medicines were discontinud 1 at a time in the order isosorbide dinitrate-tape, nifedipine, and isosorbide dinitrate, at intervals of 1 month. Although <b>denopamine</b> alone remained as a treatment, there were no angina attacks, and abnormal changes in the ST segment were not observed on Holter monitoring after 3 months of <b>denopamine</b> only. <b>Denopamine</b> alone was effective in the case of refractory vasospastic angina pectoris...|$|E
40|$|Prenalterol (131 -agonist), <b>denopamine</b> ($ 1 -agonist), and {{zinterol}} ($ 2 -agonist) were partial agonists of {{adenylate cyclase}} (AC) stim-ulation in human ventricular myocardium obtained from nonfailing chambers whose 191 / 192 receptor subtype ratio was approximately 80 / 20. At a concentration less than its low affinity (i 92) K,, betax-olol, a highly selective 91 -antagonist, inhibited isoproterenol (non-selective agonist), <b>denopamine,</b> and prenalterol stimulation of AC, indicating that isoproterenol, <b>denopamine,</b> and prenalterol are all capable of stimulating AC through fl 1 -receptor activation. At a concentration less than its low affinity (f 3) K,, lCI 1 18, 551, a highly selective 132 -agonist, inhibited both isoproterenol and zinterol stimulation of AC, indicating that isoproterenol and zin-terol stimulate AC through fl 2 -receptors. Zinterol stimulation of AC was mediated entirely by 92 -receptors, inasmuch as 1 0 M betaxolol {{had no effect}} on the zinterol dose-response curve an...|$|E
40|$|<b>Denopamine,</b> {{which is}} an oral 1 y {{effective}} cardiotonic agent and a beta- 1 -receptor-selective agonist, reportedly prolongs {{the survival of the}} BIO 14. 6 strain of cardiomyopathic Syrian hamsters(BIO). The latter is an animal model of human idiopathic cardiomyopathy. The purpose of the present experiment was to investigate the effects of <b>denopamine</b> on myocardial damage in BIO hamsters. They were divided into two groups: one that received <b>denopamine</b> treatment (1 mg/kg/day) from 2 months of age, and a control (untreated) group. Morphological studies of the myocardium, assays for beta-adrenergic receptors, and measurements of myocardial adenylate cyclase (AC) activity and cAMP concentration were performed at 1, 3, and 7 months of age in al 1 animals. It was observed that denopamine: 1) inhibited the progression of disease from the stage of hypertrophy to that of congestive failure that was demonstrated in the control BIO hamster, 2) inhibited the down-regulation of beta- 1 -adrenergic receptors in the myocardium of the control BIO hamsters at 7 months of age, and 3) prevented an increase in myocardial AC activity and cAMP concentration that was seen in control BIO hamsters at 3 months of age (stage of ealy hypertrophy). In conclusion, <b>denopamine</b> may prevent myocardial damage in BIO hamsters by inhibiting the down-regulation of beta- 1 -adrenergic receptors，thus preventing an increase in myocardial AC activity and cAMP concentration...|$|E
40|$|Primary adipocytes were {{isolated}} from axillary brown adipose tissue from adult cynomolgus monkeys. That this tissue contained brown adipocytes was verified by morphological examination and by demonstrating {{the presence of}} uncoupling protein messenger ribonucleic acid in the isolated adipocytes. The contributions of � 1 -, � 2 -, and � 3 -adrenergic receptors (AR) to lipolysis and oxygen consumption of isolated brown adipocytes were determined after agonist stimulation. Dose responses were determined using isoproterenol (a nonselective �-AR agonist), <b>denopamine</b> (� 1 -AR agonist), procaterol (� 2 -AR agonist), and CGP 12177 A (� 1 - and � 2 -AR antagonist, � 3 -AR agonist).

40|$|Aim To {{determine}} the mechanism whereby transient {{stimulation of the}} β-adrenergic receptor subtypes (β-AR) elicit cardioprotection against subsequent ischaemia. Methods Isolated rat hearts were subjected to 35 min regional ischaemia (RI) and reperfusion and infarct size (IS) determined. Hearts were preconditioned with 5 min isoproterenol (β 1 /β 2 -AR agonist), <b>denopamine</b> (β 1 -AR agonist), formoterol hemifumarate (β 2 -AR agonist) or BRL 37344 (β 3 -AR agonist) and 5 min reperfusion. The roles of the β-ARs, NO, PKA, and PI 3 -K were explored by using selective antagonists/blockers. Pertussis toxin was administered i. p., 48 h prior to experimentation. Results IS of hearts preconditioned with either isoproterenol, <b>denopamine</b> or formoterol (% of area at risk: 23. 6 ± 1. 26; 24. 52 ± 0. 89; 20. 74 ± 0. 85 respectively) were significantly smaller than that of non-preconditioned hearts (41. 7 ± 1. 65) and associated with improvement in postischaemic mechanical performance. The β 3 -AR agonist BRL 37344 could not reduce IS. The β 1 - and β 2 -AR blockers CGP- 20712 A and ICI- 118551 abolished the reduction in IS and improvement in mechanical recovery during reperfusion induced by isoproterenol preconditioning, while the β 3 -AR blocker SR 59230 A was without effect. Both Rp- 8 -CPT-cAMPs and wortmannin significantly increased IS when administered before and during β 1 /β 2 -AR preconditioning and reduced mechanical recovery. PTX pretreatment had no {{significant effect on the}} reduction in IS induced by β 1 /β 2 -AR or β 2 -AR preconditioning, but reduced mechanical recovery in β 2 -AR preconditioning. Similarly the NOS inhibitors L-NAME and LNNA had no effect on IS in β 1 /β 2 -AR preconditioning, but depressed mechanical recovery. Conclusion Protection afforded by β-ARs stimulation, depends on activation of both β 1 -AR and β 2 -ARs but not β 3 -AR. With functional recovery as endpoint, results suggest involvement of NO in β 1 /β 2 -AR preconditioning and the Gi protein in β 2 -AR preconditioning. Both PKA and PI 3 -K activation were essential for β 1 /β 2 -AR cardio-protection. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010. Articl...|$|E
