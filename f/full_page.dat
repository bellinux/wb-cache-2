5|$|In 2006, Spider-Man {{garnered}} {{major media}} coverage with {{the revelation of}} the character's secret identity, an event detailed in a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> story in the New York Post before the issue containing the story was even released.|$|E
5|$|Potter's own three-door oven, her hearthrug, her indoor plants, her {{coronation}} teapot, and {{her water}} pump are minutely detailed with more color {{than in other}} productions. The large format of the original edition, the captions accompanying the <b>full</b> <b>page</b> color illustrations, and the occasional lack of coordination between picture and text all display Potter's delight in the pictures, sometimes {{at the expense of}} the text.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>full</b> <b>page</b> {{advertisements}} for the Altair computer {{appeared in the}} February issues of Popular Electronics and Radio-Electronics magazines. Soon MITS was advertising in technical journals such as the IEEE Computer, and general interest magazines such as Scientific American. MITS was also the most prominent advertiser in the new hobbyist computer magazines such as Creative Computing and Byte.|$|E

5|$|The {{steady flow}} of {{calculator}} sales allowed MITS to run <b>full</b> <b>page</b> advertisements in Radio-Electronics, Popular Electronics and Scientific American. In the June 1972 Radio-Electronics, MITS announced a 14 digit calculator (Model 1440) with memory and square root function for $199.95 kit and $249.95 assembled. The original 816 kit was reduced from $179 to $149.95. Both calculators could be controlled by upcoming programming unit.|$|E
5|$|Pertec {{was eager}} to {{increase}} sales to small businesses through the 26 Altair Computer stores across the United States. The marketing toward hobby/home user was curtailed. The November 1977 issue of the MITS newsletter, Computer Notes, was the last produced by the Albuquerque staff. There was one more issue produced by the Pertec staff in Chatsworth, California. The back cover of the leading home computer magazine, Byte, always carried a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> Altair advertisement. This ended with the September 1977 issue. Roberts and Yates stayed on and worked on special projects.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{publication}} of Summer Cooking, David was wooed away from her regular column in Harpers by Vogue magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> photograph. The new contract meant she also wrote for Vogues sister magazine House & Garden. Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted David to write more personal columns than she had done for Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients {{and from time to time}} £100 for research trips to France.|$|E
50|$|Three <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> of {{quotations}} introduce this work, {{signaling the}} syncretic {{intention of the}} author. Many sacred texts and sources such as Dante, Catullus, and Jesus are quoted.|$|R
50|$|The {{paper has}} varied {{the amount of}} space given over to Welsh {{language}} coverage, but currently at least two <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> of Welsh are provided in the Saturday supplement.|$|R
50|$|The 16:10 {{aspect ratio}} (as {{opposed to the}} 16:9 used in {{widescreen}} televisions) was chosen because this aspect ratio is appropriate for displaying two <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> of text side by side.|$|R
5|$|The text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead was {{typically}} written in cursive hieroglyphs, most often {{from left to}} right, but also sometimes from right to left. The hieroglyphs were in columns, which were separated by black lines – a similar arrangement to that used when hieroglyphs were carved on tomb walls or monuments. Illustrations were put in frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of papyrus.|$|E
5|$|Originally Allen & Unwin {{planned to}} {{illustrate}} the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were: The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water, The Trolls, The Mountain Path, The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate, Beorn's Hall, Mirkwood, The Elvenking's Gate, Lake Town, The Front Gate, and The Hall at Bag-End. All {{but one of the}} illustrations were a <b>full</b> <b>page,</b> and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.|$|E
5|$|The {{cancellation}} of Enterprise was protested by {{fans of the}} series. Actions included around a hundred fans picketing the gates of Paramount Studios. The response to the cancellation was organised on websites such as TrekUnited.com. They raised money which {{was intended to be}} used for new Star Trek programming, with $48,000 raised within a month of the cancellation. The website sought to raise $32 million to pay for a full fifth season of the show, but failed to get close only gaining some $87,000 from general donors plus $3 million of anonymous donations from investors who work in the American spaceflight industry. Rallies were also held elsewhere around the world, and a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> advertisement supporting the show was taken out in the Los Angeles Times. The money was refunded after an unsuccessful campaign, with reportedly only one accidental contact between TrekUnited and Paramount.|$|E

5000|$|In Amazing Spider-Man #639, {{the story}} is told as a mixture of flashbacks and current events. The flashbacks are from [...] "Civil War" [...] and Amazing Spider-Man #539-543. These flashbacks are only panels from the {{original}} comics and not <b>full</b> <b>pages.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{system was}} {{the topic of}} intense inter-service rivalry {{throughout}} its lifetime. When the ABM role {{was given to the}} Army in 1958, the United States Air Force began a long series of critiques on Zeus, both within defense circles and in the press. The Army returned these attacks in kind, taking out <b>full</b> <b>page</b> advertisements in popular mass market news magazines to promote Zeus, as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner the maximum political support. As deployment neared in the early 1960s, the debate became a major political issue. The question ultimately became whether or not a system with limited effectiveness would be better than nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the <b>full</b> <b>page</b> prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E
5|$|Krekeler's text {{uses the}} National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges' {{numerical}} system for recording covered bridges. The {{system is a}} collection of three sets of two digits used to represent the state, the county and the designated bridge respectively. The book includes detailed information on each state's historic bridges before providing an individual listing of surveyed bridges. A typical page includes two entries on a single page. Each entry includes a description of the bridge, its history, a black and white photograph, and a local street map with directions. Interspersed throughout the book {{is a collection of}} color photographs ranging from a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> to a quarter page in size. Krekeler states that construction dates prior to 1850 are often questionable because of an absence of records and that these early sources would often contradict one another. Krekeler's bibliography cites an extensive collection of state maps, numerous local newspaper sources and works like World Guide to Covered Bridges by Richard Donovan. The information and sources used are cited {{at the end of each}} entry listing in the book, directly following the directions to the bridge. The book does not contain a typical index and instead favors a listing of bridges after the introduction of the state. The book was published in 1989 by Daring Books.|$|E
50|$|An {{advertisement}} covering two <b>full</b> <b>pages,</b> promoting Concorde, {{ran in the}} 29 May 1967 {{issue of}} Aviation Week & Space Technology. The advertisement predicted a market for 350 aircraft by 1980 and boasted of Concorde's head start over the United States' SST project.|$|R
50|$|A topper in {{comic strip}} parlance {{is a small}} {{secondary}} strip seen along with a larger Sunday strip. In the 1920s and 1930s, leading cartoonists were given <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> in the Sunday comics sections, allowing them to add smaller strips and single-panel cartoons to their page.|$|R

5|$|The year 1912 saw {{a marked}} {{increase}} in militant action in Wales. Anger at {{the defeat of}} the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon. The protesters, male and female, were treated harshly with clothes torn and hair ripped out and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas. Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod. Just two weeks later {{one of the most notorious}} events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place, when Lloyd George returned to his home town of Llanystumdwy to open the village hall. No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by the cries of 'Votes for Women!' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd. One was stripped to the waist before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below. As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of photographs to the incident. The local press not only attacked the suffragettes, but poured scorn on the crowd for tarnishing the image of a peaceful, Nonconformist, chapel-going Wales. The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women's suffrage in Wales.|$|E
