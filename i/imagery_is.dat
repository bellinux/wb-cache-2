5|$|Phallic {{architecture}} {{consciously or}} unconsciously creates a symbolic representation of the phallus. Buildings intentionally or unintentionally resembling the human penis {{are a source of}} amusement to locals and tourists in various places around the world. Deliberate phallic <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> found in ancient cultures and in the links to ancient cultures found in traditional artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Narcissi {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular garden plants in Islamic culture. Prior to the Arab conquest of Persia, the Persian ruler Khosrau I is said to have not been able to {{tolerate}} them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes, an association that persists to this day, as described by the poet Ghalib. The eye <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> also found in a number of poems by Abu Nuwas. Another poet who refers to narcissi, is Rumi. Even the prophet Mohammed is said to have praised the narcissus.|$|E
5|$|Shin used archival {{photographs}} of the 2nd and 3rd Avenue Elevated train (El) to create compositions in ceramic tile, glass mosaic, and laminated glass. The <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> manipulated and re-configured with each level having a different design. On the south east-corner entrance at Third Avenue, there are ceramic tiles depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s. At the mezzanine, a mosaic reveals the sky where the train had previously been present. The platform level features semi-transparent and reflective glass depicting vintage scenes of the neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{has three}} eleven-line stanzas which {{describe}} a progression through the season, {{from the late}} maturation of the crops to the harvest and to {{the last days of}} autumn when winter is nearing. The <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as being like that in a painting.|$|E
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
5|$|Reckoning is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band R.E.M., released on April 9, 1984 by I.R.S. Records. Produced by Mitch Easter and Don Dixon, the album was recorded at Reflection Sound Studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, over 16 days in December 1983 and January 1984. Dixon and Easter intended to capture the sound of R.E.M.'s live performances, and used binaural recording on several tracks. Singer Michael Stipe dealt with darker subject matter in his lyrics, and water <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> a recurring theme on the record. Released to critical acclaim, Reckoning reached number 27 in the United States—where it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1991—and peaked at number 91 in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{dancing is}} {{restrained}} {{with a single}} prop: that of a solitary chair. At {{one point in the}} first segment of the video, she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera. As the screens inside the viewing booths open and close, the camera slices the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration. The same <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} story, Nagisa is {{introduced}} {{to other students}} {{from each of the}} three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. ERTS- 1 <b>imagery</b> may <b>be</b> used to delineate soil associations. It {{does have the}} capacity to divide soils into groups such that their land use and management would be similar. It offers definite potential for making grass flood-plain, wetland, river shoreline, and land use change surveys. Production of volume strata and forest type from the two usable bands of ERTS- 1 <b>imagery</b> <b>were</b> of questionable value. No <b>imagery</b> <b>was</b> received for evaluation during {{the time of year when}} maine dwarf mosaic virus and southern corn leaf blight were active...|$|R

25|$|The {{infinite}} monkey theorem and {{its associated}} <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> considered a popular and proverbial illustration of the mathematics of probability, widely known {{to the general public}} because of its transmission through popular culture rather than because of its transmission via the classroom.|$|E
25|$|Scientifically, such <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} {{characterized as}} a form of pareidolia. This is a false perception of imagery due to what is theorized as the human mind's over-sensitivity to perceiving patterns, particularly the pattern of a human face, in otherwise random phenomena.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} too are {{symbolic of}} types. Charles, Hal and Mercedes symbolize vanity and ignorance, while Thornton {{and his companions}} represent loyalty, purity, and love. Much of the <b>imagery</b> <b>is</b> stark and simple {{with an emphasis on}} images of cold, snow, ice, darkness, meat, and blood.|$|E

40|$|An {{irrigation}} {{ground water}} use inventory in Sherburne County, Minnesota, was attempted by indirectly locating irrigation wells by determining {{the location of}} irrigated lands. Digital classification of LANDSAT MSS <b>imagery</b> <b>was</b> employed using the IDIMS at Goddard Space Flight Center. Single-date classification proved moderately successful after accurate ground truth data were obtained. A combination of supervised and unsupervised classification was used. Multitemporal analysis using August 10 and May 21, 1978 <b>imagery</b> <b>was</b> also attempted. This unsupervised classification proved most successful in identifying crops and irrigated fields...|$|R
40|$|Speckle {{reduction}} {{techniques are}} applied to SAR imagery to produce images that are almost photographic in appearance ("quasi-photographic imagery"). A road tracking system designed for use with photographic <b>imagery</b> has <b>been</b> used to process this data. The road networks extracted from the quasi-photographic <b>imagery</b> <b>are</b> compared with those produced from optical <b>imagery.</b> It <b>was</b> found that the performance was affected by the SAR resolution. Additionally, urban road networks were better defined when they were parallel to the radar line of sight than when perpendicular to it. ...|$|R
25|$|Imagery {{resolution}} {{ranges from}} 15 meters of resolution to 15 centimeters.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to expand our breadth of {{knowledge}} and fill a gap in the literature regarding injured youth athletes’ imagery use during injury rehabilitation, using a retrospective qualitative approach. The participants were 12 young adults who had sustained an injury as an adolescent (during the previous five years) forcing them to miss time in their sport due to the injury. During the interviews, the participants described their use of imagery during sport injury rehabilitation including when, where, why and for what purpose they used imagery. They reported using imagery during sport rehabilitation for cognitive, motivational, pain management and healing purposes. Motivational <b>imagery</b> <b>was</b> used to set rehabilitative goals and develop confidence in returning to sport, while cognitive <b>imagery</b> <b>was</b> used to learn and rehearse sport and rehabilitation skills and strategies. Pain management <b>imagery</b> <b>was</b> used to distract from pain sensations, block the pain, and practice dealing with the pain, while healing <b>imagery</b> <b>was</b> used for internal physiological processes. With respect to what they imaged, participants commented on the timing, effectiveness, nature, modalities, and “other” details regarding their imagery use. Overall, implementing imagery in conjunction with physical rehabilitation may enhance the rehabilitative process for young injured athletes, thereby increasing the rates of physiological recovery...|$|R
