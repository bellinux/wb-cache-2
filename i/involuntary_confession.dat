40|$|For {{more than}} a century, the Supreme Court has {{interpreted}} the Bill of Rights as prohibiting the police from obtaining involuntary confessions from suspects {{through the use of}} coercion. If asked whether this <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule is an understandable and workable doctrine, however, a noticeable percentage of judges, prosecutors, police officers, criminal defense attorneys and law professors would answer with an unequivocal no. Basic questions concerning voluntariness and free will - whether it exists, and if so, when it exists, etc. - have puzzled philosophers for centuries and represent one of history 2 ̆ 7 s Gordian knots. Not surprisingly, judges have fared no better than philosophers in solving this age-old enigma since the Supreme Court first adopted voluntariness as the touchstone for constitutional confession law in 1897. The problems with the <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule are well-documented and legion. Given the pervasive problems with the <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule in application, it is surprising how little mainstream attention has been given to its ascendancy to power and current doctrinal legitimacy. Indeed, although it currently lies at the foundation of confession law, it is unclear from which provision in the Bill of Rights it emanates. Some believe the Fifth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s Privilege Against Compulsory Self-Incrimination demands a rule that involuntary confessions are inadmissible. Others would claim that the <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule is derived from the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Still others would argue that both the Privilege and the Due Process Clauses are identical in this respect, and work in tandem to prohibit involuntary confessions. It is as if the voluntariness test has ruled the roost for so long that its source and doctrinal validity are no longer questioned by courts or practitioners. The thesis of this Article is that, due to legal and historical errors, the Supreme Court has unduly relied on the <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule in confession jurisprudence for the past century. This unexplained adherence to the voluntariness test has caused the Court to ignore other important values and principles that should be considered and ultimately infused into the equation. These principles should be used to forge a new test for confession admissibility that either replaces the <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule outright, or, at a minimum, supplements existing doctrine. Four essential points support this thesis and form the foundation of this Article. The first point is that nothing in the Bill of Rights requires, or even suggests, a voluntariness test as the primary test for confession admissibility. At no point did the Framers engraft a voluntariness standard upon us, and, like a cruel joke, make the unsolvable puzzle of free will the unavoidable sine qua non in courtrooms and interrogation rooms for time immemorial. Indeed, the word voluntary and its various permutations do not even appear anywhere in the Bill of Rights. Second, the <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule exists today because of a series of mistakes and doctrinal complications, beginning with Bram v. United States, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s first constitutional confession case, and continuing even after Miranda v. Arizona seemingly rendered the rule obsolete. Third, the text of the Privilege Against Compulsory Self-Incrimination suggests a standard based on compulsion, where {{the focus is on the}} objective behavior of the interrogators, rather than voluntariness, where the focus is on the subjective state of mind of the suspect. Such a test would be more faithful and consistent with existing interpretations of the Privilege in non-interrogation contexts as well as the text and historical origins of the Privilege. Fourth, a test for confession admissibility properly based on compulsion and the Privilege would differ in many important respects from the <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule. Although many scholars and even Supreme Court Justices who follow conventional wisdom might disagree, existing interpretations of the Privilege in non-interrogation contexts, the historical origins of the Privilege, the text of the Privilege, and relevant policy issues all argue to the contrary. The Article then delineates a new confession test, called the objective penalties test, based on the Privilege, in which the touchstone for admissibility would be compulsion rather than voluntariness. This test would hold confessions inadmissible that had been obtained by imposing an objective penalty in any form on the suspect to punish silence or provoke speech. The Article develops the objective penalties test in detail through reference to the scholarly literature in the field of philosophy, where a rich standard has been created for determining when a coercive penalty has been imposed. Importing this philosophical literature into the realm of confession law, the Article attempts to create a workable standard for determining the admissibility of confessions. In an effort to demonstrate how this objective penalties test would work in practice, the Article sets forth numerous hypothetical interrogations and analyzes how these interrogation problems would be solved under the newly proposed test...|$|E

40|$|This Article is {{part two}} {{in an ongoing}} series. Part I, {{published}} at 51 DUKE L. J. 1703 (2002), argued that Miranda warnings should not be strictly required when U. S. agents interrogate non-U. S. citizens abroad. This Article picks up where the first left off, and asks the question: 2 ̆ 2 In the absence of Miranda, do any provisions in the Bill of Rights restrict the ability of U. S. agents to obtain confessions from non-Americans abroad? 2 ̆ 2 The Article begins by examining the back up or default rules to Miranda in the domestic setting. These rules are the 2 ̆ 2 due process <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule, 2 ̆ 2 which holds all involuntary confessions inadmissible, and the Privilege Against Compulsory Self-Incrimination, which similarly bans 2 ̆ 2 compelled 2 ̆ 2 confessions. Due to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s preference for the due process rule, {{the contours of the}} Privilege have not been fully developed in the interrogation context post-Miranda. As a result, many courts and scholars assume that the test for admissibility under the Privilege is identical to the due process rule, and that both doctrines prohibit the introduction of 2 ̆ 2 involuntary 2 ̆ 2 confessions. It is a central thesis of this Article that the two doctrines are different, and that each should demand a distinct test for confession admissibility. The Article proffers that the due process <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule is inapplicable during interrogations by U. S. agents of non-Americans abroad. This is because the due process rule, after Colorado v. Connelly, should be interpreted as a 2 ̆ 2 freestanding civil liberty 2 ̆ 2 that is violated {{at the time that the}} coercive interrogation takes place. Thus, the due process rule mirrors the 4 th Amendment, which is violated at the time that the search takes place, and not when the evidence seized is admitted into evidence at trial. When analyzing confession admissibility under the due process rule, an <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> obtained from a non-American abroad would be admissible at trial in the United States because the constitution violation would have occurred entirely outside of the United States when the interrogation took place in the foreign country in question. Under the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s holding in U. S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez, therefore, a non-American cannot claim protection of the Bill of Rights when the constitutional violation occurs entirely beyond the borders of the United States. The Article then notes, however, that the Privilege Against Compulsory Self-Incrimination is different than the due process <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule. The Privilege is a 2 ̆ 2 trial right, 2 ̆ 2 a violation of which occurs not at the time of the interrogation, but only when the compelled confessions is introduced into evidence at trial in the United States. Thus, because a violation of the Privilege occurs within the borders of the United States, non-Americans interrogated abroad but tried in America can claim protection of the Privilege and its ban on 2 ̆ 2 compelled 2 ̆ 2 confessions. This raises the next question: 2 ̆ 2 Is the Privilege 2 ̆ 7 s ban on compelled confessions different than the ban on 2 ̆ 2 involuntary 2 ̆ 2 confessions under the due process rule? 2 ̆ 2 While conventional wisdom might suggest these two doctrines are identical, the Article proffers that history, text, precedent and policy all suggest a different test for the Privilege. A confession should be considered 2 ̆ 2 compelled 2 ̆ 2 under the Privilege whenever interrogators impose an objective penalty on a suspect to provoke speech or punish silence. The Article then briefly describes how this new test for compulsion would operate in the interrogation context. The theories in this Article are a precursor to Part III, a work in progress, which will assert that the due process <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> rule and its 2 ̆ 2 voluntariness 2 ̆ 2 test are illegitimate vestiges of legal errors and now obsolete political maneuvers made by the Supreme Court in past decades. The proper test for confession admissibility both abroad and at home should be grounded solely in the Privilege Against Compulsory Self-Incrimination. The test should be objective, should focus solely on the police conduct rather than the state of mind of the suspect, and should ask whether or not the interrogators employed 2 ̆ 2 compulsion 2 ̆ 2 to obtain a confession. Part III will then examine the historical origins of the Privilege, the text of the Privilege, the policies supporting the Privilege, and how the Privilege has been interpreted in the non-interrogation context to expand on the 2 ̆ 2 objective penalties 2 ̆ 2 test for compulsion first set forth in Part II...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{discussion}} about the inadequacy of the Canadian confessions rule in light of what modern forensic psychology reveals about the human mind, and the propensity of legally-sanctioned interrogation tactics to cause suspects to make false confessions. 	Contemporary forensic psychology research makes it clear that many of the techniques used in police interviewing and interrogation can have the effect of subverting or overbearing an individuals free-choice and can cause them to make a false confession. Yet many of these same techniques are considered acceptable according to the Canadian law of voluntariness. This thesis examines the confessions rule and examines the key features of an <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> as defined by the Canadian courts. The thesis also compares the structure and content of two different methods of interrogation used by contemporary police: the Reid Technique, and the PEACE model. The thesis will demonstrate the problems associated with each interrogation method, and will show how a suspect can be led into making an involuntary or false confession. 	The content of this thesis can be broken down into a number of stages [...] The first stage takes a historical approach to the development of confessions law in England and shows how the judges of the nineteenth century gave shape to the basic rule for the admissibility of confessions evidence: the voluntariness doctrine. Next, the application of voluntariness in Canada is examined as the English law was adopted in Canadian cases. The concept of voluntariness then expanded on Canadian soil to take on additional features, which are discussed. These different historical developments are evaluated in light of Herbert Packers crime-control and due process models. Following this, there will be a discussion of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms impact on interrogation and confessions, where the protective capability of the section 10 (b) right to counsel is explored. In the next stage, this thesis will discuss the privilege against self-incrimination with a focus on the fact that many scholars want to do away with this ancient right and move towards an accused-speaks model...|$|E
40|$|Last term 2 ̆ 7 s {{decisions}} in Yarborough v. Alvarado and Missouri v. Seibert shed important {{light on the}} state of the Miranda doctrine in the Supreme Court. In Yarborough, a slim majority held that a state appellate court 2 ̆ 7 s failure to consider a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s age and history of contact with law enforcement in its “custody” determination was not “contrary to” or an “unreasonable application of” clearly established Supreme Court case law. In Seibert, a fractured majority affirmed the Missouri Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision to exclude a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s confession where police officers strategically withheld a suspect 2 ̆ 7 s Miranda rights at the outset of a custodial interrogation and only gave the warnings after obtaining a complete confession. On first impression, both decisions appear quite unrelated. Consider the precise issues before the Court: Yarborough concerned the definition of “custody”; Seibert addressed the proper remedy when police have not honored Miranda 2 ̆ 7 s command that the warnings precede any custodial interrogation. Consider too their procedural postures: Yarborough concerned review of a federal appellate court decision on a habeas petition challenging a state conviction; Seibert involved direct review of a state Supreme Court decision. Studied more closely, the two cases share an important common thread. Both concerned whether an actor 2 ̆ 7 s “subjective” understanding was relevant to the doctrinal inquiry or, instead, whether the inquiry should be guided by purely “objective” factors. In Yarborough, the Court revisited its definition of custody—whether “a reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave”—and appeared to hold that a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s peculiar characteristics were not relevant to the “reasonableness determination. ” In Seibert, the justices divided over whether the availability of the exclusionary remedy following delayed administration of the warnings turned on the objective unreasonableness of the officer 2 ̆ 7 s conduct or on evidence of deliberate misconduct by police. Seen at this level, Yarborough and Seibert carry broader implications about the Court 2 ̆ 7 s willingness (or reluctance) to rely on subjective or objective tests to shape the formation of the Miranda doctrine specifically and “reasonableness” doctrines more generally. To be sure, the Court has not charted an entirely consistent path on these matters, and these most recent decisions confirm the Court 2 ̆ 7 s unpredictability. Nonetheless, one can draw both positive lessons about how the Court confronts reasonableness determinations and normative lessons about how it should do so. This Essay explores these lessons in three parts. Part I traces some of the traditional arguments for and against subjective and objective standards of reasonableness, drawing on debates in other contexts where those issues have arisen. Part II reviews the facts and various opinions of Yarborough and Seibert and then evaluates the opinions in light of these traditional arguments. Part III elevates the critique to a normative level and offers guidance on how the Court should address these doctrinal issues in the future. In the interest of brevity, I subject this Essay to two important simplifying assumptions. First, the Essay does not take a position in the debate over the legitimacy of Miranda—either as a matter of constitutional doctrine or as a matter of policy. I take Miranda doctrine as I find it and simply trace out its logical implications. Second, the Essay assumes that Miranda doctrine should be developed in light of its underlying purposes: to counteract the inherently compelling nature of the custodial interrogation and reduce the risk that an <b>involuntary</b> <b>confession</b> will be admitted at trial through the use of its presumptions, prophylactic rules and exclusionary principles...|$|E

40|$|In {{an era of}} Charter protections, {{the common}} law rule {{excluding}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>confessions</b> remains a suspect’s best legal protection against coercive interrogation. This paper reviews and evaluates the current Canadian confessions rule and points to some ways the protection it offers might be strengthened. The basic contours of the rule are drawn from R. v. Oickle, the leading Supreme Court of Canada case, and refinements to the rule from the recent Supreme Court cases of R. v. Spencer and R. v. Singh are also discussed. The paper concludes that the confessions rule represents a modest but crucial safeguard for the accused that pursues the two distinct goals of excluding unreliable evidence and ensuring fair treatment of interrogated suspects. It is argued that the rule is better suited to promote {{the first of these}} two goals, since it reflects insights from the social science literature on false confessions but places only indirect restraints on interrogators. In any event, the need to balance suspects’ procedural protections against the exigencies of law enforcement places unavoidable limits on the rule’s capacity to advance either goal. The paper suggests several ways in which lawmakers might fortify the protection offered by the confessions rule: by imposing clearer limits on police practices, by offering further guidance on the treatment of vulnerable suspects, by encouraging police to record interrogations, by looking to other Charter rights as safeguards against coercive interrogation, and by educating juries about the problem of false confessions.
