25|$|The main Tonedale site in Wellington was {{the largest}} <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> site in the South West of England, {{covering}} 10 acres of land and forming {{the hub of the}} Fox Brothers woollen manufacturing 'empire'. It {{is believed to have been}} the only 'Twin Vertical Woollen Factory' in the world - that is, making both worsted and woollen products, and controlling the entire process from fleece to finished cloth in-house.|$|E
25|$|De-unionization efforts {{throughout}} the Midwest began in 1897 when Jones and Laughlin Steel {{refused to sign}} a contract. By 1900, not a single steel plant in Pennsylvania remained union. The AA presence in Ohio and Illinois continued {{for a few more}} years, but the union continued to collapse. Many lodges disbanded, their members disillusioned. Others were easily broken in short, desultory battles. Carnegie Steel's Mingo Junction, Ohio plant was the last major unionized steel mill, in the north and east, but it, too, broke the AA and withdrew recognition in 1903. There was however a medium-sized mill in Granite City, IL (Granite City Steel) that continued to have active AA lodges from the late 1890s until SWOC was founded. This plant became part of National Steel Corp. until its assets were sold to US Steel in bankruptcy. The Granite City plant remains the oldest operating <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> in North America (and probably in the Western Hemisphere).|$|E
500|$|In 1813, {{businessman}} Francis Cabot Lowell {{formed a}} company, the Boston Manufacturing Company {{and built a}} textile mill next to the Charles River in Waltham, Massachusetts. [...] Differing from the earlier Rhode Island System, where only carding and spinning were done in a factory while the weaving was often put out to neighboring farms {{to be done by}} hand, the Waltham mill was the first <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> in the United States, transforming raw cotton into cotton cloth in one mill building.|$|E
50|$|Paper mills can {{be fully}} <b>integrated</b> <b>mills</b> or nonintegrated <b>mills.</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>mills</b> {{consist of a}} pulp mill and a paper mill on the same site. Such mills receive logs or wood chips and produce paper.|$|R
50|$|In 2017, {{there were}} 9 {{operating}} <b>integrated</b> steel <b>mills</b> in the United States (plus one idled), down from 13 in 2000. <b>Integrated</b> <b>mills</b> produced 31% {{of the steel}} produced in the US.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>integrated</b> steel <b>mills</b> has {{continued}} to decline, and in 2014, only 11 <b>integrated</b> <b>mills</b> were operating in the US. Most of the steel produced has been by {{the growing number of}} mini-mills, also called specialty mills, which in 2014 numbered 113. In 1981, mini-mills produced an estimated 15% of US steel. Since 2002, steel produced by electric arc furnace, the process used by the mini-mills, has produced more than half the steel made in the US. Many companies operating <b>integrated</b> <b>mills</b> also have mini-mills.|$|R
50|$|The Gary Works {{is a major}} {{steel mill}} in Gary, Indiana, {{on the shore of}} Lake Michigan. For many years, the Gary Works was the world's largest steel mill, and it remains the largest <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> in North America. It is {{operated}} by the United States Steel Corporation.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{steelmaking}} {{arc furnace}} {{is the source}} of steel for a mini-mill, which may make bars or strip product. Mini-mills can be sited relatively near to the markets for steel products, and the transport requirements are less than for an <b>integrated</b> <b>mill,</b> which would commonly be sited near a harbour for access to shipping.|$|E
5000|$|Open Society Azovstal {{is another}} <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> ("Combine"), {{the third largest}} in Ukraine in terms of gross revenue. Its {{production}} varies in millions of tonnes of pig-iron, steel, and rolled iron annually. The company's general director is Oleksiy Bilyi. Azovstal is closely connected with the Mariupol coke works [...] "Markokhim" [...] which serves as the supplier of coke.|$|E

50|$|At {{integrated}} {{pulp and}} paper mills, pulp is usually stored in high density towers before being pumped to stock preparation. Non <b>integrated</b> <b>mills</b> use either dry pulp or wet lap (pressed) pulp, usually received in bales. The pulp bales are slushed in a repulper.|$|R
50|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>mills</b> {{are large}} {{facilities}} that are typically only economical {{to build in}} 2,000,000-ton per year annual capacity and up. Final products made by an integrated plant are usually large structural sections, heavy plate, strip, wire rod, railway rails, and occasionally long products such as bars and pipe.|$|R
50|$|Currently, Nucor (in {{conjunction}} with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates two facilities in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Blytheville, Arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel {{without the need}} for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip) allows an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional <b>integrated</b> <b>mill.</b> They call this concept a 'micro-mill'.|$|E
50|$|In October, 1984 a Merrill Lynch analyst infamously {{predicted}} that U.S. Steel would close Thomson {{within a few}} years.The plant survived {{the collapse of the}} steel industry in the 1980s, which shuttered famous plants, like the Homestead Steel Works in Homestead, or the National Tube Works in Mckeesport, and became the last <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> in the valley, an area which once contained 90,000 people employed in the basic steel industry.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, {{the steel}} mill built by SCOTIA at Sydney Mines was closed, however the <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> at Sydney {{continued}} to expand, using Bell Island iron ore and locally produced coal as a fuel. In 1920, SCOTIA and DOMCO/DISCO merged to form British Empire Steel Corporation, or BESCO, which was reorganized as Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation, or DOSCO, in 1930; SCOTIA and DOMCO remained separate BESCO/DOSCO subsidiaries, with SCOTIA being reorganized as Old Sydney Collieries.|$|E

50|$|By 1912, 80% of Japan's {{pig iron}} {{production}} was from Yahata. An <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> with coke, iron, and steel facilities, Yahata was also responsible {{at this time}} for 80-90% of Japan's steel output. Energy efficiency was greatly improved by the conversion from steam to electricity as a power source, resulting in a drop in consumption of coal per ton of steel produced from four tons in 1920 to 1.58 in 1933. Much of the iron ore was from China and Korea.|$|E

50|$|The {{property}} {{the company}} acquired {{that was once}} owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around 900 acre of land along the river bordering Trenton. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another <b>integrated</b> <b>mill,</b> so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill. Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces, but that was based upon {{the completion of the}} All American Channel. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} {{raw materials}} for an <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> are iron ore, limestone, and coal (or coke). These materials are charged in batches into a blast furnace where the iron compounds in the ore give up excess oxygen and become liquid iron. At intervals of a few hours, the accumulated liquid iron is tapped from the blast furnace and either cast into pig iron or directed to other vessels for further steel making operations. Historically the Bessemer process was a major advancement {{in the production of}} economical steel, but it has now been entirely replaced by other processes such as the basic oxygen furnace.|$|E
50|$|Jacob Isett House and Store, {{also known}} as Arch Spring Farm, is a {{historic}} home and store building located at Arch Spring, Blair County, Pennsylvania. The property includes the Jacob Isett House (1805), store (1799), and summer kitchen; five wood frame outbuildings (c. 1870); and various archaeological remains. The house is a 2 1/2-story, seven bay, limestone dwelling in a vernacular Georgian style. Connected to the house is the one-story summer kitchen. The store is a two-story limestone building. The wood frame outbuildings are a wood shed, weigh shed, stable, barn, and implement shed. The archaeological site includes the remains of an <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> village.|$|E
50|$|The Wellington Foxes built a large textile {{mill and}} a grand house at Tone Dale House, Wellington, Somerset (which {{is now part}} of the Big House Co).The mill is {{currently}} being converted into residential apartments. The brochure says:"The 12.6 acre former woollen textile mill complex is a brownfield site featuring a range of Grade II and Grade II* listed buildings. Established in 1790 by the Fox family, Tonedale Mill was the largest <b>integrated</b> <b>mill</b> in the South West, producing woollen and worsted fabrics. It became a site of national importance during the Boer War when the Tonedale dyers developed the ‘khaki’ dye - given the royal seal of approval by the then Prince of Wales in 1900 - which led to the end of British soldiers’ ‘redcoats’.|$|E
50|$|The 19th {{century was}} a time of rapid {{urbanisation}} and industrialisation in Yorkshire. Yorkshire was already a centre of industry in textiles, concentrated in the West Riding. Steel continued to be concentrated around Sheffield, as was the production of coal.

40|$|Blackliquorgasification (BLG) {{is being}} {{developed}} as an alternative technology for energy and chemical recovery in kraft pulp mills. This study compares BLG – with downstream production of DME (dimethyl ether) or electricity – with recovery boiler-based pulping biorefinery concepts for different types of mills. The comparison is based on profitability as well as CO 2 emissions, using different future energy market scenarios. The possibility for {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) is considered. The results show that, if commercialised, BLG with DME production could be profitable for both market pulp <b>mills</b> and <b>integrated</b> pulp and paper mills in all energy market scenarios considered. Recovery boiler-based biorefinery concepts including extraction of lignin or solid biomass gasification with DME production could also be profitable for market and <b>integrated</b> <b>mills,</b> respectively. If the mill is located close to an infrastructure for CO 2 collection and transportation, CCS significantly improves profitability in scenarios with a high CO 2 emissions charge, for both combustion- and gasification-based systems. Concepts that include CCS generally show a large potential for reduction of global CO 2 emissions. Few of the concepts without CCS achieve a significant reduction of CO 2 emissions, especially for <b>integrated</b> <b>mills...</b>|$|R
