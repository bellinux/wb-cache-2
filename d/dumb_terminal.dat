Assuming the System BIOS still permitted the machine to boot (which {{is often the case}} at least with BIOSes for embedded PCs), the video card could then be removed completely, and the system could provide a total of 960KB of continuous DOS memory for programs to load.|$|E

50|$|The {{system used}} {{telephone}} lines and modems connected to personal computers or to <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> which had built in modems and no processing functionality. Telkom's dedicated terminal {{was named the}} Minitel.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} first applied to devices {{that were not}} capable of running their own {{stand-alone}} programs, but could interact with remote computers via a network. These <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> were clients of the time-sharing mainframe computer.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} used {{in a wide variety of}} programs, {{including}} a conversion of Quake II which allows the 3D game to be played on <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals,</b> and to let media players output in text mode (Xine, MPlayer, VLC).|$|R
50|$|A basic {{packet radio}} station {{consists}} of a computer or <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal,</b> a modem, and a transceiver with an antenna. Traditionally, the computer and modem are combined in one unit, the terminal node controller (TNC), with a <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> (or terminal emulator) used to input and display data. Increasingly, however, personal computers are taking over {{the functions of the}} TNC, with the modem either a standalone unit or implemented entirely in software. Alternatively, multiple manufacturers (including Kenwood and Alinco) now market handheld or mobile radios with built-in TNCs, allowing connection directly to the serial port of a computer or terminal with no other equipment required.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, amateur radio {{operators}} have {{connected to}} AX.25 networks {{through the use}} of a terminal node controller, which contains a microprocessor and an implementation of the protocol in firmware. These devices allow network resources to be accessed using only a <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> and a transceiver.|$|E
50|$|The Unifamily was {{the first}} series of Data I/O's programmers to feature a {{built-in}} user menu. All the programmer required for basic operation was a <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal,</b> hooked up via an RS-232 serial port. Facilities were also provided for computer-based remote control via a second serial port.|$|E
50|$|Thus {{from above}} we can {{understand}} that the Call-Agents are the Brains for the complete infrastructure and the destination end devices i.e. phone, PRI, CO (FXO), Extension (FXS) Media Gateway are under control of Call-Agent instructions for each activity behaving as <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Closely {{related to}} the X.25 {{protocol}} are the protocols to connect asynchronous devices (such as <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> and printers) to an X.25 network: X.3, X.28 and X.29. This functionality was performed using a Packet Assembler/Disassembler or PAD (also known as a Triple-X device, referring to the three protocols used).|$|R
50|$|The TAS system soon was {{succeeded by}} the EVE system; more {{powerful}} and taking advantage of early-model PCs and <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals.</b> By the late 1980s, AMTELCO's EVE (Electronic Video Exchange) system grew {{to become the most}} widely used business telephone answering equipment in the industry. Today, Infinity has replaced EVE as the flagship Telephone switching system.|$|R
5000|$|Videotex (or [...] "interactive videotex") {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} implementations of an end-user information system. From the late 1970s to early 2010s, it was used to deliver information (usually pages of text) to a user in computer-like format, typically to be displayed on a television or a <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Local [...] "craftspersons" [...] (telephone network engineers) {{can access}} a SDH/ SONET network element on a [...] "craft port" [...] and issue {{commands}} through a <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> or terminal emulation program {{running on a}} laptop. This interface can also be attached to a console server, allowing for remote out-of-band management and logging.|$|E
50|$|The later 286 {{version of}} Xenix {{leveraged}} the integrated MMU present on this chip, by running in 286 protected mode. The 286 Xenix {{was accompanied by}} new hardware from Xenix OEMs. For example, the Sperry PC/IT, an IBM PC AT clone, was advertised as capable of supporting eight simultaneous <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> users under this version.|$|E
50|$|With {{the single}} {{copy of the}} Dynix {{software}} installed on a central server, both patrons and librarians could access it by using <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals.</b> The technology for linking the terminals to the server within each building, and linking the separate buildings (branches) together to the central server location, changed over time as technology progressed. The earliest method {{was to have the}} entire system connected via RS-232; there would be many muxes (statistical multiplexers) and many miles of serial lines. Muxes were the phone company's solution for connecting serial lines between branches. Later, <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> were connected via RS-232 to a terminal server, which in turn connected via Ethernet to the branch's LAN. The separate branches would be connected to the central Dynix server via IP-based methods (the Internet). The latest installations used PC's running terminal emulation software, and connecting to the Dynix server via telnet over the Internet.|$|R
50|$|The first {{electronic}} trading platforms were {{typically associated with}} stock exchanges and allowed brokers to place orders remotely using private dedicated networks and <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals.</b> Early systems would not always provide live streaming prices and instead allowed brokers or clients {{to place an order}} which would be confirmed some time later; these were known as 'request for quote' based systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose was to}} connect low-speed <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> to a central time sharing host in Toronto. It was soon modified to allow a terminal to connect to an alternate host running the SHARP APL software under license. Terminals were initially either 2741-type machines based on the 14.8 characters/s IBM Selectric typewriter or 30 character/s ASCII machines. Link speed was limited to 9600 bit/s until about 1984.|$|R
50|$|The Data General-One {{also had}} a {{built-in}} <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> emulator, suggesting an attempt to attract as customers those in organisations with large, expensive minicomputers or mainframes that would access corporate data via terminals such as the ADM-3A or Data General's own Dasher terminals (the cost of the laptop would not have seemed excessive in such situations).|$|E
50|$|An {{intelligent}} {{computer network}} {{is a computer}} network in which the network is in control of application creation and operation. Relatively <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> and devices on the network periphery access centralized network services {{on behalf of their}} users. The owners of the network are in complete charge of the type and quantity of applications that exist on the network.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{systems could}} have the {{graphics}} card removed {{so that they could}} be used as a servers; in such a case the keyboard and mouse were automatically ignored, and the system accessed either across the network, or via a <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> plugged into the machine's serial port. Such a system was designated [...] "DSP" [...] instead of [...] "DN".|$|E
50|$|CP/M-86 1.1 (with BDOS 2.2) and MP/M-86 2.x were merged {{to create}} Concurrent CP/M-86 3.0 (also known as CCP/M-86) with BDOS 3.0 in 1982/1983. Initially, {{this was a}} single-user {{operating}} system supporting true multi-tasking of up to four (in its default configuration) CP/M-86 compatible programs. Later versions supported <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> and so could be deployed as multiuser systems. Concurrent CP/M-86 3.1 (BDOS 3.1) shipped on 21 February 1984.|$|R
50|$|In {{information}} technology, Questar computer terminals are {{a line of}} largely 3270-compatible text-only <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> {{manufactured by}} Groupe Bull and widely used in France and some other markets. The terminals combine standard 3270 emulation {{with a number of}} Questar-specific features. The terminals have been most successful with users who already operate compatible Bull mainframe systems, and have achieved far less market penetration as plug-compatible replacements for IBM 3270 terminals.|$|R
50|$|S/KEY is a {{one-time}} password system developed for authentication to Unix-like operating systems, especially from <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> or untrusted public computers on which {{one does not}} want to type a long-term password. A user's real password is combined in an offline device with a short set of characters and a decrementing counter to form a single-use password. Because each password is only used once, they are useless to password sniffers.|$|R
5000|$|Alloy grew to $50 {{million in}} annual sales by 1986 and {{executed}} a successful IPO in June of that year. Alloy had an installed base of 150,000 users by the early 1990s, largely small businesses, comprising a relatively {{significant portion of the}} multi-user DOS marketplace. One DOS based computer was equipped with a multi-user/multi-tasking operating system called [...] "386/MultiWare" [...] which along with specialized hardware could provide serial connectivity to up to 20 <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> clients. Each <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> was connected to a session running up to 8 concurrent DOS virtual machines, all running on the host computer. If a problem arose with a single DOS virtual machine it could be rebooted without an effect on other terminals attached. Later [...] "MultiNode" [...] was introduced to meet client needs operating under the Novell network operating system allowing both Client/Server network connectivity as well as serial terminal users.|$|E
50|$|Before the Web, {{most people}} {{accessed}} remote computers via <b>dumb</b> <b>terminal</b> emulators running on their PCs. BBS systems came in two flavors: DOS based and proprietary. DOS based systems required one PC and one modem for each incoming phone line. It {{was not uncommon}} for a BBS to have a hundred IBM PCs stacked up next to shelves of a hundred modems.|$|E

50|$|At one point, Dynix was benchmarked {{supporting}} 1,600 terminals on {{a single}} system. This stability would later come in handy; the largest installations ever were the King County Library System in the greater Seattle area, which was largest by collection size (10's of millions of cataloged items), and New York Public Library in New York City, which covered the largest geographical area with 87 branches (requiring <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals</b> numbering into the thousands).|$|R
5000|$|Software {{flow control}} is used {{extensively}} by low-speed devices, especially older printers and <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals,</b> to indicate they are temporarily unable to accept more data. Typically, {{this is due}} to a combination of limited output rate and any buffers being full. Some terminal control packages, such as termcap, employ [...] "padding" [...] (short delays using millisecond granularity) to allow such equipment sufficient time to perform the requested actions without the need to assert XOFF.|$|R
5000|$|CMS {{started in}} the era of teletype-style paper terminals, and the later [...] "glass teletype" [...] <b>dumb</b> <b>terminals.</b> By the late 1970s, however, most VM users were {{connecting}} via full-screen terminals [...] - [...] particularly the IBM 3270, the ubiquitous transaction processing terminal on IBM mainframes. The 3270 played a strategic role in IBM's product line, making its selection a natural choice for large data centers of the day. Many other manufacturers eventually offered bisync terminals that emulated the 3270 protocol.|$|R
