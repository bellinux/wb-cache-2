5|$|At {{a meeting}} of local Democrats in Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1859, Brown was {{nominated}} to oppose Joshua Jewett for Jewett's seat in the House of Representatives. Despite Brown's protests that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year younger than the legal age to serve, he was elected over Jewett by about two thousand votes. He did not take his seat until the second congressional session because of his age. He {{became a member of}} the Douglas National Committee in 1860 and engaged in a series of debates with supporters of John C. Breckinridge for president, including Breckinridge's cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday saw limited running as well, as training was halted {{due to a}} massive crash by Carlos Sainz Jr.. The Spaniard lost control of his car going into turn 13, hit a wall {{and went on to}} crash into the safety barriers, burying the nose of his car in the process. The session was stopped while Sainz was taken {{out of the car and}} transported to hospital, albeit uninjured. Practice was not resumed afterwards and the time of 1:38.561 set by Nico Rosberg before the accident remained the fastest lap of the session. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> seven-tenths of a second faster than Valtteri Bottas in second, with Lewis Hamilton another tenth behind. Sainz's teammate Max Verstappen finished the session 17th fastest after spinning in the final corner.|$|E
5|$|Engel was {{the fastest}} driver {{who was not}} issued with a penalty to not qualify within the top ten; his fastest time was eight-tenths of a second slower than Piquet's pole {{position}} lap. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one-tenth of a second faster than 13th-placed qualifier Félix da Costa, who in turn, was nearly four-tenths ahead of débutant Carroll. The three drivers were followed by Sarrazin in 15th, and Evans in 16th; the latter struggled with cold brakes and tyres which prevented him from going faster. Ma's left-rear quarter was damaged when he contacted the barriers lining the circuit and qualified 17th. Jérôme d'Ambrosio struggled and was restricted to starting behind Ma. Di Grassi pushed hard and made a mistake at the chicane, making contact with the wall, and his front-left quarter was damaged, triggering red-flag conditions with three minutes left of the second group's running. He was restricted to starting 19th. Frijns completed the field and caused qualifying to be temporarily stopped when his car went airborne after hitting the kerbs at the chicane and collided with the barrier.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{candidates}} {{to host the}} program included Soupy Sales, host of children's variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live, {{the search for a}} host continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from Los Angeles and New York. First attending a tryout in lieu of a friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position {{in the first week of}} September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, in October the {{two sides}} came to an agreement, broadly on {{the lines of the}} earlier Ikhshidid proposal: al-Ikhshid {{acknowledged}} Hamdanid control over northern Syria and even consented to sending an annual tribute in exchange for Sayf al-Dawla's renunciation of all claims on Damascus. The Hamdanid ruler was also to marry one of al-Ikhshid's daughters or nieces. For al-Ikhshid, the maintenance of Aleppo was less important than southern Syria with Damascus, which was Egypt's eastern bulwark. Provided that these remained under his control, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> willing to allow the existence of a Hamdanid state in the north. The Egyptian ruler knew that he would have difficulty in asserting and maintaining control over northern Syria and Cilicia, which had traditionally been influenced more by Upper Mesopotamia and Iraq. By abandoning its claims on these distant provinces, not only would Egypt be spared the cost of maintaining a large army there, but the Hamdanid emirate would also fulfil the useful role of a buffer state against incursions from both Iraq and a resurgent Byzantine Empire. Indeed, throughout al-Ikhshid's rule, and that of his successors, relations with the Byzantines were quite friendly, as the lack of a common border and the common hostility to the Fatimids guaranteed that the interests of the two states did not clash. Despite Sayf al-Dawla's attempt to push again into southern Syria soon after al-Ikhshid's death, the border agreed in 945 held, and even outlived both dynasties, forming the dividing line between Mesopotamian-influenced northern Syria and the Egyptian-controlled southern part of the country until the Mamluks seized the entire region in 1260.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} week at Phoenix, Johnson started inside {{the top ten}} and finished second behind Carl Edwards. He followed this with a sixth-place finish at Las Vegas. At Bristol, he was running on the lead lap until a spin late race forced him back to a 22nd-place finish. At Fontana, he struggled {{for most of the}} race, racing near the back of the pack, but managed to salvage a 12th-place finish. Johnson won his first pole position of the season at Martinsville and had the dominant car, leading 346 of 500 laps on the way to his eighth Martinsville race win. Johnson also assumed the point lead as well, which he would hold on to {{for the remainder of the}} regular season. Johnson's consistency was enough that there were points in the summer where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a full two race wins' worth of points ahead of Carl Edwards or Clint Bowyer. Afterward, Johnson finished sixth at Texas. At Kansas, he led nine laps and finished third behind Matt Kenseth and Kasey Kahne. Johnson finished 12th the {{following week}} at Richmond, allowing him to build even further on his point lead. At Talladega, he was the only driver besides Matt Kenseth to lead double digit laps (16), and finished in fifth place. A fourth-place finish the following week at Darlington allowed Johnson to further solidify his point lead over Edwards.|$|E
25|$|Some {{years passed}} before he again {{attempted}} romance writing, {{and then the}} first two parts of Gil Blas de Santillane were published in 1715, without the popularity of Le Diable boiteux. Lesage worked {{at it for a}} long time, and did not bring out the third part till 1724, nor the fourth till 1735. During these twenty years he was, however, continually busy. Notwithstanding the great merit and success of Turcaret and Crispin, the Théâtre Français did not welcome him, and in 1715 he began to write for the Théâtre de la foire, the comic opera held in booths at festival time. According to one computation he produced, either alone or with others, about a hundred pieces, varying from strings of songs with no regular dialogues, to comediettas only distinguished from regular plays by the introduction of music. He was also industrious in prose fiction. Besides finishing Gil Blas he translated the Orlando innamorato (1721), rearranged Guzman d'Alfarache (1732), published two more or less original novels, Le Bachelier de Salamanque and Estevanille Gonzalez, and in 1733 produced the Vie et aventures de M. de Beauchesne, which resembles certain works of Daniel Defoe. Besides all this, Lesage was also the author of La Valise trouvée, a collection of imaginary letters, and of some minor pieces including Une journée des Parques. He did not retire until 1740, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> seventy years of age; he and his wife went to live with his second son, who was a canon at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Lesage's eldest son, Louis-André, had become an actor, and Lesage had disowned him. Lesage's last work, Mélange amusant de saillies d'esprit et de traits historiques les plus frappants, appeared in 1743.|$|E

25|$|The team's winning ways {{continued}} at Paris–Nice in March. Goss won the field sprint finish to stage 3, after narrowly missing {{a victory in}} stage 2, maneuvering around riders who fell after 's Peter Sagan crashed on the course's final sharp turn. In the mountainous stage 5, Martin finished with the first group {{on the road to}} assume fourth place {{at the end of the}} day, ten seconds down on race leader Andreas Klöden. This was an advantageous position with the stage 6 individual time trial to come; Martin was viewed as a favorite for the time trial. The next day, Martin handily won the time trial, with only five riders finishing within a minute of his winning time. He took the race lead, with a 36-second lead over Klöden in the overall standings. His advantage largely held steady over the last two days, giving him the overall race crown. The team won the flat first stage of the Volta a Catalunya, but not in the manner by which they regularly win flat stages. New acquisition Smukulis made the morning breakaway and had it stick to the finish. Last shedding former teammate Ben Gastauer of , Smukulis soloed to victory 28 seconds ahead of the charging peloton. It was his first professional victory, and he was visibly emotional as he crossed the finish line. He held the race lead for a second day before giving it up on the high mountain stage 3, as he lost nearly 17 minutes that day. At the Tour of the Basque Country, Albasini won the mountains classification thanks to back-to-back nearly day-long efforts in the breakaways in stages 4 and 5. Also, Martin won the time trial which closed out the event, again besting Klöden, though this time the elder German was the overall race winner. The team was successful on two fronts at the Tour of California. Van Garderen showed solid climbing legs on the race's two summit finishes. Though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a minute back of the stage winner both days, he was well better than the majority of the field, including all his rivals for the youth classification. He won the award at the end of the race by almost six minutes over 's Andrew Talansky. The last stage featured a group sprint finish. Where their leadout train had been outmaneuvered by 's earlier in the race, this time Goss was successfully delivered to the line first. Van Garderen's final overall placing was fifth. Degenkolb and Albasini both found their way into the winner's circle at Bayern-Rundfahrt. First, Degenkolb edged out fellow young German sprinter Marcel Kittel in the finish to stage 2. Albasini won a breakaway sprint the next day, best of a nine-man group. This win gave him the race lead for a day, and he held on to finish on the event's final podium in third place.|$|E
