The regeneration effects of oncomodulin outcompetes other neurotrophic factors like BDNF, CNTF, and GDNF (4).

It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours.
