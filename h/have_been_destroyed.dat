5|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} the brick shrine was {{destroyed}} either by a cyclone or a tsunami which took place 2,200 years ago. The Pallavas built a granite temple on the brick foundation in the 8th century AD, which also was likely to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed</b> by a tsunami. Archaeologists {{believe that the}} second tsunami must {{have occurred in the}} 13th century AD as the latest inscriptions which speak of the shrine have been dated to 1215.|$|E
5|$|Due to the show's {{habit of}} repeating cliffhanger footage, {{sometimes}} missing episode material {{can be found}} in surviving neighbor episodes. Episode 2 of The Daleks uses a prefilmed reprise from the original recording of Episode 1, which later had to be remounted; the original version of Episode 1 is presumed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed</b> simply by people throwing debris into them {{while others have}} ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E

5|$|The Boca Chita Key {{structures}} are administered {{as a cultural}} landscape, interpreting the area's use as a retreat for the rich. More modest homesteads include the now-abandoned plantations developed by Israel Jones and his sons, and the Sweeting Homestead on Elliott Key. The frame structures associated with these plantations, together {{with those of the}} Cocolobo Cay Club and frame buildings on Boca Chita Key, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed</b> by fire and hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed,</b> hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. Out at sea, ships {{take advantage of their}} known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed</b> by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E
5|$|Between Operations Trident and Python, and the Indian Air Force {{attacks on}} Karachi's fuel and {{ammunition}} depots, {{more than fifty}} percent of the total fuel requirement of the Karachi zone was reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The result was a crippling economic blow to Pakistan. The damage was estimated to be worth $3billion, with most of the oil reserves and ammunition warehouses and workshops destroyed. The Pakistan Air Force was also affected by the loss of fuel.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, after The Bell Jar was published, Plath {{began working}} on another {{literary}} work titled Double Exposure. It was never published and disappeared around 1970. Theories {{about what happened to}} the unfinished manuscript are repeatedly brought up in the book Sylvia Plath's Fiction: A Critical Study by Luke Ferretter. Ferretter also claims that the rare books department at Smith College in Massachusetts has a secret copy of the work under seal. Ferretter believes that the draft of Double Exposure may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed,</b> stolen, or even lost. He presumes in his book that the draft may lie unfound in a university archive.|$|E
5|$|Many of New Zealand’s geysers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed</b> {{by humans}} {{in the last}} century. Several New Zealand geysers have also become dormant or extinct by natural means. The main {{remaining}} field is Whakarewarewa at Rotorua. Two thirds of the geysers at Orakei Korako were flooded by the Ohakuri hydroelectric dam in 1961. The Wairakei field was lost to a geothermal power plant in 1958. The Taupo Spa field was lost when the Waikato River level was deliberately altered in the 1950s. The Rotomahana field was destroyed by the Mount Tarawera eruption in 1886.|$|E

By this point the North Korean Air Force was considered to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed,</b> losing 110 aircraft and only possessing 35, with only 18 operable. Through August and September, the North Koreans could only muster at most 16 sorties a day, most by isolated, single aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Only six Molyneux globes {{are known}} to exist today, two {{terrestrial}} globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and Kassel (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but it is believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed</b> during World War II. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by Middle Temple in London and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed.</b> He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{first version}} of the painting, {{completed}} in 1883 and originally exhibited in Chicago, was lost for some time. It was rediscovered in 1965 and purchased {{by a group of}} North Carolina investors in 2007 for an undisclosed amount. Until November 2005, the second painting, originally exhibited in the Cyclorama Building in Boston, was on display at the Gettysburg National Military Park. It was removed for restoration work and the exhibition was reopened September 2008 in the new Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center. The third version, exhibited in Philadelphia, is known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The location of the fourth version, originally exhibited in Brooklyn, is unknown.|$|E
