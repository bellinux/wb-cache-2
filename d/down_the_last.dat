5|$|This {{turned out}} to be unnecessary, however, as Tyler Fredrickson's punt was {{returned}} 52yards by Virginia Tech's DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown. Hall's return tied the game at 49–49, and with 3:11 remaining in the game, California took over on offense. On his first play after receiving Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The Bears' Chris Murphy jumped on the ball, preventing what otherwise might have been a game-losing turnover. Rodgers recovered from the fumble by completing three straight passes: first to J. J. Arrington for 11yards, then to Brandon Hall for 18yards and a first down, then to Burl Toler for 22yards and another first <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> <b>last</b> play took California deep into Virginia Tech territory. At the Tech 20-yard line, Rodgers rushed for a five-yard gain, then prepared the offense for a potential game-winning field goal kick. With twoseconds remaining on the clock, California called timeout and sent in kicker Tyler Fredrickson. Despite an attempt by Virginia Tech to ice the kicker by calling its final timeout, Fredrickson was undeterred by the pressure and his 35-yard field goal sailed through the goalposts as time expired. The kick gave California three points and the 52–49 victory.|$|E

25|$|This railway line {{continued}} operation until 1957, when {{a combination of}} pressures from the National Capital Commission, who wished {{to cut down on}} the number of railway lines through Ottawa in an effort to eliminate noise pollution, as well as from the Saint Lawrence Seaway project, which required the removal of the railway's bridge in Cornwall, caused the railway line to shut <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> <b>last</b> trains ran in February 1957, and in April CN purchased the railway track and proceeded to demolish it.

A few decades later, the municipal government constructed a rail trail on the right of way, which remains in use to the present day.|$|E
25|$|The Essex v Northamptonshire {{match was}} played at Valentines Park, Ilford 17 to 20 May. Northamptonshire won the toss {{and decided to}} bat, scoring 215 all out with a top score of 49 by Vince Broderick while Essex's Test leg break and googly bowler Peter Smith took four for 65. By close of play on Saturday, Essex had replied to 170 for 4 with opener Chick Cray on 90 not out. He {{completed}} his century, exactly 100, on Monday morning and Essex went on to total 267 all out. Northamptonshire were 219 for 5 at the close on Monday evening with their veteran batsman John Timms on 90 not out. Timms was out for 112 on Tuesday morning and Peter Smith completed ten in the match by taking six for 84 in the Northamptonshire total of 291. Essex therefore needed 240 to win with ample time left on the final day. They had a good stand of 103 for the fourth wicket between Frank Vigar (60) and Len Clark (64) but spinners Broderick and Bertie Clarke kept picking up the wickets and Essex were still ten behind when the ninth went <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> <b>last</b> pair were captain Tom Pearce and wicketkeeper Tom Wade who managed to level the scores before Wade was bowled by Clarke to tie the match.|$|E
