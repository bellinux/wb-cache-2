40|$|Estimates serve {{a number}} of {{different}} functions in the construction industry. The reason for estimating is to provide the most realistic prediction possible of time and cost at any given stage in a project. Over the life of a project the estimator should be able to produce a series of estimates, from an early estimate at beginning, to the final account, in which the increasing accuracy of the estimate is reflected in the decreasing extent of risk and uncertainty. All estimates take the form of base estimates, plus allowances for uncertainties and specific contingencies as required. The role of the estimator or practitioner in cost engineering is vital to the success of a construction project. The estimators are responsible for predicting the most economic costs for construction {{in a way that is}} both clear and consistent. Although an estimator will have a feel for the prices in the marketplace, it is the responsibility of management to add an amount for <b>general</b> <b>overheads,</b> assess the risks and turn the estimate into tender...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Belgian {{third-party}} payer {{wishes to}} set reimbursement tariffs {{at a level}} that reflects the costs of orthotic braces. This article aims to calculate production and distribution costs of a prefabricated hard neck and knee brace and to explore whether Belgian tariffs and actual retail prices correspond with estimated costs of these two braces. METHODS: The cost model considered manufacturing costs, <b>general</b> <b>overheads,</b> research and development costs, warehousing costs, profit and distribution margins. Data were gathered from manufacturers, a production site visit, desk research, a decomposition of finished products and stakeholder interviews. The price year was 2007. RESULTS: The cost model estimated a retail price of euro 55 -euro 150 for the neck brace, depending on assumptions. The estimated retail price for the neck brace was lower than the reimbursement tariff of euro 194 and the actual retail price of euro 241. The estimated retail price of euro 331 -euro 694 for the knee brace was lower than the actual retail price of euro 948. CONCLUSIONS: Actual retail prices and reimbursement tariffs for a neck brace and a knee brace exceeded prices based on estimated costs. Therefore, there appears to be scope for reducing tariffs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the tendering process {{from the point}} of view of Swedish building contractors. The purpose with the study is to chart the decision process for the contractors during the tendering process.   The study is designed as a survey study. This made it possible to reach a wide base of respondents, not letting such factors as geography being an issue. The survey itself was characterised by a very high response rate compared to other similar studies.   The result from this study shows that former experience from similar projects, current workload and the clients economic condition are very important factors for both whether or not the contractor will bid for a project as well as the cost estimation and tendering price. Former experience from similar projects is also an important factor for the determination of the indirect costs. Furthermore the work of indirect cost determination is characterised by the view that site overheads in comparison to <b>general</b> <b>overheads</b> tends to vary to a greater extent depending on the project. The need for better methods for determination of site overheads is another study result that deserves to be highlighted. Finally this study shows that markup size for risks involved can be a tricky subject matter, especially for small building contractors. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{state of}} the art in Grid style data {{management}} is to achieve increased resilience of data via multiple complete replicas of data files across multiple storage endpoints. While this is effective, it is not the most space-efficient approach to resilience, especially when the reliability of individual storage endpoints is sufficiently high that only a few will be inactive at any point in time. We report on work performed as part of GridPP[1], extending the Dirac File Catalogue and file management interface to allow the placement of erasure-coded files: each file distributed as N identically-sized chunks of data striped across a vector of storage endpoints, encoded such that any M chunks can be lost and the original file can be reconstructed. The tools developed are transparent to the user, and, as well as allowing up and downloading of data to Grid storage, also provide the possibility of parallelising access across all of the distributed chunks at once, improving data transfer and IO performance. We expect this approach to be of most interest to smaller VOs, who have tighter bounds on the storage available to them, but larger (WLCG) VOs may be interested as their total data increases during Run 2. We provide an analysis of {{the costs and benefits of}} the approach, along with future development and implementation plans in this area.

40|$|The {{claim for}} damages is an {{effective}} sanction to react to infringements of intellectual property rights like patents, utility models, designs, copyrights and trademarks. Article 125 of the Italian Industrial Property Code expressly provides the obligation of the infringer to pay the rightholder damages to compensate the injury suffered. Damage claims in this field are not governed by the same principles which run for different property rights. The italian Supreme Court held that the right-holder can choose among three methods {{for the assessment of}} the damages suffered: 1. actual damages, including lost profits; 2. the royalty which is normally paid by a licensee; 3. the profits obtained by the infringer. Under the new Code the right-holder can elect two different remedies, a wrong one –with the three methods - and a restitutionary one, in which the basic principle is restitution and not wrong or tort, because the remedy is provided even though the infringement is not wilfully or negligently committed, and the infringer can deduct a portion of his <b>general</b> <b>overheads</b> allocated to the production and marketing of the infringing product. The claimant can award either damages and the recovery of profits which are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account when calculating the compensatory damages. The claim is a restitutionary one and not only, or not always, a tort: or, as common law courts say, the award is not (or not only) for its loss but for an account of the profits made by the defendant {{as a result of the}} infringement. We cannot assume that all of the profits will be awarded, and so the problem, under a legal framework like the one designed by the european directives, is more and more how the profits have to be calculated. It can be assumed that in the future a right-holder will more often choose the restitutionary remedy to recover all the profits made by the infringer which are attributable to the infringement and which are not taken into account when calculating the compensatory damages. The right holder cannot recover the profits attributable to factors other than the protected property right. Whereas under English law the claimant must make an election between damages and account of profits, under the new italian Code, a successful claimant can award both damages and restitutionary remedy, to strip the defendant of its gains: the defendant is entitled to deduct from its profits certain costs incurred and must only account for the profits made as a result of the wrongdoing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{storage of}} data on remote systems such as the public cloud opens new {{challenges}} {{in the field of}} data protection and security of the stored files. One possible solution for meeting these challenges is the encryption of the data at the local device, e. g. desktop, tablet, or smartphone, prior to the data transfer to the remote cloud-based storage. However, this approach bears additional challenges itself, such as secure encryption key management or secure and effective sharing of data in user groups. Including an additional encryption layer and security checks may additionally affect the system’s usability, as higher security requirements and a group sharing workflow increase <b>general</b> <b>overhead</b> through the complete organization of processes. To overcome such issues, we propose a solution which is based on highly secure and attack-resistant hardware-based encryption applied through the use of the Austrian citizen card public key infrastructure. As the citizen card infrastructure is already deployed and available to a wide population, the service overhead and additional requirements of our proposed solution are lower in comparison to other approaches, {{while at the same time}} synergistic and networking effects of the deployed infrastructure facilitate its usage and further potentials. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on a Cognitive Relay Network (CRN) where only the {{information}} of the average channel gains {{is available at the}} secondary source. A distributed multiple relay selection scheme is proposed for the secondary transmission. Since the secondary source does not fully control the selection but lets each secondary relay decide by itself, it doesn't know which and how many relays will participate in the forwarding. This brings a serious uncertainty in the number of forwarding relays. We analyze this uncertainty and derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability of the secondary transmission under the uncertainty. Finally, we evaluate the proposed relay selection scheme by means of simulation. The simulation shows the appropriateness of our analytical model. In addition, although having lower interference constraint at each relay, the performances of the proposed multi-relay CRN scheme are shown to be strictly superior to the single relay CRN. Moreover, the simulation results suggest {{that it is necessary to}} spend the <b>general</b> <b>overhead</b> for secondary networks on knowing the exact QoS requirement of the primary user (i. e. the interference violation probability) to apply our proposed relay selection scheme with the statistical total interference constraint.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} multiple-antenna interference channels, accounting for <b>general</b> <b>overhead</b> {{as a function of}} the number of users and antennas in the network. The model includes both perfect and imperfect channel state information based on channel estimation in the presence of noise. Three low complexity methods are proposed for reducing the impact of overhead in the sum network throughput by partitioning users into orthogonal groups. The first method allocates spectrum to the groups equally, creating an imbalance in the sum rate of each group. The second proposed method allocates spectrum unequally among the groups to provide rate fairness. Finally, geographic grouping is proposed for cases where some receivers do not observe significant interference from other transmitters. For each partitioning method, the optimal solution not only requires a brute force search over all possible partitions, but also requires full channel state information, thereby defeating the purpose of partitioning. We therefore propose greedy methods to solve the problems, requiring no instantaneous channel knowledge. Simulations show that the proposed greedy methods switch from time-division to interference alignment as the coherence time of the channel increases, and have a small loss relative to optimal partitioning only at moderate coherence times.

These hyperspectral images consist of large amounts of data, much of which is redundant and must be compressed. The purpose of this thesis was -to investigate and optimize a Karhunen [...] Loe��ve transform (KLT) based algorithm to compress hyperspectral images. The thesis focused on combining a multi-level Karhunen [...] Loe��ve transform with spatial aggregation in the form of K-means and JPEG 2000 to improve compression performance as compared to similar lossy to lossless compression methods. The developed algorithm is dubbed Spatially Aggregated Multilevel Clustering (SAMLC) KLT.

40|$|The dairy {{landscape}} in the Republic of Ireland {{is characterized by}} pastoral spring-calving systems and a bell-shaped milk production curve. This seasonality at producer level initiates various implications at processor level, such as poor utilization of plant capacity off-peak season, a requirement for seasonal labour management and limited product options in autumn and winter months due to the properties of late-lactation milk. An optimization model was developed to analyze the impact of production seasonality and quota removal on the Irish dairy processing industry in terms of maximum processor gross surplus, the optimum product mix and the marginal values of the milk solids fat, protein and lactose. Processor gross surplus was specified {{as a function of}} product sales revenue, less variable costs of collecting and processing raw milk and <b>general</b> <b>overhead</b> (fixed) costs. 5 scenarios with differing milk intake curves were examined whereby a flatter intake curve incurred less monthly variation in the marginal producer milk price, capacity utilization and product mix as well as a higher surplus as compared to more seasonal patterns. However, an isolated consideration of financial indicators at processor level disregards key characteristics of Irish grass-based seasonal milk production and producer-processor interdependencies. It was therefore concluded that a broader modelling approach integrating both the producer and the processor perspectives is desirable for more holistic analysis of sector-wide implications.

In this context, the UICC has developed a Global Task Force on Radiotherapy for Cancer Control with a charge to answer a single question: “What does it cost {{to close the gap}} between what exists today and reasonable access to radiotherapy globally?” The Task Force consists of leaders internationally recognized for their radiation treatment related expertise (radiation oncologists, medical physicists, radiation therapists) as well as those with global health and economics specialization. The Task Force has developed three working groups: (1) to look at the global burden of cancer; (2) to look at the infrastructure requirements (facilities, equipment, personnel); and (3) to consider outcomes in terms of numbers of lives saved and palliated patients. A report is due at the World Cancer Congress in December 2014. This presentation reviews the infrastructure considerations under analysis by the second work group. The infrastructure parameters being addressed include capital costs of buildings and equipment and operating costs, which include human resources, equipment servicing and quality control, and <b>general</b> <b>overhead...</b>|$|R

Screening for required {{experience and}} capacity was undertaken by each bidder having {{to complete a}} detailed questionnaire. The construction delivery method, or type of construction contract, was a [...] "fixed-fee-cost-plus", meaning the work would be performed {{for the cost of}} the materials and labor plus a fixed fee for the <b>general</b> contractor's <b>overhead</b> and profit. On October 28, 1949, the General Services Administration received bids from 15 general contractors ranging up to $950,000 for fees. The low bid was for $100,000 from John McShain Inc.; {{by the end of the}} project, he had reportedly lost approximately $200,000, bringing his total costs for supervision, management, and other overhead to around $300,000.|$|R

Despite the proximity of the Yên Bái Air Base only 5 mi away and its well-developed anti-aircraft defenses, there were no losses during his rescue.|$|R
40|$|Reductions are {{commonly}} used in parallel programs to produce a global result from partial results computed in parallel. Currently, OpenMP only supports reductions for primitive data types and a limited set of base language operators. This is a significant limitation for those applications that employ user-defined data types (e. g., objects). Implementing manual reduction algorithms makes software development more complex and error-prone. Additionally, an OpenMP runtime system cannot optimize a manual reduction algorithm in ways typically applied to reductions on primitive types. In this paper, we propose new mechanisms to allow the use of most pre-existing binary functions on user-defined data types as User-Defined Reduction (UDR) operators. Our measurements show that our UDR prototype implementation provides consistently good performance {{across a range of}} thread counts without increasing <b>general</b> runtime <b>overheads...</b>|$|R
