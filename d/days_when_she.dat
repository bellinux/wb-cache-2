The actress {{believed}} that she had performed badly in the audition and decided to leave for a five-week snowboarding holiday in Canada. Robbie had been in Canada for two <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> received a phone call telling her that she had been successful and that she had to return to Australia. Robbie began appearing on-screen in June of that year. Donna was originally supposed to have a guest character role, but Robbie was promoted to regular cast member shortly after her debut.|$|E

In January 1933 the American journal Aquariana published an article written by McKenzie concerning 'Some interesting inhabitants of Sydney seashores', in which she recommended keeping sea horses in a salt-water tank.|$|E

The play largely is {{composed}} of a fanciful collection of interviews that never took place between Monroe and Mailer during Marilyn Monroe's last hours. The play made its Off Broadway debut in January 1986, which included Mailer's wife Norris Church in the cast and subsequently his daughter Kate Mailer in the Monroe role. Kate Mailer additionally appeared on the April 1986 Vanity Fair cover as the Marilyn Monroe character in Strawhead.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interest}} in Halloween and songwriting came together one <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> {{was playing the}} organ at a funeral, and the tune to the traditional round, [...] "Ghost of John," [...] wove through her head.

She opened as a museum on 27 July. The restored ironclad was renamed HMS Warrior (1860) to avoid confusion with the Northwood Headquarters, commissioned as HMS Warrior in 1963, which was at the time the operational headquarters of the Royal Navy.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 {{review by}} Simon noted that Donna lacked {{dedication}} to her job, and was easily distracted by her love life. Following an April 2008 interview with Jacobs, the itv.com website for the entertainment show This Morning observed that despite Donna's [...] "chaotic" [...] personal life, {{she had grown}} more serious about her work. Ultimately, adopting her half-niece Mia forced Donna to grow up, focussing on her career by attaining promotion to ward sister and accepting the resultant responsibilities. Reflecting on Donna's development in January 2011, Jacobs observed that she had changed {{a great deal from}} her early <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was used as a comical character with [...] "bumbling one-liners", into a serious, more responsible person.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, {{the year}} before she died, Potter's {{thoughts}} returned to Kitty MacDonald when she wrote about a piece of crockery:Seventy eighty years ago it belonged to another old woman, old Katie MacDonald, the Highland washerwoman. She was a tiny body, brown as a berry, beady black eyes and much wrinkled, against an incongruously white frilled mutch. She wore a small plaid crossed over shawl pinned with a silver brooch, a bed jacket, and a full kilted petticoat. She dropped bob curtsies, but she was outspoken and very independent, proud and proper ... The joy of converse with old Katie was to draw her out {{to talk of the}} <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was a wee bit lassie—herding the kine.

500|$|Sanctuary {{was mostly}} filmed on virtual green screen sets. Initially Tapping went through {{what she called}} [...] "chroma key green headaches" [...] because she had to stare at nothing but bright green walls {{for the first few}} <b>days.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> got used to it, she likened filming on green screen to working in theatre. In the second season her daughter, Ashley was killed off. The producers, as well as the American and Canadian {{networks}} to give the character, including Magnus, a deep and most dramatic impact. They also wanted Magnus to feel more angry and vulnerable throughout the season, especially in the first three episodes. After playing Magnus in the series' third season, Tapping admitted that she still does not get Magnus because [...] "there's so many things about the decisions that she makes that I still can't wrap my head around, and to me that's fascinating as an actor, to try to get inside somebody so complex and so kind of confusing." [...] In the episode [...] "Normandy", Tapping wore a red-haired wig for Magnus during her time in the Second World War, as an homage to her late grandmother. For the fourth season, Tapping requested that Magnus would be given a new love interest. The request was granted {{in the form of a}} female virologist appearing early in the season (thus establishing Magnus's bisexuality).|$|E
2500|$|While The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie {{was still}} an unproduced script, Alfred Hitchcock read it and offered Allen the script for Marnie (1964).

2500|$|Of {{particular}} {{prominence in}} the soundtrack is the 1933 Taiwanese song [...] "Bāng Chhun-hong". As the producers were writing the script in New York, Woo Yen Yen called her mother to ask her about the most popular song of her time. Her mother's first suggestion was [...] "Bong Chun Hong", a song which the producers came to like. The song was later adopted as the opening theme, and the character Siew Luan would hum it again as the film concludes, this time more wistfully as she would recount the <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was young. Four major and three minor variations of [...] "Bong Chun Hong" [...] {{were included in the}} soundtrack. As Moviexclusive describes Sydney Tan's score, [...] "the [...] use of pianos and strings is complemented by the occasional wistful accompaniments of the traditional erhu, adding the essential 'Asian touch' to the music." ...|$|E

Times and dates may also change due to school holidays, special occasions and unexpected events. Two sailings a day, Sunday or night sailings are rare and usually only arranged by the Steamship Company when an exceptionally high number of passengers depend on the ferry service.

Over this tunic she wore a red velvet dolman with very short sleeves. The bonnet which held her white hair was not decorated with ribbons, but with the most beautiful diamonds." ...|$|E

Rabbi Simai thus deduced that just as only two out of 600,000 (Caleb and Joshua) entered the Promised Land, so only two out of every 600,000 Israelites in Egypt participated in the Exodus, and the rest died in Egypt. Rava taught that it will also be so when the Messiah comes that {{only a small portion of}} Jews will find redemption, for [...] says, [...] "And she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> came up out of the land of Egypt," [...] implying that circumstances upon the coming of the Messiah will be similar to those upon the Israelites' entry into the Land of Israel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{disciples of}} Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai {{asked him why}} [...] ordained that after {{childbirth}} a woman had to bring a sacrifice. He replied that when she bore her child, she swore impetuously in the pain of childbirth {{that she would never}} again have intercourse with her husband. The Torah, therefore, ordained that she had to bring a sacrifice, as she would probably violate that oath. Rabbi Berekiah and Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that because she fluttered in her heart, she had to bring a fluttering sacrifice, two turtle-doves or two young pigeons. The disciples asked Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai why [...] permitted contact between the father and mother after 7 days when the mother bore a boy, but [...] permitted contact after 14 <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> bore a girl. He replied that since everyone around the mother would rejoice upon the birth of a boy, she would regret her oath to shun her husband after just 7 days, but since people around her would not rejoice on the birth of a girl, she would take twice as long. And Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai taught that [...] ordained circumcision on the eighth day so that the parents could join their guests in a celebratory mood on that day.|$|E
2500|$|The antagonists Grendel and Grendel's {{mother are}} portrayed by Crispin Glover and Angelina Jolie, respectively. Glover had {{previously}} worked with Zemeckis in Back to the Future, when he portrayed George McFly. Zemeckis had found Glover tiresome on set, {{because of his}} {{lack of understanding of}} shooting a film, but realized this would not be a problem as on a motion capture film he could choose his angles later. Glover's dialogue was entirely in Old English. Jolie had wanted to work with Zemeckis, and had read the poem years before but could not remember it well until she read the script and was able to recall basic themes. The actress recounted her first impression of her character's appearance by saying [...] "...I was told I {{was going to be a}} lizard. Then I was brought into a room with Bob, and a bunch of pictures and examples, and he showed me this picture of a woman half painted gold, and then a lizard.
