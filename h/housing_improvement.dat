25|$|Bridgeton's most {{successful}} times were now behind them, {{and though they}} maintained their league status for the next 20 years, they never challenged for major honours again. In 1960, New Barrowfield was subject to another housing CPO by the city fathers and Waverley were again forced to move, this time to Carntyne Stadium a mile to the north, which was more suited to greyhound racing and speedway. By this point, many of the local Junior clubs were in financial difficulty; distractions of modern living had made attending matches less appealing, and Glasgow's <b>housing</b> <b>improvement</b> programme was in full swing, {{with much of the}} population of the crowded, substandard tenements decanted to new overspill estates on the edge of town – for East End residents this typically meant Easterhouse and Cranhill, although no new Junior teams were established in these vast schemes. Shawfield had folded in 1960, and Bridgeton Waverley followed in 1962. They would not be the last, with Parkhead ceasing operations in 1963, Strathclyde in 1965 and Dennistoun Waverley in 1968. Housing was never built on New Barrowfield as had been planned; it became the training ground for Celtic for the next 40 years and still contains football pitches. Housing now occupies the Carntyne site as well as the Dennistoun ground, the hospital and the Strathclyde ground (which formed part of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games), while the Parkhead site is a public park and the Shawfield F.C. ground was bulldozed for the M74 motorway extension.|$|E
500|$|The Housing Trust {{was a key}} plank in Playford's {{campaign}} to keep costs low and promote investment. By providing cheap housing, workers could also be persuaded to accept lower salaries, therefore keeping production costs down. In 1940, Playford introduced the <b>Housing</b> <b>Improvement</b> Act to parliament, having seen {{the benefits of the}} Housing Trust's activities. The main aims of the legislation were [...] "to improve the adverse housing conditions" [...] by replacing [...] "insanitary, old, crowded, or obsolete dwelling houses" [...] with better-quality buildings—at the time many older residences in the city centre were made of corrugated iron and many areas were slum-like. The law forced landlords to provide a minimum standard of housing and enacted rent controls, setting a maximum rent for various houses; at the time many landlords bought large numbers of low-quality dwellings and charged tenants exorbitant prices. It also expanded the role of the Housing Trust, potentially undercutting the rentier class. Labor were taken aback by Playford's move, as this was the start of a trend whereby the nominally conservative government pursued policies that were more left-wing than other Labor governments across the country. After expressing shock at Playford's [...] "loving kindness to the poor and distressed", Labor helped to get the legislation—which threatened the interests of the landlord class that traditionally supported the LCL—passed into law. During one 15-year period, Housing Trust rents were not increased once despite steady inflation.|$|E
40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} more {{evidence}} linking particular <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> to changes in specific health conditions. Research often looks at generic works over short periods. Methods: We use a longitudinal sample (n[*]=[*] 1933) with a survey interval of 2 – 5 years. Multivariate logistic regression is used to calculate the odds ratios of developing or recovering from six health conditions according to receipt of four types of <b>housing</b> <b>improvements.</b> Results: Receipt of fabric works was associated with higher likelihood of recovery from mental health problems and circulatory conditions. Receipt of central heating was also associated with higher likelihood of recovery form circulatory conditions. No evidence was found for the preventative effects of <b>housing</b> <b>improvements.</b> Conclusions: Health gain from <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> appears most likely when targeted at those in greatest health need. The health impacts of area-wide, non-targeted <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> are less clear in our study...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{long-established}} {{associations between}} housing conditions and health, the evidence linking <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> {{to changes in}} health outcomes is still sparse. Our latest briefing paper, Health Effects of <b>Housing</b> <b>Improvements,</b> reports on changes in {{physical and mental health}} outcomes related to <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> undertaken in social housing Glasgow since 2003 as part of investment agreed as part of the stock transfer to bring stock up to the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS). The objective of the research was to establish whether there were any differences in the change in physical and mental health outcomes over time between those who did or did not receive four different types of <b>housing</b> <b>improvements.</b> The briefing paper looks at the effects of each of four <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> on physical and mental health. It also examines the effects of multiple improvements and of time since the improvements in order to investigate whether the effects change over time. Our findings relating the health <b>improvements</b> following <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> are modest. However, while <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> may not lead manifest improvements in individual health over the short term but improved and maintained housing stock should lead to longer term health improvements at the population level. Although housing providers improve homes with the expectation of health gains they also aim to improve residential satisfaction and quality of life more generally. Our study highlights the central importance of employment to the health of residents in deprived areas, and supports a case for more attention to be paid to employment as part of regeneration, whether through economic, employability or health-improvement measures...|$|R

30|$|What {{might be}} necessary, then, is {{to carry out}} wider slum {{upgrading}} programs that combine <b>housing</b> <b>improvements</b> with broader interventions addressing other major problems affecting slum dwellers.

We use a unique four-round panel dataset on farm households in northern Ethiopia that {{had access to}} microfinance, observed on two key poverty indicators: household consumption and <b>housing</b> <b>improvements.</b> Fixed-effects and random trend models are used to reduce potential selection biases due to time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and individual trends therein. Results show that borrowing indeed causally increased consumption and <b>housing</b> <b>improvements.</b> A flexible specification {{that takes into account}} repeated borrowings also suggests that borrowing has cumulative long-term effects on these outcomes, implying that short-term impact estimates may underestimate credit effects.

Progress has been made in the last decade demonstrated by malaria mortality reductions primarily attributed to current vector control strategies. However, the continuing threat of resistance, both resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides and parasites to antimalarial medicines, requires the development of new and improved strategies to supplement those already in place. <b>Housing</b> <b>improvements</b> such as screening doors and windows, closing eaves, patching cracks in walls, and installing ceilings are one such intervention that help stop contact between malaria vectors and humans, and therefore, help stop malaria transmission.
