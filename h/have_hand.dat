25|$|The pirates {{get most}} of their weapons from Yemen, but a {{significant}} number come from Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. Weapons dealers in the capital receive a deposit from a hawala dealer {{on behalf of the}} pirates and the weapons are then driven to Puntland where the pirates pay the balance. Various photographs of pirates in situ indicate that their weapons are predominantly AK47, Type 56, AKM, RPK, PK, RPG-7, and TT33. Additionally, given the particular origin of their weaponry, they are likely to <b>have</b> <b>hand</b> grenades such as the RGD-5 or F1.|$|E
25|$|Most {{workbenches}} {{are made}} from solid wood; the most expensive and desirable are made of solid hardwood. Benches may also be made from plywood and Masonite or hardboard, and bases of treated pine and even steel. There are trade offs with the choice of construction material. Solid wood has many advantages including strength, workability, appearance. A plywood or hardboard bench top {{has the advantage of}} being stable, relatively inexpensive, and in some ways it's easier to work with - particularly for a woodworker who doesn't yet <b>have</b> <b>hand</b> tools. The practical drawbacks of a plywood or composite bench top are that they don't hold their corners and edges well, and they can't be resurfaced with a plane - something that is needed from time to time.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviets {{stripped}} down their P-40s significantly for combat, {{in many cases}} removing the wing guns altogether in P-40B/C types, for example. Soviet Air Force reports state that they liked the range and fuel capacity of the P-40, which were superior {{to most of the}} Soviet fighters, though they still preferred the P-39. Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov recalled: [...] "The cockpit was vast and high. At first it felt unpleasant to sit waist-high in glass, as the edge of the fuselage was almost at waist level. But the bullet-proof glass and armored seat were strong and visibility was good. The radio was also good. It was powerful, reliable, but only on HF (high frequency). The American radios did not <b>have</b> <b>hand</b> microphones but throat microphones. These were good throat mikes: small, light and comfortable." [...] The biggest complaint of some Soviet airmen was its poor climb rate and problems with maintenance, especially with burning out the engines. [...] VVS pilots usually flew the P-40 at War Emergency Power settings while in combat, bringing the acceleration and speed performance closer to that of their German rivals, but could burn out engines in a matter of weeks. They also had difficulty with the more demanding requirements for fuel quality and oil purity of the Allison engines. A fair number of burnt out P-40s were re-engined with Soviet Klimov engines but these performed relatively poorly and were relegated to rear area use.|$|E

These, however, had been surprised and taken without the slightest noise; as, on finding a lantern on one side of their heads and a pistol on the other, each had submitted without the slightest resistance. All these had been sent down to the hold below, and a guard placed over them. The guns were loaded and the whole of the officers divided among them in readiness to run them forward. Four or five minutes passed, then a shout was heard forward and a low rush of many feet.|$|E

5000|$|Pairs {{of dancers}} form a circle, with dance moves {{called out by}} one person, a caller (or [...] "l√≠der" [...] or [...] "cantante" [...] in Spanish). Many moves <b>have</b> <b>hand</b> signs to {{complement}} the calls; these are useful in noisy venues, where spoken calls might not be easily heard. Most moves involve the swapping of partners, where the partners move around the circle to the next partner.

50|$|In 1995, Meier and Willerman {{defined the}} three primary manual {{gestures}} as pointing, reaching, and waving, so anything beyond those three could {{be categorized as}} manual babbles. Common babbles by this definition include arm waves, body pats, and claps. Common communicative gestures, which are different from babbles because they carry meaning, include reaches, points, conventional waves, and rituals (like patty cake). Identification of manual babbling references American Sign Language phonology. This means that the babbles <b>have</b> <b>hand</b> shapes, a general place of articulation, movement, and palm orientation.|$|E

50|$|Many water {{balls are}} {{constructed}} from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 0.8-1.0 mm thick. Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) {{are the best}} choice for use in cold weather or on snow. Some water balls are made from a PVC-TPU mix. More expensive balls use 100% TPU. Balls are typically made in China, and come in various sizes. A typical water ball stores flat and weighs 15 kilograms, and can be inflated in under a minute with a good air pump. Some models also <b>have</b> <b>hand</b> grips on the inside or outside, and the surface can be printed on.|$|E

50|$|First {{compare the}} hand types. If one <b>hand</b> <b>has</b> a better <b>hand</b> type than the other, that hand wins. The amount won is the winning hand's deng times the {{original}} bet.

If one <b>hand</b> <b>has</b> a greater taem than the other, that hand wins. The amount won is the winning hand's deng. If both <b>hands</b> <b>have</b> the same <b>hand</b> type and taem, the deng is compared. If one <b>hand</b> <b>has</b> a greater deng than the other, that hand wins the payout of the difference of the hands' deng. If both <b>hands</b> <b>have</b> the same <b>hand</b> type, taem, and deng, they tie and the original bet is returned to the player.|$|R

5000|$|... van Buchem {{disease is}} also an {{autosomal}} recessive skeletal disease characterized by bone overgrowth. It was first described in 1955 as [...] "hyperostosis corticalis generalisata familiaris", but was given the current name in 1968. Excessive bone formation is most prominent in the skull, mandible, clavicle, ribs and diaphyses of long bones and bone formation occurs throughout life. It is a very rare condition with about 30 known cases in 2002. In 1967 van Buchem characterized the disease in 15 patients of Dutch origin. Patients with sclerosteosis are distinguished from those with van Buchem disease because they are often taller and <b>have</b> <b>hand</b> malformations.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the term}} [...] "chopper" [...] is {{generally}} {{used to describe}} a motorcycle or bicycle that has had some of its original parts replaced with custom parts, today's definition has grown to include custom motorcycles and bicycles that are low to the ground, usually with extended forks creating a long front end. Even as commercial interests are taking note of the popularity of choppers and expanding their lines, most riders of choppers <b>have</b> <b>hand</b> built choppers and encourage others to make their own.
