5|$|Freemasonry {{and women}} have a complex relationship, which can be readily divided into many phases with no {{demonstrable}} relationship to each other until the 20th century. A <b>few</b> <b>women</b> were involved in Freemasonry before the 18th century; however the first printed constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of England appeared to bar them from the Craft forever.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York to Russian Jewish immigrants. When Ginsburg was a toddler, her older sister died, and shortly before she {{graduated}} high school, her mother died. Ginsburg was {{a wife and mother}} before starting law school at Harvard, where {{she was one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>women</b> in her law school class. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School where she graduated tied for first in her class.|$|E
5|$|In {{a country}} in which <b>few</b> <b>women</b> may take out loans from large {{commercial}} banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women. While a World Bank study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.|$|E
50|$|Mercuriade (14th-century) was an Italian physician, {{surgeon and}} medical author. She {{is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>woman</b> {{physicians}} known from the Middle Ages.|$|R
50|$|Unpaid {{work also}} affects the labor {{supply of the}} economy because <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> are {{entering}} into the workforce due to their domestic unpaid work duties.|$|R
50|$|Rebecca de Guarna (fl. 1200), was an Italian {{physician}} and surgeon and author. She {{is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>woman</b> physicians known from the Middle Ages.|$|R
5|$|Lady Saigō bore four children: {{she had a}} son and a {{daughter}} (Saigō Katsutada and Tokuhime) while married, and she later bore two sons as the consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu: Tokugawa Hidetada and Matsudaira Tadayoshi. Among the descendants of Lady Saigō was the Empress Meishō (1624–1696), one of very <b>few</b> <b>women</b> to accede to the Chrysanthemum Throne as empress regnant.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras can rub and pinch the breast, causing skin {{irritation}} and breast pain, and the wire of a worn bra can protrude from the fabric and scrape or cut the skin. When {{the fabric of}} worn bra exposes an underwire, skin contact with nickel and other metals may cause contact dermatitis in a <b>few</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the music}} {{industry}} has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are {{much less likely to}} have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very <b>few</b> <b>women</b> behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.|$|E
30|$|We {{hypothesize that}} if the entry point of Wikipedia {{functions}} as a glass ceiling, <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> {{will be included in}} Wikipedia, but those women will be more notable than their male counterparts on average. Especially if we compare the number of male and female ‘local heroes’ (people with low levels of notability, without worldwide fame), we expect to see a larger gender gap (i.e., <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> than men) than for worldwide ‘superstars,’ because fewer female ‘local heroes’ {{will be able to make}} it into Wikipedia.|$|R
50|$|Guadagno {{supports}} a pro-choice position on abortion, but {{would like to}} see <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> choose the option. Christie expressed a pro-life stance on abortion during the primary campaign.|$|R
50|$|The program lasted {{seven years}} in Oregon, with <b>fewer</b> and <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> {{requesting}} help each year, both because women’s education was increasing and because more women were already in the workforce.|$|R
5|$|At the International Penal and Prison Congress in 1872 Carpenter read a {{paper on}} The Principles and Results of the English Reformatory and Certified Industrial Schools. She read forty papers at {{conferences}} of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science between the years of 1857 and 1746, gave many public lectures and was {{known as one of}} the most prominent speakers on social reform in an era when <b>few</b> <b>women</b> ever addressed public meetings.|$|E
5|$|First {{to arrive}} was Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton {{and his wife}} Peggy, who reached Los Alamos on 13 December 1943. At Los Alamos Frisch {{continued}} his work on critical mass studies, for which Titterton developed electronic circuitry for high voltage generators, X-ray generators, timers and firing circuits. Peggy Titterton, a trained physics and metallurgy laboratory assistant, {{was one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>women</b> working at Los Alamos in a technical role. Chadwick arrived on 12 January 1944, but only stayed for a few months before returning to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|One {{chronology}} {{assumes that}} the Aitareya, Taittiriya, Kausitaki, Mundaka, Prasna, and Katha Upanishads has Buddha's influence, and is consequently placed after the 5th century BCE, while another proposal questions this assumption and dates it independent of Buddha's date of birth. After these Principal Upanishads are typically placed the Kena, Mandukya and Isa Upanishads, but other scholars date these differently. Not much {{is known about the}} authors except for those, like Yajnavalkayva and Uddalaka, mentioned in the texts. A <b>few</b> <b>women</b> discussants, such as Gargi and Maitreyi, the wife of Yajnavalkayva, also feature occasionally.|$|E
30|$|The ‘leaky pipeline’ {{phenomenon}} {{means that}} <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> {{enter into the}} e-business fields, {{limiting the number of}} women entrepreneurs in research and development, and at senior positions in the ICT arena (Martinez and Reilly 2002).|$|R
50|$|Women do not access health {{insurance}} {{at the rate}} of men because women {{are less likely to be}} employed than men, there are <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> in the workforce than men, and women are more likely to work part-time than men.|$|R
5000|$|J & S Records was a New York {{record label}} started in 1956 and {{continued}} {{through to the}} early 1970s. The owner was Zelma [...] "Zell" [...] Sanders (1922-1976), one of the <b>few</b> <b>woman</b> label owners in the record business.|$|R
5|$|After her defeat, Dallas {{worked in}} private {{business}} {{after her husband}} suffered several strokes {{and was forced to}} retire. Initially, she worked as an associate editor at the Philadelphia Daily News. In 1959, she was hired as an investment banker at Dehaven & Townsend, Crouter & Bodine. As in politics, she was one of a <b>few</b> <b>women</b> working in a male-dominated profession. When her husband died, Dallas moved out of their Chestnut Hill home to a retirement community in Delaware County, but continued working until the age of 76. She also remained active on several charitable boards including serving as a commissioner of Valley Forge State Park (now Valley Forge National Historical Park) and in the nonpartisan watchdog group, the Committee of Seventy. She died on January 13, 1983, and was buried alongside her husband in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. <b>Few</b> <b>women</b> participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|Born in Mayesville, South Carolina, {{to parents}} who had been slaves, she started working in fields with her family at age five. She took an early {{interest}} in becoming educated; {{with the help of}} benefactors, Bethune attended college hoping to become a missionary in Africa. She started a school for African-American girls in Daytona Beach, Florida. It later merged with a private institute for African-American boys, and was known as the Bethune-Cookman School. Bethune maintained high standards and promoted the school with tourists and donors, to demonstrate what educated African Americans could do. She was president of the college from 1923 to 1942, and 1946 to 1947. She was one of the <b>few</b> <b>women</b> in the world to serve as a college president at that time.|$|E
5000|$|Another aspect that {{contributes}} to the phenomenon is the aging population of Japan. For {{the first time since the}} 19th century, Japan has been experiencing a population decline during peacetime. [...] While there are still many available women of marrying and childbearing age now, the trend of aging in Japanese society will become self-sustaining at some point. Since 1995, Japan has experienced a decrease in the production population, those who are aged 15 to 64. [...] There will simply be <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> to fill these roles. And, as a result of <b>fewer</b> <b>women,</b> there will be fewer children. Marriage rates for women aged 25 to 29 dropped from 82% to 52% from 1970 to 1995.|$|R
50|$|Nina Albright (February 15, 1907 - February 7, 1997), born Nina Dorothy Abrecht, was an American {{comic book}} artist {{for nine years}} during the Golden Age of Comic Books. She was one of <b>few</b> <b>woman</b> {{illustrating}} and writing comic books during the period.|$|R
50|$|An Banshenchas {{is framed}} in a {{historical}} context and starts with Eve and other biblical women, moves to the legendary women of Irish mythology such as Étaín and Emer, then completes with later-day characters who are almost certainly historical, including a <b>few</b> <b>woman</b> of the Hiberno-Norse aristocracy.|$|R
5|$|Following law school, Ginsburg {{turned to}} academia. She was a {{professor}} at Rutgers School of Law–Newark and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure {{as one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>women</b> in her field. Ginsburg spent a considerable part of her legal career as an advocate for the advancement of gender equality and women's rights, winning multiple victories arguing before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsels in the 1970s. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit where she served until her elevation to the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, but women {{were considered to be}} better at running them. A <b>few</b> <b>women</b> worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL has an {{authorised}} {{strength of}} 1,500 regular personnel and 1,500 reservists. It has never reached these totals as funding shortfalls {{have prevented the}} reserve component from being formed and the Army's two regular battalions have remained under-strength. While all the F-FDTL's personnel were initially FALINTIL veterans the force's composition has changed over time and few soldiers from the insurgency remain due to the force's narrow age requirement. After the F-FDTL's 1st Battalion was established in 2001 recruitment was opened to all East Timorese above the age of 18, including women. <b>Few</b> <b>women</b> have joined the F-FDTL, however, and as at February 2010 only seven percent of new recruits were female.|$|E
5000|$|The Egyptian team {{included}} 46 sportspeople, 10 {{women and}} 36 men. This was 2 <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> than {{the country had}} sent to Sydney for the 2000 Games. [...] Three members of the delegation, including two athletes, participated in a study about dental health during the Games.|$|R
50|$|Alexander {{is one of}} the <b>few</b> <b>woman</b> {{recognized}} by the British Sumo Federation and has won four gold medals in international competitions. In 2006 Alexander competed in 25 different competitions and went to Japan to represent Great Britain in the World Sumo Championship. Since then, she has competed in international tournaments.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of modernization, women’s {{employment}} patterns have changed dramatically.

5|$|The parishes {{were grouped}} into deaneries called Varados. Every parish {{was divided into}} wards, while Parish Councils were present in most parishes. About 15 percent of the {{households}} in the parishes were literate. A widow had to remain indoors, practically {{for the rest of}} her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death of their husbands, the high-caste Christians too considered the remarriage of a widow as something unnatural. Canon law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. <b>Few</b> <b>women</b> had the courage to go against the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was attached to her husband. Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 25/26 June, SAO Krajina forces {{took control of the}} police station in Dvor and {{attacked}} the police station in Glina. The rebels managed to capture the police station in Glina for less than an hour before they were pushed back by the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit and police reinforcements deployed from Sisak. Croatian police casualties amounted to one killed and six wounded. Even though the attack in Glina did not leave SAO Krajina in control of the police station in Glina, 16 Croatian policemen were captured and held hostage. The prisoners were taken to the Knin camp and a detention facility in Golubić. In response to the fighting, the JNA deployed its troops to the two towns. New fighting erupted the same day near Hrvatska Kostajnica. In the final days of June, many Serb civilians, especially from Dvor, fled to the area of Bosanski Novi for safety. By 28 June, only a <b>few</b> <b>women,</b> children and the elderly remained in Glina. The town's shops were closed and its streets were patrolled by JNA armoured vehicles. After the fighting, the JNA positioned its troops around the police station, while the Croatian Serb rebels controlled the rest of the town.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{reported}} that a <b>few</b> <b>women</b> from western countries practising the Theravada tradition and a <b>few</b> <b>women</b> from Thailand have been ordained to bhikkuni order in Sri Lanka in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there are}} <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> than men in both {{junior and senior}} {{positions}} employed by Kleiner Perkins, its gender gap is smaller than that of most other venture capital firms and its most prominent female partner, Mary Meeker, has called it [...] "the best place to be for {{a woman in the}} business." ...|$|R
60|$|On a wide cobbled {{space on}} the sea front they found a guard of red-coated militia drawn up to receive them, and a crowd--attracted by their arrival--which in dress and manner {{differed}} little from a crowd in a seaport at home save that it contained <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> and {{a great number of}} negroes.|$|R
25|$|Margaret Rossiter, an American {{historian}} of science, offered three concepts {{to explain the}} reasons behind the data in statistics and how these reasons disadvantaged women in the science industry. The first concept is hierarchical segregation. This is a well-known phenomenon in society, that the higher the level and rank of power and prestige, the smaller the population of females participating. The hierarchical differences {{point out that there}} are <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> participating at higher levels of both academia and industry. Based on data collected in 1982, women earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States, with 50 percent of these in science. The source also indicated that this number increased almost every year. There are <b>fewer</b> <b>women</b> at the graduate level; they earn 40 percent of all doctorates, with 31 percent of these in science and engineering.|$|R
