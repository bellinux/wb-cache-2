It is also easier to steer the tractor and driving with the front wheel against the <b>furrow</b> <b>wall</b> will keep the front furrow at the correct width. This is less satisfactory when using a tractor with very wide front tyres, for although they make better use of the tractor power, the tyres may compact part of the last furrow slice turned on the previous run. The use of furrow widener or a longer mouldboard on the rear body will overcome the problem. The latter moves the soil further towards the ploughed land leaving more room for the tractor wheels on the next run.|$|E

It also helps in stabilizing the plough while it is in operations. The rear bottom end of the landslide, which rubs against the furrow sole, is known as heel [...] A heel iron is bolted {{to the end of}} the rear of the landside and helps to carry the back of the plough. The landside and share are arranged to give a ‘'lead” towards the unploughed land, thus helping to maintain the correct furrow width. The landside is usually made of solid medium carbon steel, and is very short except on the rear bottom of the plow. The heel or rear end of the rear landside may be subject to excessive wear if the rear wheel is out of adjustment, therefore, a chilled iron heel piece is frequently used. This heel is inexpensive and can be easily replaced. The land side is fastened to the frog with the help of plough bolts.|$|E

50|$|Geotrichum candidum {{is thought}} to be {{homothallic}} but most isolates are self-sterile. Sexual reproduction was first observed in strains isolated from soils in Puerto Rico. The fungus produces globose asci that contain a single, thick walled, uninucleated, globose to oval ascospore measuring 6-7 μm by 7-10 μm. The ascospores have a smooth inner <b>wall</b> and a <b>furrowed</b> outer <b>wall.</b> The septa are perforated by microspores, arranged in a ring structure. The colonies appear to be growing faster in the sexual stage than the asexual stage. Colonies grow at a rate of 5-7 mm daily at 24 C.|$|R
40|$|A large {{increase}} in surface area must accompany {{formation of the}} amphibian embryo first cleavage furrow. The additional membrane for this areal expansion has been thought to be provided entirely from cytoplasmic stores during furrowing. We have radioiodinated surface proteins of fertilized, precleavage Xenopus laevis embryos and followed their redistribution during first cleavage by autoradiography. Near the end of first cleavage, membrane of the outer, pigmented surface of the embryo and a short band of membrane {{at the leading edge}} of the furrow displayed a high silver grain density, but the remainder of the furrow membrane was lightly labeled. The membrane of the cleavage furrow is thus mosaic in character; the membrane at the leading edge originates in part from the surface of the zygote, but most of the membrane lining the <b>furrow</b> <b>walls</b> is derived from a source inaccessible to surface radioiodination. The furrow membrane adjacent to the outer, pigmented surface consistently showed a very low silver grain density and was underlain by large membranous vesicles, suggesting that new membrane derived from cytoplasmic precursors is inserted primarily in this location, at least during the later phase of cleavage. Radioiodinated membrane proteins and surface-attached carbon particles, which lie in the path of the future furrow, contract toward the animal pole in the initial stages of cleavage while markers in other regions do not. We suggest that the domain of heavily labeled membrane at {{the leading edge of the}} definitive furrow contains the labeled elements that are gathered at the animal pole during the initial surface contraction and that they include membrane anchors for the underlying contractile ring of microfilaments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The main {{parameters}} of the plough body that determine the ploughing efficiency are the initial and the final soil slice lifting angles on the share-mouldboard surface, the angle of its horizontal generatrix, the radius of this surface and the working width of the body. Studies {{have been carried out}} to determine the share-mouldboard {{parameters of}} some contemporary plough bodies: the cultural (digger), semi-helicoidal and helicoidal types. For this purpose profilograms of its share-mouldboard surfaces are made and the values of the investigated parameters measured. The energetic, agronomic and economic characteristics of ploughs were estimated by their testing. As the result of investigations, it was discovered that the optimal values of the main {{parameters of the}} bottoms for contemporary ploughs are: the inclination angle of the share towards the furrow bottom – 28 … 32 ˚; the inclination angle of the horizontal generatrix towards the <b>furrow</b> <b>wall</b> on the initial part of the share-mouldboard surface – 34 … 38 ˚, on the top- not less than 48 ˚; the working width of the bottom – 45 … 50 cm. The conducted investigations show that only those ploughs generally meet the requirements mentioned above which have bodies with gently sloping semi-helicoidal or helicoidal share-mouldboard surfaces, such as the Kverneland plough body No. 8. The use of bodies having optimal parameters allows attaining good ploughing quality, reducing the draft resistance by 12 … 20 % and raising correspondingly the efficiency, saving fuel and financial resources for ploughing. Key words: plough body parameters, initial lifting angle, final lifting angle, angle of horizontal generatrix, optimal parameters...|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Vatica bella. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a linear gallery {{occurring}} on the upper surface of the leaves. It broadens into a blotch along {{the margin of the}} leaves. In mature condition, the blotchy part is contracted upward to make a narrow fold. The cocoon, made in a <b>furrow</b> on the <b>wall</b> of the case, is boat-shaped, ochre-whitish, and usually provided with four minute bubbles on the surface.|$|R
40|$|Grooved and hilly terrains are {{reported}} which {{occur at the}} antipode of major basins on the Moon (Imbrium, Orientale) and Mercury (Caloris). Order-of-magnitude calculations, for an Imbrium-size impact on the Moon, indicate P-wave-induced surface displacements of 10 m at the basin antipode that would arrive prior to secondary ejecta. Comparable surface waves {{are reported}} which would arrive subsequent to secondary ejecta impacts and would increase in magnitude as they converge at the antipode. Other seismically induced surface features include: subdued, <b>furrowed</b> crater <b>walls</b> produced by landslides and concomitant secondary impacts; emplacement and leveling of light plains units owing to seismically induced "fluidization" of slide material; knobby, pitted terrain around old basins from enhancement of seismic waves in ancient ejecta blankets; and the production and enhancement of deep-seated fractures {{that led to the}} concentration of farside lunar maria in the Apollo-Ingenii region...|$|R
6000|$|At a {{distance}} these glaciers, as I have said before, look like frozen rivers; when one approaches nearer, {{or where they}} press downward into the valley, like this Glacier de Boisson, they look like immense crystals and pillars of ice piled together in every conceivable form. The effect of this pile of ice, lying directly {{in the lap of}} green grass and flowers, is quite singular. The village of Chamouni itself has nothing in particular to recommend it. The buildings and every thing about it have a rough, coarse appearance. Before we had entered the valley this evening the sun had gone down; the sky behind the mountains was clear, and it seemed for a few moments as if darkness was rapidly coming on. On our right hand were black, jagged, <b>furrowed</b> <b>walls</b> of mountain, and on our left Mont Blanc, with his fields of glaciers and worlds of snow; they seemed to hem us in, and almost press us down. But in a few moments commenced a scene of transfiguration, more glorious than any thing I had witnessed yet. The cold, white, dismal fields of ice gradually changed into hues of the most beautiful rose color. A bank of white clouds, which rested above the mountains, kindled and glowed, as if some spirit of light had entered into them. You did not lose your idea of the dazzling, spiritual whiteness of the snow, yet you seemed to see it through a rosy veil. The sharp edges of the glaciers, and the hollows between the peaks, reflected wavering tints of lilac and purple. The effect was solemn and spiritual above every thing I have ever seen. These words, which had been often in my mind through the day, and which occurred to me more often than any others while I was travelling through the Alps, came into my mind with a pomp and magnificence of meaning unknown before--"For by Him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things are by him and for him; and he is before all things, and by him all things subsist." ...|$|R
