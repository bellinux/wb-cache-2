25|$|In 1999, China set an {{objective}} of “zero growth” in coastal marine capture catch, and in 2001 changed the objective to “minus growth". To achieve this, China has been reducing vessel numbers and relocating fishermen away from marine capture fisheries. By {{the end of}} 2004, 8,000 vessels were scrapped and 40,000 fishermen were relocated. In 2006, China issued the Programme of Action on Conservation of Living Aquatic Resources of China. This provides that, by 2010, deterioration of the aquatic environment, declines in <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> and increases in endangered species will be arrested, over-capacity will be reduced, and efficiencies will be increased.|$|E

40|$|Bali Strait has {{potential}} abundance of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> such as Indonesian oil sardine (lemuru), frigate mackerel (tongkol), scad mackerel (layang), short-bodied mackerel (kembung) and others {{which can be}} caught mostly using purse seine. <b>Fishery</b> <b>resources</b> are combined and also known asmultispecies; therefore this research aimed to analyze the model of bio-economic multispecies exploitation of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in Bali Strait. The analytical methods that used in this research were estimated dynamic model of Walters and Hilborn (1976) and analysis of bio-economic model. The results showed that actual production of exploitation of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in Bali Strait, was lower than the rate of sustainable production especially Indonesian oil sardine and short-bodied mackerel. Production and fishing effort were below the actual optimal value. The management of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in Bali Strait did not show a good level of economic efficiency. Thus the exploitation of pelagic <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> in Bali Strait using purse seine could still be increased...|$|R

On 1 October 1931, Komahashi was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District, and was refitted at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in early 1932 with more powerful diesel engines and survey ship facilities, a process that lasted until November 1932. Upon re-launching, she surveyed around the Luzon Strait, the South Pacific Mandate, the Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula, collecting data on ocean currents, salinity, subsea topography and <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources.</b> One of her discoveries was the Komahashi Seamount, an underwater volcano at the northern end of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge in the Philippine Sea.|$|E

40|$|Past rivalry over {{access to}} water has usually been between the farmers who irrigate and new agricultural, industrial, and {{municipal}} demands. Recently, the recreational demand for water has become another consideration in water allocation decisions. We examine {{the significance of the}} recreational demand for water as a <b>fishery</b> <b>resource</b> by applying two different frameworks to the decision to fish. The consistency of the estimated responses to changes in <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> across both decision frameworks testifies to the importance of streams as a recreational <b>fishery</b> <b>resource.</b> Modeling behavior within the household production framework allows all downstream effects to be estimated, not just impacts at particular sites. Marginal values of water as a recreational <b>fishery</b> <b>resource</b> are estimated based on day values of fishing derived in prior research...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the impact of the advance of property rights in fisheries upon the management of internationally shared <b>fishery</b> <b>resources.</b> The management of these shared <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> did, in fact, come to prominence because of a revolutionary advance in state property rights to <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> through the advent of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regime. The revolution in state property rights to <b>fishery</b> <b>resources</b> is not yet complete, however. The incompleteness of the revolution, it is argued, creates serious difficulties for the effective management for an important class of shared <b>fishery</b> <b>resources,</b> namely straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. The paper then discusses the impact, actual and potential, of the development of private property rights in fisheries upon the management of these resources. The discussion is speculative, however, and can be no more than that until there has been further advances in the game theoretic analysis of shared fish stock management.

2500|$|The federal {{government}} is constitutionally mandated for conservation and protection of <b>fisheries</b> <b>resources</b> in all Canadian fisheries waters. However, the department is largely focused on the conservation and allotment of harvests of salt water fisheries on the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts of Canada. [...] The department works toward conservation and protection of inland freshwater fisheries, such as on the Great Lakes and Lake Winnipeg through cooperative agreements with various provinces. Provincial governments have enacted provincial fisheries legislation, for the licensing of their fisheries. With the exception of Saskatchewan, conservation rules for freshwater fisheries are enacted under the Fisheries Act; six provinces administer these regulations in their own fisheries.|$|E
