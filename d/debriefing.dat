40|$|Adventure-based {{learning}} (ABL) has {{the potential}} to help teachers promote prosocial learning environments (Stuhr 2 ̆ 6 Baringer, 2005; Stuhr, Sutherland, 2 ̆ 6 Ressler, 2012). Within ABL, a student-centered <b>debrief</b> is essential in helping students make sense of intra- and interpersonal relationships (Sutherland, Ressler, 2 ̆ 6 Stuhr, 2012; Stuhr et al., 2012). This study was conducted to determine further insight into the use of the Sunday Afternoon Drive <b>debrief</b> model (Sutherland, 2011) that was created for facilitators to maximize the effectiveness of the student-driven <b>debrief.</b> Findings indicated that using the Sunday Afternoon Drive <b>debrief</b> model increased student-centered facilitation. Recommendations for teacher educators include how to best help novice facilitators successfully implement the Sunday Afternoon Drive <b>debrief</b> model by providing: examples of meaningful and complete <b>debrief</b> sessions; opportunities to lead the <b>debrief</b> process; and critique sessions to point out to teacher candidates what did and did not work well during the <b>debrief...</b>|$|R

30|$|A third {{member of}} the team {{conducted}} the <b>debrief</b> of the VBD. She began by asking the facilitators what they wanted the teachers to notice in the video and what types of questions they had prepared to address that goal. A fourth member charted the co-facilitators’ responses to the <b>debrief</b> questions. After the <b>debrief,</b> she turned the TLs’ attention to the chart and asked: “What insights did you gain about planning and conducting VBDs by listening to the two co-facilitators debrief?” This combination of the <b>debrief</b> and discussion of the charted responses was quite detailed, {{in order to make the}} planning that goes into a high-quality VBD explicit for the TLs.|$|R
5|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} in the series, he oversees FBI agent Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) briefing and <b>debriefing,</b> and later disposes of evidence Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully had brought back from their investigation of an alien abduction. With the Smoking Man hiding truth from the public, Mulder seeks to reveal {{it to the public}} and the truth about the disappearance of his sister, Samantha.

5|$|A {{year after}} James Bond's final {{confrontation}} with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, {{while on a}} mission in Japan, a man claiming to be Bond appears in London and demands to meet {{the head of the}} Secret Service, M. Bond's identity is confirmed, but during his <b>debriefing</b> interview with M, Bond tries to kill him with a cyanide pistol; the attempt fails. The Service learns that after destroying Blofeld's castle in Japan, Bond suffered a head injury and developed amnesia. Having lived as a Japanese fisherman for several months, Bond travelled into the Soviet Union to learn his true identity. While there, he was brainwashed and assigned to kill M upon returning to England.|$|E
5|$|Brand and Bond are imprisoned {{where the}} blast from the Moonraker's engines will incinerate them, to leave {{no trace of}} them once the Moonraker is launched. Before the firing, the couple escape. Brand gives Bond the proper {{coordinates}} to redirect the gyros and send the Moonraker into the sea. Having been in collaboration with Soviet Intelligence all along, Drax and his henchman attempt to escape by Russian submarine—only to be killed as the vessel flees through the waters onto which the Moonraker has been re-targeted. After their <b>debriefing</b> at headquarters, Bond meets up with Brand, expecting her company—but they part ways after she reveals that she is engaged to a fellow Special Branch officer.|$|E

5|$|Relational or <b>Debriefing</b> (Polish: relacyjne) sejmiks {{heard the}} reports of deputies {{returned}} from the General Sejm, usually presenting the law (konstytucje sejmowe) decreed by the Sejm. They passed specific instructions {{with regards to the}} execution of sejm decrees, and other local resolutions. Such sejmiks could also receive special requests from the king; this happened if the sejmik deputy was bound by instructions not to vote on certain issues that subsequently were voted on and passed in the national sejm. In such cases the king would request the sejmik to reconsider their decision and support the national legislation. These sejmiks arose in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|The sejm {{comprised}} two chambers, {{with varying}} numbers of deputies. After the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Kingdom of Poland {{was transformed into}} the federation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the numbers of sejm participants were significantly increased with {{the inclusion of the}} deputies from Lithuanian sejmiks. The deputies had no set term of office, although in practice it was about four months long, from their election at a regional sejmik, to their report on the next sejmik dedicated to hearing and discussing the previous sejm's proceedings (those sejmiks were known as relational or <b>debriefing).</b> Deputies had parliamentary immunity and any crimes against them were classified as lèse-majesté.|$|E

The West Side Boys had originally decided to release the married men, but changed their minds at the last minute and released the three rangers and two of the corporals. The West Side Boys told the British negotiators that the officers and other NCOs would not be released until the gang's remaining demands were met. The released soldiers were flown for <b>debriefing</b> to RFA Sir Percivale, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, off the coast.|$|E

5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after <b>debriefing</b> his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is {{actually}} Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on her voice and appearance. Agent 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May and turns on her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E
5|$|During series two, the Torchwood website, www.torchwood.org.uk also hosted an {{interactive}} online game written by series writer Phil Ford. Updated weekly with the airing {{of the new}} episodes, the website features specially shot footage with Gareth David-Lloyd in character as Ianto <b>debriefing</b> and informing the 'player' with regards to their mission. Throughout both series one and two, the interactive websites co-written by James Goss featured electronic literature content (such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters) which depict aspects of Ianto and the other Torchwood characters' work and personal lives. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature in hardback form, along with new original material, some of which expands on what we know of Ianto. For example, it introduces his sister, Rhiannon and brother-in-law Johnny; Rhiannon and Johnny later appear in 2009's third televised series.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro bid to {{host the}} 1936, 2004 and the 2012 Games, but failed on every occasion; missing the {{shortlist}} in the two latest attempts, while the bidding process for 1936 did not follow the current standards. For {{the first time in}} the Candidature phase, the official bid flag was raised during a ceremony held at the Palácio da Cidade (English: City's Palace) on June 23, 2008, celebrating the Olympic Day. On July 3, 2008, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid a fee of USD 500,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Procedure, reconfirming its acceptance of the rules. Then, Rio officials participated in the Olympic Games Observers Program from August 8 to 24, during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China; and attended the IOC Official <b>Debriefing</b> of the Beijing Games from November 24 to 27, in London, United Kingdom. On February 11, 2009, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee delivered its Candidature File to the IOC in Lausanne and, eight days later, to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) in Bonn, Germany; containing the responses to the 2016 Candidature Procedure and Questionnaire, as well as guarantees and undertakings. The Candidature File had three volumes containing 568 pages of detailed answers to 300 technical questions, divided into 17 themes. Finally, on June 17, 2009, the IOC organized the 2016 Candidate Cities Briefing to 93 of its members at the Olympic Museum, being the first such meeting in its history and the most important before the election. Rio officials came out stronger after a presentation of 45 minutes, considered to be exceptional, followed by a session of 16 questions.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{incident}} <b>debriefing</b> {{has been}} criticized by many for its effectiveness on reducing harm in crisis situations.

40|$|Computer {{generated}} battlefield agents {{need to be}} able {{to explain}} the rationales for their actions. Such explanations make it easier to validate agent behavior, and can enhance the effectiveness of the agents as training devices. This paper describes an explanation capability called <b>Debrief</b> that enables agents implemented in Soar to describe and justify their decisions. <b>Debrief</b> determines the motivation for decisions by recalling the context in which decisions were made, and determining what factors were critical to those decisions. In the process <b>Debrief</b> learns to recognize similar situations where the same decision would be made for the same reasons. <b>Debrief</b> currently being used by the TacAir-Soar tactical air agent to explain its actions, and is being evaluated for incorporation into other reactive planning agents. 1 Introduction The Soar-IFOR project [15] is developing intelligent agents that can control tactical aircraft in distributed battlefield simulations.
