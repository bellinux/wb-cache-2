25|$|<b>Drag-line</b> {{excavation}} {{systems are}} heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types {{are used for}} road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.|$|E
60|$|Captain Vane was {{fastening}} the <b>drag-line</b> to {{the fore}} part of the light sledge, and refused, at first, {{to listen to the}} boy's entreaties, fearing that some accident might befall him.|$|E
5000|$|The square, granite base {{measures}} 35+7/8 x 35+1/2 x 36 in. Its front-facing {{side has}} a bronze, bas-relief plaque depicting a <b>drag-line</b> mining crane {{at work in}} a strip mine. A cement foundation, 4 to 6 in thick, supports the base.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{started as}} iron founders in 1794 and {{expanded}} in Victorian times to include coal and iron mining. They diversified into equipment manufacture and in 1947 the company started producing the American brands of Koehring excavators under the Newton Chambers Koehring, name, NCK [...] and in 1958 they took over Ransomes & Rapier building excavators, <b>drag-lines,</b> port cranes and other construction equipment under the NCK - Rapier brand [...] With {{the decline in}} coal and the improvements in hydraulic machines, the company diversified into light fabrication. The company was taken over in 1972 by the holding company Central and Sheerwood. NCK later was sold to Robert Maxwells media group {{as part of a}} wider deal, but Maxwell was not interested in cranes and NCK became inactive. Cliffe Holdings then bought the company, later Staffordshire Public Works bought the company in 1997 after it fell again into receivership. NCK launched a new model, the 90T HC90 Astra crane in 2000 but it was not successful, 3 units were manufactured and are owned by Delden CSE Ltd as part of their hire fleet. The only other UK crawler crane business Ruston-Bucyrus, RB also stopped manufacture in 2009. The last crawler crane supplied by NCK was a Nova in 2001. SPW now runs and active spares and overhaul business for its cranes [...] and fabricates NCK plant to order as well as manufacturing traffic control and filtration equipment.|$|R
50|$|Bishrampur is a {{town and}} a nagar panchayat. It is 12 km south east from the {{district}} headquarters Surajpur. National Highway 78 passes through Bishrampur. Asia's largest <b>drag-line</b> machines for coal excavation are located in Bishrampur; they are named Shiv and Shakti. They were imported from United States of America in 1962.|$|E
50|$|The {{company that}} would provide key {{intellectual}} property for what would become Osgood Shovel was established by William Carmichael, nephew of William Otis, {{the inventor of the}} steam shovel. Despite having introduced the first <b>drag-line,</b> Carmichael's Albany, New York based company folded in 1899. The assets of Charmichael's failed enterprise remained unused until Cheney and his financial backers acquired the rights to them and moved the machinery to Marion Ohio.|$|E
50|$|Dredging {{companies}} {{moved into}} Confederate Gulch {{in a big}} way in the 1930s, using power shovels {{and a variety of other}} equipment, including a stationary washing plant, dry-land dredge, and <b>drag-line</b> dredge. The best returns came in 1939 when two dredging operations recovered 2,357 fine ounces of gold. One company had 16 to 18 men on the payroll that season. A single dry-land dredge worked the ground in 1942, after which operations shut down for the duration of World War II.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 June 1827, {{after the}} tunnel flooded, Isambard Kingdom Brunel forbade anyone from {{entering}} the workings. However, company directors Robert Marten and Richard Harris insisted Gravatt take them in to inspect the damage, accompanied by two miners as crew for a dinghy. Whist in the workings, Marten attempted to move forward in the dinghy, and after striking {{his head on the}} tunnel, tipped the boat over in 12 ft of water. Only Gravatt and miner Dowling could swim, and after rescuing Marten and Harris, Gravatt was joined by Brunel in the search underwater for the second miner Richardson. Joined by officials from the Humane Society, they eventually recovered the body with a <b>drag-line.</b> On 5 March 1828, silver medals were voted by the Royal Humane Society to Brunel and Gravatt [...] "for having hazarded their own lives to preserve those of their fellow-creatures." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the tarsal claws, the {{spinning}} apparatus, and other factors affecting <b>drag-line</b> spinning has been made using certain orb-web spiders, principally Araneus diadematus. The structure of the tarsal claws suggests that they are incapable of smoothly controlling {{the speed at which}} the silk thread is extracted, although they can grip and release the thread quickly. Evidence is presented that smooth control of spinning is achieved through the inter-action of the intra-abdominal pressure and the control valve which lies in the silk duct. The intra-abdominal pressure is shown to be equivalent to from 3 to 4 cm of mercury, and to be responsible for moving the fluid silk out of the gland and up the duct. The experimental results also suggest that the control valve regulates the amount of fluid silk available for spinning as a thread and that it also acts as the func-tional spinning orifice, its aperture controlling the diameter of the thread spun...|$|E
