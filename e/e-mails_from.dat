25|$|In November 2011, a music {{writer and}} editor for the British {{newspaper}} The Observer sought help raising £200,000 to have his 4-year-old niece, who was diagnosed with glioma, treated at the Burzynski Clinic. Several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment, and had died, and challenged the validity of Burzynski's treatments. Marc Stephens, identifying himself {{as a representative of}} the Burzynski Clinic, sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of Burzynski be removed from their sites. One of the bloggers who received threatening <b>e-mails</b> <b>from</b> Stephens was Rhys Morgan, a 17-year-old sixth-form student from Cardiff, Wales, at the time, previously noted for exposing the Miracle Mineral Supplement. Another was Andy Lewis, a skeptic and publisher of the Quackometer blog.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, MGM {{sold its}} rights to The Forty Days of Musa Dagh and after several {{abortive}} attempts, the novel was finally {{turned into a}} movie in 1982, directed by Sarky Mouradian with screenplay by Alex Hakobian. It was a low-budget, low-profile production that seriously abridged the original. In 2006, Sylvester Stallone expressed his desire to direct a film about Musa Dagh, according to Professor Savaş Eğilmez of Atatürk University. An e-mail campaign sponsored by the Armenian-genocide denying Foundation for the Struggle Against Baseless Allegations of Genocide (ASİMED), pressured Stallone into not proceeding with the film. In early 2009, reports surfaced that Mel Gibson was also considering directing a documentary and appearing in the adaptation of Werfel's novel but was dissuaded after receiving 3,000 <b>e-mails</b> <b>from</b> a Turkish pressure group.|$|E
25|$|Representative Rodney Alexander (R-LA) {{stated that}} he learned of the five initial <b>e-mails</b> <b>from</b> Foley to the 16-year-old page from Louisiana {{in the fall of}} 2005, after a news {{reporter}} brought the matter to his attention. Alexander spoke to the boy's parents, who did not wish to pursue the matter beyond stopping the e-mails. Alexander's chief of staff met with Mike Stokke, Hastert's deputy chief of staff in the fall of 2005. They met with Trandahl. Contradictory statements have made it unclear whether they actually read the e-mails. Trandahl then met with Shimkus, and Shimkus and Trandahl met privately with Foley, and Shimkus told him to cease contact with the page. The other two congressional representatives on the House Page Committee (including the only Democrat) were not informed, and no formal investigative or disciplinary action was taken.|$|E

During that time, she received a number of <b>e-mails</b> <b>from</b> fans requesting for new material to be released, which drove Swift into releasing Beautiful Eyes: [...] "I thought this might tide them over till the new album comes out in the fall." [...] Beautiful Eyes is musically oriented to country pop and contemporary music.

500|$|In fall 2007, Losts writers {{presented}} ABC executives {{with the}} story that a salvage vessel called the Christiane I looking for the Black Rock, among other things, in the Sunda Trench would come across what {{would appear to be}} the wreckage of 815. [...] ABC hired the Australian company Hoodlum to design a $3million viral marketing alternate reality game (ARG) titled Find 815. [...] Find 815 ran from December 28, 2007 to January 31, 2008, beginning with a press release issued from ABC Medianet announcing the fictitious return of the fictional Oceanic Airlines' return to business. [...] The ARG– apparently the largest ever– followed Sam Thomas, an Oceanic technician who had lost his girlfriend in the crash, as he received cryptic <b>e-mails</b> <b>from</b> The Maxwell Group (a division of Widmore Industries, but nonexistent in Lost), joined the crew of the Christiane I and ultimately uncovered 815. [...] Because Find 815 was produced separately from the show and without the show's writers, it contradicts events in the TV series. [...] In [...] "Confirmed Dead", 815 is found by a man not present in the game named Ron; Thomas is not mentioned. [...] Lindelof and Cuse dismissed the game as not being canon (not containing genuine information within the fictional universe) and was largely just a bonus for fans during the between-seasons hiatus.|$|E

Deadline.com editor Nikki Finke released an e-mail from a Bandslam insider who pointed out that Summit's marketing have basically sold it on to their stars Hudgens and Michalka instead of selling the concept.
