40|$|The European Commission {{launched}} the <b>eEurope</b> <b>initiative</b> in December 1999 in an aim " 8 ̆ 5 {{to ensure that}} the European Union fully benefits for generations to come from the changes the Information Society is bringing " (1). The <b>eEurope</b> <b>initiative</b> was very positively received by the member states, the European Parliament, key players in society and, more specifically, by the European Council at its March 2000 meeting in Lisbon. At this Summit-meeting, heads of state and governments committed themselves to a number of measures, including target dates, to bring eEurope forward as {{an important part of the}} strategy to turn Europe into the most competitive knowledge economy in the world. This is sometimes referred to as the "Lisbon-agenda". eEurope has three stated key objectives: • Firstly, to put every home, every classroom, every business and every public administration on-line bringing Europe into the digital age. • Secondly, to create a digitally literate Europe, supported by an entrepreneurial culture ready to develop and finance new ideas. • Thirdly, {{to ensure that the}} transition into the digital age is a socially inclusive process that it builds consumer trust and strengthens social cohesion. eEurope aims to build on existing European policies and actions and on Europe's achievements and strengths in mobile communications and digital TV. The aim is accelerate progress in these areas by setting ambitious targets. Thus the project needs to be based on a collaborative effort which (*) An earlier version of this article was written as a position paper for the European Network fo...|$|E

Improving government services available on the Internet was listed {{as one of the}} ten priorities in the eEurope plan of action. Insofar as foreign and security policy is a primary function of governing institutions and the successful development of that policy is of vital interest to the EU member states, it is important to examine what CFSP is, how it fits into the <b>eEurope</b> <b>initiative,</b> what steps are being taken to meet the eEurope targets, and what additional steps are needed.

40|$|What {{electronic}} services and devices {{will be available}} to support independent living in 2010 ? How can we ensure that the elderly and disabled are not isolated from society, victims of the digital divide? Will the computer and telecommunications be the perfect tools to help the disabled to finally get into the normal labour market? These {{are just some of the}} questions that the IST PRISMA 1 project is trying to answer. The communications revolution has created multiple digital divides. Services in the Information Society need to be adapted to the needs of the elderly and disabled as highlighted in the <b>eEurope</b> <b>initiative.</b> There is a socio-economic trend towards a service-oriented Information Society in Europe. The main aim of the PRISMA project is to help improve future service delivery across Europe by developing innovative service and thematic models for the provision of general interest services. The project covers all areas of Key Action 1 in the IST programme, addressing citizen services in the areas of health, persons with special needs (including the disabled and the elderly), administrations, the environment, transport and tourism.

40|$|Abstract. The European Commission’s <b>eEurope</b> <b>initiative</b> aims {{to bring}} every citizen, home, school, {{business}} and administration online to create a digitally literate Europe. The value lies not in the objective itself, but {{in its ability to}} facilitate the advance of Europe into new ways of living and working. Just as in the first literacy revolution, our lives will change in ways never imagined. The vision of eEurope is underpinned by a technological infrastructure that is now taken for granted. Yet it provides us with the ability to pioneer radical new ways of doing business, of undertaking science, and, of managing our everyday activities. Key to this step change is the development of appropriate mechanisms to automate and improve existing tasks, to anticipate desired actions on our behalf (as human users) and to undertake them, {{while at the same time}} enabling us to stay involved and retain as much control as required. For many, these mechanisms are now being realised by agent technologies, which are already providing dramatic and sustained benefits in several business and industry domains, including B 2 B exchanges, supply chain management, car manufacturing, and so on. While there are many real successes of agent technologies to report, there is still much to be done in research and development for the full benefits to be achieved. This is especially true in the context of environments of pervasive computing devices that are envisaged in coming years.

40|$|Teh <b>eEurope</b> <b>Initiative</b> and eEurope 2002 Action Plan were {{launched}} by European Commission in 1999 - 2000 to bring Europe on-line. The eEurope 2 ̆ 7 s {{objective was to}} accelerate {{the development of the}} Information Society. The internet penetration in Europe will be growing rapidly in the near future. 　Teh frowth of the internet using is restricted by the hight of tariff accessing to telecommunications infrastructure and the related services. Therefore, he liberalisation fo telecommunicetions to increase competition and reduce its price was very important fro making the base of the Europe 2 ̆ 7 s Information Society, so called, eEurope. 　The liberalisation of telecommunication in Europe was started by the European Commission in 1987 with the publication of Green Paper {{on the development of the}} common market for communications services and equipment. The telecommunicetions regulatory process was expanded by the European Commission. At last, the European telecommunications markets were fully liberalised in 1998. 　We should consider the telecommunications regulatory process was part of the wider process of the economic integration and Information Society Initiative of Europe. The White Paper on 2 ̆ 7 Growth, Competitiveness and Employment 2 ̆ 7 in 1993 and the Bangemann report in 1994 were published by the Commission. Both reports had made reference to Information Society and had placed the telecommunications liberalisation policy at the heart of the EU 2 ̆ 7 s general policy. The result of the development of digital technology sectors. This convergence is discussed from the view of the approach towards to the Information Society in Europe. 　In this paper the main stress falls on that the telecommunications regulatory process to the liberalisation and the going on the way of the Information Society were underpinned each other in European Union...|$|E
40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the state of}} affairs in eGovernment in Europe {{in the light of}} a study 1 conducted {{within the framework of the}} eEurope Awards Programme 2, which is managed by the author. Point of departure are the results of the eEurope Awards for eGovernment - 2003 which are indicative of what could be regarded today as the state of affairs in eGovernment in Europe. Discussions of good practice in the first part of this article are based on the 357 submitted cases, which show a pattern of replacing rigid administration with reactive, responsive and flexible structures relying on eGovernment. The cases reveal the magnitude of creativity and innovation at work in implementing eGovernment across Europe, thus demonstrating that such a process may well indeed underlie far-reaching changes in governance in Europe. The second part of the article analyses from a more general perspective what could be described as the vision versus the reality of eGovernment: The information society has coincided with unprecedented efforts to improve administrative procedures and organisation, allowing true citizen-centric, cooperative, seamless and polycentric modern governance. Consequently, the socio-technical and institutional transformations will go far beyond serving citizens and the economy by merely offering online services. Strategies for eGovernment can aim at modernising government in an unprecedented way. However, any such strategy can only be achieved on the basis of a thoroughly reasoned vision. A truly new architecture of service management and delivery is about to emerge, which is built on separating customer-centred front offices from back offices and on seamless connections between organisations. Moreover, fully-fledged eGovernment will not just reshape administrations but also civil society and the public sphere at large. The article concludes by highlighting some of the major challenges ahead beyond the framework and actions planned within the <b>eEurope</b> <b>Initiative.</b> More information on the eEurope Awards Programme and the original report on the state of affairs of eGovernment in Europe at www. e-europeawards. org...|$|E
