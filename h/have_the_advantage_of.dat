5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydroelectric plants <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dutch Army and the German 18th Army, a third force, not all that much smaller than either, would operate on Dutch soil: the French 7th Army. It had its own objectives within the larger French strategy, and French planning had long considered the possibility of operations in Dutch territory. The coastal regions of Zealand and Holland were difficult to negotiate because of their many waterways. However, both the French and the Germans saw {{the possibility of a}} surprise flanking attack in this region. For the Germans this would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> bypassing the Antwerp-Namur line. The Zealand Isles were considered to be strategically critical, as they are just opposite the Thames estuary, so their capture would pose a special menace to the safety of England.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the sailors}} of both fleets fought hard, they were {{suffering}} from popular unrest; the mutinies in Britain continued to overshadow the Royal Navy, while the Dutch sailors were unhappy with French dominion and, in marked difference to their officers, were generally {{supporters of the}} exiled House of Orange. In addition, the Dutch were disaffected and poorly trained due to the long months blockaded in their harbours, which made them inferior seamen and gunners {{when compared with the}} highly experienced British crews, and the Dutch ships were more weakly constructed than their British counterparts with a shallower draught, a necessity in the shallow waters of the Dutch coast but a liability when fighting warships built for the open ocean. The Dutch did, however, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> weight of shot, especially when their well-armed frigates and brigs are included statistically. Unlike their British equivalents, these lighter craft were intended to contribute in battle, covering the gaps in the line between their larger companions.|$|E
5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced {{and they have to}} take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> reducing {{the problem with}} nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, {{the same as the}} altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E

5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity {{is limited by the}} power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> being able to accommodate {{a wide variety of}} waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E
5|$|Engaged in {{conflict}} with their original employers, the Byzantine Empire, the Catalan Company had traversed the southern Balkans and arrived in southern Greece in 1309. The new Duke of Athens, Walter of Brienne, hired them to attack the Greek ruler of neighbouring Thessaly. Although the Catalans conquered much of the region for him, Walter refused to pay them the salaries owed, and prepared to forcibly expel them from their gains. The two armies met at Halmyros in southern Thessaly (or at the Boeotic Cephissus, near Orchomenos, according to an earlier interpretation). The Catalans were considerably outnumbered and weakened by the reluctance of their Turkish auxiliaries to fight. The Company did <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> selecting the battleground, positioning themselves behind marshy terrain, which they further inundated with water. On the Athenian side, {{many of the most}} important lords of Frankish Greece were present and Walter, a prideful man and confident in the prowess of his heavy cavalry, proceeded to charge headlong against the Catalan line. The marsh impeded the Frankish attack and the Catalan infantry stood firm. The Turks, seeing that battle was joined in earnest, re-joined the Company, and the Frankish army was routed; Walter and almost the entire knighthood of his realm fell in the field. As a result of the battle, the leaderless Duchy of Athens was taken over by the Catalans, who ruled that part of Greece until the 1380s.|$|E
