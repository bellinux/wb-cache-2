5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
25|$|Early morning {{awakening}} is an awakening occurring earlier (more than 30 minutes) than desired with {{an inability}} to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and before total sleep time reaches 6.5 hours. Early morning awakening is often a characteristic of depression.|$|E

5000|$|Just then, a whimpering Perry {{wakes up}} in the true real world in Phineas's bed. Revealing that {{everything}} was all just a bad dream and that {{the events of the}} entire episode never happened at all, Phineas then says [...] "Oh hey Perry...looks like you just had a nightmare. Well, it's over, you can go <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> now." [...] Phineas <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Perry then smiles and also <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|R

25|$|A similar custom {{is celebrated}} among Orthodox Christians in Serbia on 15 February (2 February {{according}} to the local religious Julian calendar) during the feast of celebration of Sretenje or The Meeting of the Lord (Candlemas). It is believed that the bear will awaken from winter dormancy on this day, and if it sees (meets) its own shadow in this sleepy and confused state, it will get scared and <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for an additional 40 days, thus prolonging the winter. Thus, if it is sunny on Sretenje, {{it is a sign}} that the winter is not over yet. If it is cloudy, it is a good sign that the winter is about to end.|$|E

Her father, a poor {{fisherman}}, is dying. Since she has no money Trifulgas <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Soon someone knocks again. It is a woman whose husband is dying. She has some money but not enough so the doctor <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> The storm becomes worse when another one knocks. The mother of a fisherman suffering a heart attack has enough money—their house was sold shortly ago. The doctor follows her. A look on the dying man horrifies Trifulgas—it is he who lies in the bed. In spite of all effort, Trifulgas dies under his own hands.|$|R

He has lost his wife now, and she keeps house for him, and Bill says all the young men in Varley are mad about her, but she won't have anything to say to them." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went on to}} tell Nunez {{how this}} time had been divided into the warm and the cold, which are the blind {{equivalents}} of day and night, {{and how it was}} good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold, so that now, but for his advent, the whole town of the blind would have been asleep. He said Nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the wisdom, they had acquired, and that for all his mental incoherency and stumbling behaviour he must have courage, and do his best to learn, and at that {{all the people in the}} doorway murmured encouragingly. He said the night--for the blind call their day night--was now far gone, and it behoved every one to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> He asked Nunez if he knew how to sleep, and Nunez said he did, but that before sleep he wanted food.|$|E

But Nunez slumbered not at all.|$|E

60|$|Besides this {{abundant}} game {{there were}} other good things to eat, and the cubs rarely dined of the same dish twice in succession. Salmon and big sea-trout swarmed now in every shallow of the clear brooks, and, after spawning, these fish were much weakened and could easily be caught by a little cunning. Every day and night the tide ebbed and flowed, and every tide left its contribution in windrows of dead herring and caplin, with scattered crabs and mussels for a relish, like plums in a pudding. A wolf had only to trot for {{a mile or two}} along the tide line of a lonely beach, picking up the good things which the sea had brought him, and then <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> or play satisfied. And if Wayeeses wanted game to try his mettle and cunning, there were the big fat seals barking on the black rocks, and he had only to cut between them and the sea and throw himself upon the largest seal as the herd floundered ponderously back to safety. A wolf rarely grips and holds an enemy; he snaps and lets go, and snaps again at every swift chance; but here he must either hold fast or lose his big game; and what between holding and letting go, as the seals whirled with bared teeth and snapped viciously in turn, as they scrambled away to the sea, the wolves had a lively time of it. Often indeed, spite of three or four wolves, a big seal would tumble into the tide, where the sharks followed his bloody trail and soon finished him.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variant of}} this {{solution}} {{could use a}} single condition variable for both producers and consumers, perhaps named [...] "queueFullOrEmptyCV" [...] or [...] "queueSizeChangedCV". In this case, more than one condition {{is associated with the}} condition variable, such that the condition variable represents a weaker condition than the conditions being checked by individual threads. The condition variable represents threads that are waiting for the queue to be non-full and ones waiting for it to be non-empty. However, doing this would require using notifyAll in all the threads using the condition variable and cannot use a regular signal. This is because the regular signal might wake up a thread of the wrong type whose condition has not yet been met, and that thread would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> without a thread of the correct type getting signalled. For example, a producer might make the queue full and wake up another producer instead of a consumer, and the woken producer would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> In the complementary case, a consumer might make the queue empty and wake up another consumer instead of a producer, and the consumer would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Using notifyAll ensures that some thread of the right type will proceed as expected by the problem statement.|$|E
