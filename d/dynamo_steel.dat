40|$|Magnetic measurements, {{carried out}} {{by means of the}} Epstein frame, have shown that most typical <b>dynamo</b> <b>steel</b> sheets have certain {{anisotropic}} properties. In numerical analysis, anisotropic properties are taken into account {{with the use of the}} special function of the grain distribution in the given dynamo sheet. For engineering purposes, it is desirable to assess the influence of these properties on the changes of the magnetic flux density in typical <b>dynamo</b> <b>steel</b> sheets, especially during the rotational magnetization. For this purpose, measurements of the flux density changes and field strength changes in the circular-shaped samples of two selected typical dynamo sheets were performed. These measurements were carried out for several values of the current flowing in windings which generated the axial or rotational magnetic field in the test dynamo sheet. The influence of the magnetic anisotropy on the magnetization process was briefly discussed for both types of the magnetization processes...|$|E

The invention of the electric <b>dynamo,</b> electroplating and <b>steel</b> in the 1870s created a strong demand for copper and nickel. Hard rock mining became a practical consideration because of the concurrent development of the hard rock drill and dynamite. A copper mine was established in Orford County Quebec in 1877, by the Orford Company while the Canadian Copper Company was founded in 1886 to exploit copper deposits at Sudbury made accessible by {{the construction of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway. The ore from that mine was found to contain nickel as well as copper and a technique known as the Orford process using nitrate cake (acid sodium sulphate) was developed to separate the metals. Hard rock gold mining became practical in 1887, with the development of the potassium cyanidation process, by Scott MacArthur, which was used to separate the gold from the ore. This technique was first used in Canada at the Mikado Mine in the Lake-of-the-Woods Region again made accessible by the CPR. The CPR also provided access the B.C. interior where lead, copper, silver and gold ores had been discovered in the Rossland area in 1891. The ores were transported to Trail, B.C. where they were roasted. After CPR built the Crowsnest Pass it purchased the Trail roasting facility and in 1899 built a blast furnace to smelt lead ore.|$|R
