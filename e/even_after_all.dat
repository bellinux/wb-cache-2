5|$|Once drained, stabilised and fertilised, Chat Moss became prime {{agricultural}} land, supplying Manchester with {{salad and}} other vegetables. The drainage channels, still required today, give the area its distinctive flat landscape broken up by ditches instead of hedges or walls. <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> of the reclamation {{work that has}} taken place, parts of the area remain remote and bleak.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> Ostrom's work, {{several small}} blocks of lime-encased {{material}} remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum. These consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments, including the original matrix, or surrounding rock {{in which the}} specimens were initially buried. An examination of these unprepared blocks by Gerald Grellet-Tinner and Peter Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures that helped stiffen the tail of Deinonychus) turned out to actually represent gastralia (abdominal ribs). More significantly, {{a large number of}} previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix that had surrounded the original Deinonychus specimen.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, German New Guinea was only lightly defended; <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> available reservists had reported for duty and the Melanesian police had been armed, the total strength was only 61German officers and non-commissioned officers, and about 240Melanesian police. To compound the defenders' problems, most of the Germans were reservists with either limited experience or who {{had served in the}} military many years earlier. The Bita Paka radio station itself was occupied by eight Germans and 60 Melanesians, under the command of Hauptmann (Captain) Hans Wuchert. Wuchert's force was assigned to defend against any hostile landing at a point near the coast, and was authorised to withdraw halfway between Toma and Bita Paka to Tobera if necessary, but only after demolishing the radio station. A company of 10Germans and 140Melanesians was also stationed at Herbertshöhe, commanded by Leutnant (Lieutenant) Mayer, while a squad of Melanesians at Toma under Leutnant Robert von Blumenthal ("Lord Bob") was charged with digging in and improving defences. Section outposts were established at various locations and monitored the coast from St. George's Channel to Rabaul. Despite the limits of manpower, such arrangements proved effective and the reconnaissance of the Australian Squadron on 12 August had been quickly detected, with German forces subsequently directed towards the coast to repel any invasion.|$|E

25|$|Buddhists, Jains, Advaita Vedantins and Nyāya {{philosophers}} {{considered the}} Charvakas {{as one of}} their opponents and tried to refute their views. These refutations are indirect sources of Charvaka philosophy. The arguments and reasoning approach Charvakas deployed were significant that they continued to be referred to, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> the authentic Charvaka/Lokāyata texts had been lost. However, the representation of the Charvaka thought in these works is not always firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of Charvaka texts and should be viewed critically.|$|E
25|$|A fully {{electronic}} kit is also {{easier to}} soundcheck than acoustic drums, {{assuming that the}} electronic drum module has levels that the drummer has pre-set in her/his practice room; in contrast, when an acoustic kit is sound checked, most drums and cymbals need to be miked and each mic needs to be tested by the drummer so its level and tone equalization can be adjusted by the sound engineer. As well, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> the individual drum and cymbal mics are soundchecked, the engineer needs {{to listen to the}} drummer play a standard groove, to check that the balance between the kit instruments is right. Finally, the engineer needs to set up the monitor mix for the drummer, which the drummer uses to hear her/his instruments and the instruments and vocals {{of the rest of the}} band. With a fully electronic kit, many of these steps could be eliminated.|$|E

25|$|Maggie's {{marriage}} to Mickey Horton {{is central to}} the character, with their relationship being among the most prominent and long-running relationships on the show. Mickey is depicted as a smart, tough lawyer, with Maggie being portrayed as a weak farm girl. Maggie and Mickey were generally depicted as the most stable couple on the show, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> the torment the two had gone through. During the early years of their marriage, Maggie felt threatened by the presence of his old lover, Linda Patterson, who had pretended to be Maggie's friend but was secretly trying to win Mickey back. Linda had claimed that Mickey was her daughter Melissa's father, but Linda's estranged husband Jim Phillips revealed that Linda had lied. While Linda went on to other relationships (including Mickey's brother Tommy and the wealthy Bob Anderson whom she married), she continued to remain a thorn in Maggie's side. After Bob Anderson's death, Melissa ran away from the neglectful Linda and eventually Mickey and Maggie took her in, sending her to a private school outside of Salem.|$|E

Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever been. In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met." ...|$|E

2500|$|Owing to the {{box office}} success and {{continued}} popularity of The Sound of Music (1965), Plummer remains widely known for his portrayal of Captain Von Trapp, a role he later described as [...] "so awful and sentimental and gooey".

He declined to attend the 40th Anniversary cast reunion, but did provide commentary on the 2005 DVD release. Plummer relented in 2010 for the 45th anniversary, and appeared with the full cast on The Oprah Winfrey Show on October 28, 2010.
