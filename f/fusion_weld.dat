40|$|A {{plate of}} as-cast NiAl bronze (NAB) {{material}} was sectioned {{from a large}} casting. A six-pass <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> overlay {{was placed in a}} machined groove; a portion of the weld reinforcement was removed by milling and a single friction stir processing (FSP) pass was conducted in a direction transverse to the axis of and over the weld overlay. A procedure was developed for machining of miniature tensile samples and the distributions of strength and ductility were evaluated for the <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> metal; for the stir zone (SZ) produced by the friction stir processing; and for a region wherein friction stir processing had taken place over the <b>fusion</b> <b>weld.</b> A region of low ductility in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of the <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> and in the thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ) of friction stir processed material was attributed to partial reversion of an equilibrium lamellar eutectoid constituent upon local heating above ∼ 800 ◦C and formation of non-equilibrium transformation products upon subsequent cooling. The adverse effect on ductility is worse in the heat affected zone of the <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> than in the thermomechanically affected zone of friction stir processing due to the lower heat input of the latter process. The implications of this work to engineering applications of friction stir processing are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Friction Stir Processing (FSP) is {{currently}} being developed for applications including as-cast Nickel- Aluminum Bronze (NAB). Fabrication and repair of the United States Navy's NAB propellers involve fusion welding of as-cast NAB {{and so it is}} probable that FSP is likely to encounter as deposited weld metal as well as the more slowly cooled as-cast material. Here, the microstructure and resulting distribution of mechanical properties was examined for a <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> overlay, an FSP stir zone and an FSP stir zone that was placed in <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> metal. As-deposited weld metal exhibited a refined WidmanstaÃŒ tten morphology and higher yield and ultimate strengths as well as increased ductility in comparison to base metal. However, the heat affected zone (HAZ) exhibited severely reduced ductility. Strength and ductility varied throughout the FSP stir zone. The reduction in ductility in the thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and HAZ was less for FSP than for the <b>fusion</b> <b>weld.</b> FSP over a <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> resulted in strengths and ductility's similar to those produced by FSP alone, although a region of low ductility was observed at a location where stir zone weld metal and base metal were all present...|$|E

40|$|Solid state welding {{processes}} {{have become the}} focus of welding process development at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Unlike <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> processes such as tungsten inert gas (TIG), variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA), electron beam (EB), etc., solid state {{welding processes}} do not melt the material during welding. The resultant microstructure can be characterized as a dynamically recrystallized morphology much different than the casted, dentritic structure typical of <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> processes. The primary benefits of solid state processes over <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> processes include superior mechanic properties and the elimination of thermal distortion and residual stresses. These solid state processes attributes have profoundly influenced the direction of advanced welding research and development within the NASA agency. Thermal Stir Welding (TSW) is a new solid state welding process being developed at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Unlike friction stir welding, the heating, stirring and forging elements of the weld process can be decoupled for independent control. An induction coil induces energy into a workpiece to attain a desired plastic temperature. An independently controlled stir rod, captured within non-rotating containment plates, then stirs the plasticized material followed by forging plates/rollers that work the stirred weld joint. The independent control (decoupling) of heating, stirring and forging allows, theoretically, for the precision control of microstructure morphology. The TSW process is being used to evaluate the solid state joining of Haynes 230 for ARES J- 2 X applications. It is also being developed for 500 -in (12. 5 mm) thick commercially pure grade 2 titanium for navy applications. Other interests include Inconel 718 and stainless steel.

40|$|Friction Stir Processing (FSP) is {{currently}} being considered for use in manufacture of the Navy's NiAl bronze propellers. Incorporating this technology may improve service performance and enable reduction of manufacturing time and cost. This program of research has employed miniature tensile sample designs to examine the distributions of longitudinal properties through the various regimes in a <b>fusion</b> <b>weld.</b> Also, the distributions of both longitudinal and transverse properties throughout the stir zones for selected FSP conditions were examined. Yield strengths were larger in various FSP conditions by at least a factor of two relative to fusion welds. Ultimate strengths were comparable in the weld pool and stir nugget. WidmanstaÌ tten microstructures and microvoid formation and coalescence in the fracture surface resulted in high ductilities in weld metal and the stir nugget. The thermomechanically affected zone of FSP and the heat affected zone of a <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> both exhibit low ductility. This may reflect formation of "a" upon heating to temperatures of 800 - 850 [degrees]C, followed by rapid cooling and transformation of the "a" to form martensitic transformation products in their respective microstructures. For a single-pass raster pattern, transverse ductility is lower than longitudinal ductility. For a multi-pass raster, transverse ductility is higher than longitudinal ductility. For multi-pass raster and spiral patterns in FSP, {{the data show that}} the mechanical properties are more nearly isotropic. US Navy (USN) author...|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} process that pan be used to join {{materials}} without melting. The process was invented by The Welding Institute (TWI), Cambridge, England. Friction stir welding exhibits several advantages over fusion welding in that it produces welds with fewer defects and higher joint efficiency and is capable of joining alloys that are generally considered non-weldable with a <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> process. In 1994, NASA-Marshall began collaborating with TWI to transform FSW from a laboratory curiosity to a viable metal joining process suitable for manufacturing hardware. While teamed with TWI, NASA-Marshall began its own FSW research and development effort to investigate possible aerospace applications for the FSW process. The work involved nearly all aspects of FSW development, including process modeling, scale-up issues, applications to advanced materials and development of tooling to use FSW on components of the Space Shuttle with particular emphasis on aluminum tanks. The friction stir welding process involves spinning a pin-tool at an appropriate speed, plunging it into the base metal pieces to be joined, and then translating it along the joint of the work pieces. In aluminum alloys the rotating speed typically ranges from 200 to 400 revolutions per minute and the translation speed is approximately two to five inches per minute. The pin-tool is inserted at a small lead angle from the axis normal to the work piece and requires significant loading along the axis of the tool. An anvil or reaction structure is required behind the welded material to react the load along the axis of the pin tool. The process requires no external heat input, filler material, protective shielding gas or inert atmosphere typical of <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> processes. The FSW solid-state weld process has resulted in aluminum welds with significantly higher strengths, higher joint efficiencies and fewer defects than fusion welds used to join similar alloys...|$|E
