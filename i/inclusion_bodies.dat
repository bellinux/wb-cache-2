500|$|There are {{multiple}} cellular changes {{through which the}} toxic function of mHTT may manifest and produce the HD pathology. During the biological process of posttranslational modification of mHTT, cleavage of the protein can leave behind shorter fragments constituted of parts of the polyglutamine expansion. [...] The polar nature of glutamine causes interactions with other proteins when it is overabundant in unmodified HTT proteins or the HTT fragments created from HTT cleavage. Thus, the mHTT molecule strands will form hydrogen bonds with one another, forming a protein aggregate rather than folding into functional proteins. Over time, the aggregates accumulate, ultimately interfering with neuron function because these fragments can then misfold and coalesce, in a process called protein aggregation, to form <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> within cells. [...] Neuronal inclusions run indirect interference. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> {{have been found in}} both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> in cells of the brain are one of the earliest pathological changes, and some experiments have found that they can be toxic for the cell, but other experiments have shown that they may form as part of the body's defense mechanism and help protect cells.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of serpin diseases {{are due to}} protein aggregation and are termed [...] "serpinopathies". Serpins are vulnerable to disease-causing mutations that promote formation of misfolded polymers due to their inherently unstable structures. Well-characterised serpinopathies include α1-antitrypsin deficiency (alpha-1), which may cause familial emphysema and sometimes liver cirrhosis, certain familial forms of thrombosis related to antithrombin deficiency, types1 and 2 hereditary angioedema (HAE) related to deficiency of C1-inhibitor, and familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> (FENIB; a rare type of dementia caused by neuroserpin polymerisation).|$|E
40|$|<b>Inclusion</b> <b>body</b> {{myositis}} {{is a form}} of inflammatory myopathy. We identified 4 {{cases of}} <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis showing granuloma formation in muscle tissue and aimed to assess the features of this atypical form of <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients who satisfied European Neuromuscular Centre IBM Research Diagnostic Criteria 2011. Then, we assessed clinical profiles and pathological findings in patients with <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis with granuloma and compared these findings with those of typical <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis without granuloma. We identified 15 patients with <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis. Four patients showed granuloma formation in muscle tissue in addition to typical pathological features of <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis. Granulomas comprised a mixture of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, epithelioid histiocytic cells, and lymphocytes. One patient was found to have mediastinal granulomatous lymphadenopathy; however, the evidence in other patients was insufficient for a diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis. There {{were no significant differences between}} groups with and without granuloma regarding clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, response to immunomodulating therapies, or myopathological profiles. We established a new form of <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis showing granuloma formation in muscle tissue. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis and granuloma formation could have identical pathomechanisms concerning dysregulation of autophagy. © 2015 Elsevier B.

50|$|<b>Inclusion</b> <b>body</b> {{myositis}} (IBM) is {{an inflammatory}} muscle disease characterized by slowly progressive weakness and wasting of both distal and proximal muscles, most {{apparent in the}} muscles of the arms and legs.

40|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{variants}} {{have been}} shown to be associated with many diseases. Mutations at mitochondrial DNA nucleotide positions 3192, 3196, 3397 and 4336 have been described in association with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The pathological similarities between <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis and Alzheimer's disease prompted an analysis of the relationship between the reported mutations and sporadic <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis. The 4336 G variant was not significantly increased in patients with <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis or Alzheimer's disease when compared to controls. None of the patients with <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis carried mutations at nucleotide positions 3192, 3196 and 3397. A transition at nucleotide position 4580 was detected in some patients with <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis and Alzheimer's disease but was not significantly higher in frequency when compared to controls. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 4336 G and 4580 A variants clustered together in their respective group. A group of patients with <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis also clustered together on a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree. Closer investigation of this group revealed a common polymorphism at nucleotide position 16311. The frequency of the 16311 C variant was higher in <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis than in Alzheimer's disease and controls, although when only caucasian patients were considered the increased frequency was not statistically significant. Further studies will be required to determine whether this variant plays a role in the pathogenesis of <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis...|$|R
2500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain DNA and cannot {{synthesize}} any RNA, and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities. [...] The inability to carry out protein synthesis means that no virus can evolve to target mammalian red blood cells. [...] However, infection with parvoviruses (such as human parvovirus B19) can affect erythroid precursors, as recognized by the presence of giant pronormoblasts with viral particles and <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies,</b> thus temporarily depleting the blood of reticulocytes and causing anemia.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis of FVR {{is usually}} by {{clinical}} signs, especially corneal ulceration. [...] Definitive diagnosis {{can be done}} by direct immunofluorescence or virus isolation. However, many healthy cats are subclinical carriers of feline herpes virus, so a positive test for FHV-1 does not necessarily indicate that signs of an upper respiratory tract infection are due to FVR. [...] Early {{in the course of the}} disease, histological analysis of cells from the tonsils, nasal tissue, or nictitating membrane (third eyelid) may show <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> (a collection of viral particles) within the nucleus of infected cells.|$|E
2500|$|Cytocidal {{infections are}} often {{associated}} with changes in cell morphology, physiology and are thus important for the complete viral replication and transformation. [...] Cytopathic Effects, often include a change in cell's morphology such as fusion with adjacent cells to form polykaryocytes {{as well as the}} synthesis of nuclear and cytoplasmic <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies.</b> [...] Physiological changes include the insufficient movement of ions, formation of secondary messengers, and activation of cellular cascades to continue cellular activity. [...] Biochemically, many viruses inhibit the synthesis of host DNA, RNA, proteins directly or even interfere with protein-protein, DNA-protein, RNA-protein interactions at the subcellular level. [...] Genotoxicity involves breaking, fragmenting, or rearranging chromosomes of the host. [...] Lastly, biologic effects include the viruses' ability to affect the activity of antigens and immunologlobulins in the host cell.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} most commonly by serologic {{testing of the}} blood {{for the presence of}} antibodies against the ehrlichia organism. Many veterinarians routinely test for the disease, especially in enzootic areas. During the acute phase of infection, the test can be falsely negative because the body will not have had time to make antibodies to the infection. As such, the test should be repeated. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test can be performed during this stage to detect genetic material of the bacteria. The PCR test is more likely to yield a negative result during the subclinical and chronic disease phases. [...] In addition, blood tests may show abnormalities in the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and most commonly platelets, if the disease is present. Uncommonly, a diagnosis can be made by looking under a microscope at a blood smear for the presence of the ehrlichia morulae, which sometimes can be seen as intracytoplasmic <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> within a white blood cell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> have a non-unit lipid membrane. Protein <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> are classically {{thought to}} contain {{misfolded}} protein.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the presence of impurities in an <b>inclusion</b> <b>body,</b> such as nucleic acids and non-plasmid-encoded proteins, affects the final refolding yield of the target (Maachupalli-Reddy et al. 1997). These impurities can be removed by washing the body using a low concentration of detergent. Therefore, <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> washing is very important to enhance the refolding yield of the target. However, in this study we observed that the <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> composed of ABF- 2 without partner proteins was gradually solubilized during the washing process (data not shown). Because of this unfavorable solubilization of the body, ABF- 2 was lost during the washing process and we could not obtain even crude ABF- 2 in the experiment using expression without partner proteins. On the other hand, the <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> composed of ABF- 2 and the partner protein showed almost no solubilization during the washing process, suggesting that a robust <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> was formed via coexpression of the peptide and a partner protein. From these results, {{it can be said that}} coexpression of an aggregation-prone protein is effective not only to enhance the expression level of a target peptide as an <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> but also to prevent the unfavorable loss of an <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> during washing.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} several rare forms of {{hereditary}} <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myopathy that {{are linked to}} specific genetic defects and that are passed on from generation to generation. Since these forms do not show features of muscle inflammation, they are classified as myopathies rather than forms of myositis. Because they do not display inflammation as a primary symptom, they {{may in fact be}} similar, but different diseases to sporadic <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myositis. There are several different types, each inherited in different ways. See hereditary <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> myopathy.|$|R

It has been suggested that <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> are dynamic structures formed by an unbalanced equilibrium between aggregated and soluble proteins of Escherichia coli.

50|$|<b>Inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> are dense electron-refractile {{particles}} of aggregated protein found {{in both the}} cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces of E. coli during high-level expression of heterologous protein. It is generally assumed that high level expression of non-native protein (higher than 2% of cellular protein) and highly hydrophobic protein is more prone to lead to accumulation as <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> in E. coli. In the case of proteins having disulfide bonds, formation of protein aggregates as <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> is anticipated since the reducing environment of bacterial cytosol inhibits the formation of disulfide bonds. The diameter of spherical bacterial <b>inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> varies from 0.5-1.3 μm and the protein aggregates have either an amorphous or paracrystalline nature depending on the localization. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> have higher density (~1.3 mg ml−1) {{than many of the}} cellular components, and thus can be easily separated by high-speed centrifugation after cell disruption. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>bodies</b> despite being dense particles are highly hydrated and have a porous architecture.|$|E

The soluble supernate (containing citraconylated cys-mutated rmCRP (i.e., C-rmCRP) and various other <b>inclusion</b> <b>body</b> contaminants) was collected and was immediately passed on a Phenyl Sepharose hydrophobic adsorption column.
