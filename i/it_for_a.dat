5|$|According to Paine {{scholars}} Edward Davidson and William Scheick, {{he probably}} {{wrote the first}} draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated The Age of Reason into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of The Age of Reason, Part I in 1794 in London, selling <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mere three pence.|$|E

5|$|After filming was {{completed}} in 1996 the commissioning network ITV shelved <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year. It was eventually scheduled for broadcast {{on the evening of}} 30 March 1997, as part of the network's Comedy Premieres strand, but overrunning sports coverage delayed it for an hour. Ratings were low and critical reviews were minimal, but positive; critics enjoyed the comedy drama format and praised the writing and performances of the leads. Harries entered Cold Feet in the Montreux Television Festival, where it was awarded the Rose d'Or, the festival's top prize, resulting in ITV quickly scheduling a repeat broadcast. At {{the end of the year}} it won the award for Best Comedy Drama (ITV) at the British Comedy Awards and the incoming director of channels ordered a full series, which ran for five successful years from 1998 to 2003.|$|E

On 1 November 1933, she dropped the name McDougal to free <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new destroyer of the same name, becoming known only as DD-54. The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934, and, on 22 August, was sold for scrapping in accordance with the London Naval Treaty for the limitation of naval armaments.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} {{and says that}} the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E

In September 2006, he {{captured}} {{his first and}} only title with the company, the United States Championship, and would hold on to <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month. The following year at WrestleMania 23, Anderson won the annual Money in the Bank ladder match, a contract, which guarantees a match for one of WWE's then three world level championships. He was fired from WWE on May 29, 2009. He returned to the independent circuit before signing a contract with TNA in 2010, which he was fired from TNA in 2016 and {{would return to the}} independent circuit for a second time.

5|$|Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced {{its first}} true test. In the first quarter, the Terrapins {{took a quick}} 14–0 lead and held the Bulldogs to six {{offensive}} plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown drives, and the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown. Bratkowski {{was taken out of}} the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result would be the most points the Terrapins allowed during the entire season.|$|E
5|$|Against Washington and Lee, Hanulak made an {{interception}} {{and then on}} Maryland's possession rushed for a 12-yard touchdown.

After halftime, Tatum fielded third- and fourth-string players before the final results of 52–0.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants played well, {{the team}} {{experienced}} financial hardship {{during its first}} year. Player salaries were so low that most had to take additional jobs to support themselves. The team's brief practices, held at 4:30 p. m. each day to accommodate outside-work schedules, enabled little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925 and owner Tim Mara spent $25,000 {{of his own money}} during the season to keep the team going. The financial struggle continued until the 11th game of the season, when the visiting Red Grange and the Chicago Bears drew more than 73,000 fans (a pro-football record) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. This gave the Giants much-needed revenue, possibly altering the team's history. In the 19–7 Bears victory, Grange intercepted a pass intended for Bomar and returned <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> shorter amount of time.|$|E

5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the first}} quarter, James Wilder tipped a pass from Steve DeBerg {{into the hands of}} Vikings linebacker Chris Doleman, who {{returned}} <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown. Wilder took a helmet to the sternum on this play, leaving a deep bruise that caused him to miss the next two games, and reduced his effectiveness {{for the remainder of the}} season. Seventeen seconds later, Scott Studwell recovered a Wilder fumble at the Tampa Bay 18-yard line, leading to a Viking field goal. The Buccaneers added a Donald Igwebuike field goal before the end of the quarter, but the Vikings answered it with a touchdown pass from Tommy Kramer to Mike Mularkey. DeBerg's 1-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles brought the Buccaneers to within a touchdown before halftime, but they were unable to score in the second half. The Buccaneers outperformed the Vikings in a number of statistical categories, but could not overcome the turnovers.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel.

Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E
5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.|$|E
5|$|For {{their second}} {{game of the}} season, the All-Americans played against another local team, the Buffalo All-Buffalo. Once again, the All-Americans shut out their opponents, winning 51–0. In the first quarter, Weldon scored a rushing touchdown. In the second quarter, the All-Americans scored three times: Running back Ockie Anderson {{returned}} a punt for a touchdown, Hughitt ran for a rushing touchdown, and Weldon caught a receiving touchdown from Hughitt. To start the second half, Anderson scored another rushing touchdown, {{and that was the}} only score of the third quarter. In the final quarter, Anderson kicked a 35-yard field goal. Also, defensive end Murray Shelton recovered a fumble and returned <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> touchdown. Hughitt's rushing touchdown was the final score of the game.|$|E
