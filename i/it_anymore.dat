5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need <b>it</b> <b>anymore.</b>|$|E

25|$|Until his death, Borel {{attended}} the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, {{where he studied}} electromechanics and did quite well academically.

He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he could not bear <b>it</b> <b>anymore</b> at home, that he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also told one of his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing two or three people.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{graduating from}} the university, Sakuraba had {{initially}} thought to remain with Chuo University as a coach. However, {{at the last minute}} he decided to pursue a career as a professional wrestler. According to Sakuraba, the impetus for this stemmed from a childhood dream of one day emulating Satoru Sayama, a professional wrestler who portrayed in real life the famous Japanese cartoon hero Tiger Mask. He also stated in an interview with Scramble TV that as an amateur wrestler, he weighed 68 kilograms (about 150 pounds.) He was encouraged by his peers to gain weight as {{it would be difficult to}} compete as a smaller fighter in 'puroresu', and after working to gain the weight needed to compete, he never wanted to lose <b>it</b> <b>anymore,</b> something that would be reflected in his MMA career.|$|E
25|$|Arnold {{jumped out}} of the {{airplane}} near the base of the airfield control tower and picked up a Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) from a Marine who did not need <b>it</b> <b>anymore.</b> A member of the All Navy Pistol Team and a longtime pistol and bird shooter, Arnold was an excellent marksman, and shot down a torpedo plane coming in to strafe the new control tower next to which he was standing. The plane crashed on the field. Between the two waves, Jack and a couple of sailors went over to look at the wreckage. Discovering it belonged to the first wave’s Torpedo Squadron Commander, they drank the downed pilot's sake and returned to the battle. That kill from the ground was later to make Jack the only known pilot who shot down five aircraft (one with a BAR, two with an Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, and two with a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter) who was not an ace.|$|E
