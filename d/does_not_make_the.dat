Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs {{to be taken into account}} by adding 20% to the operating reserve, but it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.|$|E
5|$|In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> {{claim for}} gender {{equality}} {{using the same}} arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating {{that men and women}} are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.|$|E

25|$|In {{management}} literature, {{gap analysis}} involves {{the comparison of}} actual performance with potential or desired performance. If an organization <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> best use of current resources, or forgoes investment in capital or technology, it may produce or perform below its potential. This concept is similar to an economy's production being below the production possibilities frontier.|$|E
25|$|Some jurisdictions {{that hold}} runoff {{elections}} allow absentee (only) voters to submit IRV ballots, because {{the interval between}} votes is too short for {{a second round of}} absentee voting. IRV ballots enable absentee votes to count in the second (general) election round if their first choice <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> runoff. Arkansas, South Carolina and Springfield, Illinois adopt this approach. Louisiana uses it only for members of the United States Service or who reside overseas.|$|E

25|$|There is {{an ancient}} pilgrimage called the Tro Breizh (tour of Brittany) which {{involves}} pilgrims walking around Brittany from the grave {{of one of the}} Seven Founder Saints to another. Nowadays pilgrims complete the circuit {{over the course of several}} years. In 2002, the Tro Breizh included a special pilgrimage to Wales, symbolically making the reverse journey of the Welshmen Paul Aurelian, Brioc, and Samson. According to Breton religious tradition, whoever <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> pilgrimage at least once in his lifetime will be condemned to make it after his death, advancing only by the length of his coffin each seven years.|$|E
25|$|Both {{hard-wired}} (cable) and through-water electronic voice {{communications systems}} {{may be used}} with surface supplied diving. Wired systems are more popular {{as there is a}} physical connection to the diver for gas supply in any case, and adding a cable <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> system any different to handle. Wired communications systems are still more reliable and simpler to maintain than through-water systems. The communications equipment is relatively straightforward and may be of the two-wire or four-wire type. Two wire systems use the same wires for surface to diver and diver to surface messages, whereas four wire systems allow the diver's messages and the surface operator's messages to use separate wire pairs.|$|E
25|$|The ICC has 104 members: 12 Full Members {{that play}} Test matches and 92 Associate Members. The ICC is {{responsible}} for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most notably the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals. It promulgates the ICC Code of Conduct, which sets professional standards of discipline for international cricket, and also co-ordinates action against corruption and match-fixing through its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU). The ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries (which include all Test matches), it does not govern domestic cricket in member countries, and it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> laws of the game, which remain {{under the control of the}} Marylebone Cricket Club.|$|E

25|$|Checksum – Each note has {{a unique}} serial number. The {{remainder}} from dividing the serial number by 9 gives checksum corresponding to the initial letter indicated on the note. Using {{a variation of the}} divisibility rule shortcut, the remainder from division by 9 can easily be found by adding the constituent digits and, if the sum still <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> remainder obvious, adding the digits of the sum. Alternatively, substituting the letter with its ASCII value makes the resulting number exactly divisible by 9. Taking the same example, Z10708476264, the ASCII code for Z is 90, so the resulting number is 9010708476264. Dividing by 9 yields a remainder of 0. Using the divisibility rule again, the result can be checked speedily since the addition of all digits gives 54; 5 + 4 = 9—so the number is divisible by 9, or 9010708476264 modulo 9 is 0.|$|E
25|$|Francis Bacon often {{gathered}} {{with the}} men at Gray's Inn to discuss politics and philosophy, and to try out various theatrical scenes that he admitted writing. Bacon's alleged connection to the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons has been widely discussed by authors and scholars in many books. However, others, including Daphne du Maurier in her biography of Bacon, have argued {{that there is no}} substantive evidence to support claims of involvement with the Rosicrucians. Frances Yates <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> claim that Bacon was a Rosicrucian, but presents evidence that he was nevertheless involved in some of the more closed intellectual movements of his day. She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's New Atlantis portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. He apparently saw his own movement for the advancement of learning to be in conformity with Rosicrucian ideals.|$|E
25|$|Threefold {{repetition}} – if {{an identical}} position has occurred {{at least three}} times {{during the course of the}} game with the same player to move each time, and is the current position on the board or will occur after the player on turn makes his move, the player on move may claim a draw (to the arbiter). In such a case the draw is not automatic - a player must claim it if he wants the draw. When the position will occur for the third time after the player's intended next move, he writes the move on his scoresheet but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> move on the board and claims the draw. Article 9.2 states that a position is considered identical to another if the same player is on move, the same types of pieces of the same colors occupy the same squares, and the same moves are available to each player; in particular, each player has the same castling and en passant capturing rights. (A player may lose his right to castle; and an en passant capture is available only at the first opportunity.) If the claim is not made on the move in which the repetition occurs, the player forfeits the right to make the claim. Of course, the opportunity may present itself again.|$|E

For example, one division alone has erected almost 300,000 stakes, and one corps over 900,000." [...] Rommel emphasized that [...] "Erecting stakes alone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> obstacles complete; the stakes must be wired together and shells and mines attached to them... It {{will still be}} possible for tethered cattle to pasture underneath these mined obstacles." ...|$|E
500|$|Keynsham rose to fame {{during the}} late 1950s and early 1960s when it {{featured}} in a long-running series of advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for Horace Batchelor's Infra-draw betting system. To obtain the system, listeners had to write to Batchelor's Keynsham post office box, and Keynsham was always painstakingly spelled out on-air, with Batchelor famously intoning [...] "Keynsham– spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M– Keynsham, Bristol". This was done because the proper pronunciation of Keynsham– [...] "Cane-sham"– <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> spelling of Keynsham immediately obvious to the radio listener.|$|E

500|$|For years, the {{reaction}} 5.Bg3 {{was not well}} considered, because the retreat <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> most out of Black's provocative fourth move; as Tseitlin points out, [...] "the bishop {{is in danger of}} staying out of play for a long time". But later Lalic found that 5.Bg3 was [...] "just as effective" [...] as 5.Bd2. Black concentrates on capturing the e5-pawn while White tries to get an advantage from the weakening of the black kingside. After the typical moves 5...Bg7 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Nc3 Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 d6 Lalic considers the best try to be 10.c5!, sacrificing a pawn to weaken Black's control on the e5-square and expose the black king further. White has also tried to quickly open the h-file with 7.h4 Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 but after 9...g4! Black succeeds in keeping the file closed.|$|E
500|$|Kant {{questions}} the intelligibility {{of the concept}} of a necessary being. He considers examples of necessary propositions, such as [...] "a triangle has three angles", and rejects the transfer of this logic to the existence of God. First, he argues that such necessary propositions are necessarily true only if such a being exists: If a triangle exists, it must have three angles. The necessary proposition, he argues, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> existence of a triangle necessary. Thus he argues that, if the proposition [...] "X exists" [...] is posited, it would follow that, if X exists, it exists necessarily; {{this does not mean that}} X exists in reality. Second, he argues that contradictions arise only when the subject and predicate are maintained and, therefore, a judgement of non-existence cannot be a contradiction, as it denies the predicate.|$|E
500|$|By 1990 {{there were}} talks within the Red Electoral Alliance towards {{replacing}} Folkvord and Athar Ali as City Council representatives in Oslo {{to make way}} for more women in the top positions within the party. Folkvord was kept since he was a well-known face with the Norwegian media. By September 1990 Folkvord had demanded a police-run investigation against Conservative Party member Michael Tetzschner, accusing him of corruption and hidden money. These charges were included in a broadcast by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). Tetzschner replied to this broadcast stating that [...] "The news feature was completely dominated by false information. If the television provider <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> corrections that are necessary, we'll bring the case to the Complaints Board of the Broadcasting Corporation". Folkvord is one of the co-founders of the Oslo party cell, established in early 1991, of the Red Electoral Alliance. While media speculated that he would become the chapter's leader, he denied any such allegations, saying their existed [...] "better suited people" [...] then him for that post.|$|E
