60|$|All entirely bad {{works of}} art may be divided into those which, professing to be imaginative, bear no stamp of imagination, and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> false, and those which, professing to be {{representative}} of matter, miss of the representation and <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> nugatory.|$|R

5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by catechol-O-methyl transferase, and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> {{no longer able to}} act as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme activity or gene regulation.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare human neurodegenerative disease, {{is caused by a}} misfolded version of a protein called alpha-synuclein, and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> also classifiable as a prion disease. Several yeast proteins have also been identified as having prionogenic properties.|$|E

5|$|A {{defendant}} who is {{competent to}} stand trial <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> also competent to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights, but not necessarily competent enough to represent herself at trial {{in the face of}} a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation.|$|E
5|$|A hollow {{conducting}} body carries all its {{charge on}} its outer surface. The field <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> zero at all places inside the body.

5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E

5|$|As {{this tournament}} takes {{place during the}} same time period as the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs, NHL players {{generally}} only become available if their respective NHL team did not make the playoffs, or once they have been eliminated from Stanley Cup contention. It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> common for several NHL players to join the World Championships while the tournament is already in progress.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E
5|$|Barium {{hydroxide}} ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO2 in aqueous solutions and <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations.

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated. It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> very possible that there are additional Category5 hurricanes other than those listed, {{but they were not}} reported and therefore not recognized. However, the lack of Pacific Category5 hurricanes during the late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, is certain.|$|E
5|$|Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor has a {{large and}} {{apparently}} stable population. It <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by climate change in the long term. October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching {{as far as the}} United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Disease-modifying {{treatments}} only {{reduce the}} progression {{rate of the}} disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase.

Management of these deficits <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> very important.|$|E
5|$|Disregarding the dates, most historians agree {{upon the}} same {{sequence}} of events for {{this part of the}} Sacred War. The principal question <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> when that sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355–354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others give these dates as occurring one year later, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.|$|E
