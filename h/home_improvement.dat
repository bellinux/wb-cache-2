5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's <b>home</b> <b>improvement</b> stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide.

25|$|<b>Home</b> <b>Improvement</b> {{had been}} in the works between Tim Allen and the writing/producing team of Carmen Finestra, David McFadzean and Matt Williams since the summer of 1990. Originally, the project's {{proposed}} title was Hammer Time, both a play on the catchphrase made popular by artist MC Hammer {{and the name of the}} fictional fix-it show within the series, which was also called Hammer Time. By the time ABC committed to the project in early 1991, Allen and his team had already changed the title to <b>Home</b> <b>Improvement.</b> The show hosted by Tim Taylor in the shooting script for <b>Home</b> <b>Improvement</b> was still called Hammer Time when the first pilot with Frances Fisher was filmed in April 1991. The catalyst for the series' name change was to represent the aspect of fixing problems within the family and home life, as well as the use of mechanics and tools. Once the second phase of the pilot was produced, with all the actors that made the final cut into the series (including Patricia Richardson), Tim Taylor's Hammer Time became Tool Time.|$|E
