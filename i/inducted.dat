5|$|Although most wrestlers are <b>inducted</b> individually, tag {{teams have}} been <b>inducted</b> {{together}}. Ole and Gene Anderson were {{among the members of}} the inaugural class; they competed together for many years as storyline brothers. The Fargo brothers (Don, Jackie, and Sonny), who also wrestled in tag team matches together despite not being related in real life, are scheduled to be <b>inducted</b> together in 2009. George Scott, <b>inducted</b> in 2007, and his brother Sandy, <b>inducted</b> in 2008, are the only true relatives in the hall. Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson, who competed as the original Blond Bombers, were also <b>inducted</b> together in 2007.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{a maximum}} of four players can be <b>inducted</b> in one year but the {{greatest}} number of players ever <b>inducted</b> in a year was 23, in 1963. They were <b>inducted</b> because the Hall of Fame was trying to induct many pre-NHL era players. Sometimes noted as 1962 inductees, the pre-NHL era players were named at the 1962 Hall of Fame luncheon at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), but were <b>inducted</b> one year later, in 1963 at the CNE. 232 of the player inductees are Canadian-born, while 16 European-born players have been <b>inducted.</b> The NHL team with the most player inductees is the Toronto Maple Leafs (previously the Toronto St. Patricks and Toronto Arenas), with 60. Seventy-seven defencemen are in the Hall of Fame, more than any other current position, while only 36 goaltenders have been <b>inducted.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is the noise {{generation}} by ducted axial fans. The work is chiefly concerned with the impact of source models on the excitation of the <b>induct</b> acoustic modes, and their effect on the total <b>induct</b> transfer function defined as the ratio of the <b>induct</b> to the free-field sound power. In the models, the sources are represented by static point sources (monopoles and dipoles) distributed along the stator vanes. These sources are assumed to be fully uncorrelated for broadband noise. Following Tyler and Sofrin, the sources are correlated and linear phase-shifted for the generation of rotor-stator interaction tones. The results show that the choice between monopole (volume) and dipole (force) sources does have a significant influence on the level of the excited <b>induct</b> modes. Whereas monopoles equally excite modes of positive and negative azimuthal order, the mode pattern generated by dipoles features a strong asymmetry between positive and negative modes. Based on the ray theory, it is shown that <b>induct</b> modes whose phase angle of propagations are perpendicular to the dipole axis are not excited. For both single and uncorrelated sources, the total <b>induct</b> transfer function tends asymptotically to one at high frequencies, which means that the influence of the duct on the total sound radiation can be neglected at hig...|$|R

5|$|On April 14, 2012, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were <b>inducted</b> by Chris Rock {{into the}} Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Despite their contributions to the band's studio albums, Jack Sherman and Dave Navarro were neither <b>inducted</b> nor invited to the ceremony because the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame committee decided that only original members, current members or those who played on more than one album were able to be <b>inducted.</b>|$|E

5|$|Six inductees in this {{category}} were associated with teams that have been <b>inducted</b> to the Hall as units. Naismith organized The First Team, the group of players involved in the first-ever basketball game in 1891 and also <b>inducted</b> {{as part of the}} inaugural Class of 1959. Robert L.

Abe Saperstein, <b>inducted</b> in 1971, was the team's founder and owner. Kennedy, although best known for his time as NBA commissioner, had been the Globetrotters' public relations director in the 1950s.
