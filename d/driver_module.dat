40|$|A utility-type 20 -kHz {{ac power}} {{distribution}} system for the Space Station, employing resonant power-conversion techniques, is presented. The system converts raw dc voltage from photovoltaic cells or three-phase LF ac voltage from a solar dynamic generator into a regulated 20 -kHz ac voltage for distribution among various loads. The results of EASY 5 computer simulations of the local and global performance show that the system has fast response and good transient behavior. The ac bus voltage is effectively regulated using the phase-control scheme, which is demonstrated with both line and load variations. The feasibility of paralleling the driver-module outputs is illustrated with the <b>driver</b> <b>modules</b> synchronized and sharing a common feedback loop. An HF sinusoidal ac voltage is generated in the three-phase ac input case, when the <b>driver</b> <b>modules</b> are phased 120 deg away from one another and their outputs are connected in series...|$|R
50|$|The unit booted via a 2.2 linux kernel in flash {{which used}} DHCP and SSDP to {{discover}} an NFS server {{from which it}} loaded a new kernel. The second kernel then mounted a root filesystem over NFS containing a small set of standard POSIX tools and an application for selecting and playing music over the network, which was served using HTTP by the Audio Receiver Manager software running on a Windows PC. Although the music player and the Audio Receiver Manager and Broadcom HomePNA kernel <b>driver</b> <b>module</b> were proprietary software, the kernel and other tools were open source. The two-step kernel boot process allowed rapid development of changes to the kernel allowing units to run new kernels by simply power cycling them; the use of standard protocols meant a variety of replacement software components could be developed independently.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{combining}} production efficiency with flexible product offers in housing design is well known. The platform concept is applied in housing to support design and production with predefined solutions. Modularization {{can be useful}} to meet both client demands on flexibility and production requirements on standardisation. To identify the <b>module</b> <b>drivers</b> in housing, ten projects at one off-site housing company were analysed. Furthermore, the cycle time for the modules was recorded. Client, design, purchasing, production and suppliers have different <b>module</b> <b>drivers.</b> When <b>module</b> <b>drivers</b> concur, <b>modules</b> are identified by; identifying clear and few interfaces, {{the availability of a}} supplier, and the cycle time for the design and production of the module in relation to the production pace. The results from the case study further show that fixed geometry on modules is a less successful concept than parameterised modules in housing. The ability to outsource technical solutions increased, when the <b>module</b> <b>drivers</b> were combined with a long term relationship with the supplier. Variant modules were successfully applied in the studied company to respond to client demands. Further research is needed on how to configure generic modules. Godkänd; 2013; 20130930 (gusjan...|$|R
