40|$|International audienceGeneral {{aspects of}} the {{production}} and use of carotenoids as colourants and supplements were discussed in Chapter 4. For several decades, these carotenoids have been produced commercially by chemical synthesis or as plant <b>extracts</b> or <b>oleoresins,</b> e. g. of tomato and red pepper. Some unicellular green algae, under appropriate conditions, become red due to the accumulation of high concentrations of ‘secondary’ carotenoids. Two examples, Dunaliella spp. and Haematococcus pluvialis, are cultured extensively as sources of β-carotene (3) and (3 S, 3 ′S) -astaxanthin (406), respectively. Non-photosynthetic microorganisms, i. e. bacteria, yeasts and moulds, may also be strongly pigmented by carotenoids, so commercial production by these organisms is an attractive prospect. Penetration into the food industry by fermentation-derived ingredients is increasing year after year, examples being thickening or gelling agents (xanthan, curdlan, gellan), flavour enhancers (yeast hydrolysate, monosodium glutamate), flavour compounds (γ-decalactone, diacetyl, methyl ketones), and acidulants (lactic acid, citric acid). Fermentation processes for pigment production on a commercial scale were developed later but some are now in use in the food industry, such as production of β-carotene from the fungus Blakeslea trispora, in Europe, and the non-carotenoid heterocyclic pigments from Monascus, in Asia [1 – 3].

These oxidation products are found in many commonly-consumed foods and are formed during their manufacture and/or processing. Concern about oxysterols consumption arises from the potential cytotoxic, mutagenic, atherogenic, and possibly carcinogenic effects of some oxysterols. Eggs and egg-derived products are the main dietary sources of oxysterols. Thermally-processed milk and milk-derived products are another source of oxysterols in our diet. Foods fried in vegetable/animal oil, such as meats and French-fried potatoes, are major sources of oxysterols in the Western diet. Efforts to prevent or to reduce cholesterol oxidation are directed to the use of antioxidants of either synthetic or natural origin. Antioxidants are not only able to inhibit triglyceride oxidation, some of them can also inhibit cholesterol oxidation. Among synthetic antioxidants 2, 6 -di-tertiarybutyl- 4 -methylphenol (BHT), and tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) can efficiently inhibit the thermal-induced oxidation of cholesterol.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} to study {{the changes in the}} content and composition of chlorophylls and carotenoids in ground thyme leaves as a function of supercritical carbon dioxide and sub-critical propane extraction. the results indicated that the maximum oleoresin yield could be obtained with supercritical carbon dioxide at 400 bar and 35 or 55 °C and sub-critical propane at 50 bar. Pigment solvating capacity of supercritical carbon dioxide increased with the increase of extraction pressure. Substantial variation was noticed in pigment composition between raw material, oleoresin and residues (powders after extraction). Chlorophyll b, chlorophyll a and the Mg-free derivatives were the dominant pigments in the raw material with other derivatives being minor constituents. After extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide at 35 °C and pressures higher than 200 bar, epimerisation and oxidation of chlorophylls lead to marked accumulation of artefacts in the residues. The content of oxidized chlorophylls was increased proportionally to the increase of the extraction pressure. The brownish green coloured-oleoresins contained only pheophytins indicating that rapid substitution of Mg with hydrogen atoms on the molecules takes place during extraction of such pigment by supercritical carbon dioxide and sub-critical propane. The marked conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytins was found in <b>oleoresin</b> <b>extracted</b> by supercritical fluid extraction at 55 °C and 100 bar...|$|R
40|$|Turmeric flavour is {{important}} in Asian cuisine; however, the production of turmeric-based ingredient with the current method of extraction of turmeric oleoresin is very laborious, time consuming and consumes large amount of solvent, coupled with limited solubility in aqueous solution, which limits its application to food system. The extract was optimised by determining the content of three marker curcuminoid compounds, namely, curcumin (C), demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC). The optimised extraction parameters for ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) with aqueous extraction solvent for curcuminoids were amplitude of 100, particle size of 0. 30 – 0. 60 mm, extraction time of 20 min, extraction solvent volume of 10 mL and extraction temperature of 60 °C. The applications showed remarkable improvements in terms of reduced extraction time, solvent consumption, extraction yield {{and the quality of}} <b>extracts.</b> The turmeric <b>oleoresin</b> was successfully solubilised in aqueous solution by forming inclusion complex with methyl-ß-cyclodextrin (Mß-CD). Phase solubility studies used curcumin as a marker compounds to represent turmeric oleoresin. In the presence of Mß-CD, the curcumin was enhanced. Result from characterisation of inclusion complexes with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry indicates that all the mixing methods were found to be suitable for encapsulation. However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows a drastic change in particle sizes, indicating a formation of a new solid phase in kneading method, implying it as the best mixing method...|$|R
40|$|Vector borne {{diseases}} {{are the major}} public health problems in developing countries particularly in tropics. Essential oils from plants can provide the safe and biodegradable alternatives to synthetic repellents, but plant-based repellent formulations available in the market are not effective. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate mosquito repellent activities of Sweet Basil (Ocimum basilicum), Neem (Azadirachta indica) and Lemon Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) extracts. Different concentrations of the extracts were tested for mosquito repellency on rabbit skin as the host of Aedes aegypti. Laboratory reared starved females were used for the tests and data collection was done by observational parameters based on frequency of mosquito landing and blood engorgement. Synergised Crude <b>oleoresin</b> <b>extract</b> of Pyrethrum and Ballet mosquito repellent® were included as positive test controls and Vaseline pure petroleum jelly® as a negative test control. The results showed that synergised Pyrethrum oleoresin showed complete protection at 0. 1 % as compared to Lemon Eucalyptus oil and Sweet Basil oil at 2 % and 3 % respectively (p< 0. 05). Neem oil and Ballet did not provide complete protection. The mean percent repellency of 5 % Neem oil was 84. 21 and that of Ballet was 66. 84 (p< 0. 05). Sweet basil and Lemon Eucalyptus oils can be alternative to Pyrethrum as natural mosquito repellents from plant origin...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{sustainable}} extractive {{industries in}} otherwise intact tropical forest regions requires a sound {{understanding of the}} production potential of key resource populations. The <b>oleoresin</b> <b>extracted</b> from Copaifera trees is an economically important non-timber forest product harvested throughout the lowland Amazon basin. We studied oleoresin extraction from four species of Copaifera trees with known harvest histories within two contiguous extractive reserves in western Brazilian Amazonia. We conducted a large-scale experimental harvest of 179 previously unharvested Copaifera trees, in both seasonally flooded (várzea) and adjacent unflooded (terra firme) forests. The likelihood of trees yielding any oleoresin was principally determined by their species identity: C. multijuga was the only species to regularly yield oleoresin (70 % of trees). Yield volumes varied both amongst species and forest types: C. multijuga (restricted to terra firme forest) had the highest mean yield of 505 ml, whilst C. guyanensis produced higher volumes of oleoresin in várzea (139 ml) than terra firme (15 ml) forest. Intraspecific differences were driven mainly by tree size. To assess extraction sustainability, we reharvested a sample of C. multijuga trees and compared the oleoresin production of 24 conspecific trees that had been initially harvested one year previously with that of 17 trees initially harvested three years previously. Reharvested trees produced just 35 % of the oleoresin volume compared to that when originally drilled, but this response was not affected by the time interval between consecutive harvests. We demonstrate that, within a population of Copaifera, both morphological and environmental factors restrict total productivity; consideration of these factors should inform sustainable management practises. We additionally raise methodological considerations that may improve the comparability of studies...|$|R

The antioxidant activity of essential oil and oleoresins was evaluated against linseed oil system at 200 ppm concentration by peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid value, ferric thiocyanate, ferrous ion chelating activity, and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging methods. The essential oil and ethyl acetate oleoresin {{were found to}} be better than synthetic antioxidants. The total phenol contents (gallic acid equivalents, mg GAE per g) in black cumin essential oil, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and n-hexane oleoresinswere calculated as 11. 47 ± 0. 05, 10. 88 ± 0. 9, 9. 68 ± 0. 06, and 8. 33 ± 0. 01, respectively, by Folin-Ciocalteaumethod. The essential oil showed up to 90 %zone inhibition against Fusarium moniliforme in inverted petri plate method. Using agar well diffusion method for evaluating antibacterial activity, the essential oil was found to be highly effective against Gram-positive bacteria. Fil: Singh, Sunita.

Influence of the working parameters: temperature, time, pressure, solid to liquid phase ratio, density, type of solvents, and particle size of raw material on the yield of extract and content of capsaicinoids, colour compounds and volatiles was studied. Modelling of the experimental phase data by application of mathematical methods was performed. Re-utilization of seed and stalk from red hot pepper in form of extracts for development of new formulations as edible films, biopesticides and nanoemulsions was studied, also. Paprika (Capsicum annuum L.), ki je v svetu široko razširjen zelenjavni pridelek, predstavlja odličen vir hranilnih in biološko aktivnih spojin. Karotenoidi in kapsaicinodi iz rdeče pekoče paprike ter njihovi oljni oleoresini so postali zanimivi zlasti v živilski in farmacevtski industriji. V doktorski disertaciji smo raziskovali pridobivanje oleoresinov iz celotnega ploda pekoče paprike t. j. pericarpa, posteljice, semena in peclja. Svež material smo posušili nato smo ločili strukture med seboj ter jim določili fizikalno-kemijske lastnosti. Materialu smo določili tudi nekatere bioaktivne snovi kot so: kapsaicionidi in karotenoidi ter druge hlapne snovi. V drugem delu doktorske disertacije smo se osredotočili na določitev optimalnih parametrov za izolacijo bioaktivnih kapsaicionidov ter drugih hlapnih snovi s pomočjo superkritične ekstrakcije ter klasične ekstrakcije z organskimi topili.
