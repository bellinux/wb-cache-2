50|$|The Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) {{between the}} United States of America and The Cayman Islands which {{was signed in}} London, United Kingdom on 29 November 2013. Page 1 - Clause 2 of the <b>FATCA</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E
50|$|A legal {{challenge}} against {{the constitutionality of}} FATCA, its IGA's, and FBAR reporting requirements was filed in a federal district court in Ohio on July 14, 2015 (see below). The case is Crawford v. U.S. Department of Treasury. Arguments for an injunction against the <b>FATCA</b> Intergovernmental <b>agreements</b> were held on Sept 4, 2015.|$|R
50|$|This {{means that}} either {{jurisdiction}} may negotiate and determine its own reportable accounts in its agreement. For example, the United States, with its citizenship-based taxation, has established in its <b>FATCA</b> Intergovernmental <b>Agreements</b> that, accounts held by US citizens and US Persons for Tax purposes {{in the other}} country's jurisdiction need to be reported via FATCA.|$|R
50|$|The Cayman Islands {{have worked}} to promote {{governance}} and regulation and have over the years collaborated with governments in the major economies to introduce tax information <b>agreements</b> such as <b>FATCA</b> and co-operation <b>agreements</b> with securities regulators, aimed at promoting a transparent legal regime for global business.|$|R
50|$|Preceding the 2014 <b>FATCA</b> <b>agreement</b> is {{one which}} was entered into on January 30, 1987 between the United States of America and Saint Lucia {{according}} to Paragraph 2 of the Model 1 agreement, {{the purpose of}} which was to exchange Tax Information.|$|E
50|$|The <b>FATCA</b> <b>agreement</b> is an {{international}} agreement signed between Canada and the United States that allows {{the implementation of the}} Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (an Act of the U.S. Congress) in Canada. It is one of 30 intergovernmental agreements the US has concluded with other countries to implement the FATCA.|$|E
5000|$|The Letter of Entrustment dated July 14, 2010 was {{originally}} {{provided to the}} Government of the British Virgin Islands and authorized the Govt of the BVI [...] "to negotiate and conclude Agreements relating to taxation that provide for exchange of information on tax matters to the OECD standard" [...] (Paragraph 2 of the <b>FATCA</b> <b>Agreement).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) is an {{information}} {{standard for the}} automatic exchange of tax and financial information on a global level, which the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed in 2014. Its purpose is to combat tax evasion. The idea {{was based on the}} USA Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (<b>FATCA)</b> implementation <b>agreements</b> and its legal basis is the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. As of 2016, 83 countries had signed an agreement to implement it. First reporting is planned September 2017. The CRS has been criticised for leaving too many loopholes open, for how developing countries were not considered and involved and that non-reciprocity agreements were catering to tax havens.|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{provisions}} of the Tax Administration Act, No 28 of 2011 (TAA), as well as the introduction of Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) between South Africa and other nations around the world, the issues around information exchange and the confidentiality thereof has become pertinent. Article 26 of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital provides a standard for information exchange and also highlights the use of automatic exchange of information as being considered a standard form of information exchange. The recent case of Commissioner of South Africa v Werner Van Kets dealt with the definition of a taxpayer as well as information exchange. In addition, this case ruled on the hierarchy of domestic laws and international agreements. This case has led {{to the question of whether}} or not a third party is considered a taxpayer in terms of international tax agreements and raises question regarding the taxpayer's rights to confidentiality relating to information exchanged. In light of new international best practice, domestic legislation and case law, various domestic laws of South Africa were reviewed to determine whether the domestic law allows for the international exchange of information and whether or not the confidentiality clauses therein are contradictory to one another. When reviewing the manner in which South Africa allows for the exchange of information, in {{light of the}} standard Article 26, it was found that the TIEAs are aligned with both the TAA and Article 26 in terms of the exchange of information that is relevant to domestic laws. It would however appear that South Africa has not yet adopted the use of automatic exchange of information - apart from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (<b>FATCA)</b> Inter-Governmental <b>Agreement</b> (IGA) that was signed with the USA. South Africa has only entered into bilateral agreements which allow for the exchange of information on request and The TAA is silent on automatic exchange, despite the financial benefit of increased annual taxation revenue that South Africa could gain through having automatic exchange agreements in place...|$|R
