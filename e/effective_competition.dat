5|$|Under an Act of Parliament of 1874, the South Yorkshire {{company was}} {{absorbed into the}} Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Despite the railway competition, traffic levels {{remained}} healthy, with the waterways carrying a total of 982,000 tons in 1878, {{but there was a}} growing dissatisfaction with the situation, particularly the high tolls compared to the railways, and the refusal to allow steam haulage, which had been in use on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation for over 50 years. In an attempt to improve the situation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Ltd was formed in 1888, with the intention of buying back the canals from the railway company, and upgrading them to offer <b>effective</b> <b>competition</b> to the railways. As a result of their efforts, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Co was created by an Act of Parliament dated 26 August 1889, with powers to raise £1.5 million to purchase and improve four canals. These were the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. The intention was to upgrade the Don and the Stainforth and Keadby to take 300 or 400 ton barges, to investigate the use of compartment boats, and to build a new port facility at Keadby, where coal could be trans-shipped to seagoing vessels. Negotiations with the railway company were long and bitter, and the Navigation company only managed to raise £625,000 of the £1.14 million purchase price, with the result that although ownership of the waterways was transferred to them, the railway company still nominated five of the ten directors, and thus retained significant control.|$|E

25|$|The scrum was {{traditionally}} used as {{a mechanism}} where the two teams compete for possession of the football; however this has since changed {{with the introduction of}} fair, but uncontested scrums, where the ball is fed into the second row, instead of the first, all but eliminating an <b>effective</b> <b>competition</b> for the ball. Because of these changes the scrum serves to simply remove the forwards from the play for a period, thus creating more space for the backs to attack the depleted defensive line. This is intended to give advantage to the side that is awarded the scrum. It is very rare (but not completely unknown) for a team to win possession of the ball, despite not having the feed, though in such situations the referee may restart the scrum.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, the tit-for-tat {{strategy}} has been of beneficial use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict. Research has indicated that when individuals {{who have been in}} competition {{for a period of time}} no longer trust one another, the most <b>effective</b> <b>competition</b> reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy. Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation, a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members. Therefore, if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation, then cooperation ensues. On the other hand, if the other party competes, then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well. Ultimately, each action by the other member is countered with a matching response, competition with competition and cooperation with cooperation.|$|E

500|$|In September 1949, Nixon hired Chotiner as {{campaign}} manager for his upcoming 1950 run for the United States Senate. Helen Gahagan Douglas defeated Manchester Boddy for the Democratic nomination in a primary that badly splintered the Democratic Party, while Nixon had little <b>effective</b> <b>competition</b> for the Republican slot. Chotiner realized that Nixon could not beat Douglas by advocating more social welfare programs, so he advised his candidate to attack Douglas {{on the issue of}} communism, seen as a Democratic vulnerability. Echoing a theme used by Boddy in the primary, Chotiner linked Representative Douglas with leftist Congressman Vito Marcantonio of the socialist American Labor Party, listing the matters in which the two had voted the same way in a leaflet printed on pink paper—the [...] "Pink Sheet"—and popularizing a label for Douglas which had been first coined by Boddy—the [...] "Pink Lady". However, the Northern California campaign chairman for Nixon, John Dinkenspiel, and his paid assistant, Harvey Hancock, declined to use the Pink Sheet in their territory. With the Korean War raging, Douglas also tried to depict Nixon as soft on communism, stating this in her first speech of the general election campaign, but that strategy was not successful, and Chotiner noted, [...] "She made the fatal mistake of attacking our strength instead of sticking to attacking our weakness." ...|$|E

40|$|A key {{question}} of theoretical ecology is which properties of ecosystems favour their stability and help maintaining biodiversity. This qu estion recently reconsid- ered mutualistic systems, generating intense controversy {{about the role}} of mutu- alistic interactions and their network architecture. Here we show analytically and verify with simulations that reducing the <b>effective</b> intersp ecific <b>competition</b> and the propagation of perturbations positively influences struct ural stability against envi- ronmental perturbations, enhancing persistence. Notewor thy, mutualism reduces the <b>effective</b> interspecific <b>competition</b> only when the direct interspecific competition is weaker than a critical value. This critical competition i s in almost all cases larger in pollinator networks than in random networks with the same connectance. Highly connected mutualistic networks reduce the propagation of e nvironmental perturba- tions, a mechanism reminiscent of MacArthur???s proposal tha t ecosystem complexity enhances stability.

2500|$|Competition law {{has been}} {{perceived}} as {{an essential part of}} the [...] "social market economy" [...] since the Treaty of Rome. Its main aims are to prevent monopolies abusing a dominant position, by prohibiting exploitative practices and potentially by breaking them up, to prevent anti-competitive mergers and takeovers occurring, and to criminalise cartels or collusive practices by independent firms. According to the Court of Justice, and the dominant view, the law aims to protect [...] "an <b>effective</b> <b>competition</b> structure" [...] to enhance consumer and social welfare, [...] "aiming at full employment and social progress, and a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment". The scope of European competition law is limited in three main ways: first, by ensuring that only [...] "undertakings" [...] are regulated. This will include any profit-making business, but the Court of Justice suggests it is limited to entities [...] "engaged in an economic activity". The [...] "economic" [...] criterion suggests that, in general, organisations based on a principle of solidarity and not for profit will be exempt from competition law. Employees and trade unions are completely outside the scope of competition law, on a long-standing consensus view, because labour is not a commodity and the sellers of labour have inherently unequal bargaining power compared to business and employers. Second, trade between member states must be affected to at least an [...] "appreciable" [...] degree. Third, the law promotes fair competition, rather than unfair [...] "cut-throat" [...] competition. For example, in Meca Medina and Majcen v Commission the Court of Justice held that rules of the International Olympic Committee and the International Swimming Federation which prohibited drugs were outside the scope of competition law altogether. Although drugs could increase competitiveness, the [...] "integrity and objectivity of competitive sport" [...] was more important. In this way, the central task of competition law is to regulate the unequal bargaining power of private, profit-making businesses, rather than to affect the delivery of public services, collective action by social groups, or sound regulation of the economy.|$|E
6000|$|Here {{is found}} the germ of the idea, {{which has been}} elaborately [...] worked out by Mr. Cairnes(175) in his theory of non-competing [...] groups of laborers: “What we find, in effect, is not a whole [...] {{population}} competing indiscriminately for all occupations, but a [...] series of industrial layers superposed on one another, within each [...] of which the various candidates for employment possess a real and [...] effective power of selection, while those occupying the several [...] strata are, for all purposes of <b>effective</b> <b>competition,</b> practically [...] isolated from each other.” (Mr. Mill certainly understood this [...] fully, and stated it clearly again in Book III, Chap.

6000|$|The {{discussion}} by Mr. Cairnes {{on the question}} of wages as affected [...] by the tariff is such that I have quoted it as fully as possible: [...] “The position taken in the United States is that protection is [...] only needed and only asked for where American industry is placed [...] under a disadvantage, as compared with the industry of foreign [...] countries.... The rates of wages measured in money are higher in [...] the United States than in Europe, and, therefore, it is argued, [...] the cost of producing commodities is higher.... The high rates of [...] wages in the United States are not peculiar to any branch of [...] industry, but are universal throughout its whole range. If, [...] therefore, a high rate of wages proves a high cost of production, [...] and a high cost of production proves a need of protection, it [...] follows that the farmers of Illinois and the cotton-planters of [...] the Southern States stand in as much need of fostering legislation [...] as the cotton-spinners of New England or the iron-masters of [...] Pennsylvania! A criterion which leads to such results must, I [...] think, be regarded as sufficiently condemned. The fallacy is, in [...] truth, ... that all industries are not in each country equally [...] favored or disfavored by nature, and have not, therefore, equal [...] need of this protecting care. If American protectionists are not [...] prepared to demand protective duties in favor of the Illinois [...] farmer against the competition of his English rival, they are [...] bound to admit either that a high cost of production is not [...] incompatible with <b>effective</b> <b>competition,</b> or else that a high rate [...] of wages does not prove a high cost of production; and if this is [...] not so in Illinois, then I wish to know why the case should be [...] different in Pennsylvania or in New England. If a high rate of [...] wages in the first of these States be consistent with a low cost [...] of production, why may not a high rate of wages in Pennsylvania be [...] consistent with a low cost of producing coal and iron? ...|$|E
