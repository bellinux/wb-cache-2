50|$|In 1909, Shichizaemon Yuasa {{established}} Yuasa Iron Works {{to modernize}} the family business, founded in 1666 as a charcoal trading business. Yuasa Iron Works began producing storage batteries in 1915, and three years later Yuasa Storage Battery Co., Ltd was established. Soon after, Yuasa Storage Battery Co., Ltd began making Japan's first automotive batteries. In 1925, Yuasa began making dry cells, and in 1941 they began making alkaline cells.

An environmental study revealed a high concentration of manganese dust at the main working areas, far exceeding the accepted MAC. The manganese level in blood was almost within the normal range.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{non-destructive}} {{determination of the}} state-of-charge of zinc- and magnesium-manganese dioxide <b>dry</b> <b>batteries</b> is examined experimentally {{from the viewpoint of}} internal impedance and open-circuit voltage at equilibrium. It is shown that the impedance is mainly charge-transfer controlled at relatively high states-of-charge and progressively changes over to diffusion control as the state-of-charge decreases in the case of zinc-manganese dioxide <b>dry</b> <b>batteries.</b> On the other hand, the impedance is mainly diffusion controlled for undischarged batteries but becomes charge-transfer controlled as soon as there is some discharge in the case of magnesium-manganese dioxide batteries. It is concluded that the determination of state-of-charge is not possible for both types of batteries by the measurement of impedance parameters due to film-induced fluctuations of these parameters. The measurement of open-circuit voltage at equilibrium {{can be used as a}} state-of-charge indicator for Zn-MnO 2 batteries but not for Mg-MnO 2 batteries...|$|R

50|$|Although not {{strictly}} a pentagrid (in {{that it has}} more than five grids), the octode (eight-electrode) nevertheless operates on the pentagrid principle. It resulted simply from the addition of an extra screen grid to the UK version of the pentagrid heptode. This was done mainly to improve the antenna/oscillator separation and to reduce the power consumption for use in radio sets operated by <b>dry</b> <b>batteries</b> that were becoming increasingly popular.|$|R
50|$|The {{accumulator}} {{is defined}} as any equipment used for the intermediate storage of electrical energy supplied by the solar generator or by the charging unit.
