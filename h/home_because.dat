5|$|He {{was arrested}} in 2002 for interfering with police {{investigating}} a code violation at a restaurant he owned; the charges were eventually dropped. After settling down in Newport Beach, California, the police appeared over 70 times at his <b>home</b> <b>because</b> of loud parties. In early 2003, Rodman {{was arrested and charged}} with domestic violence at his home in Newport Beach for allegedly assaulting his then-fiancee.|$|E
5|$|Louise {{spent much}} of her time at Kent House, and she {{frequently}} visited Scotland with her husband. Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray, Argyll's ancestral <b>home,</b> <b>because</b> the couple were economising. When Queen Victoria had visited the house before Lorne became Duke of Argyll, there were seventy servants and seventy-four dogs. By the time of Edward VII's accession, there were four servants and two dogs.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, 1968, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, {{in support}} of the black {{sanitary}} public works employees, who were represented by AFSCME Local 1733. The workers had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent <b>home</b> <b>because</b> of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.|$|E

5|$|To {{force the}} Ojibwa to comply, the {{subagent}} Watrous {{announced he would}} pay future annuities only at Sandy Lake, Minnesota instead of La Pointe, {{where they had been}} paid previously. This change resulted in the Sandy Lake Tragedy, when hundreds of Ojibwas starved or died of exposure in Minnesota and on the journey <b>home</b> <b>because</b> the promised annuity supplies were late, contaminated or inadequate.|$|E
5|$|As {{with earlier}} campaigns, {{recruiting}} enough men was a problem. Jefferson {{called for the}} western counties of Virginia to provide militia manpower for Clark's campaign, but county officials protested {{that they could not}} spare the men. Militiamen did not want to set out on a lengthy expedition—they would be gone for six months to a year—while their families and homes were threatened by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at <b>home.</b> <b>Because</b> of this resistance, Jefferson called for volunteers rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E
5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back <b>home</b> <b>because</b> his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E

Ah Jong and Li flee, and while Ah Jong's wounds are mended, they find themselves bonding and becoming friends. Ah Jong tells Li that should anything happen to him, Li should have Ah Jong's eyes donated for Jennie's surgery or use Ah Jong's money to fly her overseas to have her surgery performed by more experienced doctors.|$|E
5|$|Mark Mangini {{served as}} The Final Frontiers sound designer; he had {{previously}} worked on The Voyage <b>Home.</b> <b>Because</b> Mangini was concerned about creating continuity within Star Treks sounds, he decided to reuse some effects rather than create new and different-sounding ones— as such, the Bird of Prey's cloak effect, beaming sounds, and the Enterprise engines sound similar to past movies. Mangini collaborated with Shatner to work out how the completely new effects would sound. For Sybok's mind melds, Shatner wanted the sounds of beating hearts and breathing.|$|E
5|$|The Home {{opened its}} doors in 1923. It was built as a diocesan {{memorial}} to the Coloured men who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country. It was run by the Anglican Nuns, the Order of St Margaret, East Grinstead who remained in charge until 1978 when they left South Africa in protest against apartheid. The Main Block, Boys' House and Priests' House were designed by the diocesan architect F.L.H. Flemming. The Church successfully opposed removal of the <b>Home</b> <b>because</b> the property was on farm land and {{not part of a}} proclaimed township.|$|E

5|$|The second {{official}} residence for the state's governor {{was built in}} the center of Indianapolis where the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument now stands. It was designed by Alexander Ralston, who also laid out most of the city. The mansion cost $6,500 and was completed in 1827 during the term of Governor James B. Ray. Ray's wife refused to live in the <b>home</b> <b>because</b> of its lack of privacy; it was never used by a governor. It was inhabited by Indiana Chief Justice Isaac Blackford from around 1830 until the 1850s. It was demolished in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris' family and in a veterans' hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa's family for keeping him in their <b>home</b> <b>because</b> of shame about his mental problems, and {{suggested}} that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played piano in the family's basement or for other residents at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father. Marmarosa {{died of a heart attack}} on September 17, 2002, in a veterans' hospital in Pittsburgh. He was survived by his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|The {{struggle}} for power at the court had unfortunate consequences for both foreign affairs and for internal administration. All parties tried to satisfy the army {{in order to avoid}} interference in court affairs by leading commanders, and the military was given a free hand to pursue ever larger conquests. As long as the Gorkhas were invading disunited hill states, this policy—or lack of policy—was adequate. Inevitably, continued aggression led Nepal into disastrous collisions with the Chinese and then with the British. At <b>home,</b> <b>because</b> power struggles centered on control of the king, there was little progress in sorting out procedures for sharing power or expanding representative institutions. A consultative body of nobles, a royal court called the Assembly of Lords (Bharadari Sabha), was in place after 1770 and it had substantial involvement in major policy issues. The assembly consisted of high government officials and leading courtiers, all heads of important Gorkha families. In the intense atmosphere surrounding the monarch, however, the Assembly of Lords broke into factions that fought for access to the prime minister or regent, and alliances developed around patron/client relationships.|$|E

5|$|Although Democratic-Republicans held {{a narrow}} {{majority}} in the Senate, the Federalist senators were both experienced and devoted their cause. Breckinridge acted as floor leader for the Democratic-Republicans and newly elected president, Thomas Jefferson. His proposed repeal of the Federalist-supported Judicial Act of 1801, which had {{increased the number of}} federal courts and judges, was particularly controversial. On January 4, 1802, he presented caseload data to argue that the new courts and judges were unnecessary. Federalist leader Gouverneur Morris countered that the proposal was unconstitutional; once established, courts were inviolate, he maintained. On January 20, Federalist Jonathan Dayton moved to return the bill to a committee to consider amendments. South Carolina's John E. Colhoun, a Democratic-Republican, voted with the Federalists, and the result was a 15–15 tie. Empowered to break the tie, Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, voted with the Federalists. The five-man committee consisted of three Federalists, enough to prevent the bill's return to the floor, but when Vermont Senator Stephen R. Bradley, who had traveled <b>home</b> <b>because</b> of a family illness, returned to the chamber, the Democratic-Republicans regained a majority and introduced a successful discharge petition. In one last attempt to derail the legislation in debate, Federalists argued that the judiciary would strike down the repeal as unconstitutional; Breckinridge denied the notion that the courts had the power to invalidate an act of Congress. On February 3, the Senate repealed the act by a vote of 16–15, with the House concurring a month later.|$|E
