5|$|Buffy's former nemesis is Spike (James Marsters), a vampire. In {{the fourth}} season The Initiative, a secret {{military}} organization whose {{mission is to}} evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he {{had fallen in love}} with Buffy. She initially rejected him, but after and just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 18th century, the {{composer}} was normally {{an employee of}} an aristocrat, and the chamber music he or she composed was <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of aristocratic players and listeners. Haydn, for example, was an employee of Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy, a music lover and amateur baryton player, for whom Haydn wrote many of his string trios. Mozart wrote three string quartets for the King of Prussia, Frederick William II, a cellist. Many of Beethoven's quartets were first performed with patron Count Andrey Razumovsky on second violin. Boccherini composed for the king of Spain.|$|E
25|$|Havelock Ellis, in Studies in the Psychology of Sex, {{argued that}} there is no clear {{distinction}} between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.|$|E

25|$|The {{players are}} cast as slaves who {{are forced to}} fight in a fantasy gladiator arena, which is reason for the game title. The slaves are from a village where people are bred solely to be gladiators and fight <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of demon types to win their freedom. The players have the help of Balfus, a Spirit Mentor, and need to {{overcome}} the challenges and defeat the guardians of each arena. Spirit Mentors guide gladiators through the arena and Balfus is revealed to have done so for previous dead gladiators before the player. Balfus remains the source of drama since the protagonists are silent throughout {{the game and the}} antagonists do not go beyond taunting them.|$|E

The second novel of this series, Therese and Pierrette and the Little Hanging Angel (Thérèse et Pierrette à l'école des Saints-Anges, 1980), {{was one of the}} novels chosen for inclusion in the French version of Canada Reads, Le combat des livres, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2005, where it was championed by union activist Monique Simard.|$|E

The temple’s benefactor preferred this site in the city centre to those that she owned in the outskirts: the site of the circus or the site where the Temple of Celeste was later built. Gabinia’s family, one of the richest in Dougga, was well placed within Carthage’s notables and maintained its power at Dougga, even during the reduction of the local aristocracy in the 3rd century. The terms of Gabinia’s will provide evidence of her concern that the family should endure - the annual banquet would keep alive the memory of the family’s generosity and emphasise its sociability, while the circus would provide <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of the most humble of the city’s inhabitants.|$|E

25|$|In 1929 Pat Collins, {{the owner}} of Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach, {{attended}} the Paris Colonial Exposition where the largest attraction was a scenic railway. The Scenic Railway had been designed by German Herr Erich Heidrich of Hamburg especially for the Exposition (Heidrich was a scenic railway designer, having the previous year designed and built Montaña Suiza at a Spanish amusement park), and was operated at the Exposition by showman Hugo Hans. At {{the close of the}} Exposition, Pat Collins bought the ride <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pleasure</b> Beach; and he along with Harry and Edward Wadbrook shipped the components to England. They arrived in February 1932 and a team of German workmen began constructing the ride on the sands of the Pleasure Beach site. The ride opened to visitors in April 1932.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the {{hurricane}}'s arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, if not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts {{take it as a}} sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

She said FIG seized {{this opportunity to}} change the relationship between improvisers and female audiences. Using their [...] "skills of social and technical virtuosity", FIG improvised around issues important to women, and thereby [...] "drew women into their music who might not otherwise be concerned {{with the concept of}} free improvisation." [...] Smith explained that even women not familiar with the technicalities of free improvisation still related to a group of women on stage [...] "foreground their bodies and their sounds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of other woman".|$|E

Her roles were almost always chorus girls, secretaries, or models; occupations where [...] "the woman is on show, there <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of men." [...] Film scholar Thomas Harris, who {{analyzed}} Monroe's public image in 1957, wrote that her working class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually available, [...] "the ideal playmate", in contrast to her contemporary, Grace Kelly, who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class background {{came to be seen}} as a sophisticated actress, unattainable for the majority of male viewers.|$|E
500|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education [...] with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be [...] "companions" [...] to their husbands rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the Rights of Woman respond vitriolically to conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and educational philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who wanted to deny women an education. (Rousseau famously argues in [...] (1762) that women should be educated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pleasure</b> of men.) ...|$|E
