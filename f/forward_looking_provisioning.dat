The paper “Fair Value Accounting and Procyclicality: Mitigating Regulatory and Accounting Policy Differences through Regulatory Structure Reforms and Enforced Self Regulation” illustrates how the implementation of accounting standards and policies, in certain instances, have contrasted with Basel Committee initiatives aimed at mitigating procyclicality and facilitating <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> <b>provisioning.</b> The paper also highlights how and why {{differences between}} regulatory and accounting policies could (and should) be mitigated. This paper focuses on how recent regulatory reforms – with particular reference to the Dodd Frank Act, impact fair value measurements. Other potential implications for accounting measurements and valuation, will also be considered. Given the tendencies for discrepancies to arise between regulatory and accounting policies, and owing to discrepancies between Basel III and the Dodd Frank Act, would a more imposing and commanding role for international standards not serve as a powerful weapon in harmonizing Basel III and Dodd Frank – whilst mitigating regulatory and accounting policy differences?...|$|E
40|$|In {{what ways}} can {{changes to the}} {{structure}} of regulation (as well as other regulatory reforms) mitigate the effects of policies which trigger financial instability? More specifically policies, information asymmetries or externalities which could give rise to bank contagion, systemic/liquidity risks or procyclical effects? Whilst acknowledging that accounting standards play a fundamental role in addressing problems which could contribute to information asymmetries and ultimately systemic risks, this paper also highlights why the type of regulatory structure, clear allocation of responsibilities between regulators, as well as measures aimed at fostering accountability, constitute vital elements which could serve as safeguards in mitigating procyclical effects (as well as other factors) which could trigger financial instability. In achieving this aim, the paper focusses on the rationale for fair value accounting, as well as problematic issues arising from its implementation. The adoption of international accounting standards is considered to have a vital role in contributing to financial stability. This paper will also illustrate how the implementation of accounting standards and policies, in certain instances, have contrasted with Basel Committee initiatives aimed at mitigating procyclicality and facilitating <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> <b>provisioning.</b> More importantly, the paper will highlight how and why differences between regulatory and accounting policies could (and should) be mitigated. ...|$|E
40|$|As well as {{highlighting}} {{the importance of}} introducing counter cyclical capital buffers, this paper {{draws attention to the}} need for greater focus on “more forward looking provisions”, as well as provisions which are aimed at addressing losses and unforeseen problems attributed to “maturity transformation of short-term deposits into long term loans. ” Whilst the need for <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> <b>provisioning</b> has been echoed by some authorities on the literature, the paper also adds weight to the argument through its attempt to link such an argument to the ever increasing prominence assumed by liquidity risks – since liquidity also contributes to pro cyclicality. “The complex response of financial institutions to deteriorating market conditions - which to a large extent, is attributed to liquidity shortfalls which reflected on and off balance sheet maturity mismatches and excessive levels of leverage, has resulted in an increasingly important role for liquidity provided by central banks in the funding of bank balance sheets. ” Owing to such increased importance of liquidity risks, this paper also attempts to highlight why the Basel Committee’s Counter Cyclical Buffer Proposal – a response to the recent financial crisis (which to a significant extent, focuses on banking sector capital requirements), should also take greater account of more forward looking provisions. In so doing, it draws attention to the importance of coupling forward looking provisions (as well as other measures) with counter cyclical charges and why this provides a better alternative to the mere introduction of counter cyclical capital charges. ...|$|E
40|$|Parts I and II of {{this paper}} are aimed at {{providing}} a comprehensive overview of, and responses to, four very vital components of the consultative processes which {{have contributed to the}} new framework known as Basel III. The papers will approach these components in the order of the consultative processes, namely, the capital proposals, the liquidity proposals and the Proposal to ensure the loss absorbency of regulatory capital at the point of non-viability. The capital proposals comprise proposals aimed at strengthening the resilience of the banking sector, the proposal relating to international framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring and, the countercyclical capital buffer proposal. Whilst the capital proposals have been welcomed, there has been growing realization since the aftermath of the recent Financial Crisis that banks which have been complying with capital adequacy requirements could still face severe liquidity problems. As well as highlighting the importance of introducing counter cyclical capital buffers, the response to the countercyclical proposal draws attention to the need for greater focus on more <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> <b>provisions,</b> as well as provisions which are aimed at addressing losses and unforeseen problems attributed to “maturity transformation of short-term deposits into long term loans. ” The Committee's acknowledgement of negative incentives arising from the use of external ratings to determine regulatory capital requirements and proposals to mitigate these incentives is well - founded – however, regulators will also be able to manage, with greater ability, systemic risks to the financial system during such periods when firms which are highly leveraged become reluctant to lend where more market participants such as credit rating agencies, could be engaged in the supervisory process. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{advances}} in robotics and imaging technologies have brought various imaging devices {{to the field}} of the unmanned exploration of new environments. <b>Forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar is one of the newly emerging imaging methods employed in the exploration of underwater environments. While the video sequences produced by <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar systems are characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio, low resolution and limited range of sight, it is expected that video enhancement techniques will facilitate the interpretation of the video sequences. Since the video enhancement techniques for <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar video sequences are applicable to most of the <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar sequences, the development of such techniques is more crucial than developing techniques for optical camera video enhancement, where only specially produced video sequences can benefit the techniques. In this paper, we introduce a procedure to enhance <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar video sequences via incorporating the knowledge of the target object obtained in previously observed frames. The proposed procedure includes inter-frame registration, linearization of image intensity, and maximum a posteriori fusion of images in the video sequence. The performance of this procedure is verified by enhancing video sequences of Dual-frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON), the market leading <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar system. ...|$|R
40|$|The Rational Addiction (RA) model {{assumes that}} {{individual}} {{decisions about the}} consumption of harmful and addictive commodities are made on a rational basis (Becker and Murphy, 1988). In this context, rational means <b>forward</b> <b>looking,</b> i. e. a tendency {{to take account of}} future consequences of current consumption decisions. Different individuals may well attach different weights to the present relative to the future. The degree to which an individual is <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> in her consumption decisions is revealed not by her current consumption level but rather by the time path of her consumption of an addictive commodity. Hence, the need to estimate a <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> second order difference equation (SODE) as {{part of the process of}} testing the RA model. Most studies using micro level data estimate a single SODE for the whole sample. This involves estimating an average propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> for the entire sample, even when it is believed that different fully rational individuals in the same sample may have different propensities to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking.</b> <b>Forward</b> <b>looking</b> behaviour is an aspect of treating the consumption of an addictive commodity as part of an inter-temporal optimization problem. Inter-temporal optimization is characterized by what are known as saddle point dynamics and the information about an individual’s propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> is contained in what are known as the characteristic roots of the equation (Ferguson, 2003). In a sample of heterogeneous individuals we expect propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> to differ across individuals and the best way to identify these differences is by looking at the dynamic behaviour of the individual consumption paths. Estimating a common SODE for everyone hides this key difference. In this paper, we make the argument that the best place to look for differences in individual propensities to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> is in dynamic behaviour considered at different points in the distribution of the consumption of an addictive commodity. To do this we adopt techniques of Quantile Regression, (QR) estimating RA type difference equations in consumption across quantiles of cigarette consumption. We use panel data to ensure that we are examining the behaviour of individuals across time. Our hypothesis is that we will find differences in the degree of <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> behaviour characterizing the time paths of consumption across quantiles in the micro-level data. ...|$|R

40|$|Brock and Hommes (1997) {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} adaptive rational equilibrium dynamics (ARED), where agents choose between a costly rational expectation forecast and a cheap naive forecast, and the fractions using {{each of the two}} strategies evolve over time and are endogenously coupled to the market equilibrium price dynamics. In their setting agents are backward looking in the sense that strategy selection is based on experience measured by relative past realized profits. When the selection pressure to switch to the more profitable strategy is high, instability and complicated chaotic price fluctuations arise. In this paper we investigate the ARED with <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> agents, whose strategy selection is based upon expected profits. Our findings suggest that <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> behavior dampens the amplitude of price fluctuations, but local instability of the steady state remains. The global dynamics depends upon how sophisticated the <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> behavior is. With perfectly <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> agents prices converge to a stable 2 -cycle, while with <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> agents who are boundedly rational concerning their estimate of expected profits, small amplitude chaotic price fluctuations may arise. We also establish an equivalence relationship between a heterogeneous agent model with switching of strategies and a representative agent framework, where the representative agent optimally chooses between the benefits of a high quality forecasts and the associated information gathering costs. To an outside observer it is impossible to distinguish between the two. ...|$|R
