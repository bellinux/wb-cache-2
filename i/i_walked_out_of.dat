500|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 stars out of 4 {{and called it}} [...] "painfully and unremittingly intense" [...] and a [...] "superb example of filmmaking craft." [...] He also stated [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the theater, there were knots in my stomach from the film's roller-coaster ride of violence." [...] Walter Goodman of The New York Times {{said it was a}} [...] "flaming, flashing, crashing, {{crackling}} blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics." [...] Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its , 1986, issue, calling it the [...] "summer's scariest movie". Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film [...] "a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore." [...] The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film, as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine. Echoing Times assessment, Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film [...] "one sequel that surpasses the original." [...] On the negative side, Gene Siskel described Aliens as [...] "one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses" [...] and that [...] "toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{that year}} he mounted {{a show of}} O'Keeffe's works next to some amateurish {{paintings}} on glass by Becky Strand. He did not publish a catalog of the show, which the Strands took as an insult. Paul Strand never forgave Stieglitz. He said [...] "The day I walked into the Photo-Secession 291 [...] in 1907 was a great moment in my life… but the day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> An American Place in 1932 was not less good. It was fresh air and personal liberation from something that had become, for me at least, second-rate, corrupt and meaningless." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Jane Anders in {{the review}} by io9 criticized [...] "the personality-free hero, the {{nonsensical}} plot twists, the CG clutter, the bland romance, the new-age pablum...", concluding that [...] "Shyamalan's true achievement in this film is that he takes a thrilling cult TV series, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and he systematically leeches all the personality and soul out of it — {{in order to create}} something generic enough to serve as a universal spoof of every epic, ever." [...] Anders summarized the experience of watching the film by stating that, [...] "Actually, my exact words when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this film were, 'Wow, this makes Dragonball Evolution look like a masterpiece.'" [...] Ain't It Cool News' review questioned why Shyamalan was allowed to write the script, as well as why he was even chosen to direct such a high-profile film after a string of previous flops: [...] "Burdened by [...] never-ending onslaught of expository dialogue awkwardly delivered by actors giving career-worst performances across the board, The Last Airbender is so outrageously bad it's a wonder it ever got before cameras." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My time, gentlemen, is short." [...] (A hacking cough {{interrupted}} him.) [...] "I {{feel that}} I am withering. It rests with you, gentlemen, {{whether or not}} <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this room a free man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Explain yourself," [...] I said coldly, {{in a very}} chilly voice. [...] "Courtenay Ivor, I {{give you}} three minutes to explain. At {{the end of that}} time, if you can't {{exonerate}} yourself, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this house to give you up, as I ought, to the arm of Justice!" ...|$|R

2500|$|On 20 November 1944, {{his unit}} was {{released}} from service. Joseph Ratzinger again returned home. After three weeks passed, he was drafted into the German army at Munich and assigned to the infantry barracks {{in the center of}} Traunstein, the city near which his family lived. After basic infantry training, he served at various posts around the city with his unit. They were never sent to the front. In late April or early May, shortly before Germany's surrender, he deserted. Desertions were widespread during the last weeks of the war, although deserters were subject to death if caught. However, diminished morale and equally diminished risk of prosecution from a preoccupied and disorganized German military contributed to the growing wave of soldiers looking toward self-preservation. He left the city of Traunstein and headed for his nearby village. [...] "I used a little-known back road hoping to get through unmolested. But, as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a railroad underpass, two soldiers were standing at their posts, and for a moment the situation was extremely exciting for me. Thank God that they, too, had had their fill of war {{and did not want to}} become murderers." [...] They used the excuse of his arm being in a sling to let him go home.|$|E
60|$|With this Parthian shaft <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house, supposing that I {{had seen}} the last of it and Alexander Abraham.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{them until}} I send for them," [...] said I. And, {{giving him a}} patronizing bow, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the shop, as the German tied up my shoes in paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "I daren't, young 'un," [...] he cried, drawing back. [...] "Fifty years <b>I</b> have <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this office, {{proud of}} it, {{proud of being}} {{connected}} with it. I daren't face the street!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, {{while the}} Professor picked the little girls--who were more frightened than hurt--off the ground, and the pupils {{clustered}} around him closely grouped, <b>I</b> calmly <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the school-house, turned a corner, and escaped unnoticed to {{a grove of}} trees that stood near" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> him rapidly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the still}} square, past the fishermen's almshouses, towards the coast, he still inquiring indignantly where I was going.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said the mule. [...] "It's {{too dark to}} see much. Aren't these camels too sickening for anything? <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my lines to get a little peace and quiet here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Till the {{pleasure}} grown too strong [...] Left me muter evermore, [...] And, the winding road being long, [...] <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight, before, [...] And so, wrapt in musings fond, [...] Issued (past the wayside pond) [...] On the meadow-lands beyond.|$|E
60|$|I went to London resolving to {{act upon}} the {{paternal}} advice, and oh! how I {{longed for the}} day when I should be married, vowing in my secret soul that I would light a cigar as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> St. George's, Hanover Square.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{am aware}} how {{probable}} {{it is that}} all this may come to nothing. <b>I</b> can't <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house and marry you as the cookmaid does the gardener. I've got to wait till I'm told that everything is settled; and at present I'm told that things are not settled because you won't agree." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{simple fact}} is <b>I</b> unintentionally <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a store with items I had not paid for. Of course, I {{intended}} to purchase what I had, but I didn't. Losing track of how fast you are driving {{is no excuse for}} speeding. And losing track of clothing I was purchasing is no excuse for walking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a store without paying." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tata {{was also}} {{controversially}} {{supportive of the}} declaration of emergency powers by Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, in 1975. He is quoted to have told a reporter of the New York Times, [...] "things had gone too far. You can’t imagine what we’ve been through here—strikes, boycotts, demonstrations. Why, there were days <b>I</b> couldn’t <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my office into the street. The parliamentary system is not suited to our needs." ...|$|R
60|$|Here our conference ended. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the study}} a very {{different}} being from what I was on entering it. I had gone in with {{the air of a}} professor about to deliver a lecture; I came out like a student who had failed in his examination, and been degraded in his class.|$|E
6000|$|... "Milor!" [...] {{was all she}} said, but {{of course}} I understood. I {{had no idea that}} English milors could be thus treated by pert maidens. But what cared I for social {{amenities}} just then? My hand had closed over the duplicate key of the safe, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room {{in the wake of the}} damsel. Theodore had disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you believe}} it--two nights later, I saw the fellow--after the theatre, in a restaurant--whole party of people--big plate of {{so and so}} in front of him--quart bottle of so and so on ice--such and such and so forth. I stepped over to him--tapped him on the shoulder: 'See here,' I said, 'if you won't obey my instructions, you can't expect me to treat you.' <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|CONJURER. [Doing {{whatever}} passionate {{things people}} {{do on the}} stage.] I am a man. And you are a woman. And all the elves have gone to elfland, and all the devils to hell. And you and <b>I</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this great vulgar house and be married.... Every one is crazy in this house to-night, I think. What am I saying? As if you could marry me! O my God! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} if,--if all the grandeurs {{of all the}} Pallisers could consent {{to put up with}} poor me, if heaven were opened to me with a {{straight}} gate, so that <b>I</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our republic into your aristocracy with my head erect, with the stars and stripes waving proudly round me till I had been accepted into the shelter of the Omnium griffins,--then I would call him--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was getting}} angry by this time. If I hadn't really wanted the thing <b>I</b> should have <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the shop; but there the {{cushions}} {{were in the}} window, evidently for sale. I didn't see why I couldn't have one.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean the}} morning when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Belarab's stockade on your arm, Captain Lingard, {{at the head of}} the procession. It seemed to me that I was walking on a splendid stage in a scene from an opera, in a {{gorgeous}} show fit to make an audience hold its breath. You can't possibly guess how unreal all this seemed, and how artificial I felt myself. An opera, you know. [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he added, [...] "we {{ran out of}} the gale, and I had bitter {{words to}} face when we reached Vancouver. As one result of it <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the city with four or five dollars in my pocket--though there was a share due to me. Then I rode up into the ranges in an open car to mend {{railroad}} bridges in the frost and snow. It {{was not the kind of}} home-coming one would care to look forward to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} see her again now before I depart. I left her, as I have said, by Don Jose's bedside. The street was dark, the houses shut up, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town in the night. Not a single street-lamp had been lit for two days, and the archway of the gate was only a mass of {{darkness}} in the vague form of a tower, in which I heard low, dismal groans, that seemed to answer the murmurs of a man's voice.|$|E
40|$|Teaching is a {{difficult}} profession. I refer not to the hours we need put in, which are not so long, or even the pay, which I have always regarded as generous, but to the emotional burdens we shoulder. Like most teachers, I spend hours on end preparing for class. I reread the assigned material, trying to identify the most pressing dilemmas within it. In class I address those dilemmas with all the force and energy I can muster and try to engage {{the students in the}} inquiry. After an hour or two, or maybe, I confess, a little more, <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the classroom, wondering to myself: Have I helped my students understand the issues better? Have I stirred their imaginations? Have I enabled the class to see the law for all it could be? I amble back to my office, usually alone, full of hope, but uncertain of the answers to these questions. The void or emptiness I experience is shared, I imagine, by most law teachers, and it haunts us in our quietest moments...|$|R
5000|$|Marcelo Palomino {{had been}} the drummer for Tura Satana. At the time, Tairrie stated: “When <b>I</b> first <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Tura Satana, Marcelo {{was one of the}} reasons I left, so it’s funny he’s with me again now. I asked him to do this project because I really respect him as a musician. He is my backbone, he is my {{strength}} and without him I simply don’t think I could do it. He’s the best friend I’ve got.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet, {{if things}} are to go forward as we have arranged, you must meet him, Dona Margaret, and give him that answer which he desires. Well, I {{think it can be}} arranged. The court below is large. Now, while you and the marquis talk at one end of it, the Señora Betty and <b>I</b> might <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> earshot at the other. She needs more {{instruction}} in our Spanish tongue; {{it would be a good}} opportunity to begin our lessons." ...|$|R
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room. After all, {{what was}} the use of saying anything? And what could I say that would have done me any service? If they were capable of {{thinking}} me a thief,--which they certainly did,--nothing that I could say would remove the impression. Nor, as I thought, was it suitable that I should defend myself from such an imputation. What were the Greenes to me? So I walked slowly out of the room, and never again saw one of the family from that day to this.|$|E
6000|$|... "That you may swear to," [...] he cried. [...] "It's a pure, bright, A number 1 paper; the St. Jo Sunday Herald. The idea of {{the series}} was quite my own; I interviewed the editor, put it to him straight; the {{freshness}} of the idea took him, and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that office with the contract in my pocket, and did my first Paris letter that evening in St. Jo. The editor did no more than glance his eye down the head-lines. 'You're the man for us,' said he." ...|$|E
60|$|Availing {{myself of}} the {{permission}} of the king to go where I would, a little later in the day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town towards the Valley of Bones in order to ascertain for myself whether what Goza had told me was true. So it proved, for about three hundred yards {{from the mouth of the}} valley, which at that distance looked like a black hole in the hills, I found soldiers stationed about ten paces apart in a great circle which ran right up the hillside and vanished over the crest. Strolling up to one of these, whose face I thought I knew, I asked him if he would let me pass to see my friend, the Opener of Roads.|$|E
6000|$|... "The lady's salary!" [...] said Mr. Walker, indignantly, {{to these}} gentlemen and their attorneys. [...] "Do you suppose I will allow Mrs. Walker {{to go on}} the stage?--do you suppose I am such a fool as to sign bills to the full amount of these claims against me, when in a few months more <b>I</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison without paying a shilling? Gentlemen, you take Howard Walker for an idiot. I like the Fleet, and rather than pay I'll stay here for these ten years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubt whether}} people do know," [...] said Hampstead. [...] "She is twenty-one, {{and as far}} as the law goes might, <b>I</b> believe, <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house, and marry any man she pleases to-morrow. You as her father have no {{authority}} over her whatever;"--here the indignant father jumped up from his chair; but his son went on with his speech, as though determined not to be interrupted,--"except what may come to you by her good feeling, or else from the fact that she is dependent on you for her maintenance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well I'm sure I hope so. Don't get to mooning over a story, Agnes. I'll {{lock the}} library up and {{fortunately}} {{there are no}} fiddles at the Pinery. Above all, don't let any of the McGinnises in. They'll be sure to be prowling around when I'm not home. Don't give that dog of theirs any scraps either. That is Miranda Mary's one fault.
