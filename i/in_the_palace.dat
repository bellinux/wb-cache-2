5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School {{share the}} idea of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as a {{celestial}} being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> of Supreme Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> of Supreme Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{included}} Kitty Kelley, who falsely {{alleged that}} during the Second World War Elizabeth did not abide by the rationing regulations.

25|$|<b>In</b> 1502, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> {{had been}} built large enough so that the Portuguese Royal Court could begin moving into <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> <b>In</b> 1508, King Manuel I started {{expansion}} works on <b>the</b> <b>palace,</b> which ended <b>in</b> 1510, and appointed Diogo de Arruda as head architect of the project.

5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
