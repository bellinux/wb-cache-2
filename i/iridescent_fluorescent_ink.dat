40|$|We {{propose a}} method for hiding {{patterns}} within printed images by making use of classical and of two daylight fluorescent magenta and yellow inks. Under the D 65 illuminant we establish in the CIELAB space the gamut of a classical cmyk printer and the gamut of the same printer {{using a combination of}} classical <b>inks</b> with daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks.</b> These gamuts show that {{a significant part of the}} classical ink gamut can be reproduced by combining classical <b>inks</b> with daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks.</b> By printing parts of images with a combination of classical and daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> instead of using classical inks only, we can hide security patterns within printed images. Under normal daylight, we do not see any difference between the parts printed with classical inks only and the parts printed with daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> and classical inks. By changing the illumination, e. g. by viewing the printed image under a tungsten lamp or under a UV lamp, the daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> change their colors and reveal the security pattern formed by combinations of classical inks and of daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present {{contribution}} aims {{at creating}} color images printed with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> {{that are only}} visible under UV light. The considered <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> absorb light in the UV wavelength range and reemit part {{of it in the}} visible wavelength range. In contrast to normal color printing which relies on the spectral absorption of light by the inks, at low concentration <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> behave additively, i. e. their light emission spectra sum up. We first analyze to which extent different <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> can be superposed. Due to the quenching effect, at high concentrations of the fluorescent molecules, the fluorescent effect diminishes. With an ink-jet printer capable of printing pixels at reduced dot sizes, we reduce the concentration of the individual <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> and are able to create from the blue, red and greenish-yellow inks the new colorants white and magenta. In order to avoid quenching effects, we propose a color halftoning method relying on diagonally oriented pre-computed screen dots, which are printed side by side. For gamut mapping and color separation, we create a 3 D representation of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>ink</b> gamut in CIELAB space by predicting halftone fluorescent emission spectra according to the spectral Neugebauer model. Thanks to gamut mapping and juxtaposed halftoning, we create color images, which are invisible under daylight and have, under UV light, a high resemblance with the original images...|$|R

40|$|A new {{spectral}} colour {{prediction model}} for a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>ink</b> printed on paper is presented. It is based on our previous work on transparent support 4 and on a new mathematical formalism which generalizes the Kubelka-Munk theory. The printed paper is modelized by means of three matrices: an interface correction matrix, a matrix exponential modelizing the layer which contains the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>ink,</b> and a reflection matrix caracterising the substrate. The interface correction matrix allows to take multiple reflections into account by operating the Saunderson correction. These matrices are related to physical properties of ink and paper which must be measured: the transmittance spectra, the quantum yields, the absorption bands and the emission spectra of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks,</b> and the reflection properties of the paper.

40|$|Introduction Classical colour {{prediction}} models do {{not take}} fluorescence into account, and their predictions fail if fluorescent substances are contained in the inks. This {{is due to the}} fact that the overall spectrum of fluorescent substances depends on the spectrum of the light source. Furthermore, fluorescence is a non linear phenomenon. This study aims at predicting the spectra and the colours of uniform samples produced with one <b>fluorescent</b> <b>ink</b> at different concentrations. The method is based on a "one channel" modelization of the phenomenon where only one direction of propagation is taken into account. This model is used to compute the transmittance spectra of uniform colour samples.

Typically, a CD has a core of graphite or amorphous carbon framework, and the surface of which is coated with oxygen-containing groups, polymers and other species [1]. Meanwhile, CDs, which are not larger than 10  nm, have unique photophysical characteristics, such as high photostability, good biocompatibility, excellent optical properties and low environmental hazards [2, 3]. Inspired by these properties, the CDs possess various potential applications, such as drug delivery [4], <b>fluorescent</b> <b>ink</b> [5], sensors [6, 7], optoelectronics [8], photocatalysis [9, 10], and light-emitting devices [5, 11 – 13].

40|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} reproducible colors in a printing method is called the color gamut. This gamut is the range of colors around the spectrum and from light to dark that {{are available in the}} process. Previous research has found that the three parameters, spectral reflectance of the ink, solid ink density level and screening method, all influence the gamut in process color printing. This thesis evaluated how much these parameters change the color gamut both as individual parameters and in combination. A test target with 168 patches in the most saturated combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow and black was printed and measured with a spectrophotometer. The three coordinates L*, a* and b* for each patch in the target was plotted in the CIELAB space. Connecting these points forms a three dimensional object, the color gamut volume. By calculating the volume of this object the number of CIELAB combinations that can be reproduced in the system was derived. The pressrun was made at three levels of solid ink density and the targets were screened using frequency and amplitude modulated screening. The print was made on the six color Heidelberg Speedmaster 72 sheet fed lithography press at School of Printing Management and Science, Rochester Institute of Technology. The inks that were used in the test print are the Naturalith process cyan, magenta, yellow and black from Sun Chemical. In addition to these, a fluorescent magenta and yellow ink from DayGlo 2 ̆ 7 s ink series Starfire were used. These alternative magenta and yellow inks were printed with the Naturalith cyan and black. In this way two four color process combinations were evaluated with only six inks. The prints where made on a glossy coated paper, Centura Gloss from Consolidated Paper Inc. The result show that: <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> can be used in process color printing and that they produced a color gamut that reproduce light and more colorful colors than normal process colors, while dark colors were reproduced with lower colorfulness. The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> that were used are semi transparent and can not yield a dark black when printed on top of black. The solution is to use a high degree of under color removal and or to printing black as the last down ink. High solid ink densities was found to increase the color gamut for both ink sets. Frequency modulated screening was found to reproduce a color gamut with significantly higher gamut for the normal sheet fed inks, while no increase could be found for the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks.</b> By using frequency modulated screening and increasing the solid ink density when using normal sheet fed ink, the color gamut could be increased about 30 percent compared to amplitude modulated screening and SWOP solid ink densities. The Silicon Graphics based 3 D software Explorer was found to be a very useful tool when determining the shape of the color gamut...|$|R
