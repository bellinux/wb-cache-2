We find that there are pooled Perfect Bayesian equilibria that are collusive in which a firm plays exactly the same strategy irrespective of its realized cost. There are also separating equilibria with signaling {{as well as with}} communication, in which the firms produce the optimal <b>incentive</b> compatible <b>quantity</b> vector. In the separating equilibria with signaling, the firms play the strictly separating Bayesian Nash equilibrium in period 1 and then from period 2 onwards produce the optimal <b>incentive</b> compatible collusive <b>quantity</b> vector. In the separating equilibrium with communication the firms produce the optimal <b>incentive</b> compatible <b>quantity</b> vector from period 1 onwards after an initial communication phase. We show that among these equilibria, the separating equilibrium with communication gives the highest expected discounted sum of joint profits...|$|R
40|$|The article studies collusive equilibria in an {{infinitely}} repeated Cournot oligopoly with unknown costs. I look at collusive pooled Perfect Bayesian equilibria and separating equilibria {{either with}} signaling or with communication. In the separating equilibria with signaling the firms play the strictly separating Bayesian Nash equilibrium in period 1 and produce the optimal <b>incentive</b> compatible collusive <b>quantity</b> vector from period 2 onwards. In the separating equilibrium with communication the optimal <b>incentive</b> compatible <b>quantity</b> vector is produced from period 1 onwards. Among these, the optimal separating equilibrium with communication gives the highest expected discounted joint profits. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel experimental design in which creativity is incentivized and measured along three dimensions: quantity, quality and originality of ideas. We implement piece rate <b>incentives</b> for <b>quantity</b> alone, quantity {{in combination with}} quality and quantity in combination with originality and compare the results to a baseline with a fixed wage. Studying the effect of incentives on performance in the separate dimensions of creativity, we find that incentives significantly affect the quantity and average quality of ideas, but not the average originality. We show that incentives have both positive direct and negative spillover effects on performance in these dimensions and that organizations, therefore, face tradeoffs when introducing incentives for creative performance. When investigating the effect of incentives on a combined measure of innovation, i. e., the number of creative ideas {{that are at the}} same time of high quality and original, we find that <b>incentives</b> for both <b>quantity</b> and originality perform best...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to endogenizing technological spillovers. Firms choose continuous levels of a cost-reducing innovation before they engage in competition for each other's R&D-employees. Successful bids for the competitor's employee then result in higher levels of cost reduction. Finally, firms enter product market competition. We apply the approach to the long-standing debate on the effects of the mode of competition on innovation incentives. We show that incentives to acquire spillovers are stronger and incentives to prevent spillovers are weaker under quantity competition than under price competition. As a result, {{for a wide range of}} parameters, price competition gives stronger innovation <b>incentives</b> than <b>quantity</b> competition. spillovers, innovation incentives, product market competition...|$|R
40|$|Many {{regulated}} industries involve an oligopoly market structure. We examine optimal incentive regulation for a duopoly {{model of}} spatial competition when firms have private cost information. Market structure is endogenous as regulation determines market segments for firms and output distribution across consumers in each firm's market. By varying {{the assignment of}} consumers to firms, a relatively more efficient firm can be rewarded with a larger market, thus reducing <b>quantity</b> <b>incentive</b> distortions.

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the biomass power generation industry {{has resulted in the}} conversion of substantial agricultural waste (crop straw) into energy feedstock, thereby increasing the income of farmers and promoting the development of rural areas. However, the promising industry faces financial deficits because of difficulties in collecting straw from farmers. To determine strategies for overcoming the biomass supply problem, we apply Stackelberg game theory in modeling the Chinese biomass supply chain and design incentive scenarios under stakeholder risk perception. We illustrate the proposed methodology through an empirical case study on China and demonstrate the effects of incentives on farmers and middlemen. Results show that with <b>incentives,</b> straw <b>quantity</b> and stakeholder profit are expected to increase. Incentives exert a particularly remarkable effect on farmers, with such inducements producing the highest social welfare. Moreover, perceived risk dramatically affects stakeholder profit. Mitigating the risk perception of farmers is expected to significantly advance the development of the biomass power generation industry, increase stakeholder profit, and decrease the amount of incentives needed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{examine how}} worker {{productivity}} differs when performance-based compensation {{is based on}} measures of quantity, creativity, or the product of both measures. In an experimental task in which participants design “rebus puzzles, ” we find that quantity-based compensation increases the number of puzzles produced, and that creativity-based compensation improves average creativity ratings, as evaluated by an independent panel of raters. However, a weighted compensation scheme that rewards the product of quantity and average creativity ratings results in weighted productivity scores that are significantly lower than those generated by participants with <b>quantity</b> <b>incentives</b> alone. Follow-up analysis indicates that relative to participants compensated solely for quantity, participants in the weighted condition produce approximately {{the same number of}} high-creativity puzzles, but produce significantly fewer puzzles of mediocre creativity. This finding is consistent with the premise that participants rewarded for creativity-weighted output simplify their objectiv...|$|R

In a controlled field experiment, we study a minimally invasive change in the communication of a well-established incentive scheme - a reminder regarding the piece rate {{at the beginning of the}} shift. The experiment was conducted in a large firm where experienced managers work in a team production setting and where <b>incentives</b> for both <b>quantity</b> and quality of output are provided. While the treatment conveyed no additional material information and left the incentive system unchanged, it had significant positive effects on quantity and on managers' compensation. These effects are economically sizable and robust to alternative empirical specifications. We consider various potential mechanisms, where our preferred explanation - improved salience of incentives - is consistent with all of the findings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} our prototype implementation of Jiminy, a scalable distributed architecture for providing participation incentives in online rating schemes. Jiminy {{is based on an}} incentive model where participants are explicitly rewarded for submitting ratings, and are debited when they query a participating reputation management system (RMS). Providing explicit <b>incentives</b> increases the <b>quantity</b> of ratings submitted and reduces their bias by removing implicit or hidden rewards, such as those gained through revenge or reciprocal ratings. To prevent participants from submitting arbitrary or dishonest feedback for the purpose of accumulating rewards, Jiminy halts rewards for participants who are deemed dishonest by its probabilistic honesty estimator. Using this estimator, Jiminy can also perform classification of users based on their rating behaviour, which can be further used as criteria for filtering the rating information that users obtain from the RM...|$|R
40|$|Consider a {{multi-product}} firm {{facing an}} uncertain demand. It {{will be shown}} that the firm may benefit from decentralizing the decisions of how much to produce. To obtain these benefits, the firm should use the suggested internal tax <b>incentive</b> scheme. The <b>quantities</b> determined under the suggested scheme are equal to {{the sum of the}} quantities determined under centralization and a random vector with zero mean. This result is attributed to the dynamics by which a decentralized solution is obtained. It follows that the central planner may improve his decisions by behaving according to similar dynamics. A tax incentive scheme which guarantees improvement by decentralization may be unfair to some decentralized units. Sufficient conditions will be given for the existence of a fair scheme which improves on the centralized solution. It will be shown that if the uncertainty in the demand is large such a scheme will usually exist. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that firms alter year-end inventory policies in response to accounting tax incentives. This study proposes a stochastic ordering policy model which quantifies these effects. An innovative feature is its use of two decision variables: an initial order-up-to-level {{at the beginning of}} each year and a desired year-end inventory level. The ability to place a second order after demand has been assessed allows for an explicit consideration of the effects of tax <b>incentives</b> on order <b>quantity</b> decisions. Separate formulations are developed for the two most widely-used inventory accounting methods, LIFO and FIFO. The model provides new implications for choices between LIFO and FIFO, the forms of optimal ordering policies under each and for year-end inventory levels. A procedure is given for calculating the optimal FIFO policy. Calculating optimal LIFO policies is very difficult so myopic approximate policies are given which bound the optimal policy. accounting, inventory/production: stochastic models, inventory/production: approximations...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{managerial}} contracts (i. e. {{incentive schemes}} {{based on a}} linear combination of profits and sales) under asymmetric information about costs. In the competitive setting with ex ante symmetric information, standard strategic effects appear. Under adverse selection in both, monopolistic and competitive settings, we show that, in order to decrease the manager's expected informational rents, the owner will optimally pay the manager to keep sales low or, on the contrary, keep them high. Moreover, the interactions between the strategic and the informational rent effects have a non-additive nature, implying non-standard results. Unlike the monopolistic framework, we show that, in the competitive framework, the manager may become aggressive under ex ante symmetric information than under adverse selection. Unlike the setting with ex ante symmetric information, we show that, under adverse selection, the manager may become more aggressive in the monopolistic framework than in the competitive one.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between financial incentives and performance, long {{of interest to}} social scientists, has gained new relevance {{with the advent of}} web-based “crowd-sourcing ” models of production. Here we investigate the effect of compensation on performance in the context of two experiments, conducted on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT). We find that increased financial <b>incentives</b> increase the <b>quantity,</b> but not the quality, of work performed by participants, where the difference appears to be due to an “anchoring ” effect: workers who were paid more also perceived the value of their work to be greater, and thus were no more motivated than workers paid less. In contrast with compensation levels, we find the details of the compensation scheme do matter—specifically, a “quota ” system results in better work for less pay than an equivalent “piece rate ” system. Although counterintuitive, {{these findings are consistent with}} previous laboratory studies, and may have real-world analogs as well...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simulation}} based {{decision support system}} to decide the inventory ordering policy {{in the context of}} a single commodity, multi pack, and finite horizon situation. The multiple objectives include (a) Minimizing the end of the season inventory, (b) Maximizing the operating profit, (c) Minimizing the peak working capital requirements during the season. Stochastic demand and positive lead time add to the complexity of the problem context. In addition multiple partners in the supply chain with distinct and conflicting set of objectives necessitate the need for a formal approach. The motivation for this model is based on a real life situation. The model addresses the decision choices faced by the distributor in a specific logistics chain. In this chain, a typical distributor has to balance between the stochastic nature of the demand and the attractive nature of financial <b>incentives</b> (order <b>quantity</b> based) proposed by the manufacturer. The problem can be formulated as a multi-period dynamic programming problem with stochastic demand with an objective to optimize the expected operating profit, subject to specific constraints on working capital requirement, service level, order fill rate and end of the season inventory. Such a formulation is hard to solve and does not lend itself to analyze several ordering policies. Based on simulation experiments, we propose an ordering policy which optimizes the overall objectives of supply chain partners and hence demonstrated the possibility of jointly managing the uncertain demand by supply chain partners. The model is simple and easy to use. It is implemented by using spreadsheet. It provides adequate flexibility to conduct what-if analysis. The model has a potential to be useful in a wide range of situations. ...|$|R
40|$|Because {{compensation}} {{policies have}} critical {{implications for the}} provision of health care, and evidence of their effects is limited and difficult to study in the real world, laboratory experiments may be a valuable methodology to study the behavioural responses of health care providers. With this experiment undertaken in 2013, we add to this new literature by designing a new medically framed real effort task to test the effects of different remuneration schemes in a multi-tasking context. We assess the impact of different <b>incentives</b> on the <b>quantity</b> (productivity) and quality of outputs of 132 participants. We also test whether the existence of benefits to patients influences effort. The results show that salary produces the lowest quantity of output, and fee-for-service the highest productivity. By contrast, we find that the highest quality is achieved when participants are paid by salary, followed by capitation. We also find a lot of heterogeneity in behaviour, with intrinsically motivated individuals hardly sensitive to financial incentives. Finally, we find that when work quality benefits patients directly, subjects improve the quality of their output, while maintaining the same levels of productivity. This paper adds to a nascent literature by providing a new approach to studying remuneration schemes and modelling the medical decision making environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Preventive {{services}} and health promotion {{in terms of}} lifestyle counselling provided through primary health care (PHC) {{has the potential to}} reduce morbidity and mortality in the population. Health professionals in general are positive about and willing to develop a health-promoting and/or preventive role. A number of obstacles hindering PHC staff from addressing lifestyle issues have been identified, and one facilitator is the use of modern technology. When a computer-based tool for lifestyle intervention (CLT) was introduced at a number of PHC units in Sweden, this provided an opportunity to study staff perspectives on the subject. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore PHC staff’s perceptions of handling lifestyle issues, including the consultation situation as well as the perceived usefulness of the CLT. Methods A qualitative study was conducted after the CLT had been in operation for 2 years. Six focus group interviews, one at each participating unit, including a total of 30 staff members with different professions participated. The interviews were designed to capture perceptions of addressing lifestyle issues, and of using the CLT. Interview data were analysed using manifest content analysis. Results Two main themes emerged from the interviews: a challenging task and confidence in handling lifestyle issues. The first theme covered the categories responsibilities and emotions, and the second theme covered the categories first contact, existing tools, and role of the CLT. Staff at the units showed commitment to health promotion/prevention, and saw that patients, caregivers, managers and politicians all have responsibilities regarding the issue. They expressed confidence in handling lifestyle-related conditions, but to a lesser extent had routines for general screening of lifestyle habits, and found addressing alcohol the most problematic issue. The CLT, intended to facilitate screening, was viewed as a complement, but was not considered an important tool for health promotion/prevention. Conclusion Additional resources, for example in terms of manpower, may help to build the structures necessary for the health promotion/prevention task. Committed leaders could enhance the engagement among staff. Cooperation in multi-professional teams seems to be important, and methods or tools perceived by staff as compatible have a potential to be successfully implemented.

40|$|Objectives: Titmuss {{hypothesized}} that paying blood donors {{would reduce the}} quality of the blood donated and would be economically inefficient. We report here the first systematic review to test these hypotheses, reporting on both financial and nonfinancial incentives. Method: Studies deemed eligible for inclusion were peer-reviewed, experimental studies that presented data on the quantity (as a proxy for efficiency) and quality of blood donated in at least two groups: those donating blood when offered an incentive, and those donating blood with no offer of an incentive. The following were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO using OVID SP, CINAHL via EBSCO and CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library, Econlit via EBSCO, JSTOR Health and General Science Collection, and Google. Results: The initial search yielded 1100 abstracts, which resulted in 89 full papers being assessed for eligibility, of which seven studies, reported in six papers, met the inclusion criteria. The included studies involved 93, 328 participants. Incentives had no impact on the likelihood of donation (OR = 1. 22 CI 95 % 0. 91 – 1. 63; p =. 19). There was no difference between financial and nonfinancial <b>incentives</b> in the <b>quantity</b> of blood donated. Of the two studies that assessed quality of blood, one found no effect and the other found an adverse effect from the offer of a free cholesterol test (β = 0. 011 p <. 05).

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to analyze effects of tax {{incentives}} on long-run dynamics of total factor productivity (TFP) growth and capital formation in the Canadian sawmilling industry over a 40 -year period (1961 - 2000). Simulated tax incentives involved increasing capital cost allowance and investment tax credit and reducing corporate income tax. The production technology was specified as a function of capital, labor, energy, sawlogs, and a time dependent technological progress variable. A translog multilateral index number model was applied to measure and analyze TFP. Two analytical phases were followed. In the first phase, without the tax incentives, we analyzed annual levels and growth rates of TFP 1; and parametrically examined effects of output growth and time dependent technology on the growth of TFP 1. Over the study period, the average annual growth rate of TFP 1 was 2 %; and the parametric results revealed that the marginal effects of each of output growth and technological progress on TFP 1 growth were highly significant. The second phase involved recalculation of the rental price of capital to estimate effects of the simulated tax incentives on capital formation and growth of TFP (=Â TFP 2). As expected, the average annual share of capital in total cost with the tax incentives rose to 12 % from 9 % without the tax incentives. The average annual capital intensity also rose to real $ 15, 263. 70 with the incentives from real $ 10, 402. 91 without the incentives. Most importantly, higher capital formation, motivated by the tax <b>incentives,</b> raised aggregate <b>quantity</b> of the inputs significantly, leading to a slightly lower TFP 2 than TFP 1, because output was unchanged. In short, the data validated the hypothesis that tax incentives do indeed spur capital formation and TFP growth.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the overall state {{of water resources}} in the Great Miami River Watershed for 2011, {{with an emphasis on}} the buried valley aquifer and water quantity and quality data. The Miami Conservancy District (MCD) operates and maintains an extensive hydrologic monitoring system. By tracking trends in precipitation, runoff, and groundwater levels, changes to the balance of the hydrologic system of the watershed are assessed. Water quality data also is collected in both surface and groundwater to track annual trends, establish a baseline for future studies, and verify nutrient reductions from landowner <b>incentive</b> programs. WATER <b>QUANTITY</b> The year 2011 was a record setting year with regards to annual precipitation. In 2011 MCD recorded record high annual precipitation within the Great Miami River Watershed. The 2011 mean annual precipitation was 58. 89 inches, 19. 84 inches above the long-term mean annual precipitation. The above normal precipitation contributed to above normal runoff in the Great Miami River and its tributary streams. The total annual runoff for the Great Miami River Watershed upstream of Hamilton was 29. 83 inches, 16. 61 inches above the long-term mean annual runoff. The year 2011 was an above normal year for groundwater storage in the Great Miami River buried valley aquifer system. The annual groundwater recharge to aquifers is estimated from stream gaging records for the Great Miami River Watershed. Groundwater recharge in 2011 was estimated to be 15. 54 inches, 7. 46 inches above the long-term mean annual groundwater recharge. The groundwater elevation levels measured in MCD observation wells reflect that the aquifers in the Great Miami River Watershed received most of their recharge in three major pulses occurring in late February/early March; late April/early May; and late November/early December. Groundwater levels in the major aquifers began the year at near normal levels, climbed to above normal levels, and finished the year at above normal levels. The water budget computed by MCD for the Great Miami River Watershed is a simple analysis using water inflows and outflows to the watershed. The computed 2011 water budget shows net water storage in the aquifers and soils of the watershed. Over the long term, the net water storage in the Great Miami River Watershed is near zero and water inflows and outflows are in balance...|$|R
