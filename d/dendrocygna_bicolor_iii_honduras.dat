The mangroves shelter species that are endangered in the state, including the anhinga (Anhinga anhinga), fulvous whistling duck (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>bicolor),</b> and broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris).|$|R

5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck or fulvous tree duck (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>bicolor)</b> is a whistling duck that breeds {{across the}} world's tropical regions in much of Mexico and South America, the West Indies, the southern US, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It has mainly reddish brown plumage, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on the ground. The preferred habitat is shallow lakes, paddy fields or other wetlands with plentiful vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|The Lac Fitri Ramsar Site meausres [...] in {{size and}} was {{established}} on 13 June 1990. The Lake Fitri expands substantially during the rainy season, varying from year to year. Swamps encircle the lake periphery over a length of 150 km. Echinochloa stagnina, Vossia cuspidata and Nymphaea aquatica are the common vegetation types noted while Acacia nilotica and Mitragyna inermis grow in the flooded zone of the lake. The fringe land area around the lake has annual grasses and sedge. Also, as an Important Bird Area it has both breeding and non-breeding species. It is wintering ground for {{a large number of}} Palearctic waterbirds. The large number of bird species recorded here are Aythya nyroca, Balearica pavonina, Ardeola ralloides, Platalea alba, <b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>bicolor,</b> <b>Dendrocygna</b> viduata, Anas acuta, and Anas querquedula. It provides refuge during the drought season to Afrotropical species and elephants. It is also known as a productive fishing lake with an annual fish catch of 3,000 tonnes.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} is a wintering {{place or}} feeding place for {{many species of}} birds.It provides the main winter habitat for species such as northern pintail (Anas acuta), American wigeon (Anas americana), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), and osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Native species include great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), military macaw (Ara militaris), blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), scarlet macaw (Ara macao), red-and-green macaw (Ara chloroptera) chestnut-fronted macaw (Ara severus), northern screamer (Chauna chavaria), Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), knob-billed duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), fulvous whistling duck (<b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>bicolor),</b> black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti).Endangered birds include the recurve-billed bushbird (Clytoctantes alixii) and blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti).|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{availability}} for Afrotropical waterbirds {{is highly}} dynamic with unpredictable rainfall patterns and ephemeral wetlands resulting in diverse movement strategies among different species. Movement strategies among waterfowl encompass resident, regional and intercontinental migrants, but little quantitative information exists on their specific movement patterns. We studied the movement ecology of five Afrotropical waterfowl species marked with satellite transmitters in Malawi, Mali and Nigeria. Resident species, including White-faced Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna viduata, Fulvous Whistling Ducks <b>Dendrocygna</b> <b>bicolor</b> and Spur-winged Geese Plectropterus gambensis, remained sedentary {{during the rainy}} season and only flew limited distances during other months. In contrast, Knob-billed Ducks Sarkidiornis melanotos made short regional movements ? 50 km in all months and showed little site fidelity to previously used habitats in subsequent years. Garganey Anas quequedula followed an intercontinental strategy and made long-distance jumps across the Sahara and Mediterranean to their Eurasian breeding grounds. Most species flew farthest during the dry season, as mean daily movements varied from 1. 5 to 14. 2 km and was greatest in the winter months (January-March). Total distance moved varied from 9. 5 km for White-faced Whistling Ducks (October-December) to 45. 6 km for Knob-billed Ducks (April-June). Nomadic behaviour by Knob-billed Ducks was evidenced by long exploratory flights, but small mean daily movements suggested that they were relying on previous experience. Improving our understanding of these movement strategies increases our ability to assess connectivity of wetland resources that support waterfowl throughout their annual cycle and focuses conservation efforts on their most important habitats.

40|$|The present {{article is}} an {{elaboration}} {{of the text}} prepared for a lecture, delivered in London, England, on Tuesday, October 19, 2010, {{as part of the}} Centre for Transnational Legal Studies’ annual Transnational Justice Lecture series. A prior version appeared as a working paper in the Osgoode CLPE Research Paper Series. The present Ethics in Action published version contains both a number of important edits and several substantive additions (notably to section <b>III</b> on <b>Honduras)</b> subsequent to the Osgoode CLPE Research Paper. The paper begins, in Section II, with general comments on a notion of “interactive diversity of knowledge” and how that connects up to a view about the nature of truth. Sections III and IV then present salient aspects of events in both Honduras and Sri Lanka over the last two years, with the coup d’ état of 28 June 2009, in Honduras and the bloody end to the civil war in Sri Lanka in spring 2009 as fulcrums of the narrative. In each case, emphasis is also placed on the establishment of truth-related commissions or panels in relation to each country. The paper ends with a discussion of three interconnected quandaries - the inside/outside quandary, the consistency and fairness quandary, and the timing quandary. The discussion of the timing (or staging) quandary offers some provisional thinking on the sequencing of processes related to truth, justice and reconciliation, offering some reasons not to fuse truth-seeking processes with either criminal justice or reconciliation processes - with special reference to the Sri Lanka context...|$|R
