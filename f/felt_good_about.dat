50|$|Niebuhr couched {{his ideas}} in Christ-centered {{principles}} {{such as the}} Great Commandment and the doctrine of original sin.

The human tendency to corrupt the good was the great insight he saw manifested in governments, business, democracies, utopian societies, and churches. This position is laid out profoundly in one of his most influential books, Moral Man and Immoral Society (1932).

The following nine factors may lead to a more dynamic and informed hiring process and perhaps to fewer regrets among all involved...|$|R
