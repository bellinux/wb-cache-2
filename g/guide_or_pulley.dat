50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the jockey <b>pulley</b> <b>or</b> <b>guide</b> <b>pulley</b> (top) and the tension pulley (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up chain slack. The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|R
50|$|Power source: Either a mainspring, or {{a weight}} {{suspended}} from a cord {{wrapped around a}} <b>pulley.</b> The mainspring <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> has a mechanism {{to allow it to}} be wound up, which includes a ratchet to prevent it from unwinding. The barrel <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> has gear teeth on it which drives the center wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{velocity}} v of {{the chain}} or belt is the same when {{in contact with the}} two sprockets or pulleys:where the input sprocket <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> A meshes with the chain or belt along the pitch radius rA and the output sprocket <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> B meshes with this chain or belt along the pitch radius rB, ...|$|R

50|$|Richard Payl (Pawlie, Payli, Paylus <b>or</b> <b>Pulley)</b> was a 15th-century Dominican friar. He served firstly as the Bishop of Dromore before {{becoming}} the Bishop of Mann and The Isles.|$|R
50|$|Canal houses {{usually had}} a {{basement}} and a loft and attic where trade goods could be stored. A special beam <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> installation would {{be located in}} the attic to hoist up valuable goods, like spices, cotton, or heavier stuff like cocoa. The pulleys are still used for moving furniture.|$|R
50|$|A {{mechanical}} actuator functions to execute movement by converting {{one kind of}} motion, such as rotary motion, into another kind, such as linear motion. An example is a rack and pinion. The operation of {{mechanical actuator}}s is based on combinations of structural components, such as gears and rails, <b>or</b> <b>pulleys</b> and chains.|$|R
50|$|The Bowflex {{grew out}} of a now-expired patent first {{conceived}} by an Ethiopian engineering student in the United States, Tessema Dosho Shifferaw. Bowflex of America, Inc. began marketing the first product, Bowflex 2000X in 1986. Instead of conventional weights <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> machines, the original Bowflex machine used a combination of polymer rods to create constant resistance or tension.|$|R
50|$|If {{the line}} {{is meant to be}} moved while in the {{fairlead}}, the angle in the line created by the fairlead must be shallow to minimize friction. For larger angles a block <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> is used as a fairlead to reduce friction. Where {{the line is}} removed from a hook fairlead before using, the angle is not an issue.|$|R
5000|$|In Roman Egypt, Hero of Alexandria {{identified}} {{the wheel and}} axle {{as one of the}} simple machines used to lift weights. [...] This is thought to have been {{in the form of the}} windlass which consists of a crank <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> connected to a cylindrical barrel that provides mechanical advantage to wind up a rope and lift a load such as a bucket from the well.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the spindle and its bearings, the headstock often contains parts to convert the motor speed into various spindle speeds. Various types of speed-changing mechanism achieve this, from a cone <b>pulley</b> <b>or</b> step <b>pulley,</b> to a cone pulley with back gear (which is essentially a low range, similar in net effect to the two-speed rear of a truck), to an entire gear train {{similar to that of}} a manual-shift auto transmission. Some motors have electronic rheostat-type speed controls, which obviates cone <b>pulleys</b> <b>or</b> gears.|$|R
25|$|Benchtop table saws, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} job-site saws, are lightweight and {{are designed to}} be placed on a table or other support for operation. They commonly have direct drive (no v-belt <b>or</b> <b>pulleys)</b> from a universal motor. They can be lifted by one person and carried to the job location. These saws often have parts made of steel, aluminum and plastic and {{are designed to be}} compact and light.|$|R
50|$|Radio-controlled car {{manufacturers}} use {{the same}} basic design Schumacher created in the 1980s. The {{main part of the}} differential is a drive gear (<b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> in a belt transmission) with multiple holes cut through it, following its outside diameter. These holes are slightly larger than the width of the ball bearings, so that the balls, commonly around 2 mm diameter in a model car, sit inside the holes of the gear/pulley.|$|R
25|$|Master's mates were {{responsible}} for fitting out the ship, and making sure they had all the sailing supplies necessary for the voyage. They hoisted and lowered the anchor, and docked and undocked the ship. They would examine the ship daily, notifying the master if there were problems with the sails, masts, ropes, <b>or</b> <b>pulleys.</b> They executed the orders of the master, and would command in his place if he was sick or absent.|$|R
50|$|Where {{electrical}} power or rotating parts are not available, fans may be drive by other methods. High-pressure gases such as steam {{can be used}} to drive a small turbine, and high-pressure liquids {{can be used to}} drive a pelton wheel, which can provide the rotational drive for a fan. Large, slow-moving energy sources such as a flowing river can also power a fan using a water wheel and a train of gears <b>or</b> <b>pulleys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This is for {{use during}} mounted work. The leather {{piece of the}} Gogue is {{attached}} to the girth, and it forks near the chest into two cords. The cords are then run to the rings <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> at the browband, down the cheekpieces, and through the bit ring. From the bit ring they go toward the rider's hands, and snap onto shortened Gogue reins (which have metal rings at the end specifically for this purpose).|$|R
50|$|Variable pitch drives are pulley {{and belt}} drives {{in which the}} pitch {{diameter}} of one <b>or</b> both <b>pulleys</b> can be adjusted.|$|R
6000|$|The whip is a thicker line, rove {{through a}} block <b>or</b> <b>pulley,</b> and having its two ends spliced {{together}} without a knot, {{in such a}} manner that the join does not check the running of the rope through the pulley. Thus the whip becomes a double line--a sort of continuous rope, or, as it is called, an [...] "endless fall," [...] by means of which the lifebuoy is passed to and fro between the wreck and shore.|$|R

The matter was so {{prearranged}} {{that it is}} my belief that they brought with them some sort of block <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> which might serve as a gallows. That screw-driver and those screws were, as I conceive, for fixing it up. Seeing the hook, however they naturally saved themselves the trouble. Having finished their work they made off, and the door was barred behind them by their confederate." ...|$|R
25|$|There are {{generally}} three jumbie dancers in a unit, who perform {{accompanied by the}} babala (tambourine, or jumbie drum), triangle, fife <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> (accordion, concertina <b>or</b> melodeon), and most importantly the French reel (also jumbie drum or woowoo), a skin drum that produces an ominous sound which is said to attract the jumbie spirits. Both the babala and French reel {{are similar to the}} Irish bodhran in construction; all three drums are played with the fingertips, palms and the backs of the hands.|$|R
50|$|The {{drum shell}} (<b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> face) can be {{produced}} in aluminium, steel or stainless steel and is normally crowned to facilitate central belt tracking. However, cylindrical shells {{can be produced}} and fitted with external sprockets or rotary brushes for special applications. Rubber NBR, PU and other coatings {{can be applied to}} the shell to increase friction between the shell and conveyor belt and hot vulcanised or moulded profiled lagging can also be applied to drive plastic or steel modular belts.|$|R

60|$|A model boat {{should be}} rigged {{with only one}} mast and lug-sail, or with two masts and sails at the most. Three are {{unnecessary}} and cumbrous. Each sail should be fixed to a yard, which should be hoisted or hauled down {{by means of a}} block <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> fastened {{near the top of the}} mast. The positions of these yards and the form of the sails may be more easily understood by a glance at our woodcut than by reading many pages of description.|$|R

On receiving an answering signal from the shore he began to haul on the rocket-line. The men in charge had fastened to it a block, <b>or</b> <b>pulley,</b> with two tails to it; a line was rove through this block. The instant the block reached his hands Aspel sprang with it to the stump of the foremast, and looking round cried, [...] "Who'll lend a--" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{superior}} {{oblique muscle}} loops through a pulley-like structure (the trochlea of superior oblique) and inserts into the sclera on the posterotemporal surface of the eyeball. It is the pulley system that gives superior oblique its actions, causing depression of the eyeball despite being inserted on the superior surface.The superior oblique arises immediately above {{the margin of the}} optic foramen, superior and medial to the origin of the superior rectus, and, passing forward, ends in a rounded tendon, which plays in a fibrocartilaginous ring <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> attached to the trochlear fossa of the frontal bone.|$|R
5000|$|B-Bender is {{a guitar}} {{accessory}} that enables {{a player to}} mechanically bend the B-string up a whole tone (two frets) to C-sharp. There are several different designs, but all use levers <b>or</b> <b>pulleys</b> inside <b>or</b> outside the guitar body that are activated by a pull or push of the guitar neck, body, or bridge. The resulting tone sounds much like a pedal steel guitar and contributes a [...] "country" [...] feeling. Originally designed for the Fender Telecaster, B-Benders are now available to fit many solid body electric guitars, and even acoustic guitars.|$|R
50|$|A horse engine (also {{called a}} horse power or horse-power) is a now-largely {{obsolete}} machine for using draft horses to power other machinery. It {{is a type}} of animal engine somewhat more sophisticated than a horse mill. A common design for the horse engine was a large treadmill on which one or more horses walked. The surface of the treadmill was made of wooden slats linked like a chain. Rotary motion from the treadmill was first passed to a planetary gear system, and then to a shaft <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> that could be coupled to another machine.|$|R
50|$|This is {{used for}} longeing or free-schooling the horse, when the trainer is dismounted, and some {{trainers}} also begin early mounted schooling in the Gogue. The Gogue is made a leather piece with cords attached. These cords fork at the horse's chest and each run {{through one of the}} bit rings. The cord then follows the cheekpiece of the bridle up to a ring <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> {{at the side of the}} browband, before going back down to snap to the leather piece near the chest. The leather extends so that it can attach to the girth.|$|R
5000|$|The Capstan and Bowstring is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotary motion into linear motion and vice versa. It {{is very similar}} in function to a rack and pinion but operates on a different principle, being that of the Polelathe. It consists of a capstan which is a reel <b>or</b> <b>pulley</b> around which the bowstring is wound several turns. As the capstan is rotated, the bowstring is pulled in {{on one side and}} reeled out on the other. The free ends of the bowstring are coupled to the linear part of the mechanism, the [...] "bow", which holds the string in tension.|$|R
5000|$|Fixed: A {{fixed pulley}} has an axle mounted in {{bearings}} {{attached to a}} supporting structure. A fixed pulley changes {{the direction of the}} force on a rope or belt that moves along its circumference. Mechanical advantage is gained by combining a fixed pulley with a movable <b>pulley</b> <b>or</b> another fixed <b>pulley</b> of a different diameter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Guide</b> <b>or</b> stay vanes: The primary {{function}} of the <b>guide</b> <b>or</b> stay vanes is to convert the pressure energy of the fluid into the momentum energy. It also serves to direct the flow at design angles to the runner blades.|$|R
