5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise {{the complexity of the}} required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Dominick Benedetto {{was born}} on August 3, 1926, in Astoria, Queens, New York, to grocer John Benedetto and {{seamstress}} Anna Suraci. In 1906, John had emigrated from Pod√†rgoni, a rural eastern district of the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria. Anna {{had been born in}} the U.S. shortly after her parents also emigrated from the Calabria region in 1899. Other relatives came over as well as part of the mass migration of Italians to America. Tony grew up with an older sister, Mary, and an older brother, John Jr. With a father who was ailing and unable to work, the children grew up in poverty. John Sr. instilled in his son a love of art and literature and a compassion for human suffering, but died when Tony was 10 years old. The experience of growing up in the Great Depression and a distaste <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the Hoover Administration would make the child a lifelong Democrat.|$|E
5|$|CTW enlisted Palmer, in {{conjunction}} with Harvard University, in 1979 to conduct a study in Jamaica regarding the effects of Sesame Street on children with no exposure to other children's television programs, in order to correct <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> multimedia exposure on children in the US. Palmer discovered that Jamaican children's interest dropped during segments with the Muppets, possibly due to language and cultural differences; musical segments were the most effective. The children's learning increased after exposure to the show, especially letter and number recognition.|$|E

5|$|Several {{flights in}} and out of the state were delayed or {{canceled}}, and the Cape May-Lewes Ferry canceled travel across the Delaware Bay during the duration of Isabel. In Atlantic City, casino workers prepared for coastal flooding by placing sandbags at boardwalk entrances. New Jersey Transit workers secured its buses, railways, and light rail equipment. To ensure service would remain accessible during and after the hurricane, NJ Transit prepared backup generators, pumps, and chainsaws, with workers inspecting trains and the paths of the lines. FEMA mobilized and dispatched an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force of 28people to the state for possible rescue duty. Days before the storm made landfall, the Salvation Army prepared food and aid for potentially affected citizens. In anticipation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> Isabel, Governor Jim McGreevey declared a state of emergency, which allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deal with the situation.|$|E
5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E

5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E

25|$|One {{positive}} {{aspect of}} soil liquefaction is the tendency <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> earthquake shaking {{to be significantly}} damped (reduced) {{for the remainder of}} the earthquake. This is because liquids do not support a shear stress and so once the soil liquefies due to shaking, subsequent earthquake shaking (transferred through ground by shear waves) is not transferred to buildings at the ground surface.|$|E
