5|$|Emeric's death jeopardized his father's {{achievements}} {{in establishing a}} Christian state, because Stephen's cousin, Vazulwho had the strongest claim to succeed himwas suspected of an inclination towards paganism. According to the Annals of Altaich Stephen disregarded his cousin's claim and nominated his sister's son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo, as his heir. The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded, and his three sons, Levente, Andrew and Béla, were expelled from Hungary. Stephen's legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king's life by members of his court. According to Kristó, the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act. That Vazul's <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the Illuminated Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its <b>ears</b> <b>were,</b> its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{has been}} practiced {{all over the}} world since ancient times. There is considerable written and archaeological evidence of the practice. Mummified bodies with pierced ears have been discovered, including the oldest mummified body discovered to date, the 5,300-year-old Ötzi the Iceman, which was found in a glacier in Italy. This mummy had an ear piercing 7–11mm diameter. The oldest earrings found in a grave date to 2500 BCE. These were located in the Sumerian city of Ur, home of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. Earrings are mentioned in the Bible. In Genesis 35:4, Jacob buries the earrings worn by members of his household along with their idols. In Exodus 32, Aaron makes the golden calf from melted earrings. Deuteronomy 15:12–17 dictates ear piercing for a slave who chooses not to be freed. Earrings are also referenced in connection to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi in the Vedas. Earrings for pierced <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> found in a grave in the Ukok region between Russia and China dated between 400 and 300 BCE.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ears</b> <b>are</b> always pricked and {{directed}} straight up, but their size, pointed or slightly rounded tips of <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> variable. Generally, <b>ears</b> of the Khanty Laika are small to medium. In the Mansi Laika, <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> medium to long. <b>Ears</b> can <b>be</b> set high {{and close to}} each other or slightly apart.|$|R

5|$|Oryzomys antillarum was a {{medium-sized}} rodent, about {{as large as}} O.couesi. According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> black on the outer and yellow {{on the inner side}} and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris natator, for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{market was}} also the {{location}} for public punishment of wrongdoers, and stocks and a pillory were set at a prominent position at {{the eastern end of}} the Guildhall. The stocks were used for the punishment of relatively minor offences such as breaching the regulations on the price of bread, public brawling or incivility to the Mayor; wrongdoers would on occasion also be paraded around the market wearing paper hats bearing details of their offence. The pillory was used for more serious offences such as sedition. On at least two occasions in the late 16th century people convicted of sedition were nailed to the pillory by their ears; on completion of their time on the pillory their <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> cut off. Public whippings of criminals were also conducted in the marketplace. Although not all executions in the period are recorded, it is known that public hangings also took place in the market square and around the market cross.|$|E

5000|$|The work {{follows the}} common {{left-right}} polarity, where right is generally auspicious, left not so, where for example a deformity {{to the right}} <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> bad, to the left <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> good and two right <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> good whereas two left <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> perceived to be bad. The work shares {{much in common with}} some of the izbu omens in the Šumma ālu series, from which it may have borrowed, or alternatively provided a source for these “unprovoked” omens. A late Babylonian commentary relates some of the omens to astrological observations: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> set fairly low, {{medium in}} size, and are {{strongly}} developed. The ears project from the head, and are moderately long and {{shaped like a}} mason's trowel.

The bottom-most third of the <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> covered with short hair.|$|R
25|$|The {{auricles}} of her <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> {{found in}} much different condition. Part {{of the right}} auricle is missing, {{and can not be}} used to determine her appearance in life. Her left auricle is in a better condition, and two piercings were located in its earlobe. The Lady had a double-pierced ear.|$|E
25|$|Howard Carter {{writes in}} his {{description}} of Tutankhamun's tomb that the Pharaoh's earlobes were perforated, but no earrings were inside the wrappings, although the tomb contained some. The burial mask's <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> perforated as well, but the holes were covered with golden discs. That implies that at the time, earrings were only worn in Egypt by children, much like in Egypt of Carter's times.|$|E
25|$|Mickey's {{circular}} {{design is}} most noticeable in his ears. In animation in the 1940s, Mickey's <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> animated {{in a more}} realistic perspective. Later, they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way Mickey was facing. This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark. The circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a three-dimensional Mickey.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the middle}} and inner <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> {{necessary}} for hearing, people with complete agenesis of the <b>ears</b> <b>are</b> totally deaf. Minor agenesis that affects only the visible parts of the outer <b>ear,</b> which may <b>be</b> called microtia, typically produces cosmetic concerns and perhaps hearing impairment if the opening to the <b>ear</b> canal <b>is</b> blocked, but not deafness.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> {{very well}} preserved. The {{external}} <b>ear</b> (pinnae) <b>is</b> fairly large and broad in a mouse-like fashion. The inner <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> also exceptionally {{preserved in the}} form of the Meckels cartilage, which may be of extreme relevance in understanding the evolution of the mammalian ear.|$|R
25|$|By 1827 the breed's {{fighting}} spirit {{had made it}} equally handy along a hedge row as in a rat-pit. The Manchester could tackle an opponent twice its size. <b>Ears</b> <b>were</b> cropped to save risk of being torn in frequent scraps. (This also enhanced the sharp appearance of the expression). When rat-killing became illegal in England, rat-pits were supplanted by dining halls or public inns, {{all of which were}} infested by rats. To combat the rodent problem, each inn kept kennels.|$|E
25|$|The red hue was abandoned, as {{when viewed}} on {{television}} sets it made Nimoy look dark skinned. The makeup artists tried a yellow hue instead, which lightened Nimoy {{on television and}} {{it was agreed that}} this was an improvement. Meanwhile, Chambers re-created an ear mould as the ones created earlier for Nimoy were damaged. These new moulds would be the basis of the well known Spock ears. Each time Nimoy wore the ears, they were glued into place and could only be removed with solvent. But the <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> damaged in their removal, and so each pair could only be worn once.|$|E
25|$|A {{finding of}} lesser {{importance}} {{is that the}} Younger Lady has a double-pierced ear. Pierced <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> rather common for women of the New Kingdom of Egypt, including royals and nonroyal women. The Lady's pierced ear can not help researchers determine her identity or social position. Similarly inconclusive for identification purposes was {{the discovery of a}} wig in KV35, which could have belonged to the Younger Lady. Supporters of the theory identifying the Lady with Nefertiti, pointed to the wig's perceived similarities with the type of wigs used by Nefertiti. They are fashion items used by Egyptian women of the same era, they can not help us identify the wig's user with the Queen.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} civilians who took shelter in house basements were killed. The killings largely took {{place as the}} lead {{elements}} of the attacking force, composed of regular JNA units, advanced and the SAO Krajina forces came in their wake. The JNA and SAO Krajina TO troops started searching houses in Škabrnja after a JNA tank was destroyed. People were either shot in shelters or were removed from their basements and interrogated, beaten or killed. In one instance, a captured HV soldier was beaten and his <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> cut off before {{he was shot in}} front of his family. A large majority of the killed civilians or prisoners of war were shot at point-blank range, and one woman was crushed to death by a tank.|$|E
25|$|Before the 20th century, all maize {{harvesting}} was by manual labour, by grazing, or by {{some combination}} of those. Whether the <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> hand-picked and the stover was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and shocked, people and livestock did all the work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree, as appropriate to each farm's needs, although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest unit costs when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost can be too high, as their higher fixed cost cannot be amortized over as many units.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} hypothesis, {{based on}} morphology, suggests {{the ancestors of}} snakes were related to mosasaurs—extinct aquatic reptiles from the Cretaceous—which in turn {{are thought to have}} derived from varanid lizards. According to this hypothesis, the fused, transparent eyelids of snakes are thought to have evolved to combat marine conditions (corneal water loss through osmosis), and the external <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> lost through disuse in an aquatic environment. This ultimately led to an animal similar to today's sea snakes. In the Late Cretaceous, snakes recolonized land, and continued to diversify into today's snakes. Fossilized snake remains are known from early Late Cretaceous marine sediments, which is consistent with this hypothesis; particularly so, as they are older than the terrestrial Najash rionegrina. Similar skull structure, reduced or absent limbs, and other anatomical features found in both mosasaurs and snakes lead to a positive cladistical correlation, although some of these features are shared with varanids.|$|E

2500|$|To {{conform to}} the breed standards, the Shelties' ears should bend {{slightly}} or [...] "tip", this contributes to the [...] "proper Sheltie expression". The <b>ear</b> <b>is</b> to have the top third to {{a quarter of the}} ear tipped.

25|$|Wolf bounties were {{regularly}} paid in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries and {{as recently as}} 1950's. Gian Galeazzo Visconti himself offered ten Imperial marks for every wolf killed. 600 wolves are recorded to have been bountied between the 14th and 19th centuries. Presentation of the killed wolf to the authorities was obligatory. The authorities had to give an accurate testimony {{with a description of}} the presented animal (gender, weight, measurements, color, estimated age, etc.) and the symptomatic ascertainment of eventual rabies infections. The wolf's paw was then amputated and/or its <b>ears</b> <b>were</b> sealed in wax {{in order to avoid the}} spoils being represented elsewhere. Only one case of fraudulence in 1834, which was punished by arrest, occurred. Italian wolf hunters lacked the organisation or determination of their French counterparts, having not formed any special hunting teams. Wolves were exterminated from the Alps in the 19th century, though they were never fully exterminated in the peninsula.|$|E
