40|$|International audienceThe air {{conditioning}} of vehicle cabins is now standard equipment for vehicles. Increasing the consumption of fuel, the {{air conditioning}} also raises difficulties and costs with its integration in the electric and hybrid vehicles, because of the continuous or punctual absence of hot source as is the internal combustion engine. In this paper, we study {{the interest of the}} techniques of adiabatic cooling to cooling down a cabin of an agricultural machine. Recordings of the activity of a tractor in real situation are used for studying the temperatures inside the cabin along a typical working day. From these observations, we adapted a model to estimate the thermal exchanges of the cabin with the environment. The solar incomes are estimated under various countries in France and the ventilation rate is taken into account. We substitute then the air conditioning by a system that mists water droplets on the air admission for the cabin. The efficiency of this cooling system depends mainly of the atmospheric conditions and we establish, for various weather situations, the cooling capacity of this process. So the temperatures inside the cabin are assessed, as well as the water consumption. These results add to efficiency assessment about adiabatic cooling systems <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} methods to {{dimension}} concrete slabs due to vehicle loads, {{most of them}} based on Westergaard theory. These methods have been developed <b>for</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicles</b> (cars, trucks and forklifts). Considering agricultural buildings {{one of the most}} used vehicles is the agricultural tractor whose characteristics (tires of great dimensions but with a reduced contact surface) are different to those of the industrial vehicles. The goal of this research was to analyze the applicability of the finite element method (FEM) to estimate the stresses generated on the concrete slabs considering the loads transmitted by agricultural tractors. To achieve this objective, the effect of the loads transmitted by the rear axle tires of three agricultural tractors has been considered. In parallel, the same study has been carried out using the Westergaard theory. As a preliminary step, to validate the FEM, a numerical analysis has been made to obtain the stresses generated on a concrete slab considering three forklifts. The numerical analysis results have been compared with those obtained by mean of validated methods (Portland Cement Association) and the classical theory of Westergaard. For each agricultural tractor, the actual geometry of the contact surface of tires has been measured on a concrete slab and discretized by the FEM. As a result of the research process developed, it is possible to conclude that the FEM is a valid tool to analyze the tensions generated by the loads transmitted by the tires of agricultural tractors on concrete floors supported on the ground...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{navigation}} in real-world industrial environments is {{a challenging}} task in many respects. One {{of the key}} open challenges is fast planning and execution of trajectories to reach arbitrary target positions and orientations with high accuracy and precision, while taking into account non-holonomic vehicle constraints. In recent years, lattice-based motion planners have been successfully used to generate kinematically and kinodynamically feasible motions for non-holonomic vehicles. However, the discretized nature of these algorithms induces discontinuities in both state and control space of the obtained trajectories, resulting in a mismatch between the achieved and the target end pose of the vehicle. As endpose accuracy is critical for the successful loading and unloading of cargo in typical industrial applications, automatically planned paths have not been widely adopted in commercial AGV systems. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} a path smoothing approach, which builds on the output of a lattice-based motion planner to generate smooth drivable trajectories <b>for</b> non-holonomic <b>industrial</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The proposed approach is evaluated in several industrially relevant scenarios and found to be both fast (less than 2 s per vehicle trajectory) and accurate (end-point pose errors below 0. 01 m in translation and 0. 005 radians in orientation) ...|$|R
