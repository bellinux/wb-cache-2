40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{the problem of}} online cost-sensitive clas- sifier {{adaptation}} and the first algorithm to solve it. We assume we have a base classifier for a cost-sensitive classification problem, but it is trained {{with respect to a}} cost setting different to the desired one. Moreover, we also have some training data samples streaming to the algorithm one by one. The prob- lem is to adapt the given base classifier to the desired cost setting using the steaming training samples online. To solve this problem, we propose to learn a new classifier by adding an <b>adaptation</b> <b>function</b> to the base classifier, and update the <b>adaptation</b> <b>function</b> parameter according to the streaming data samples. Given a input data sample and the cost of misclassifying it, we up- date the <b>adaptation</b> <b>function</b> parameter by minimizing cost weighted hinge loss and respecting previous learned parameter simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is compared to both online and off-line cost-sensitive algorithms on two cost-sensitive classification problems, and the experiments show that it not only outperforms them one classification performances, but also requires significantly less running time...|$|R

BEA considers an application model where trans-node application timeliness requirements are expressed using benefit functions, and anticipated workload during future time intervals are expressed using <b>adaptation</b> <b>functions.</b> Furthermore, BEA considers an adaptation model where subtasks of application tasks are replicated at run-time for tolerating failures {{as well as}} for sharing workload increases. Given such models, the objective of the algorithm is to maximize the aggregate real-time benefit and the ability to tolerate host failures during the time window of <b>adaptation</b> <b>functions.</b> Since determining the optimal solution is computationally intractable, BEA heuristically computes near-optimal resource allocations in polynomial-time. We show that BEA can achieve almost the same fault-tolerance ability as full replication, and accrue most of realtime benefit that full replication can accrue. In the meanwhile, BEA requires much fewer replicas than full replication, and hence is cost effective. ...|$|R

As an outcome of this interaction is the fulfillment of household food need. However, {{this is not always}} the case. Many factors affect the fulfillment of household needs for food. One of them is the difference in the types of agro-ecosystem. This research aims describe the rate of household {{food security}} and analyze determinant factors that influence of each type of Agro-ecosystem. The study proves that household based on rice field agro-ecosystem has a better food security than the ones based on dry field agro- ecosystem. This proves that household interaction with a different environment will result in a different level of food security. The differences are mainly caused by differences in income, purchasing power, food availability, and food distribution in the region. Among the two types of Agro-ecosystem, the most significant determinant variable which affect the attainment of household food security are food availability, purchasing power (<b>adaptation</b> <b>function),</b> work and consumption motivation (goal attainment function), the role of household members for income generating and the role in decision making (integration function), knowledge about food and nutrition, food norms and the level of application technology (latency function).

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} moving mesh method and its {{applications}} in the numerical solution of moving boundary problems and higher order evolutionary partial differential equations. The concept of equidistribution has played {{a fundamental role in}} moving mesh methods. For a given <b>adaptation</b> <b>function,</b> de Boor 2 ̆ 7 s algorithm is commonly used for generating equidistributing meshes. The algorithm produces a sequence of meshes upon using piecewise constant interpolation for the <b>adaptation</b> <b>function</b> on the current mesh and generating a new mesh that exactly equidistributes the interpolant. Although the effectiveness of this algorithm was confirmed numerically long ago, the proof for the existence of the limit mesh and the convergence of this algorithm have thus far remained theoretically elusive. These theoretical issues are treated in Chapter 2 of this thesis. Numerical results are also given to illustrate the theoretical findings as well as stopping criteria necessary for the implementation of the algorithm. The use of moving meshes has become a popular technique for improving existing approximation schemes for moving boundary problems. In Chapter 3, we study the relative efficiency and accuracy of various numerical methods for moving boundary problems on moving meshes. A moving mesh front-tracking method based on equidistributing a specially designed <b>adaptation</b> <b>function</b> is proposed for moving boundary problems of implicit type. The resulting numerical method does not require any analytical knowledge of solutions, assumptions on solution profiles or interpolation/extrapolation which are common in other methods in the literature. Some preliminary work for moving mesh front-tracking methods in two dimensions is presented in Chapter 4.
