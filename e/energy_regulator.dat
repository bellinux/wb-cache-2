25|$|In July 2015, one of {{the largest}} leaks in Canada’s history spilled 5,000 cubic metres of {{emulsion}} — about 5 million litres of bitumen, sand and wastewater — from a Nexen Energy pipeline at a Long Lake oil sands facility, south of Fort McMurray. The subsidiary of China’s CNOOC Ltd. automated safety systems had not detected the pipeline fault that caused the spill to cover an area of about 16,000 square metres prior to manual inspection. Alberta <b>Energy</b> <b>Regulator</b> (AER) revealed the number of pipeline “incidents” in Alberta increased 15% last year, despite the regulator’s well-publicized efforts to reduce ruptures and spills.|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of new power plants in the United States carries the risk of significantly contributing to global climate change. After concluding that the current federal regulatory response to climate change risks from power plants is inadequate, this Article examines three potential roles for state <b>energy</b> <b>regulators</b> to play as a bridge climate mitigation strategy until a cohesive federal policy is enacted. State <b>energy</b> <b>regulators</b> have received relatively little attention as potential climate change regulators, but they are well positioned to analyze and mitigate climate change risks from new power plants. The Article considers the advantages and drawbacks of state <b>energy</b> <b>regulators</b> considering greenhouse gas risks in traditional utility regulatory proceedings. It describes an innovative strategy used by the State of Michigan to incorporate state <b>energy</b> <b>regulators</b> into state environmental permitting proceedings. Finally, the Article considers a more dramatic proposal to merge energy and environmental considerations into a single power plant siting regulatory process where state <b>energy</b> <b>regulators</b> affirmatively decide what type of power plant to build and use a competitive bidding process to select a private owner of the plant...|$|R

2500|$|A {{network of}} {{gathering}} and feeder pipelines collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: Edmonton, Alberta and Hardisty, Alberta. Most of the feeder pipelines move blended bitumen or SCO southbound and diluent northbound, {{but a few}} move product laterally within the oil sands region. In 2012, {{the capacity of the}} southbound feeder lines was over 300,000 m³/d (2 million bbl/d) and more capacity was being added. [...] The building of new oil sands feeder pipelines requires only the approval of the Alberta <b>Energy</b> <b>Regulator,</b> an agency that deals with matters entirely within Alberta and is likely to give little consideration to interference from political and environmental interest from outside Alberta.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2015, the Pembina Institute {{published}} a brief report about [...] "a recent surge of odour and air quality concerns in northern Alberta {{associated with the}} expansion of oilsands development", contrasting the responses to these concerns in Peace River and Fort McKay. In Fort McKay, air quality is actively addressed by stakeholders represented in the WBEA, whereas the Peace River community must rely on {{the response of the}} Alberta <b>Energy</b> <b>Regulator.</b> [...] In an effort to identify the sources of the noxious odours in the Fort McKay community, a Fort McKay Air Quality Index was established, extending the provincial Air Quality Health Index to include possible contributors to the problem: , TRS, and THC. Despite these advantages, more progress was made in remediating the odour problems in the Peace River community, although only after some families had already abandoned their homes. [...] The odour concerns in Fort McKay were reported to remain unresolved.|$|E

The BBC reported: [...] "Bank shares {{saw some of the}} biggest gains, on hopes that the sector will not see any further rises in levies. Shares in Lloyds Banking Group rose 5.75% while Barclays was 3.7% higher", adding, [...] "Energy firms also saw their share prices rise, as Labour had wanted a price freeze and more powers for the <b>energy</b> <b>regulator.</b> British Gas owner Centrica rose 8.1% and SSE shares were up 5.3%". BBC economics editor Robert Peston noted: [...] "To state the obvious, investors love the Tories' general election victory. There are a few reasons. One (no surprise here) is that Labour's threat of breaking up banks and imposing energy price caps has been lifted. Second is that investors have been discounting days and weeks of wrangling after polling day over who would form the government – and so they are semi-euphoric that we already know who's in charge. Third, many investors tend to be economically Conservative and instinctively Conservative." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oil sands {{production}} forecasts {{released by}} the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), the Alberta <b>Energy</b> <b>Regulator</b> (AER), and the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) are comparable to National Energy Board (NEB) projections, in terms of total bitumen production. None of these forecasts take into account probable international constraints to be imposed on combustion of all hydrocarbons in order to limit global temperature rise, giving rise to a situation denoted by the term [...] "carbon bubble". Ignoring such constraints, and also assuming {{that the price of}} oil recovers from its collapse in late 2014, the list of currently proposed projects, many of which are in the early planning stages, would suggest that by 2035 Canadian bitumen production could potentially reach as much as 1.3 million m3/d (8.3 million barrels per day) if most were to go ahead. Under the same assumptions, a more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production would reach 800,000 m3/d (5.0 million barrels/day), 2.6 times the production for 2012. The majority of the growth would likely occur in the in-situ category, as in-situ projects usually have better economics than mining projects. Also, 80% of Canada's oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods.|$|E
