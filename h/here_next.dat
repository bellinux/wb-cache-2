These families do not pay rent and the owner wants to evict them. These families earn money by selling crafts on the sidewalks in the colonia or by washing clothes. There are families that live on the streets here who survive on 20 pesos a day.|$|E
2500|$|All {{the pupils}} under John Bosco {{observed}} a monthly event called The Exercise of a Happy Death; this practice continues {{under the name}} The Monthly Day of Recollection. [...] This practice was encouraged by Pope Pius IX. Part of this {{was to make a}} Confession and Communion as though they were the last ones to be made before death. Bosco notes that Dominic observed this practice devoutly, and that one day, Dominic said that he would be the first amongst the group to die. During the month of May, before his death, the intensity of his spiritual practices increased. John Bosco notes that he said, [...] "Let me do what I can this year; if I am <b>here</b> <b>next</b> year I'll let you know what my plans are." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fifth-placed Craig Chalmers {{was cast}} by Bill Kenwright as Joseph in the touring version of Joseph from 20 August 2007. The tour {{was due to}} have its first night in Bromley, London, less than 24km (about 15 miles) from the Adelphi, where Kenwright was co-producer. In Chalmers' last week before viewers voted him off the programme, Kenwright had told him: [...] "You wowed the {{audience}} and please God you are <b>here</b> <b>next</b> week for the semi-final." [...] Chris Barton played Benjamin on the tour and at some matinees Joseph or the Narrator. He {{then went on to}} be a Swing in Spring Awakening in both Hammersmith and the Novello west end. Kenwright employed Chris Crosby on his new national tour of Half a Sixpence opening on 28 August 2007 at the Churchill Theatre in Bromley.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond the lock, {{there is}} a section which could be dredged to return it to navigable condition, but the M6 {{motorway}} has been built across it. A culvert maintains {{the flow of water}} under the motorway, but is not big enough for navigation. However, the motorway embankment is high enough to allow the insertion of a navigable culvert. Just before the motorway was Dog Bridge, but this was demolished and the road it carried was realigned as part of the motorway construction. One possible solution would be to build a new lock beyond the road, to replace lock 2, and lower the level of the canal between. Beyond the motorway, Scrawpers End Bridge carries Oak Lane over the canal, but it has been lowered, leaving around [...] of headroom. A replacement lift bridge might be required <b>here.</b> <b>Next</b> is the feeder from Gailey reservoirs, which has ensured that the channel has remained intact, since the water supplies the main line.|$|E
2500|$|Houses loom {{large in}} Bowen's work (as {{is evident in}} Bowen Court, her 1946 book memorialising her ancestral house, Bowen Court, one of the Irish great houses, which {{she was forced to}} sell and which was {{subsequently}} demolished) and in The House in Paris the main setting is the house where Naomi and Mme Fisher live, which is characterised as full, stuffy, and oppressive: [...] "The inside of this house—with its shallow door-panels, lozenge door-knobs, polished brass ball {{on the end of the}} banisters, stuffy red matt paper with stripes so artfully shadowed as to appear bars—was more than simply novel to Henrietta, it was antagonistic, as though it had been invented to put her out. [...] She felt the house was acting, nothing seemed to be natural; objects did not wait to be seen but came crowding in on her, each with what amounted to its aggressive cry." [...] Naomi's deceased aunt's home in Twickenham is similarly described, though there is a suggestion of future redemption: [...] "the aunt's house was hollow, completely dead. But someone else would move in almost at once, and be <b>here</b> <b>next</b> spring, no doubt, to enjoy the cherry." [...] A third house is the home of Colonel and Violet Bent lived in Rushbrook, the house in Ireland that Karen briefly visited before returning to the Michaelis home in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London. But that Irish home is itself a replacement of an earlier great house, the ancestral home of Colonel Bent, which was burned during the Irish War of Independence.|$|E
