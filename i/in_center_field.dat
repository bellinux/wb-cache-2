5|$|Although in 2008 Baseball America {{projected}} Venable as an {{every day}} starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned {{whether he would}} be a long-term solution <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut on September 7, 2010, as a pinch hitter for Denard Span, {{striking}} out against Kansas City Royals' pitcher Jesse Chavez. He {{remained in the}} game, replacing Span <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> He recorded his first major league run batted in (RBI) on September 18, 2010, when he grounded out to score J. J. Hardy {{in a game against}} the Oakland Athletics. He recorded his first major league hit a day later.|$|E
5|$|Nick Swisher {{walked to}} lead off {{the fifth inning}} and {{advanced}} to second on a Melky Cabrera single. Swisher restored the Yankees' lead, scoring on a single by Jeter, and Cabrera added to it by scoring a run on a Damon single. Brett Gardner replaced Cabrera <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> as a defensive substitution {{in the bottom of}} the sixth inning after Cabrera left the game due to a hamstring injury. Chan Ho Park relieved Phillies starter Joe Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless in that inning. Chase Utley hit his third solo home run of the series {{in the bottom of the}} seventh with two outs, bringing the game to 4–3. Dámaso Marte relieved Sabathia and got the final out of the seventh without further scoring.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>center</b> <b>field</b> {{bleacher}} {{section is}} named [...] "The Rockpile". During the 1993 and 1994 seasons {{when the team}} played at Mile High Stadium, which was a hybrid football/baseball venue, the Rockpile was located next to the south stands, which were <b>in</b> dead <b>center</b> <b>field</b> and very distant from home plate. The same design was incorporated into Coors Field, and is located <b>in</b> deep <b>center</b> <b>field</b> up high. The original Rockpile seats cost a dollar each.|$|R

5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{replaced}} Melky Cabrera {{on their}} postseason roster with Ramiro Peña {{due to his}} injury in Game4, while Brett Gardner took Cabrera's place <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> A. J. Burnett, the Yankees' Game2 starter, started Game5 on three days rest, one less than the Phillies' Cliff Lee. The Yankees scored first in the first inning, with Johnny Damon reaching base with a single and then scoring on a two-out double by Alex Rodriguez. The Phillies responded {{in the bottom of}} the inning with a single by Jimmy Rollins, Shane Victorino reaching after being hit by a pitch, and finally a three-run home run by Chase Utley to take the lead. The Phillies added to their lead in the third inning with Utley and Ryan Howard drawing walks followed by RBI singles by Jayson Werth and Raúl Ibañez. With no outs in the inning, Burnett was relieved by David Robertson, who allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz ground out.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{returned}} to the majors in 2009, as a reserve outfielder for the San Francisco Giants. In 2010, he became their everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter, winning the Willie Mac Award and helping the team win its first World Series since 1954. After the 2011 season (in which Torres battled injuries and lost playing time in September), he {{was traded to the}} New York Mets. He spent one season with the Mets, starting <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> for the most part except for a stretch in which he platooned with Kirk Nieuwenhuis, before re-signing with the Giants in 2013. He was used in a platoon split with Gregor Blanco in 2013 before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury in August. After going unsigned to begin 2014, Torres signed a minor league deal with the Boston Red Sox in June, but opted out of his contract in late July after not getting called up.|$|E

Additionally, the fan experience was upgraded as well by adding new seats to replace worn, older seating <b>in</b> the <b>center</b> grandstand.|$|R
50|$|The stadium {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as a pitchers' park {{due to the lack of}} power hitting over its lifespan. Part of this can be attributed to its dimensions; the field was 340 feet from home plate to the wall in left field, 330 feet in right, and a daunting 420 feet <b>in</b> deep <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> The outfield walls were also 12 feet high the whole distance around, higher than walls seen elsewhere <b>in</b> baseball. The <b>center</b> <b>field</b> wall included a 90-degree, inward facing angle, reminiscent of the old Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC.|$|R
5|$|In a game {{versus the}} Reds on June9, {{the score was}} tied 5–5in {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning when Stivetts {{connected}} for a pinch-hit, walk-off solo home run. This was his second career walk off home run, his third as a pinch hitter, and the last home run of his career. It was reported on July22 that a deal had been agreed upon to trade Stivetts to the St. Louis Browns of the NL for Kid Carsey and cash. The deal was contingent upon the acceptance of Stivetts. In early August, the Boston manager Selee sent Stivetts home, commenting that the team did not have use of his services any longer. Tim Hurst, now managing St. Louis, planned on using Stivetts <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> Stivetts refused to accept the move to St. Louis, and a sale was officially conducted on August14 that sent him to St. Louis for $2000 and an unnamed player. True to his word, Stivetts did not report, or play a single game for St. Louis that season. Due to his objection to being sold to St. Louis, he claimed that he would remain in Ashland and return to coal mining.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{responded by}} scoring three {{runs in the}} bottom of the fourth inning. With one out and no runners on the bases, Hafey hit a single. O'Farrell {{followed}} and hit a ground ball towards Koenig that he bobbled, enabling O'Farrell and Hafey to reach first and second base, respectively. Tommy Thevenow followed with a double to right field that got by Meusel, scoring Hafey and moving O'Farrell to third base. Cardinals' manager Rogers Hornsby then put in left-handed infielder Specs Toporczer to pinch hit for Rhem, who was done pitching for the game. Toporczer hit a fly ball to Earle Combs <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field,</b> upon which O'Farrell promptly tagged up to score another Cardinal run. With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate.|$|E
25|$|Demeter {{participated in}} the first ever old-timer's game hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He started <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> for the 1960s Dodgers. The 1950s Dodgers won the game 1-0 {{in front of a}} crowd of 48,227.|$|E
5000|$|The Cardinals led 3-1 in {{the eighth}} inning when Dom DiMaggio tied the game with a two-run double but was pulled from the game after pulling a {{hamstring}} and Leon Culberson took his position <b>in</b> the <b>center</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ballantine also {{sponsored}} the Philadelphia Phillies {{on radio and}} TV {{for many years in}} the 1950s and 1960s. The scoreboard <b>in</b> right <b>center</b> <b>field</b> at Philadelphia's Connie Mack Stadium (previously known as Shibe Park) sported a 60 ft Ballantine Ale sign.|$|R

25|$|Seven outfielders, {{including}} Demeter, {{were brought}} to the Tigers spring training facility in Lakeland, Florida. Demeter {{was one of the last}} players to sign his contract for the 1966 season, receiving a raise to $33,000. Unlike years past, Demeter's spot as everyday starter <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> was not guaranteed. By March, it was already being predicted that Demeter was going to lose his position to a young Mickey Stanley, who was described by Baseball Digest magazine as a defensive ace. Demeter had trouble with a sore right shoulder during spring training, requiring a cortisone shot. Eventually, it was officially announced that he had lost his slot <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> to Stanley.|$|E
25|$|Oriole Park {{underwent}} {{a round of}} significant renovations to enhance the fan experience in advance of its 20th anniversary in 2012. New features included new bars and dining spaces, improved sight lines, upgraded concessions {{and the addition of}} six bronze statues of Orioles legends <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the Dodgers traded Matt Kemp in December 2014, the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} the team figured to start Pederson <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> in the 2015 season. Baseball America named him the #8 {{prospect}} in 2015, and MLB.com ranked him the 13th-best prospect in baseball, and the #2 outfield prospect, going into the 2015 season.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton {{ended up}} {{starting}} {{most of the}} season <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> after an injury to Ryan Freel, but he was shut out in the voting for the Rookie of the Year, which was won by Ryan Braun. On December 21, 2007, the Reds traded Hamilton to the Texas Rangers for Edinson Vólquez and Danny Herrera.|$|E
25|$|He {{struck out}} as a pinch hitter in his Major League debut that night, against the Washington Nationals. He started <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field</b> the {{following}} day {{and picked up his}} first Major League hit on a single to right center off of Doug Fister in the second inning.

5000|$|Historians may note several {{distinguishing}} features of Forbes Field at the time. One is the [...] "Kiner's Korner" [...] inner fence in left field, with the 365-feet left field foul line marker observable {{on the outer}} wall, and the 335-feet sign on the inner fence. The other distance markers (376-457-436-375-300) are visible in some scenes. Other objects {{on the field of}} play at Forbes are visible from time to time, including the flagpole and batting cage near the 457 foot marker <b>in</b> deep left <b>center</b> <b>field,</b> and the Barney Dreyfuss monument <b>in</b> straightaway <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> The University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning is prominent in many shots filmed in Forbes Field.|$|R
25|$|Gailen {{played for}} Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifier. After not {{playing in the}} first game, he was a late-inning {{defensive}} replacement in the second game, but did not bat. Gailen started the third game <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field,</b> and hit a two-run {{home run in the}} 5th inning, while walking twice and scoring an additional run.|$|E
25|$|Kapler {{made the}} club, {{and began to}} see action <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> On April 5, 2008, he hit the first pinch-hit home run of his career for Milwaukee in the 7th inning of {{a game against the}} San Francisco Giants. Kapler started the season as the Brewers' hottest hitter, going 11-for-26 with 4 home runs and 11 RBIs.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the 1925 World Series the right field {{pavilion}} had also been double-decked, and the angling right field wall and its scoreboard were reconstructed to align with the low right field wall, about 8 feet inside of it. This also resulted in the unique inward-pointing 90° angle <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>field.</b> Both versions of the tall fence had the effect of keeping the neighbors in the adjacent row houses from watching the games for free.|$|E
