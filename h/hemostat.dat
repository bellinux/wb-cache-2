25|$|Temporary {{heat sinks}} are {{sometimes}} used while soldering circuit boards, preventing excessive heat from damaging sensitive nearby electronics. In the simplest case, this means partially gripping a component using a heavy metal crocodile clip, <b>hemostat</b> or similar clamp. Modern semiconductor devices, which {{are designed to}} be assembled by reflow soldering, can usually tolerate soldering temperatures without damage. On the other hand, electrical components such as magnetic reed switches can malfunction if exposed to hotter soldering irons, so this practice is still very much in use.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of May 14, 1912, Gregovich was at the Tonopah and Goldfield train depot to collect a grocery bill and had engaged a Doctor J. R. Masterson in conversation. [...] Mircovich {{had come to the}} depot from the {{cemetery}} to see who was arriving on the morning train. When he saw Gregovich on the station platform, Mircovich said, [...] "I will get you, you old son-of-a-bitch!" [...] He then stabbed Gregovich with a knife in the chest and groin, puncturing his lung and severing his femoral artery. Doctor Masterson was able to clamp the artery with a <b>hemostat</b> from his medical bag. Deputy Sheriff William Walker immediately apprehended Mircovich, who told him that the murder weapon was his and that Gregovich had taken his money. Despite the efforts of a team of doctors, Gregovich died of shock at 1:00p.m. at Miner's Hospital. At the Nye County Jail, Mircovich told Sheriff Ed Malley that he [...] "wanted to make John Gregovich die", although Malley did not advise him that such statements could be used against him in court.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAchieving {{hemostasis}} is {{a crucial}} focus of clinicians working in surgical and trauma settings. Topical hemostatic agents—including mechanical <b>hemostats,</b> active <b>hemostats,</b> flowable <b>hemostats,</b> and fibrin sealants—are frequently used in efforts to control bleeding, and new options such as hemostatic dressings, initially used in combat situations, are increasingly being used in civilian settings. To achieve successful hemostasis, a number of vital factors must be considered by surgeons and perioperative nurses, such as {{the size of the}} wound; bleeding severity; and the efficacy, possible adverse effects, and method of application of potential hemostatic agents. Understanding how and when to use each of the available hemostatic agents can greatly affect clinical outcomes and help to limit the overall cost of treatment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{kinetics}} of absorbable <b>hemostats</b> used for supporting the hemostasis and wound closure during surgical intervention. There are several types of <b>hemostats</b> of different composition therefore with different mechanism of action. Here, terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy is used for studying the absorption kinetics of the reactions between the hemostatic and the physiological saline solution (PSS). The reactions correspond with the changes of the THz radiation response measured in time. These time dependences are analyzed to find time constants for mathematical description of the hemostatic kinetics and the significant differences among all types of <b>hemostats</b> are found. The physiological saline solution is replaced by human blood in the additional measurement. Based on the results, we can compare the reaction rate {{of different types of}} <b>hemostats</b> that could be beneficial in the surgery practice. © 2016 IEEE.

50|$|Chitosan hemostats are topical agents {{composed}} of chitosan and its salts. Chitosan bonds with platelets and {{red blood cells}} to form a gel-like clot which seals a bleeding vessel.

40|$|William D SpotnitzSurgical Therapeutic Advancement Center (STAC), Department of Surgery, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA, USA Abstract: Fibrin sealant liquid was {{approved}} {{for use in}} the US in 1998 by the Food and Drug Administration as the first {{of a new generation of}} <b>hemostats,</b> sealants, and adhesives. The initial fibrin sealant liquid use in the country was limited by obstacles in the formulation&# 39;s ease of use (usability). Specifically, it was associated with cumbersome preparation, including thawing, mixing, and applicator loading. Although these challenges have been addressed to some extent, a new generation of fibrin sealants in the form of patches has been introduced, boasting significant efficacy as well as elimination of the liquid preparation complexities. Additionally, the patches may provide enhancements in efficacy because they are easily combined with manual pressure to arrest bleeding. In addition, usability has been increased because they may be stored at room temperature and they are provided in packages ready for immediate use. This review will highlight the capabilities of the two Food and Drug Administration-approved fibrin sealant patches and review the recent literature on fibrin sealant patch use.
