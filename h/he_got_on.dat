5|$|After leaving Barrow, McEvilly began {{training}} with Sligo Rovers of the League of Ireland Premier Division in June 2010. He made only one league appearance for the side, coming on {{as a substitute}} in the 2–1 defeat to Shamrock Rovers on 2 July 2010. In November 2010, {{he returned to his}} first senior club Burscough, signing a permanent contract with the Northern Premier League outfit. He made his debut on 11 December 2010 as a second-half substitute in the 3–2 loss against Bradford Park Avenue. Three weeks later, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the scoresheet for the first time during his second spell at the club, scoring both Burscough goals in the 4–2 defeat to Kendal Town. McEvilly went on to stay at Victoria Park for three months before transferring to Conference North side Droylsden along with goalkeeper Sean Lake in March 2011.|$|E
5|$|Lord Hailsham {{left his}} {{position}} in 1938 due to his failing health, {{and was replaced by}} Lord Maugham, who was appointed on 15 March. His appointment was done on Schuster's advice and was considered quite a surprise as he had no real political experience; even Maugham himself admitted he had not expected to be offered the job. Schuster and Maugham had a difficult relationship, especially after the start of the Second World War in 1939, due to their differing political opinions. Schuster did not play an active part in policy decisions in this period, partially because of his disagreements with Maugham and partially because Maugham preferred to work on legislation and policy changes himself. Schuster later said that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> with all of his Lord Chancellors except one—Maugham.|$|E

25|$|Spurrier had few {{opportunities}} {{to play and}} fewer to start early in his pro career, {{and he did not}} play very well when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the field. He attempted less than five passes over the entire season in three out of his first five years in the NFL, and he did not throw a touchdown pass until his third pro season. Instead, he settled into the role of backup quarterback and starting punter.|$|E
25|$|Linklater {{assembled}} the cast {{for two weeks}} of rehearsals in Austin, Texas before principal photography began in order to fine-tune the script. The result was a fusion of Linklater's writing, the novel and the actors' input. To prepare for their respective roles, Cochrane came up with his character five minutes before <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the elevator to work; Downey Jr. memorized his dialogue by writing it all out in run-on sentences, studying them and then converting them to acronyms; and Reeves relied on the book, marking down each scene in the screenplay to the corresponding page.|$|E

25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
25|$|The {{month of}} May began with United playing their 5th game in 18 days {{and with a}} back line that had one healthy centerback, Brandon McDonald. The other centerbacks, Emiliano Dudar, Dejan Jakovic and Ethan White, were all out due to injuries. Playing the hottest team in the league, the San Jose Earthquakes, the defenseless United {{surrendered}} 5 goals in a 5-3 defeat. The game started well for United with a goal by Dwayne De Rosario in the eighth minute. However, the disorganized United defense gave up three goals in a flurry before halftime, on goals by Chris Wondolowski, Steven Lenhart and Justin Morrow. United drew close, when Daniel Woolard scored a diving header in the 64th minute. San Jose soon pulled away as Wondowlowski and Lenhart each scored their second goal of the game. Although the game was out of reach, United fans were buoyed with a late goal by substitute Hamdi Salihi, in the 88th minute. Salihi, United's much-hyped offseason signing, scored {{for the first time}} in league play, when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the end of a long pass by De Rosario, and neatly chipped it over the diving San Jose goalie, Jon Busch.|$|E
25|$|Ledley {{scored in}} the first match of the 2006–07 season, the opener in a 2–1 win over Barnsley. He then scored several weeks later, as Cardiff City beat fellow {{promotion}} contenders Birmingham City, 2–0, to move top of the table. At this match Cardiff City had a full stadium, 20,000 fans, {{for the first time}} in over 45 years. This signalled their growing momentum in the league and the belief within the club that they were able to get promoted. Ledley was identified as one of the key players in Cardiff City's team, his pace on the left wing being vital to their tenacious style of play. On 25 September, Ledley scored in a 3–0 win over Southend United to confirm Cardiff's status as early season favourites. Cardiff entered the FA Cup at the third round and drew Tottenham Hotspur. The match ended 0–0 but Ledley had an excellent chance to put Cardiff City in the lead after 55 miuntes, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the end of a cross but hit his shot just over the bar. The match went to a replay and Tottenham Hotspur won 4–0 at White Hart Lane on 17 January. On 2 February Ledley suffered a hamstring injury in a 2–0 win over Barnsley. At the end of the season he picked up the Football League goal of the season award for his strike against Barnsley.|$|E

25|$|For D.C. United, {{the final}} month of MLS' regular season began {{the way the}} prior month ended -- with a victory, one that {{extended}} the winning streak to three games in a row. Following the midweek win over the Crew, United traveled to Toronto, where they faced a Toronto F.C. squad that had struggled since their star Giovinco was injured. Jozy Altidore, however, continued his hot streak. as he dribbled past both Birnbaum and Hamid and scored to stake the home team to a lead in the 36th minute. But, Neagle scored on a header three minutes later to level the score, when a goalmouth scramble forced a saved by the Toronto goalie that {{found its way to}} Neagle in front of the goal. Neagle made it two in the second half when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the end of a Sam pass and touched it beyond the keeper's reach. Pending the next day's Montreal Impact match, the win catapulted D.C. at least temporarily into 4th place in the Eastern Conference. The Toronto match was followed by a break for international games, and both Birnbaum and Hamid were called into the national team. Birnbaum made the trip to Cuba where he was a second-half substitute, but a kick to the face left him bloody and needing stitches.|$|E

[...] Shortly after the July dates, Barrett abruptly stopped recording, breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Corner and then going off on a drive around Britain in his Mini; he ended up in psychiatric care in Cambridge.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Henson's episcopate the Durham miners were on strike. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well with miners individually and conversed with many of them as they walked through the extensive grounds of Auckland Castle. It was said of him that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> easily with everyone [...] "except other dignitaries in gaiters". [...] Friction arose from Henson's belief that strikes were morally wrong because of the harm they did to other working people, and he had, in Grimley's words, [...] "a violent, almost obsessional", dislike of trade unions. His early concern {{for the welfare of}} the poor remained unchanged, but he regarded socialism and trade unionism as negations of individuality. For the same reason he was against state provision of social welfare, though a strong advocate of voluntary spending on it. Later in his bishopric Henson denounced the Jarrow March in 1936 as [...] "revolutionary mob pressure" [...] and condemned the action of his subordinate, the suffragan Bishop of Jarrow, who had given the march his blessing. He loathed class distinction, and was not antipathetic to social reformers, but he was strong in his criticism of Christian campaigners who maintained that the first duty of the Church was social reform. To Henson, the Church's principal concern was each individual man or woman's spiritual welfare.|$|E

500|$|Dodd {{was working}} on Bitter Springs as a tracker and {{interpreter}} for actor Michael Pate when Rafferty arranged {{for him to have}} an on-screen role. There was a positive relationship between the Indigenous Arrente people and the cast and crew, particularly Rafferty, involved in the location filming for Bitter Springs in the area of Quorn in northern South Australia. Michael Pate said that Rafferty [...] "wasn't a prejudiced person... Chips was a person who appreciated the Aborigine [...] very much... <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> very well with the people". Dodd, meanwhile, appreciated Rafferty's vision for an Australian film industry and its potential to provide opportunities for Indigenous Australians.|$|E
500|$|When {{speaking}} to Canadian music magazine Exclaim!, [...] Royce da 5'9" [...] confessed that [...] "Lighters" [...] was {{originally intended to}} be featured on Royce's fifth solo studio album, Success Is Certain. It was solely produced by Battle Roy. After Royce presented the track to Eminem, he was inspired to write his verse which prompted Royce to write his the day afterwards. Bad Meets Evil then flew to Los Angeles, where Mars heard the song. Along with Eminem, the latter made {{minor changes to the}} musical arrangement. Subsequently, Mars' vocals were added on the original cut. The singer joked saying that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the song after beating Eminem on a rap battle.|$|E
500|$|Michael Rutter in Maternal Deprivation Reassessed (1972), {{described}} by New Society as a [...] "classic {{in the field}} of child care", argued that research showed that it did not matter which parent the child got on well with as long as <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well with one of them, that both parents influence their child's development and that which parent is more important varies with age, sex and temperamental development. He concluded, [...] "For some aspects of development the same-sexed parent seems to have a special role, for some the person who plays and talks most with the child and for others the person who feeds the child. The father, the mother, brother and sisters, friends, school-teachers and others all affect development, but their influences and importance differ for different aspects of development. A less exclusive focus on the mother is required. Children also have fathers!" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{principal}} landmark of Home's term as Foreign Secretary {{was also}} in the sphere of east–west relations: the negotiation and signature of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well with his American and Soviet counterparts, Rusk and Andrei Gromyko. The latter wrote that whenever he met Home there were [...] "no sudden, still less brilliant, breakthroughs" [...] but [...] "each meeting left a civilised impression that made the next meeting easier". Gromyko concluded that Home added sharpness to British foreign policy. Gromyko, Home and Rusk signed the treaty in Moscow on 5 August 1963. After the fear provoked internationally by the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water was widely welcomed as a step towards ending the cold war. For the British government the good news from Moscow was doubly welcome for drawing attention away from the Profumo affair, a sexual scandal involving a senior minister, which had left Macmillan's administration looking vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} songs {{recorded}} for the album were [...] "Any Way The Wind Blows" [...] and [...] "Who Are the Brain Police?" [...] When Tom Wilson heard the latter, {{he realized that}} The Mothers were not merely a blues band. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa wrote [...] "I {{could see through the}} window that he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss—probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a [...] "white blues band", but... sort of.'" [...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the phone and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E
500|$|Livingstone {{describes}} himself as a socialist. In 1987, he stated that [...] "politics is my religion. It's my moral framework. I believe a socialist society is inherently the best thing, and that's like an act of faith." [...] In 2007, he stated that [...] "I still believe one day that the idea that the main means of production are owned by private individuals... will be considered as anti-democratic as the idea serfs could be tied to the land. But I will not be alive when that day comes." [...] Livingstone had always worked towards a unified socialist front on the British left, and disliked the tendency towards splintering and forming rival factions, usually over issues of political theory, among the socialist community. Although rejecting Marxism, throughout his political career he has worked alongside Marxist far-left groups and has become involved with the [...] "politics of the street". He has not worked with those Marxist groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party, who advocate the destruction of the Labour Party as the way forward for socialism, seeing their beliefs as incompatible with his own. Livingstone has consistently opposed the actions of the Israeli government. In a 2005 interview {{he said that he was}} not against the existence of Israel, but rather Ariel Sharon's government; he recalled that on his 1986 visit to the country <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> well with its left-wing politicians.|$|E
