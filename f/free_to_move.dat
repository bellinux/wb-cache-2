5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. Outside their breeding season, sea lions {{spend much of their}} time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
25|$|Association {{football}} and Gaelic football {{tend to use}} kicking <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the ball around the pitch, with handling more limited. Body tackles are less central to the game, and players are <b>freer</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around the field (offside laws are typically less strict).|$|R

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a {{six degrees of}} freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters in that it allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E
5|$|Metallic bonding can be {{classified}} {{as a type of}} covalent bonding for which the constituent atoms of the same type and do not combine with one another to form a chemical bond. Atoms will lose an electron(s) forming an array of positive ions. These electrons are shared by the lattice which makes the electron cluster mobile, as the electrons are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> as well as the ions. For this, it gives metals their relatively high thermal and electrical conductivity as well as being characteristically ductile.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> small distances along {{the underside of the}} tongue, while the majority of its length adheres to the underside of the tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E
50|$|A gang offers {{money for}} {{stealing}} the Édouard Manet painting La blonde aux seins nus (The Blonde with Bare Breasts) from the museum. The brothers agree {{to steal the}} painting. Louis steals the painting, while the young guard Rosalie (Vahina Giocante) is distracted. Rosalie comes after him, but Louis manages to lock her up. She is later <b>freed</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around on the ship. Although she is sometimes treated rudely, she likes the adventure. The police suspect her {{of being involved in}} the theft. She helps by hiding the painting and herself, when the ship is searched.|$|R

5|$|These growing {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis finally {{spilled over into}} open war in 1167, triggered by a trivial argument over how money destined for the Crusader states of the Levant should be collected. Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons, and the French king attacked Normandy. Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town {{to the ground and}} forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce. Henry was then <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> against the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still running high.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan. Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another cat with the same first part of their name, and very often will a warrior meet another cat with the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, {{while the rest of}} the clan is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into the warrior’s den, where the majority of the Clan sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors can take a mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life, or until they are old enough to retire.|$|E

50|$|While {{significant}} amounts of programming remain free, there is no assurance to viewers that any individual broadcast currently available free-to-air will remain so. Some will inevitably <b>move</b> <b>to</b> incompatible signal formats (such as MPEG 4:2:2, 8PSK, DVB-S2, or MPEG-4), change from <b>free</b> <b>to</b> encrypted, <b>move</b> <b>to</b> different satellite locations (often across bands, where C band reception requires much larger antennae) or shut down entirely.|$|R

30|$|Goharshadi and Hadadian [50] {{described}} {{the effect of}} particle size distribution on the viscosity of nanofluids. According to these authors, nanofluids with a wide particle distribution have better packing ability than those of narrow particle distribution keeping constant volume fraction. This suggests that a wide distribution of nanoparticle provides more <b>free</b> space <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around and eventually makes the sample less viscous.|$|R
25|$|Graphite is an {{electric}} conductor, consequently, useful in such applications as arc lamp electrodes. It can conduct electricity {{due to the}} vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers (a phenomenon called aromaticity). These valence electrons are <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is primarily conducted within {{the plane of the}} layers. The conductive properties of powdered graphite allow its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones.|$|E
25|$|When {{the game}} begins, the storyline follows a linear path, {{but at a}} certain point, the game world opens up, and the player is <b>free</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from planet to planet using the pirate ship, Dorgenark.
