40|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> (FGB) {{is a major}} {{emergency}} plant pest (EPP) of stored grain in Australia. Populations of FGB have recently developed high level resistance to phosphine (the only viable fumigant available for non-quarantine use) resulting in control failures with current dosage regimes. As there is no practical alternative to phosphine, failure to control FGB with phosphine places at risk market access for Australian grain worth up to 7 billion in annual trade. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop appropriate phosphine fumigation protocols to eradicate outbreaks of strongly resistant FGB. Research outcomes: - Characterisation of high resistance to phosphine in flat grain beetles (FGB) {{for the first time}} internationally. - Establishment of fumigation protocols and an eradication strategy that will enable industry to eradicate infestations of phosphine-resistant <b>flat</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and prevent or delay further selection for resistance to phosphine. - Development of a rapid test to detect highly resistant FGB. -Facilitate continued market access of Australian grain...|$|E

40|$|Managing stored {{grains and}} seed {{requires}} {{the use of}} various techniques to ensure the quality of the product entering the storage facility does not deteriorate over time. These techniques include: the use of sanitation, storing sound, dry grain, managing temperature and aeration, using chemical protectants, regular sampling, and the use of fumigation. Bin and storage facilities also {{play an important role in}} determining the quality of the stored grain. Storage facilities should be inspected regularly for deterioration of any type. Proper storage moisture varies depending on type of seed, length of storage and storage conditions. Seed moisture content changes until equilibrium is established with the surrounding environment. The equilibrium moisture is different for each kind of seed. High oil content seeds (soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers) will not absorb as much moisture as seed with a high starch content (wheat, barley, corn, sorghum). Oil does not absorb water; therefore, in a seed with 40 % oil the seed moisture will be concentrated in the other 60 %. The time to reach equilibrium will vary from days to months depending on the kind of seed, humidity and temperature. When there are large differences in seed moisture and the surrounding environment the initial change is rapid and slows as equilibrium temperature/moisture is approached. Over 60 species of insects infest stored grains.

40|$|Abstract: The total {{synthesis}} of (S) -(+) -ferrulactone (2), {{one of several}} synergistic aggregation pheromones produced by male <b>flat</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetles,</b> Cryprolesres ferrugineus (Stephens) was achieved in a five-step synthesis in very high optical purity (~ 99 % ee) and 17. 5 % chemical yield, starting from (S) -(+) -methyl- 8 -hydroxynonanoate (5) and a three-carbon Wittig reagent 11. The nine-carbon bifunctional chiron 5 was obtained from methyl 8 -oxononanoate via enantioselective r duction with Therrnoanaerobium brockii alcohol dehydrogenase (TBADH). A reliable and widely applied approach to the total {{synthesis of}} optically active biochemicals and pharmaceuticals {{involves the use of}} readily available chiral starting materials (chirons). 1 One time-tested method for producing novel chiral building blocks, particularly those not easily derived from common natural products, is enzymatic synthesis. 2 In preceding papers,sM we have introduced awide variety of chiral mono-and bifunctional aliphatic secondary alcohols that were efficiently produced by reduction of the corresponding ketones with the aid of Thennoanaerobium brockii alcohol dehydrogenase (TBADH). Besides the remarkably broad range of substrates reduced by this enzyme, excellent enantioselectivities were achieved in most cases. These bifunctional, chii alcohols are excellent building blocks that may be conveniently employed for syntheses of natural products containing chiral carbinol centers. We exemplified this approach by the employment of S-(+) -S-chloropentan- 2 - 01 in the total synthesis of (+) -(S,S) -(cis- 6 -methyltetrahydropyran- 2 -yl) acetic acid, 1, a natural constituent of the perfume material civet. 45 Of particular interest am the naturally occurring macrolides, 7 many of which contain a methyl carbinol moiety, frequently characterized by an S configuration (e. g. zearalenone, curvularin, brefeldm A, etc.).

40|$|The {{potential}} for using imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and indoxacarb (an oxadiazine) as grain protectants {{was investigated in}} bioassays against resistant strains of five stored grain beetles. The species investigated were Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (the lesser grain borer), Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (the rice weevil), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (the rust-red flour beetle), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (the saw tooth flour beetle), and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) (the <b>flat</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle).</b> Each of these species has developed resistance {{to one or more}} protectants, including organophosphorus insecticides, synthetic pyrethroids and the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene. Mortality and reproduction after a 2 -week exposure of adults to treated wheat depended on species, dose and insecticide. Imidacloprid had no effect on S. oryzae at any dose, but none of the other species produced any live progeny at 10 mg/kg. Indoxacarb had no effect on T. castaneum at any dose, but none of the other species produced any live progeny at 5 mg/kg. The results show that although both imidacloprid and indoxacarb can control at least four of the five key pests tested at doses comparable to those used for organophosphorus protectants, more potent neonicotinoid or oxadiazine insecticides would be needed than either of these to provide broad spectrum protection of stored grain...|$|E

A three-parameter nonlinear regression model satisfactorily described temperature profiles {{on each of}} the four mill floors and was useful in showing differences among floors in the number of hours taken to reach 501 C and hours above 501 C. Pitfall traps with food and pheromone lures and sticky traps with pheromone lures were used to sample adults of beetles and moths, respectively, between July 8 and December 1, 1999 to evaluate heat treatment effectiveness. A total of 32 insect species representing 26 families in seven orders were captured in traps. Immediately after heat treatment, there was 95 % reduction in total beetle captures in pitfall traps and 99 % reduction in moth captures in sticky traps. Trap captures of the almond moth, Cadra cautella (Walker) and cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (L.) were significantly reduced and remained low after heat treatment.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} a potential new method, solid phase microextraction (SPME) for detecting insect infestation in stored wheat. The {{results show that}} volatile pheromones isolated from the common stored grain insects {{can be used to}} indicate infestation. The amounts of pheromone released varied between species. This resulted in different sensitivity when SPME was used for detection. A single specimen of lesser grain borer, LGB (Rhyzopertha dominica) and red flour beetle, RFB (Tribolium castaneum) could be successfully detected in 1 kg of wheat whereas groups of 15 and 20 of rusty grain beetle, RGB (Cryptolestes ferrugineus Stephen) and <b>flat</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> FGB (Cryptolestes pusillus Schonherr) male beetles were required to be detected in the same quantity of grain. Extraction period and temperature affected the sensitivity of SPME method. Longer exposure time and higher temperature allowed more analyte to be collected. Consequently extraction for 4 h at 50 Â°C appeared to be the condition for extracting pheromone produced by the beetles covered by this study. The method was further adjusted to suit industrial condition and this resulted in changing the sensitivity. Detection of a single LGB can still be successfully achieved whereas for the remaining species, the minimum number of insects required had to be increased by about 40 - 60 % in order to detect VP in headspace. Method validation was conducted for LGB. The validation showed acceptable results since the method presented linear calibration curve, high accuracy, low detection limit and was specific to the pheromone of LGB. However, poor precision was observed due to matrix interferences. This was improved by using standard addition method. SPME {{can also be used to}} quantify the LGB pheromone by internal standard technique but no significant difference of pheromone amount produced relating to increased number of insects was observed. Therefore, it may not be used to predict the size of the population present in the matrix. Instead, a range of concentration can be established to estimate the population. Lastly, SPME also demonstrated potential to be used in the larger scale where a total of 7 males insects can be detected in 20 kg of grain...|$|E
40|$|Spinosad is a reduced-risk {{insecticide}} {{derived by}} fermentation {{from the soil}} actinomycete, Saccharopolyspora spinosa Mertz & Yao. Spinosad is currently registered in several countries as a grain protectant at a maximum labeled use rate of 1 ppm (1 mg a. i. /kg of grain) and with the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) or tolerance on grains set at 1 or 1. 5 ppm. Global launch of spinosad as a grain protectant is expected in the near future, pending final acceptance of international residue tolerances for spinosad by major grain importing and exporting countries. Spinosad effectively controls economically important beetle and moth pests associated with stored grain and is also effective against certain psocid species. Spinosad provides grain protection through control of adult and/or immature life stages of pest insects. The pest spectrum of spinosad under commercial grain storage conditions is still being defined, {{but it is clear}} from available laboratory and field evaluations on various grains that the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.); larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn); rusty grain beetle. Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens); <b>flat</b> <b>grain</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cry ptolestes pusillus (Schonherr); red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); confused flour beetle. Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val; Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner); rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton); Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier); almond moth. Cadra cautella Walker; and the psocid species Lepinotus reticulatus Enderlein and Liposcelis entomophila (Enderlein) are susceptible to spinosad and complete control is to be expected. Other pest species such as the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motchulsky; rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L); and sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L) are susceptible to spinosad to varying degrees, but their overall level of control remains to be verified under commercial grain storage conditions. Spinosad residues are highly stable on grains stored in bins, with a length of protection ranging from 6 months to 2 years. Numerous factors have been shown to impact the overall performance of spinosad, including insect pest species, pest life stage, grain type, grain variety, and formulation type. Spinosad possesses a unique mode of action in insects and controls insect strains resistant to other grain protectants. When launched globally, spinosad will represent a valuable new addition to the limited arsenal of grain protectants and can positively impact global food security. Its combination of high efficacy, broad insect pest spectrum, low mammalian toxicity, and sound environmental profile is unique among existing products currently used for stored-grain protection.

40|$|Graduation date: 1959 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the performance of four species of stored <b>grain</b> <b>beetles</b> in competition at three levels of moisture and temperature. The insects used in these tests were the granary weevil, the rice weevil, the saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and the red flour beetle. The experiments were conducted at temperatures of 90, 80, and 70 degrees Fahrenheit and at moisture levels of 15, 12, and 9 percent moisture content in two varieties of commercial wheat. Redmond variety commercial feed wheat was used for the majority of these tests. Several of the tests were duplicated using Idaed variety seed wheat. The competition studies were designed to test the performance of one species of <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> when reared in the presence of one or two other species. The procedure used was to obtain 50 adult insects of each species from stock cultures. These insects were picked at random and introduced into 250 gram samples of wheat in one pint containers and allowed to remain for one week. The initial adult population was then removed and the adult progeny were counted periodically to determine the size and time of appearance of the first generation. The following combinations of insects were tested: 1. Granary weevil and saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> 2. Granary weevil and red flour <b>beetle</b> 3. Saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and red flour beetle 4. Granary weevil, saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and red flour beetle 5. Rice weevil and saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> 6. Rice weevil and red flour beetle In addition to these combinations, all species of insects were reared alone in each test in order to compare the performance of the insects when in pure culture and when in competitive situations with the other species. The rice weevil was the best competitor of the four species and was less influenced by the presence of other species of beetles. The rice weevil has a wide range of temperature and moisture tolerance and, though considered a tropical species, it is a common and successful pest of stored grain in the Pacific Northwest. The granary weevil was a good competitor because of its capacity to attack whole grains but did riot do as well as the rice weevil, probably because of its lower reproductive rate and longer life cycle. The granary weevil and the rice weevil were well adjusted to the conditions of these tests because of their ability as primary feeders in whole grain. Competition between weevils and bran bugs (the sawtoothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and the red flour beetle) usually favored the bran bugs since the weevils chewed up the grain and made food material available to the bran bugs. In competition with weevils, the bran bugs usually appeared earlier than the former but ordinarily had smaller populations. In competition between bran bugs, the red flour beetle was almost always the dominant species. This was because of the ability of the red flour beetle to attack whole wheat grains and because of its extensive predation of the eggs and pupae of the saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle.</b> The saw-toothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and the red flour beetle usually produced larger populations {{in the presence of the}} rice weevil than when with the granary weevil. Where conditions of high temperature and moisture were present in the grain, mold often formed. The presence of the mold may have been favorable to the two species of bran bugs. It has been observed that when the granary weevil or the rice weevil is reared alone under high moisture conditions, there is considerable mold growth. When, however, the weevils are reared in the presence of one or two species of bran bugs, little or no mold is found. It is not known if the bran buns actually feed ori the mold but the results of these tests indicate that both species of bran bugs either feed on the mold or in some way inhibit its formation in grain at high moisture and. temperature levels.

PhillipsKnowing {{the factors}} that {{influence}} the distribution patterns, establishment and persistence of stored product insects aids {{in the development of a}} more effective pest management program in grain storage structures. This research focuses mainly on the insect communities of stored wheat and stored rice in two different geographical locations, their temporal relationships and the most important or abundant species within that community. Stored wheat was sampled for one season in Manhattan, KS and for rice stored in Beaumont, TX was sampled for two seasons. Hairy fungus beetle, Typhaea stercorea (Coleoptera: Mycetophagidae) was one of the most abundant species and was present in every bin of either wheat or rice and appeared to move into and out of the grain mass. In wheat bin, Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was a predominant species captured in the bin headspace, but was not frequently recovered in the grain mass. Headspace temperatures tended to be warmer than grain temperatures and outside temperatures. Other major insects recovered in wheat bin included the following groups or species: Anthicidae, Lathridiidae, Cryptolestes, foreign <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> Ahasverus advena (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), sawtoothed <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), smalleyed flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionoidea) and minute pirate bug Xylocoris favipes (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae). In rice bins, the predominate species were hairy fungus <b>beetle,</b> foreign <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and Angoumois <b>grain</b> moth Sitotroga cerealella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Angoumois grain moth was one of the most abundant species in rice, and was captured in the headspace as well as below the grain surface. Rice bins varied considerably in the relative abundance of different species between bins within a season and between seasons. Foreign <b>grain</b> <b>beetle</b> and hairy fungus beetle were especially variable among bins. Two species of weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) that are not grain pests, the sugar cane rootstock weevil, Apinocis deplanata and rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were present in high numbers in rice bins from September-December 2009...|$|R
