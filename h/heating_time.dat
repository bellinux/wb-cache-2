5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

This research {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effect of seed pretreatment potassium humate on its deterioration under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a 5 × 4 × 3 factorial experiment using completely randomized design with three replications. Experimental factors were three levels of potassium humate (control, one and two parts per 1000 potassium humate), four wheat varieties (Shirodi, Darya, Morvarid and Chamran) and five <b>heating</b> <b>times</b> (zero, 48, 72, 96 and 144 hours). Results showed significant differences in simple effect of variety and effect of potassium humate × <b>heating</b> <b>times</b> for shoot length; simple effect of <b>heating</b> <b>times</b> and effect of potassium humate × varieties for germination percent; effect of potassium humate × varieties × <b>heating</b> <b>times</b> for radicle length, shoot dry weight, seminal roots dry weight and seedling dry weight. Pretreatment of seeds by using 2 / 1000 potassium humate produced × longest radicle roots in Shirodi, Darya, Morvarid and Chamran respectively with 72, 72, 144 and 96 hours <b>heating</b> <b>times.</b> The highest root dry weight was produced by 2 / 1000 potassium humate and 48 and 72 hours of <b>heating</b> <b>times</b> on Shirodi and Chamran, respectively. Application of 1 / 1000 of potassium humate produced the highest seedling dry weight in Shirodi, Darya and Morvarid with 48, 72 hours of <b>heating</b> <b>times</b> and without <b>heating,</b> respectively. Results also revealed that different varieties responded differently to potassium humate treatment at different <b>heating</b> <b>times.</b> It can be concluded that longer heating durations affected wheat characters at early growth stages and pretreatment of seeds by potassium humate can decrease seed deterioration...|$|R

Methods: Full anthropometric profiles were collected from 107 lightweight rowers (n = 65 males, n = 45 females) competing in the Under 23 and Open age categories.

50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{resistance}} welding bonds: solid state, fusion, and reflow braze. In a solid state bond, also called a thermo-compression bond, dissimilar materials with dissimilar grain structure, e.g. molybdenum to tungsten, are joined using {{a very short}} <b>heating</b> <b>time,</b> high weld energy, and high force. There is little melting and minimum grain growth, but a definite bond and grain interface. Thus the materials actually bond while still in the solid state. The bonded materials typically exhibit excellent shear and tensile strength, but poor peel strength. In a fusion bond, either similar or dissimilar materials with similar grain structures are heated to the melting point (liquid state) of both. The subsequent cooling and combination of the materials forms a “nugget” alloy of the two materials with larger grain growth. Typically, high weld energies at either short or long weld times, depending on physical characteristics, are used to produce fusion bonds. The bonded materials usually exhibit excellent tensile, peel and shear strengths. In a reflow braze bond, a resistance heating of a low temperature brazing material, such as gold or solder, is used to join either dissimilar materials or widely varied thick/thin material combinations. The brazing material must “wet” to each part and possess a lower melting point than the two workpieces. The resultant bond has definite interfaces with minimum grain growth. Typically the process requires a longer (2 to 100 ms) <b>heating</b> <b>time</b> at low weld energy. The resultant bond exhibits excellent tensile strength, but poor peel and shear strength.|$|E
