5|$|Thoroughbred {{racehorses}} {{perform with}} maximum exertion, which {{has resulted in}} high accident rates and <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> such as bleeding from the lungs. Other health concerns include low fertility, abnormally small hearts and a small hoof-to-body-mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> in the Thoroughbred breed, and research is ongoing.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> during first-half pregnancy. Study design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Material and Method: The 255 singleton pregnant women < 20 weeks of gestation were enrolled. They {{were asked to complete}} a self-administered questionnaire which included Thai GHQ- 30 (mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> screening tool) and frequent psychosocial stressor forms. The prevalence and factors associated with mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> were evaluated. Main outcome measurement: The prevalence of mental <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> Results: The prevalence of mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> was 17. 3 %. Factors independently associated with mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> included worrying about health, stress of taking care of other family members and financial problem with adjusted OR 3. 5 (95 % CI 1. 16, 10. 74), 3. 8 (95 % CI 1. 80, 7. 89) and 3. 2 (95 % CI 1. 34, 7. 53) respectively. Conclusion: The prevalence of mental <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> was 17. 3 %.

5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E

Whilst malaria was perceived by the local people {{to be a major}} <b>health</b> <b>problem,</b> knowledge about the mode of transmission and correct treatment for malaria was relatively low.

50|$|Perceived {{susceptibility}} {{refers to}} subjective {{assessment of risk}} of developing a <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> The <b>health</b> belief model predicts that individuals who perceive that they are susceptible to a particular <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> will engage in behaviors to reduce their risk of developing the <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> Individuals with low perceived susceptibility may deny that they {{are at risk for}} contracting a particular illness. Others may acknowledge the possibility that they could develop the illness, but believe it is unlikely. Individuals who believe they are at low risk of developing an illness are {{more likely to engage in}} unhealthy, or risky, behaviors. Individuals who perceive a high risk that they will be personally affected by a particular <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> are more likely to engage in behaviors to decrease their risk of developing the condition.|$|R
