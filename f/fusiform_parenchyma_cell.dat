40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{account is}} given of the parenchyma-like tangential bands, as {{seen on the}} transverse surface of Miconia species. The bands consist of <b>parenchyma</b> strands, <b>fusiform</b> <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> and fibres. These fibres differ from the fibres of the ground tissue in wall thickness, lumen diameter and sometimes in pit size. In the bands intermediate forms between <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> and fibres occur. The functional relationship between the elements forming the parenchyma-like bands is discussed. The systematic value of this phenomenon is still uncertain. In other genera of the Melastomataceae, however, {{as well as in}} other families of the Myrtales it has also been observed...|$|R
30|$|Focussing on {{four types}} of <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cell</b> around pith regions of {{branches}} of Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis, we examined the timing and role of cell death during heartwood formation. Large <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> that were located in the inner part of the pith died within a year. By contrast, other <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> died within 4  years, with the timing of cell death {{depending on the type}} of <b>cell.</b> Axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> of the xylem close to the pith died first. Then, small <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> died in the perimedullary zone in the outer part of the pith. Finally, ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in the xylem close to the pith died. Variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls, which might have been due to deposition of heartwood substances, were observed first in xylem ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> and small <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in the perimedullary zone. Our results indicate that the initiation of heartwood formation occurs within 4  years in pith regions of branches in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis. Moreover, it appears that not only xylem ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> but also small <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in the perimedullary zone might be involved in the synthesis of heartwood substances.|$|R

30|$|By {{contrast}} to the above observations, there were no clear variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls of axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in LH- 1 samples (Fig.  5 b). However, we did observe the disappearance of starch grains from axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> during cell death (Fig.  4 e). It has been suggested that, in Cryptomeria japonica, axial and ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in xylem might synthesize and accumulate different kinds of heartwood substances [13, 25]. Nobuchi and Harada [26] reported differences {{in terms of the}} ultrastructural changes during heartwood formation between axial and ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in xylem. These observations together suggest that axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> might play a different role in heartwood formation from that of ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> and perimedullary cells in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis.|$|R
30|$|Rates of {{survival}} of ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> {{were calculated for}} each annual ring.

30|$|Heartwood {{formation}} in temperate zone trees {{results from the}} death of xylem <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> {{that is associated with}} the annual life cycle of the tree. The death of xylem <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> progresses from the inner toward the outer region of the stem. Therefore, the death of xylem <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> might be expected to begin in the tissues at the center of branches and stems, where the pith, consisting of <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells,</b> is located [6]. If this hypothesis is correct, the <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in the pith might be involved in the initiation of heartwood formation. However, the site of initiation of heartwood formation remains to be identified.|$|R
40|$|The {{length and}} breadth of the cambial {{initials}} and their derivatives have been examined in Polyalthia longifolia, a tropical tree possessing non-storied cambium. Taking the average size of the initials and the elements originating from them, most of the sieve-tube elements {{have been found to}} be slightly shorter in length than the fusiform initials. On the other hand, a few of these are still shorter - almost half of the fusiform initials, due to transverse or somewhat oblique divisions in the sieve element mother cells. The vessel elements are slightly shorter but 5 - 6 times wider than the <b>fusiform</b> initials. The <b>parenchyma</b> strands, in phloem comprising cells storing starch or tannin (pps), in xylem accumulating starch only (ssps), are more or less equal to fusiform initials indicating that the xylem and phloem mother <b>cells</b> forming <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> have not undergone any major change except for transverse divisions. The individual vessel-associated <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> (v. a. p. cells) are wider but much shorter in length as compared to the starch-storing <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> (s. s. p. cells) indicating that more transverse divisions have occured in the strands of the former than those of the latter. Among all the cambial derivatives, the fibers exhibit maximum increase in length, due to intrusive growth. The ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> are slightly longer than the ray initials possibly due to the elongation of these initials during their transformation into vascular ray cells...|$|R

30|$|Wood {{consists}} of {{several kinds of}} secondary xylem cell that {{have a variety of}} functions. Cell death plays a critical role in the determination of the function of secondary xylem cells. Long-lived xylem ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> (ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells)</b> retain their organelles for several years or decades, and they play important roles in the storage and radial transport of materials [1, 2]. In addition, ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> are involved in the heartwood formation and they synthesize heartwood substances, such as polyphenols, that contribute to resistance to decay and the color and odor of wood, prior to their death [3 – 6]. In previous studies, we investigated the death of ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> as a model of the death of long-lived xylem cells in situ. The death of ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> does not occur successively even within the same radial cell lines of a ray, suggesting that the death of ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> might not be controlled in a time-dependent manner [7 – 9]. Thus, the mechanism of the death of ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> might differ from that of the time-dependent programmed cell death of short-lived tracheary elements [10, 11].|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{localization}} of starch granules in culm, it can {{be observed}} that most starch granules localized in the <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells,</b> around nuclei or close to <b>cell</b> walls.

30|$|Changes in the {{morphology}} {{and functions}} of vacuoles provide useful information about the mechanism of cell death. In the present study, we monitored the morphology and contents of vacuoles during the death of ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in the conifer Cryptomeria japonica. In differentiating xylem, ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> had large central vacuoles. In sapwood, vacuoles in ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> contained proteins, an indication {{that one of the}} main functions of these vacuoles might be protein storage. A dramatic decrease in the protein content of some vacuoles was detected in the intermediate wood before the initiation of vacuole rupture. Although vacuole rupture was detected from the intermediate wood to the outermost heartwood, some vacuoles were obviously enlarged in the inner intermediate wood. Condensed nuclei were first observed after the rupture of these large vacuoles in ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells.</b> It seems plausible that the autolysis of the contents of ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> might be caused by the rupture of the enlarged vacuoles in the inner intermediate wood.|$|R

Various methods were employed to release intracellular substances from xylem <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> and all resulted in a reduction of supercooling ability. It was concluded that the reduction of supercooling ability primarily resulted from changes of intracellular conditions, including the release of intracellular contents or their mixing with extracellular solutions, rather than due to changes of cell wall structures.

These observations suggest that the main function of vacuoles in ray <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> might be storage of proteins from the outer part of the sapwood to the outer part of the intermediate wood. It was reported that PSVs contain hydrolytic enzymes and function in autophagy, even when proteins are accumulated [29, 31].

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the site of initiation of heartwood formation within the branches of Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis.

We examined the timing of the death of <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> in the pith and in the xylem close to the pith. In addition, we examined the distribution of storage starch in <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> around the pith because the amount of starch in xylem <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> generally decreases during the conversion of sapwood into heartwood [5, 8, 9].

Therefore, in this paper, we used fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy with spectrum analysis to analyze the changes in autofluorescence of cell walls due to lignin and deposition of heartwood substances.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Lignin and {{hemicelluloses}} are {{the major}} components limiting enzyme infiltration into cell walls. Determination of the topochemical distribution of lignin and aromatics in sugar cane might provide important data on the recalcitrance of specific cells. We used cellular ultraviolet (UV) microspectrophotometry (UMSP) to topochemically detect lignin and hydroxycinnamic acids in individual fiber, vessel and <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cell</b> walls of untreated and chlorite-treated sugar cane. Internodes, presenting typical vascular bundles and sucrose-storing <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells,</b> were divided into rind and pith fractions. Results Vascular bundles were more abundant in the rind, whereas <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> predominated in the pith region. UV measurements of untreated fiber cell walls gave absorbance spectra typical of grass lignin, with a band at 278 nm and a pronounced shoulder at 315 nm, assigned {{to the presence of}} hydroxycinnamic acids linked to lignin and/or to arabino-methylglucurono-xylans. The cell walls of vessels had the highest level of lignification, followed by those of fibers and <b>parenchyma.</b> Pith <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cell</b> walls were characterized by very low absorbance values at 278 nm; however, a distinct peak at 315 nm indicated that pith <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells</b> are not extensively lignified, but contain significant amounts of hydroxycinnamic acids. Cellular UV image profiles scanned with an absorbance intensity maximum of 278 nm identified the pattern of lignin distribution in the individual cell walls, with the highest concentration occurring in the middle lamella and cell corners. Chlorite treatment caused a rapid removal of hydroxycinnamic acids from <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cell</b> walls, whereas the thicker fiber cell walls were delignified only after a long treatment duration (4 hours). Untreated pith samples were promptly hydrolyzed by cellulases, reaching 63 % of cellulose conversion after 72 hours of hydrolysis, whereas untreated rind samples achieved only 20 % hydrolyzation. Conclusion The low recalcitrance of pith cells correlated with the low UV-absorbance values seen in <b>parenchyma</b> <b>cells.</b> Chlorite treatment of pith cells did not enhance cellulose conversion. By contrast, application of the same treatment to rind cells led to significant removal of hydroxycinnamic acids and lignin, resulting in marked enhancement of cellulose conversion by cellulases. </p...|$|R
