40|$|A {{recently}} proposed analytical hemodynamic model 1 [S. Fantini, NeuroImage 85, 202 – 221 (2014) ] is able {{to predict}} the changes of oxy, deoxy, and total hemoglobin concentrations (model outputs) given arbitrary changes in blood flow, blood volume, and rate of oxygen consumption (model inputs). One assumption of this model is that the capillary compartment {{is characterized by a}} single blood transit time. In this work, we have extended the original model by considering a distribution of capillary transit times and we have compared the outputs of both models (original and extended) for the case of sinusoidal input signals at different frequencies, which realizes the new technique of coherent hemodynamics spectroscopy (CHS). For the calculations with the original model, we have used the mean value of the distribution of capillary transit times considered in the extended model. We have found that, for distributions of capillary transit times having mean values around 1 s and a standard deviation less than about 45 % of the mean value, the original and extended models yield the same CHS spectra (i. e., model outputs versus frequency of oscillation) within typical experimental errors. For wider capillary transit time distributions, the two models yield different CHS spectra. By assuming that Poiseuille's law is valid in the capillary compartment, we have related the distribution of capillary transit times to the distributions of capillary lengths and capillary speed of blood flow to calculate the average <b>capillary</b> and venous <b>saturations.</b> We have found that, for standard deviations of the capillary transit time distribution that are less than about 80 % of the mean value, the average <b>capillary</b> <b>saturation</b> is always larger than the venous saturation.

40|$|Knowledge of {{moisture}} storage capacity above the hygroscopic range is essential when calculating moisture, especially when different materials {{are to be}} connected. Generally, the storage capacity is represented by water retention curves, in which suction is plotted against the moisture content.

This was based on an estimate of <b>capillary</b> <b>saturation</b> based on a mean of arterial versus peripheral venous blood gas measurements. Since estimation of hypoxia is usually now based either on arterial blood gas measurement or pulse oximetry, this is probably an overestimate, with evidence that levels of 2.0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin may reliably produce cyanosis. Since, however, the presence of cyanosis is dependent upon there being an absolute quantity of deoxyhemoglobin, the bluish color is more readily apparent in those with high hemoglobin counts than it is with those with anemia. Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin. When signs of cyanosis first appear, such as on the lips or fingers, intervention should be made within 3-5 minutes because a severe hypoxia or severe circulatory failure may have induced the cyanosis.|$|R

The analysis is focused to small salt concentrations, having practically negligible effect on the material porosity but significantly increasing hygroscopic moisture content of the bricks. The simply experiment, consisting in monitoring of isothermal one-dimensional capillary uptake and following drying was carried out for salt free and salt contaminated bricks. Tests were done for two different salt concentrations. The moisture uptake and release during the tests was determined by weighting the samples. The experimental results were compared with numerical simulation {{of the process of}} drying. In the simulations, desorption curves, measured from capillary moisture content were used as moisture storage functions. Within the hygroscopic range, moisture transport was specified by water vapor permeability, determined from standard cup measurements. Beyond the hygroscopic range, moisture diffusivity function, obtained from absorption coefficient for water and <b>capillary</b> <b>saturation</b> water content, was used for simulation of moisture transport. On the basis of the comparison, the effect of salt contamination on moisture transport parameters was evaluated.

Comparisons of these differential formulations are theoretically and numerically presented for the first time. It is shown that the global pressure-saturation formulation is the most efficient one from the computational {{point of view in}} the complexity of these three-phase curves that compli-cates the derivation of the global pressure-saturation form for the former case. In the two-phase flow, the governing equations can be written in terms of a global pressure and the case where the three-phase relative permeability and <b>capillary</b> <b>saturation</b> without any hypothesis [1, 8, 14].

The aim of this study has been to perform experiments where transient movement of interfaces can be monitored and to determine interfacial variables and quantities under transient conditions. We have performed two-phase flow experiments in a transparent micromodel. Specific interfacial area is defined, and calculated from experimental data, as the ratio of the total area of interfaces between two phases per unit volume of the porous medium. Recent studies have shown that all drainage and imbibition data points for <b>capillary</b> pres-sure, <b>saturation,</b> and specific interfacial area fall on a unique surface. But, up to now, almost all micromodel studies of two-phase flow have dealt with quasi-static or steady state flow conditions. Thus, only equilibrium properties have been studied.

Furthermore, we use our experimental results to obtain average (macroscale) velocity of fluid-fluid interfaces and the rate of change of specific interfacial area as a function of time and space.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} GDL water {{transport}} model based on measurable material specific properties. Therefore the Moisture Diffusion model was chosen as modelling approach and the required input parameter were determined experimentally. <b>Capillary</b> pressure <b>saturation</b> curves of the analysed materials show a wide hysteresis. Positive capillary pressures are needed to push water into the pores of a GDL. Once the water is fixed inside of a pore negative capillary pressures are required to remove the water completely. The examinations of effective permeability show that pressure drop over GDL thickness is dominated by the micro porous layer if typical liquid water flow rates are applied. The pressure drop in the GDL substrate is very low resulting in a low liquid water saturation. Additional to the ex-situ determinations in-situ tests were conducted. The results show that under wet operating conditions higher liquid water saturations are achieved compared to the ex-situ permeability measurements with equivalent liquid water flow rates. The higher liquid water saturation observed in in-situ tests is caused by condensation of water inside the GDL. The experimentally found data were used to conduct different simulations. The simulation results show that the modelling approach typically used in literature leads to very low saturations, analogue to the permeability measurements. In consequence the model was expanded by the drainage part of the <b>capillary</b> pressure <b>saturation</b> hysteresis which is applied for condensed water instead of the filling curve. This is to reflect that filling of a pore due to condensation occurs from inside out and thus is not depending on capillary pressure.

In this relationship, {{the difference between}} the two fluid pressures is called dynamic capillary pressure, and is assumed to be a function of saturation and its time rate of change. The dependency is through a so-called damping coefficient. In this work, this proportionality between <b>capillary</b> pressure and <b>saturation</b> rate of change is investigated using a pore-scale network model.
