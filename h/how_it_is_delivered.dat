Furthermore, TPD delivered with greater levels of teacher collaboration, active learning and longer duration also increases, in many countries and economies, the likelihood of teachers reporting using a large number of these strategies. In contrast, teachers’ exposure to TPD involving other teachers from the school (i. e. with collective participation) seems to be specifically detrimental for active teaching methods. The paper discusses the prevalence of these features, national gaps in their exposure and policy implications derived from these findings...|$|R

30|$|The {{notion of}} {{provenance}} had been originally introduced {{to document the}} origin, history, chain of custody, derivation, or process of art objects. When we use provenance {{in the field of}} information technology, the dual of the art object is the data. Usually, when data item is processed and transmitted across large-scale systems, the provenance size may largely exceeds the size of the data themselves; for example, Jayapandian et al. report that in the MiMI system, for data with size of 270 MB, the provenance for the data is approximately equal to 6 GB [12]. Therefore, in order to limit the provenance size, different provenance systems retain only certain provenance information. In the context of WSNs, the provenance of a data packet refers to where the packet is produced and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>delivered,</b> e.g., forwarded and/or aggregated, to the base station (BS) [14].

40|$|Purpose – This {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{organization}} of the UAE educational system, its components, their goals, and finally their effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach – Three elements of the UAE education system were examined: the development; delivery; and evaluation and feedback. Findings – On analysis, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> found that there is poor alignment among what the system <b>was</b> developed for, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>delivered,</b> and what <b>was</b> evaluated. In order to align this system significant efforts are needed to ensure that extensive documentation in terms of teachers' guides, training sessions for teachers and supervisors, and relevant evaluation instruments must be designed with systems thinking as the guide. Research limitations/implications – An orientation to goals rather than textbooks, to systems thinking, and to the vision developed for the system (and perhaps some form of strategic feedback to the respective committees established in the structural framework delineated by the ministry) might be worth consideration to erase the misalignment indicated by this research. Originality/value – This paper will be of interest to those involved in education and in particular, those involved in the education system within the UAE...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this system}} was to use and display {{existing}} ski access data {{in a new way}} to create business as well as social enhancement opportunities for resorts and their guests. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enabled passes, were used as input mechanisms captured by a scanner on snow at various locations. Each scan was stored in a relational database and information extracted from this was shown to a user via a webpage. A comparative analysis of two major resorts, both of which are currently using RFID ticket technology was used to assess what information was currently provided to guests and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>delivered.</b> This analysis <b>was</b> used to identify areas for future growth and development of an improved system. The use of these services was often more of an after-ski activity rather than during (Jambon and Meillon, 2009).

The significance of this improved solution enabled a resort to differentiate itself from competitors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} to what extent written corrective feedback (WCF) is a good way to treat errors that L 2 (second language) pupils make and if they attend to the comments in future written assignments. WCF is the most used response on written assignments. Some research takes the perspective that it is fruitful (Chandler 2003, Ferris 2003) while other research argues that it is inefficient and unnecessary (e. g. Truscott 1996, 1999). This study presents the findings of a survey on the topic which was conducted at a small school in the south east of Sweden. A comparison between previous research and the findings of the present survey is made and the conclusion from this is that there are limitations in the efficacy of WCF and the results suggest that the type of feedback and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>delivered</b> are important. It is also likely to be beneficial that pupils revise their texts in order to improve in writing English. ...|$|E
40|$|Among {{strategies}} to prevent HIV, other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancies, are programs that promote sexual abstinence among adolescents. However, {{literature suggests that}} there may be differences in the understanding of abstinence across adolescents, and this study sought to explore the understanding of sexual abstinence among both male and female learners in a secondary school in a semi-rural area of North West Province, South Africa. Focus group discussions were used to collect data from learners who were in grades 8 – 10 {{at the time of the}} study. The findings are that the learners in this area understand sexual abstinence as the decision not to have sex, and this was associated with prevention of HIV, STIs and unwanted pregnancies, which ensures a better future. Barriers to sexual abstinence include peer pressure, myths and wrong perceptions about sex, influence of drugs and alcohol and the influence of television.
