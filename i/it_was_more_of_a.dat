5|$|Episode IIs soundtrack {{was first}} {{released}} as an album on July 7, 2004 as Xenosaga II: Jenseits Von Gut und Böse Movie Scene Soundtrack by Victor Entertainment. Including only Kajiura's work, the album spans two discs and 40 tracks {{and has a}} duration of 1:52:26. Another soundtrack album for the game, Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse Soundtrack, was released by Namco and Brady Games as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game. The 11-track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe, instead sampling Kajiura's pieces. Released on February 17, 2005, the album has a duration of 30:25. The Movie Scene album reached position #46 on the Japanese Oricon charts. In the liner notes for Movie Scene Soundtrack, Kajiura claims that she felt that her work for the game was different from her previous pieces, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> soundtrack, with the individual tunes fitting more closely together. She also said that she {{found it easier to}} compose tracks that fit with the worldview that Mitsuda had created for the first game, rather than invent her own. She also notes that she intended tracks 1—4 to be a single, continuous piece, although they were broken up in the game; she intended tracks 20 and 21 the same way.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me {{out as soon}} as I walked out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham when I went out there, and he did test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E
25|$|Cardiff Cricket Club was {{established}} in 1819. The club initially played on various cricket grounds, mostly in eastern Cardiff, due to better drainage. The club then moved to Cardiff Arms Park, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlemen's club, rathar that a sports club. By 1867 the Bute Estate agreed that the cricket club could rent {{the eastern part of}} the Arms Park at only one shilling per annum. By April 1875 the Bute Estate decided to restrict access to the Arms Park to Cardiff Cricket Club and other recognised clubs.|$|E

2500|$|Franklin's {{letter to}} her parents in January 1939 is often taken as {{reflecting}} her own prejudiced attitude {{and that she was}} [...] "not immune to the sexism rampant in these circles." [...] In it she remarked one lecturer as [...] "very good, though female." [...] But as Maddox explains, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> circumstantial comment rather than a gender bias. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an admiration because at the time woman teachers of science were a rarity. She in fact laughed at men who were embarrassed by the appointment of the first female professor Dorothy Garrod.|$|R
25|$|The first {{interactive}} movie laserdisc {{video game}} was Sega's Astron Belt, unveiled in 1982 and released in 1983, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shooter game presented as an action movie using full motion video. A more story-driven interactive movie game was Bega's Battle, released in 1983, which combined shooting stages with interactive anime cutscenes, where player input {{had an effect}} on the game's branching storyline. Time Gal (1985), in addition to featuring quick time events, added a time-stopping feature where specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time; during these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose one.|$|E
25|$|Boro still hadn't {{registered}} {{a league}} win {{by the time}} their fourth round tie came around, while their opponents Wolverhampton Wanderers sat top of the Football League Championship. Considering the two sides' recent form and with Middlesbrough playing away from home, many pundits were predicting a home win. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shock then that Middlesbrough were the side to advance through to the fifth round courtesy of a 2–1 victory. Boro winger Adam Johnson spurned several chances before Afonso Alves chipped the goalkeeper on the stroke of half-time. Wolves headed home an equaliser in the second half, but substitute Marvin Emnes fired in off the post seven minutes from time.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Athens, Tryfonos {{attended}} the Athens auditions for the first season of Greek Idol. There she received all yes votes from the judges along with praise, while judge Kostas Kapetanidis predicted {{that she would be}} in the top ten. Tryfonos initially did not want to audition for the show, but did so after encouragement from family and friends, as well as after having viewed a television commercial for the show; producers called her back the next day. She had not told anyone she was auditioning besides her brother and best friend, and instead told her parents about it shortly before the first episode was set to air. Tryfonos had also previously auditioned for the second season of rival Greek talent competition The X Factor, and passed the audition phase before ultimately being cut before the live shows. In response, she later stated that {{she did not want to}} join any reality show as she did not want to be judged on anything other than her voice, but auditioned for Greek Idol as she believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple talent show. Throughout the competition, she was considered a favourite to win. Recalling her experience on the show later on, she stated that she thought she would make it as a finalist onto the live shows with some difficulty, but never expected to win the completion. Following recall rounds and ten live shows, Trifonos came first in the competition and won a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment Greece.|$|E

It's OK, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cultural phenomenon than a great movie." ...|$|E

Scott Rudin purchased the script, and set up production at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million—$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.|$|E
500|$|... "Harlem Shake" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics, who {{viewed it as}} an appealing dance track, although some felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novelty song. After the song became a hit, Mad Decent label head Diplo reached {{an agreement with the}} artists of the song's samples, which had not been contractually cleared before its release. However, according to Baauer, he has not received any of the money the song made because of the legal issues from not having properly cleared the samples. American rapper Azealia Banks released a remix to [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] on her SoundCloud page, which was subsequently removed at Baauer's request and led to a dispute between the two.|$|E

The most important Akkadian building in the city is called the [...] "Palace of Naram-Sin", which had parts of it built over the original Eye Temple. Despite its name, the palace is closer to a fortress, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fortified depot for the storage of collected tribute rather than a residential seat. The palace was burned during Naram-Sin's reign, perhaps by a Lullubi attack, and the city was burned {{toward the end of}} the Akkadian period c. 2193 BC, probably by the Gutians.|$|E

One year later, Argentine musician María Martha Serra Lima covered the song on her studio album of the same name which was also arranged and produced by Pérez. Pérez also proposed the song to be covered by Mexican singer Luis Miguel for his album Segundo Romance (1994). However Miguel rejected the song because he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ballad than a bolero.|$|E
500|$|As the Rhine {{passed the}} church, {{it made a}} sharp curve; this curve and the water where it and the old water rejoin, created a small island known as the Marlener Island.

[...] The island was thick with bushes and shrubbery. Beside this lay a larger island, known as the Erlenkopf (Erlen head), which supported a battery of artillery (known as Battery 2).

[...] The river by the bridge was approximately [...] wide, and by the exposed islands were about [...] wide.|$|E

500|$|In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert {{described}} Vitalogy as [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "very eclectic." [...] McCready agreed, saying, [...] "There is {{some weird}} stuff on there." [...] McCready attributed the album's sound {{to the group}} recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, [...] "Vitalogy {{is the first one}} where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly." [...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rhythmic album." ...|$|E

Group member Heidi Range revealed that the band {{wanted to write a}} song with which they could have fun; it was inspired by different situations experienced during a night out. Keisha Buchanan, another member of the Sugababes, told Digital Spy that she wrote 90% of the song but could not comprehend the meaning of the lyrics: [...] "I think it's because as I've got older I don't really relate to the lyrics. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fun song but I just don't really feel that attached to it any more." [...] Higgins, Xenomania and Jeremy Wheatley produced the song; the latter mixed it at the Town House Studios, London. [...] "In the Middle" [...] was programmed by Matt Duguid, Nick Coler, Tim Powell and Tim Larcombe.|$|E
500|$|Much {{criticism}} was leveled against the ambiguous ending. Tim Roth, who portrayed General Thade, said [...] "I cannot explain that ending. I {{have seen it}} twice and I don't understand anything." [...] Helena Bonham Carter, who played Ari, said, [...] "I thought it made sense, kind of. I don't understand why everyone went, 'Huh?' It's all a time warp thing. He's gone back and he realizes Thade's beat him there." [...] Although the ending was ambiguous, it was closer to {{the ending of the}} actual Pierre Boulle book than was the ending of the 1968 Charlton Heston movie version. In the first of two twist endings of the Pierre Boulle book, the astronaut escapes back to planet Earth, only to be greeted by a gorilla in a jeep on the landing strip. Burton claimed the ending was not supposed to make any sense, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cliffhanger to be explained in a possible sequel. [...] "It was a reasonable cliffhanger {{that could be used in}} case Fox or another filmmaker wanted to do another movie," [...] he explained.|$|E

At the state and local level, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a swing county.
