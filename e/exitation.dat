Lanthanides (chelated) are uniquely fluorescent metals, which emit thanks to transitions involving 4f orbits, which are forbidden, hence they have very low absorption coefficients and slow emissions, requiring <b>exitation</b> through fluorescent organic chelators (e.g. dipicolinate-based Terbium (III) chelators [...] ).

50|$|Alexandrov et al. (2008) {{published}} {{a variation on}} the thermofluor assay where SYPRO Orange was replaced by N-4-(7-diethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)phenylmaleimide (CPM), a compound that only fluoresces after reacting with a nucleophile. CPM has a high preference for thiols over other typical biological nucleophiles and therefore will react with cysteine side chains before others. Cysteines are typically buried in the interior of a folded protein as they are hydrophobic. When a protein denatures cysteine thiols become available and a fluorescent signal can be read from reacted CPM. The <b>exitation</b> and emission wavelengths for reacted CPM are 387 nm/ 463 nm so a fluorescence plate reader or a qPCR machine with specialised filters is required. Alexandrov et al. used the technique successfully on the membrane proteins Apelin GPCR and FAAH as well as β-lactoglobin which fibrillates on heating rather than going to a molten globule.|$|E
50|$|Americium-241 (241Am) is an isotope of americium. Like all {{isotopes}} of americium, it is radioactive. 241Am is {{the most}} common isotope of americium. It {{is the most}} prevalent isotope of americium in nuclear waste. Americium-241 has a half-life of 432.2 years. It is commonly found in ionization type smoke detectors. It is a potential fuel for long-lifetime radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Its common parent nuclides are β− from 241Pu, EC from 241Cm and α from 245Bk. 241Am is fissile and the critical mass of a bare sphere is 57.6-75.6 kilograms and a sphere diameter of 19-21 centimeters. Americium-241 has a specific activity of 3.43 Ci/g (Curies per gram or 117.29 Gigabequerels (GBq) per gram). It is commonly found in the form of americium-241 dioxide (241AmO2). This isotope also has one meta state; 241mAm, with an <b>exitation</b> energy of 2.2 MeV, and a half-life of 1.23 μs. Its presence in plutonium is determined by the original concentration of plutonium-241 and the sample age. Because of the low penetration of alpha radiation, americium-241 only poses a health risk when ingested or inhaled. Older samples of plutonium containing plutonium-241 contain a buildup of 241Am. A chemical removal of americium-241 from reworked plutonium (e.g. during reworking of plutonium pits) may be required in some cases.|$|E

40|$|A linear oscillatory system having {{multiple}} {{degrees of}} freedom with periodic coefficients is considered. The system involves three independent parameters: the frequency and amplitude of the periodic <b>exitation</b> and a parameter of the dissipative forces, the last two being assumed small. Instability of the trivial solution (parametric resonance) is investigated. For an arbitrary periodic <b>exitation</b> matrix and a positive-definite matrix of the dissipative forces, general expressions are obtained for the domains of fundamental and combination resonances. Two special cases of the periodic <b>exitation</b> matrix, frequently encountered in applications, are studied: a symmetric matrix, and a time-independent matrix multiplied by a scalar periodic function. It is proved {{that in the first}} case the system is subject only to fundamental and sum-type combination resonances; in the second caSe fundamental resonance and sum or difference type combination resonance may occur, depending on the sign of a certain constant. It is shown that in both cases the resonance domains in the first approximation are cones in three-dimensional parameter space. Examples considered are the problem of the dynamic stability of a two-dimensional bending mode of an elastic beam subject o periodic torques, and the problem of the stability of an elastic rod of variable cross-section compressed by a periodic longitudinal force. 0 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Derivation of emission line ratios and kinematics could then be misleading, if due correction is not made for the limited spatial and spectral resolutions of the observations. The aim {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate, with application to a long slit spectrum of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1358, how line intensities and velocities, together with modelling and knowledge of the point spread function, may be used to resolve the differing structures. In the situation outlined, the observed kinematics differs for different spectral lines. From the observed intensity and velocity distributions of a number of spectral lines and with some reasonable assumptions to diminish the number of free parameters, the true line ratios and velocity structures may be deduced. A preliminary solution for the nuclear structure of NGC 1358 is obtained, involving a nuclear point source and an emerging outflow of high excitation with a post shock cloud, as well as a nuclear emission line disk rotating in the potential of a stellar bulge and expressing a radial <b>exitation</b> gradient. The method results in a likely scenario for the nuclear structure of NGC 1358.
