5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol arrived <b>in</b> <b>Bucharest</b> {{and made}} his way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null.

However, as soon as she arrived <b>in</b> <b>Bucharest,</b> she became aware that things would not go well. Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.|$|E
