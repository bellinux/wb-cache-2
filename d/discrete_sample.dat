More generally, the range of values of the interpolated signal may be wider than the range spanned by the <b>discrete</b> <b>sample</b> values.

40|$|The {{distance}} {{function to}} surfaces {{in three dimensions}} {{plays a key role}} in many geometric modeling applications such as medial axis approximations, surface reconstructions, offset computations, feature extractions among others. In many cases, the distance function induced by the surface can be approximated by the distance function induced by a <b>discrete</b> <b>sample</b> of the surface. The critical points of the distance functions are known to be closely related to the topology of the sets inducing them. However, no earlier theoretical result has found a link between topological properties of a geometric object and critical points of the distance to a <b>discrete</b> <b>sample</b> of it. We provide this link by showing that the critical points of the distance function induced by a <b>discrete</b> <b>sample</b> of a surface fall into two disjoint classes: those that lie very close to the surface and those that are near its medial axis. This closeness is precisely quantified and is shown to depend on the sampling density. It turns out that critical points near medial axis can be used to extract topological information about the sampled surface. With this result, we provide a new flow-complex-based surface reconstruction algorithm that, given a tight ε-sample of a surface, approximates the surface geometrically, both in distance and normals, and captures its topology. Furthermore, we show that the same algorithm can be used for curve reconstruction...|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, the discrete-time Fourier {{transform}} (DTFT) {{is a form}} of Fourier {{analysis that}} is applicable to the uniformly-spaced samples of a continuous function. The term discrete-time refers {{to the fact that the}} transform operates on <b>discrete</b> data (<b>samples)</b> whose interval often has units of time. From only the samples, it produces a function of frequency that is a periodic summation of the continuous Fourier transform of the original continuous function. Under certain theoretical conditions, described by the sampling theorem, the original continuous function can be recovered perfectly from the DTFT and thus from the original <b>discrete</b> <b>samples.</b> The DTFT itself is a continuous function of frequency, but <b>discrete</b> <b>samples</b> of it can be readily calculated via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) (see Sampling the DTFT), which is by far the most common method of modern Fourier analysis.|$|R
