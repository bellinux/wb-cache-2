Dick’s father, {{who was involved in}} a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that {{he actually}} was a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates.

So many unsettling details about Leo come to light that Grace becomes uneasy and leaves the reception; Leo follows her. The two run into Katie in the lobby who tells them that The Today Show has scrapped the wedding segment because the judge who performed the ceremony was not licensed in New York so their marriage is not valid. Upon learning this, Grace tells Leo that she needs time to think about their relationship. Leo returns to the reception and announces to everyone that his marriage to Grace is not legitimate. Grace returns to the reception later, and reveals that she <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to marry Leo.|$|E

5|$|Alan Grant {{returned}} for a second outing to write Curse, about a grave digger who unleashed a 150-year-old curse onto Smallville, and Clark's attempt to put everything back the way it was. In Temptation, Clark used red kryptonite to try and impress Lana and Chloe after they become infatuated with a new, French foreign exchange student. Aspect released their final novel on March 1, 2004; written by Devin K. Grayson, City chronicled Clark and Lex's trip to Metropolis.

Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes.

However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there.

[...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin."

2500|$|Reading Lolita in Tehran is {{a memoir}} about {{teaching}} government-banned Western literary classics {{to women in}} the world of an Islamic Iran, which author Azar Nafisi describes as dominated in the 1980s by fundamentalist [...] "morality squads". Stories about the lives of her book club members are interspersed with critical commentary on Lolita and three other Western novels. Lolita in particular is dubbed the ultimate [...] "forbidden" [...] novel and becomes a metaphor for life in Iran. Although Nafasi states that the metaphor is not allegorical (p.35), she <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to draw parallels between [...] "victim and jailer" [...] (p.37). She implies that, like the principal character in Lolita, the regime in Iran imposes their [...] "dream upon our reality, turning us into his figments of imagination." [...] In both cases, the protagonist commits the [...] "crime of solipsizing another person's life." [...] February 2011 saw the premiere of a concert performance of an opera based on Reading Lolita in Tehran at the University of Maryland School of Music with music by doctoral student Elisabeth Mehl Greene and a libretto co-written by Iranian-American poet Mitra Motlagh. Azar Nafasi was closely involved {{in the development of the}} project and participated in an audience Q session after the premiere.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{the reverse}} {{situation}} to a novus actus occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved {{but the court}} nevertheless <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to hold the defendant liable. [...] In Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, [...] the plaintiff's mother consumed diethylstilbestrol as a miscarriage preventative. The medicine, later re-called from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture. However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market. [...] The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. [...] The {{court held that the}} defendant was liable in proportion to its market share. [...] They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a ‘risk based’ approach to liability. [...] The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm. [...] Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. [...] However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In R v Miller , the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.|$|E

Using psychokinesis, Annie animates a suit of armor and attempts to kill Emery with a halberd. Neither attack succeeds, and Joyce calms both individuals. [...] In an attempt to uncover the secret of Rose Red, Steve creates a telepathic link between Cathy and Annie, and Cathy begins to engage in automatic writing. Annie begins to draw pictures of boulders striking the house, smashed doors, and broken glass, and soon doors and windows {{all over the house}} are opening and closing violently and glass in the windows shatters.

60|$|Political liberty, let us repeat, {{consists}} {{in the power}} of criticising those flexible parts of the State which constantly require reconsideration, not the basis, but the machinery. In plainer words, it means the power of saying the sort of things that a decent but discontented citizen wants to say. He does not want to spit on the Bible, or to run about without clothes, or to read the worst page in Zola from the pulpit of St. Paul's. Therefore the forbidding of these things (whether just or not) is only tyranny in a secondary and special sense. It restrains the abnormal, not the normal man. But the normal man, the decent discontented citizen, <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to protest against unfair law courts. He <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to expose brutalities of the police. He <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to make game of a vulgar pawnbroker who is made a Peer. He <b>does</b> <b>want</b> publicly to warn people against unscrupulous capitalists and suspicious finance. If he is run in for doing this (as he will be) he <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to proclaim the character or known prejudices of the magistrate who tries him. If he is sent to prison (as he will be) he <b>does</b> <b>want</b> to have a clear and civilised sentence, telling him when he will come out. And these are literally and exactly the things that he now cannot get. That is the almost cloying humour of the present situation. I can say abnormal things in modern magazines. It is the normal things that I am not allowed to say. I can write in some solemn quarterly an elaborate article explaining that God is the devil; I can write in some cultured weekly an aesthetic fancy describing how I should like to eat boiled baby. The thing I must not write is rational criticism of the men and institutions of my country.|$|E
