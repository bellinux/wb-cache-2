25|$|A typical HDD has two {{electric}} motors; {{a spindle}} motor that spins the disks and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator {{at the end of}} the head support arm is the read-write head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 g.|$|E
25|$|Revox went {{one step}} further: after much {{hesitation}} {{about whether to}} accept cassettes as a medium capable for meeting their strict standards from reel-to-reel recorders at all, they produced their B710MK I (Dolby B) and MK II (Dolby B) machines. Both cassette units possessed double capstan drives, but with two independent, electronically controlled capstan motors and two separate reel motors. The <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> moved by actuating a damped solenoid movement, eliminating all belt drives and other wearable parts. These machines rivaled the Nakamichi in frequency and dynamic range. The B710MKII also achieved 20–20,000Hz and dynamics of over 72dB with Dolby C on chrome and slightly less dynamic range, but greater headroom with metal tapes and Dolby C. Revox adjusted the frequency range on delivery with many years of use in mind: when new, the frequency curve went upwards a few dB at 15–20kHz, aiming for flat response after 15 years of use, and headwear to match.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, IBM {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} HDD code-named [...] "Winchester". Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to [...] "land" [...] on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, [...] "taking off" [...] again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of [...] "Winchester technology" [...] drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the <b>head</b> <b>assembly,</b> leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later [...] "Winchester" [...] drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.|$|E

2500|$|Seek time is {{a measure}} of how long it takes the <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> to travel to the track of the disk that {{contains}} data. The first HDD had an average seek time of about 600ms;. [...] Some early PC drives used a stepper motor to move the heads, and as a result had seek times as slow as 80–120ms, but this was quickly improved by voice coil type actuation in the 1980s, reducing seek times to around 20ms. Seek time has continued to improve slowly over time. [...] The fastest server drives today have a seek time around 4 ms. The average seek time is strictly the time to do all possible seeks divided by the number of all possible seeks, but in practice is determined by statistical methods or simply approximated as the time of a seek over one-third of the number of tracks.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{simplest}} configuration, rather than playing {{a pair of}} stereo channels of {{each side of the}} cassette, the typical [...] "portastudio" [...] used a four-track tape <b>head</b> <b>assembly</b> to access four tracks on the cassette at once (with the tape playing in one direction). Each track could be recorded to, erased, or played back individually, allowing musicians to overdub themselves and create simple multitrack recordings easily, which could then be mixed down to a finished stereo version on an external machine. To increase audio quality in these recorders, the tape speed sometimes was doubled to 3¾inches per second, in comparison to the standard 17⁄8 ips; additionally, dbx, Dolby B or Dolby C noise reduction provided compansion (compression of the signal during recording with equal and opposite expansion of the signal during playback), which yields increased dynamic range by lowering the noise level and increasing the maximum signal level before distortion occurs. Multi-track cassette recorders with built-in mixer and signal routing features ranged from easy-to-use beginner units up to professional-level recording systems.|$|E
