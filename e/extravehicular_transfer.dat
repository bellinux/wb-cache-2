50|$|The Soviet Union first {{achieved}} rendezvous of Soyuz 3 {{with the}} unmanned Soyuz 2 craft on October 25, 1968; docking was unsuccessfully attempted. The first Soviet docking was achieved on January 16, 1969, between the manned Soyuz 4 and manned Soyuz 5. This {{early version of}} the Soyuz spacecraft had no internal transfer tunnel, but two cosmonauts performed an <b>extravehicular</b> <b>transfer</b> from Soyuz 5 to Soyuz 4.|$|E
40|$|The Orbiter Airlock Support Subsystem (ALSS) is {{designed}} to provide shirtsleeve intervehicular transfer (IVA) between the orbiter and payload spacelab. Also, the airlock provides for <b>extravehicular</b> <b>transfer</b> (EVA) of two crewman to space and/or unpressurized payload from a pressurized cabin environment. The orbiter airlock design permits three planned EVA's for periods up to 6 hr. The airlock {{is designed}} to be interchangeable in three different locations, in the crew cabin, attached to the cabin aft bulkhead or attached to transfer tunnel adapter both which are located in the cargo bay. The Orbiter Airlock Support Subsystem described herein provides ventilation, pressurization, depressurization, prebreathing, personnel oxygen system supply (POS), and Extravehicular Mobility Unit support (EMU). This paper defines the system configuration for each airlock location and the commonality between them. Emphasis is also placed on the design data used to define repressurization and depressurization requirements, ventilation, water cooling, wastewater discharge, flow rates, and valve sizing...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} utilizing a water-immersion simulator facility to better define the cargo that can realistically be handled by man. The initial phase {{of the program was}} a parametric study to define man's intravehicular (IV) cargo transfer capabilities, and its results are reported. Additional phases of the study, deal with: (1) man's ability to perform <b>extravehicular</b> (EV) cargo <b>transfer,</b> (2) the ability to transfer cargo through a 1. 5 m (5 -foot) diameter tunnel (IV), and (3) the utilization of electroadhesive/electromagnetic mobility aids for both IV and EV self-locomotion and cargo transfer...|$|R
