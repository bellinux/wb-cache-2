50|$|In {{order to}} ensure the {{positioning}} of the pilot and writing beams remained as constant as possible, the apple tube used a unique electron gun arrangement. The beams were produced from a single anode and two closely spaced cathodes, resulting in the beams traveling in slightly different directions. They were then magnetically focused so they crossed at a point {{just in front of}} the electron guns, where a single-slit aperture was used to clear up the signal to produce a sharp-edged <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> pattern. The deflection coils were positioned around the aperture, so by having both beams pass by the deflection coils while superimposed, the deflection of both was equal. The beams then spread out again on the far side of the aperture, where a second focussing arrangement ensured both were traveling parallel to each other.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} {{for the design}} of <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> {{reflector}} antenna is presented in this paper. By means of the basic principles of ring-focus antenna, a circularly symmetric feed and two specially shaped reflectors are used to form an <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> antenna. Firstly, the design process of this ring-focus <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> antenna is studied in detail. Transition function is defined and used in the design process.

40|$|A Low-Energy Undulator Test Line (LEUTL) {{is under}} {{construction}} at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). In LEUTL periodic focusing is provided by external quadrupoles. This results in an <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> with its betatron oscillation envelope varying along the undulators. The free-electron laser (FEL) interaction with such a beam will exhibit truly 3 -D effects. Thus the investigation of 3 -D effects is important in optimizing the FEL performance.

Both programs are fully 3 -D in moving the particle, but model the interaction between particles and axially symmetric electromagnetic waves. Even though TDA 3 D can include a few azimuthal modes in the interaction, it is still not a fully 3 -D FEL code. However, they show that these 2 -D programs can still be used for an <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> whose aspect ratio is within certain limits.

40|$|Propagation of {{circular}} and <b>elliptical</b> anomalous hollow <b>beams</b> in {{a turbulent}} atmosphere is investigated in detail. Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel integral, analytical formulae {{for the average}} irradiance of circular and <b>elliptical</b> anomalous hollow <b>beams</b> propagating in a turbulent atmosphere are derived. The irradiance and spreading properties of circular and <b>elliptical</b> anomalous hollow <b>beams</b> in a turbulent atmosphere and in free space are studied numerically. It is found that circular and <b>elliptical</b> anomalous hollow <b>beams</b> at short propagation distance in turbulent atmosphere have similar propagation properties to those of free space, while at long propagation distance, circular and <b>elliptical</b> anomalous hollow <b>beams</b> eventually become circular Gaussian beams in a turbulent atmosphere, which is much different from their propagation properties in free space. The conversion from an anomalous hollow beam to a circular Gaussian beam becomes quicker and the beam spot spreads more rapidly for a larger structure constant, a shorter wavelength and a smaller waist size of the initial beam.

40|$|The {{electron}} beams {{produced by}} two different welders were examined using computer assisted tomographic (CT) analysis. The machines used are Hamilton Standard welders with 150 kV/ 50 mA maximum. One machine uses a ribbon filament {{while the other}} uses a hairpin filament. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the beam power distribution on each machine to see if weld parameters could easily be transferred between machines. Beam focus, voltage, and current settings were pre-selected to duplicate the welding conditions used in LLNL program applications. The results show that the actual beam currents measured by Faraday cup are 5 to 10 % higher for the first machine and 30 % lower for the second. The CT analysis of the beam shapes shows that the hairpin filament welder produces an <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> shape in the sharp focus condition that defocuses to a diamond shape. The ribbon filament welder produced less of an <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> shape in the sharp focus condition, but when defocused, acquires an elliptical shape. CT analysis of the effects of defocus on the peak power density shows that the hairpin filament drops in peak power density much more quickly than the ribbon filament for a given amount of defocus. Furthermore, it was more difficult to find and repeat the sharp focus condition for the hairpin filament, particularly at higher beam currents...|$|E

40|$|The {{manifestation of}} point {{sources in the}} {{upcoming}} PLANCK maps is a direct reflection of {{the properties of the}} pixelized antenna beam shape for each frequency, which is related to the scan strategy, pointing accuracy, noise properties and map-making algorithm. In this paper we firstly compare analytically the three filters for the PLANCK point source extraction, namely, the adaptive top-hat filter (ATHF), the theoretically-optimal filter (TOF), and the so-called pseudo-filter based on wavelet technique. Our analyses are {{based on the premise that}} the experiment parameters the TOF and the pseudo-filter assume and require are already known: the CMB and noise power spectrum and a circular Gaussian beam shape and size, whereas the ATHF does not need any a priori knowledge. The analyses show that the TOF is optimal of them all in terms of the gain after the parameter inputs. On the other hand, the wavelet technique is only asymptotic to the TOF. We simulate the PLANCK HFI 100 GHz channel with <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> in rotation to test the efficiency of the TOF and the ATHF.

A variable slit located before the focusing optics allows to generate a nearly <b>elliptical</b> <b>beam</b> shape and also to reduce the effective numerical aperture of the beam along the shat axis of the ellipse. The focusing optics allows to focus the beam deep inside the sample, which is translated at a constant speed transversely to the writing beam direction. The influence of several experimental parameters (energy per pulse, slit width, processing depth) on the properties of the produced waveguides has been analyzed. The influence of the intrinsic properties of the material (refractive index, composition) has been analyzed by comparing results obtained in fused silica and Er:Yb co-doped phosphate glass. The results obtained show that this approach leads to the successful production of deep subsurface (up to 7 mm) waveguides with circular cross-sections.
