25|$|The BBWR {{government}} bloc won {{the highest}} number of seats (125 out of 444 in Sejm (Polish parliament) - 28.12% of the total, and 48 out of 111 in the Senate of Poland - 43.24% of the total); the opposition parties, however, gained a majority of the remaining seats, with the left - including Polish Communists - <b>doing</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than the traditional Polish Right. Groth notes that the elections showed a progressively increasing fragmentation of the Polish electorate; a steady and significant increase in the proportion of ethnic minority voting; the rapid rise of the Polish Socialist Party as a major force within the far less stable and cohesive Polish Left; and the substantial weakening of the Right by Piłsudski's supporters, as the BBWR, despite its claims of being above traditional party divisions in fact attracted support mostly from the Right.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who {{is worried}} {{that he will not}} be able to meet the 8% {{quarterly}} sales growth figures that Robert California (James Spader) asked for by about $800, starts to think of creative ways to sell more paper. During a conference room meeting, he proposes that everyone in the office buy paper to alleviate some of the burden, but no one is willing. He then decides to ask Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to make a rounding mistake in the books, but Oscar tells Andy that he does not have time to make the mistake because he is leaving for a trivia contest in a bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He tells Andy that the prize is $1,000 and his team is determined to win it. Andy, encouraged by Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), decides to take the entire office to Philadelphia in an attempt to win the money and make up the sales growth difference. At the bar, which turns out to be a gay bar called the Liberty Well, Andy divides the office into three teams: the A-Team consisting of Jim, Darryl, Andy, and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), the B-Team consisting of Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton), and Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad), and the [...] "Just For Fun" [...] team consisting of Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery). Oscar refuses to join Andy and stays on his original team. Initially, the Dunder Mifflin A-Team does well until they soon falter. However, much to Andy's surprise, the [...] "Just For Fun" [...] team (calling themselves The Einsteins) ends up <b>doing</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than expected because of the group's trivial knowledge on a variety of issues. Humorously, the team misses the answers to a handful of common questions, including one about their namesake. They make it to the final round against Oscar's team and eventually win thanks to Kevin's correct answers. However, the Just for Fun team's luck runs out when they later get demolished while trying to win another bar's even more lucrative trivia contest.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Leno was candid {{regarding}} {{his plans for}} his new show: [...] "Even though it's ten o'clock, we’re going to pretend it’s eleven thirty." [...] The Jay Leno Show premiered on September 14, 2009, featuring Jerry Seinfeld and Kanye West (just following his infamous rant against Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards) as guests. The program racked up 18.4 million viewers, <b>doing</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than O'Brien's Tonight Show debut in both overall numbers and young demographics. Critics were harsher to Leno's program, with many viewing it as a rehash of the show he had just left. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times called a commercial funnier than the show's whole, asking, [...] "This {{is the future of}} television? This wasn't even a good rendition of television past." [...] By the show's second week, with it airing directly opposite season premieres, The Jay Leno Show saw its audience size fall to six million viewers. As the weeks wore on, producer Vickers noticed that NBC's plan—to save the best segments, such as Leno's signature [...] "Headlines", for last, in order to provide a strong lead-in for local news—was possibly hurting the program. One month in, Leno often only made third place, and executives became more uneasy.|$|E

60|$|After {{about two}} miles’ ride we {{turned the corner}} of a slight rise, and there before us lay the camp. It is prettily {{situated}} {{on the side of a}} little valley, and faces the north. The 10th Native Infantry are encamped on the right wing; the Mountain Train occupy the centre; and the 3d Cavalry camp lies on the left. Behind the rise a plain stretches away, and upon this the troops will be encamped as they arrive. The soil of the valley-side and of the plain beyond is a mere sand, covered with grass and bushes, but in the hollow of the valley, where the stream runs, or rather used to run, it is a deep black peat. Wells are now being sunk in this peat, and these rapidly fill with water. There are still deep pools where the stream formerly ran, and dams have been formed, which will keep back a considerable supply of water. The troops are not, therefore, likely to fall short for some time, and if they should, there is plenty at a stream two or three miles farther on. The health of the troops is pretty good, but both officers and men are subject to slight attacks of fever, much more so than they were when encamped on the plain by the sea. This is singular, for except that the nights are rather cold, this feels the very perfection of climate. The horses and mules are <b>doing</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> up here, and although some died at first, it is probable that they had brought the seeds of the disease with them from the pass below. As it is, the cavalry have suffered terribly. The 5th Cavalry, out of five hundred horses, have lost one hundred and seventy, and the officers’ horses of the infantry and Mountain Train have been nearly exterminated.|$|E
