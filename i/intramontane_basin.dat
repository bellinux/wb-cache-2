40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} further {{constrain}} the tectonic {{configuration of the}} Tianshan fold belt and the blocks of its northern and southern sides prior to the Eocene India/Eurasia collision and to reveal their general kinematic characteristics after the collision, we carried out paleomagnetic study for Early Cretaceous rocks collected from the Turpan <b>intramontane</b> <b>basin</b> of east Tianshan, northwest China. A high-temperature component (HTC) with dual polarities can be isolated from most samples after progressive thermal demagnetization. Thermal demagnetization behavior and some rock magnetic features of the samples indicate that this HTC resides mainly in hema-tite. The positive fold and reversal tests suggest that the HTC may be a primary magnetization acquired at or close {{to the time of}} formation of the rocks. Similar to previous results obtained from Cretaceous rocks in western China, paleomagnetic results from the Turpan <b>intramontane</b> <b>basin</b> retain also the inclination shallowing relative to stable Eurasia. However, the anisotropy of mag-netic susceptibility (AMS) measurements showed weak anisotropy degrees for Early Cretaceous Shengjinkou sandstones from the Turpan Basin.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantification}} of total and partial (divided by time slices) sedimentary volumes in the Neogene basins of the Betic–Rif orogen. These basins include the Alboran Sea, the <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins,</b> the Guadalquivir and Rharb foreland basins and the Atlantic Margin of the Gibraltar Arc. The total volume of Neogene sediments deposited in these basins is ~ 209, 000 km 3 and is equally distributed between the internal (Alboran <b>Basin</b> and <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins)</b> and the external basins (foreland basins and Atlantic Margin). The largest volumes are {{recorded by the}} Alboran Basin (89, 600 km 3) and the Atlantic Margin (81, 600 km 3). The Guadalquivir and Rharb basins amount 14, 000 km 3 and 14, 550 km 3, respectively whereas the <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> record 9235 km 3. Calculated mean sediment accumulation rates for the early–middle Miocene show an outstanding asymmetry between the Alboran basin (0. 24 mm/yr) and the foreland basins (0. 06 – 0. 07 mm/yr) and the Atlantic Margin (0. 03 mm/yr). During the late Miocene, sedimentation rates range between 0. 17 and 0. 18 mm/yr recorded in the Alboran Basin and 0. 04 mm/yr in the <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins.</b> In the Pliocene–Quaternary, the highest sedimentation rates are recorded in the Atlantic Margin reaching 0. 22 mm/yr. Sedimentary contribution shows similar values for {{the inner and outer}} basins with a generalized increase from late Miocene to present (from 3500 to 6500 km 3 /My). Interestingly, the Alboran Basin records the maximum sedimentary contribution during the late Miocene (5500 km 3 /My), whereas the Atlantic Margin does during the Pliocene–Quaternary (6600 km 3 /My). The spatial and time variability of the sediment supply from the Betic–Rif orogen to basins is closely related to the morphotectonic evolution of the region. The high sedimentation rates obtained in the Alboran Basin during the early–middle Miocene are related to active extensional tectonics, which produced narrow and deep basins in its western domain. The highest sedimentary contribution in this basin, {{as well as in the}} foreland and <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins,</b> is recorded during the late Miocene due to the uplift of wide areas of the Betics and Rif chains. The analysis of the sedimentary supply also evidences strong relationships with the post-Tortonian crustal thickening and coeval topographic amplification that occurred in the central Betics and Rif with the concomitant evolution of the drainage network showing the fluvial capture of some internal basins by rivers draining to the Atlantic Ocean (the ancestral Guadalquivir).

40|$|Marine Lower-Upper Miocene {{deposits}} uplifted to > 2 km elevation in the Tauride {{mountains of}} southern Turkey are taken as {{evidence for the}} rise of a nascent plateau. The dynamic causes of this uplift are debated, but generally thought to be a regional dynamic topographic effect of slab motions or slab break-off. Immediately adjacent to the high Tauride mountains lie the Central Tauride <b>Intramontane</b> <b>Basins,</b> which consist of Miocene and younger fluvio-lacustrine basins, at much lower elevations than the highly uplifted marine Miocene rocks. These basins include the previously analyzed Altınapa and Yalvaç basins, as well as the until now undescribed Ilgın Basin. In this paper, we aim to constrain the paleogeography of the Central Tauride <b>Intramontane</b> <b>Basins</b> and determine the role of the tectonics driving the formation of the high Miocene topography in southern Turkey. Therefore, we provide new data on the stratigraphy, sedimentology and structure of the continental Ilgın Basin. We provide an 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of 11. 61 ± 0. 05 Ma for pumice deposits in the stratigraphy. We provide paleostress inversion analysis based on growth faults showing that the basin formed during multi-directional extension, with NE-SW to E-W dominating over subordinate N–S extension. We conclude that major, still-active normal faults like the Akşehir Fault also controlled Miocene Ilgın basin formation, with proximal facies close to the basin margins grading upwards and basinwards into lacustrine deposits representing the local depocenter. The Ilgın Basin was a local depocenter, but it may have connected with the adjacent Altınapa Basin during high lake levels in late Serravallian time. The Ilgın Basin and the other continental basins provide key constraints on the paleogeography and tectonic history of the region. These continental basins were likely close to the paleo-coastline during the Late Miocene after which there must have been major differential uplift of the Taurides. We suggest that the extension we documented in the Central Tauride <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> are in part responsible for the major topography that characterizes the Central Taurides today. The causes of extension remain engmatic, but we suggest that the tomographically imaged Antalya Slab may have caused the contemporaneous formation of NE-SW trending syn-contractional basins in the west and NW-SE trending Central Tauride <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> in the east by slab retreat. Our study highlights that the Neogene deformation history, and perhabs even active tectonics, may be strongly affected by complex slab geometry in SW Turkey, and that crustal deformation {{plays an important role in}} generating the Miocene Tauride topography.

40|$|The Betic Cordillera of {{southern}} Spain form {{the western end}} of the Alpine orogen, which during the Neogene was affected by large-scale late-orogenic extension. Extension, however, occurred within a setting of continuous slow convergence of the African and European plates. During the Neogene, shortening occurred in the External Zone of the Betic chain as a result of collision between the southern margins of Iberia and the Betic crust. Simultaneously, late-orogenic extension affected the Internal Zone of the Betics, resulting in the development of <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins.</b> Parts of the Internal Zone have subsided since the Miocene to form a large marine basin, the Alboran Sea. Seismic studies of the Alboran seafloor have revealed ubiquitous graben and half-graben structures of Miocene age. The Alboran basin and basins in the eastern Betics are currently underlain by an anomalously hot thinned continental crust. A prominent set of NE-SW trending strike-slip faults in the south-eastern part of the Betics form bounding faults along a number of late Miocene <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins.</b> This first-order characteristic invited earlier workers to interpret the <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> as wrench basins, developed in response to wrench faulting along these faults. But recent fission-track studies in the Betic crust as well as the Miocene geology of the basins onland and in the Alboran Sea clearly indicate that extension of the Betic-Alboran domain continued well into the late Miocene. And studies of the Betic and Alboran crust led other workers relate the geological and geometrical developments of the Betic-Alboran region to orogenic collapse in response to convective removal of a thickened lithospheric root or to subduction roll-back followed by slab detachment. They interpret the late Miocene basins largely as extensional or back-arc basins. Our field studies of basins in the Betic External and Internal Zone clearly provide evidence that foreland basin development and thrusting in the External Zone continued well into the late Miocene and occurred simultaneously with extension and development of basins in the Internal Zone. The <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> in the Internal Zone initiated {{at the beginning of the}} late Miocene and developed as genuinely extensional and subsiding basins in response to ~NE-SW and later ~N-S directed extension. In the late Miocene, progressively from the easternmost part of the Betics towards the southwest, extension in the basins was terminated followed by uplift. In the latest Miocene – early Pliocene NE-SW trending thrust and reverse faults developed, basins were inversed and basin sediments were folded. A number of the faults that belong to the prominent NE-SW trending fault zone initiated as normal faults during late Miocene basin development but became reactivated as oblique contraction faults in the latest Miocene – early Pliocene. In conclusion, the extending middle-upper parts of the Betic-Alboran crust were transported northward onto the Iberian foreland as inferred from late Miocene ages of thrusting and amount of shortening in the Betic External Zone. The structure of the extensional basins became modified by latest Miocene – early Pliocene large-scale reverse faulting accommodating ongoing convergence between Africa and Iberia. The development of the Betic might be related with orogenic collapse, but seem more consistent with slab-detachment...|$|R

40|$|IMPF: 00. 66 A {{synthesis}} of the upper Moscovian sedimentotogical and palaeontological record of terrestrial habitats across the Variscan foreland and adjacent <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> (an area which is referred to here as Variscan Euramerica) suggests a contraction and progressive westward shift of the coal swamps. These changes can be correlated with pulses of tectonic activity (tectonic phases) resulting from the northwards migration of the Variscan Front. This tectonic activity caused disruption to the landscapes and drainage patterns where the coat swamps were growing, which became less suitable to growth of the dominant plants of the swamps, the arborescent lycopsids. They were progressively replaced by vegetation dominated by marattialean ferns, which {{through a combination of}} slower growth and larger canopies resulted in less evapo-transpiration. This in turn caused localised reductions in rainfall, which further affected the ability of the lycopsids to dominate the swamp vegetation. These changes were initially localised and where the coat swamps were able to survive the lycopsids and pteridosperms show little change in either species diversity or biogeography, indicating that at this time there was minimal regional-scale climate change taking place. By Asturian times, however, the process had accelerated and the swamps in Variscan Euramerica became progressively replaced by predominantly conifer and cordaite vegetation that favoured much drier substrates. Except in localised pockets in <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> of the Variscan Mountains, the last development of coat swamps in Variscan Euramerica was of early Cantabrian age. Further west, lycopsid-dominated coal swamps persisted for a little longer. The last remnants of the lycopsid-dominated coal swamps in the Illinois Basin disappeared probably by middle-late Cantabrian times, as the cycle of contracting wetlands and regional reductions in rainfall generated its own momentum, and no longer needed the impetus of tectonic instability. This tectonically-driven decline in the Euramerican coal swamps was probably responsible for an annual increase in atmospheric CO 2 of c. 0. 37 ppm, and may have been implicated in the marked increase in global temperatures near the Moscovian - Kasimovian boundary, and the onset of the Late Pennsylvanian interglacial.

Our {{results show that the}} Neogene fill of the Orava-Nowy Targ <b>Intramontane</b> <b>Basin</b> underwent CCW rotation of over 20 o. We infer that the rotation terminated after 8 Ma and was related to dextral shift along NW-SE to NNW-SSE trending faults at the NE termination of the Mür-Žilina Fault Zone. Our results show that, fractured clasts can be good tool for regional tectonic reconstructions. The tool is especially useful when other tectonic tools are scarce or absent. Results of our palaeomagnetic study and fractured clasts analysis verify and supplement each others. In the studied case, palaeomagnetic results allow to distinguish between regional stress field rotation and rotation of the Orava-Nowy Targ Basin Neogene fill, whereas, results of fractured clast analysis help to constrain the age of rotation.

40|$|The Guadix Basin became {{established}} as an <b>intramontane</b> <b>basin</b> {{in the central}} sector of the Betic Cordillera {{at the beginning of}} Late Miocene time. Its geodynamic evolution starts with a unit of Tortonian marine sediments and is completed by a unit of Late Turolian–Pleistocene continental sediments. In the two units, six depositional sequences have been differentiated whose boundaries, in most cases, coincide with tectonic events. Geohistorical diagrams show the results of quantitative analyses of subsidence in the northern sector of the basin and permit correlation of the main events with significant changes in the history of subsidence and uplift. A period of strong subsidence occurred at the beginning of Tortonian time causing the formation of a marine basin 800 m deep. The mid- and end-Tortonian tectonic events involved periods of uplift leading to shallowing in the basin. After continentalization {{at the end of the}} Tortonian, the basin was uplifted continuously from Late Turolian to Late Pleistocene times, finally accumulating sediments at a height of 1000 m.

40|$|Active tectonic {{processes}} in south-central Italy have been analyzed {{by means of}} spatial and kinematic analysis of fault zones In (i) the axial zones of the Apenninic mountain chain, {{where most of the}} seismic strain is released within <b>intramontane</b> <b>basin</b> areas (i. e., Norcia, Fucino, Vallo di Diane, high Agri Valley, etc.); and (ii) in the Gargano promontory, where earthquakes with magnitudes up to 6 and 7 have Occurred. Our work focuses on {{a better understanding of the}} most recent deformation processes acting in these areas, and the relative motion between the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian crustal units. In order to derive the information above, we integrated structural and seismological data from the Apennines and the Gargano area. The results of our analysis show that the style of active deformation in both of these areas is broadly consistent with the current stress field. Kinematic data from slip indicators on active fault planes are, in fact, consistent with the geometric proprieties and spatial arrangement of the various fault segments and indicate that most of the active structures are characterized by oblique motion. The overall direction of extension appears to be at fairly high angle to the trend of the Apennines, with a component of horizontal left-lateral motion between Tyrrhenia and Adria...|$|E
40|$|The Tauride {{range in}} {{southern}} Turkey is flanked and overlain by Neogene sedimentary basins. To {{the south and}} on top of the high range, these basins are mainly marine, whereas poorly studied <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> dominated by continental deposits are exposed to the north. In this paper, we study the stratigraphy and structure of the continental Altınapa Basin, and provide 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology for volcanic deposits in the stratigraphy. The stratigraphy can be subdivided into a Lower Group, displaying ~ 400 m of fining upward fluvio-lacustrine sediments, unconformably overlain by an Upper Group with ~ 500 m of lacustrine deposits, andesitic lavas and volcaniclastic sediments. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of three volcaniclastic samples across the Upper Group provide 11. 8 – 11. 6 Ma ages. The Altınapa Basin is an extensional basin, which formed predominantly due to N–S to NE–SW directed stretching. The main basin forming phase occurred during deposition of the Lower Group, prior to 11. 8 Ma. Paleostress inversion analyses demonstrate uniaxial stress, with highly variable extension directions that are consistent with currently observed seismicity patterns. The Middle Miocene extension history of the Altınapa Basin is consistent with a regional pattern of Middle Miocene NE–SW to NW–SE extension north of the Cyprus subduction zone. This suggests that the Cyprus subduction zone has been in retreat relative to central Anatolia since at least Middle Miocene time. The continental Altınapa Basin is currently at an elevation of ~ 1 km, whereas partly contemporaneous marine sediments in the Mut Basin that lies on top of the Tauride range are elevated to 2 km. This shows strong late Cenozoic differential uplift in southern Turkey, with at least 1 km more uplift of the Tauride range than of the <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> to the north. We conclude that the current high elevation of the Taurides is related to late Neogene extension and does not result from the late Cretaceous to perhaps Oligocene folding and thrusting that deformed the rocks in the rang...|$|R
40|$|We have {{obtained}} high resolution group velocity maps of Rayleigh waves at periods from 8 to 25 seconds across the Iberian Peninsula by cross-correlating {{four months of}} ambient noise data recorded by 40 permanent broadband stations. Group velocity maps accurately image the main structural elements of the Iberian upper crust, including the Iberian Massif, Alpine orogens and major sedimentary basins. The Pyrenees and the Iberian Chain are imaged as relatively high group velocities, {{in contrast with the}} Betic Cordillera, which is characterized by low velocities. We explain these low velocities in the Betics by the presence of widespread <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins</b> created in an extensional episode simultaneous with north-south convergence between the African and Eurasian plates. The most prominent low velocity anomalies in the Iberian Peninsula are related to the Guadalquivir Basin, the flysch units of the Campo de Gibraltar, and the sediments of the Gulf of Cadiz. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Distinct general lithological features, {{separated}} by unconformities, serve to distinguish {{three groups of}} mappable formations in the Carboniferous of the area, the Ruesga Group, the Yuso Group and the Cea Group. The formations which compose the Ruesga Group {{can be found in}} the greater part of the area. In general they start with a limestone series developing upwards and laterally into greywackes. The conglomerates and molasse greywackes formations of the Yuso Group follow and are limited by two major structural zones; in the west the zone that runs over the Pardomino Ridge and the Pontón fault line and in the south the León line. West of the “Pardomino-Pontón” zone other formations have been mapped, but the information is still insufficient for a good correlation of the depositions on both sides of that zone. The mainly continental formations of the upper Cea Group occur mostly in unconformable <b>intramontane</b> <b>basins.</b> In the easternmost part of the area the unconformity is only locally present...|$|R
