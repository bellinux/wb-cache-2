40|$|In the {{research}} to be described, {{it was decided}} to follow changes in protein concentration and in the activities of certain enzymes of common respiratory pathways during germination of uredospores of the wheat stem and bean rust fungi. Techniques known to give good spore breakage and good germination were employed. Spore breakage approaching 100 % is desirable. This would insure that differences in protein concentration and enzyme activities which may be observed at different <b>germination</b> <b>periods</b> are not caused by uncertainties in the extent of breakage, but rather, are due to significant changes with germination. Similarly, conditions for spore germination have to be used so that high percentage of synchronous germination occurs.

Another object of this research was to investigate whether the endogenous carbohydrates released upon germination do inhibit certain respiratory pathways, which are undoubtedly active during germination.

Factors that have discouraged farmers from growing Garcinia kola include difficulties in germination that reduces seedling availability. Most productive trees were left in the wild when farmers cut plots {{out of the forest}} (Adebisi, 2004). Researchers have studied the germination problems of G. kola seeds and suggested various means of breaking its dormancy (Gyimah, 2000, Anegbeh et al., 2006, Kanmegne and Ndoumou, 2007, Oboho and Urughu, 2010, Oboho and Ogana, 2011).

G. kola seeds has both seeds coat dormancy and physiological dormancy probably imposed by the chemicals in the seed (Oboho and Urughu 2010). Seed coat dormancy of Garcinia kola can be reduced by removing the seed coat before sowing, while physiological dormancy can be reduced by soaking in water for 72 hours (Yakubu et al., 2014).

Incorporation of each compound into RNA increased about 2 -fold from the 12 th to the 156 th hour, although the total RNA present decreased slightly over this interval.
