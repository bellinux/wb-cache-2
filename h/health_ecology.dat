There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban <b>health</b> <b>ecology</b> (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation.

25|$|Work on {{the first}} edition started with funds from Mankind 2000, {{matching}} those of the UIA. The publisher Klaus Saur, of Munich, provided funds, in conjunction with those from the UIA, for work on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions. Seed funding for the third volume of the 4th edition was also provided on behalf of Mankind 2000. In the nineties, seed funding was provided, again on behalf of Mankind 2000, for computer equipment which subsequently allowed the UIA to develop a large website and make progressively available for free the Encyclopedia databases as from the 1994–1995 edition. In turn, this proven knowledge management capacity enabled the UIA, on the initiative of Nadia McLaren, a consultant ecologist {{who has been a}} primary editor for the Encyclopedia, to successfully instigate two multi-partner projects funded by the European Union, with matching funds from the UIA. The work done through those two projects, Ecolynx: Information Context for Biodiversity Conservation (mainly) and Interactive <b>Health</b> <b>Ecology</b> Access Links, eventually resulted in what amounted to a fifth, web-based, edition of the Encyclopedia in 2000. In their own ways, two other persons in particular effectively supported the project over the years: Robert Jungk of Mankind 2000, and Christian de Laet of the UIA.|$|E

Data synthesis: The research showed that the multifactorial components involved in health and environmental problems must be considered and treated through an interdisciplinary approach which incorporates the economic, social and cultural rights in the formulation and implementation of public policies related to health and the environment. Conclusions: The public policies of health promotion and prevention support those of sustainable development, and the latter reinforce the first, showing that the issues of health and environment are inseparable in the field of public and environmental health in the production of quality of life...|$|R

A recent large scale implementation by the World Health Organization is described in [...] A long running application at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory is described in [...]The classical model scores expert performance in terms of statistical accuracy (sometimes called calibration) and informativeness [...] These terms {{should not be confused with}} “accuracy and precision”. Accuracy “is a description of systematic errors” while precision “is a description of random errors”. In the classical model statistical accuracy is measured as the p-value or probability with which one would falsely reject the hypotheses that an expert’s probability assessments were statistically accurate. A low value (near zero) means it is very unlikely that the discrepancy between an expert’s probability statements and observed outcomes should arise by chance. Informativeness is measured as Shannon relative information (or Kullback Leibler divergence) with respect to an analyst-supplied background measure. Shannon relative information is used because it is scale invariant, tail insensitive, slow, and familiar. Parenthetically, measures with physical dimensions, such as the standard deviation, or the width of prediction intervals, raise serious problems, as a change of units (meters to kilometers) would affect some variables but not others. The product of statistical accuracy and informativeness for each expert is their combined score. With an optimal choice of a statistical accuracy threshold beneath which experts are unweighted, the combined score is a long run “strictly proper scoring rule”: an expert achieves his long run maximal expected score by and only by stating his true beliefs. The classical model derives Performance Weighted (PW) combinations. These are compared with Equally Weighted (EW) combinations, and recently with Harmonically Weighted (HW) combinations, as well as with individual expert assessments.|$|E
