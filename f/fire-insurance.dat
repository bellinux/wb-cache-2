60|$|GENTLEMAN,--I am glad, indeed, {{to assist}} in {{welcoming}} the distinguished guest of this occasion to a city whose fame as an insurance centre has extended to all lands, and given us the name of being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand in hand--the Colt's arms company making the destruction of our race easy and convenient, our life-insurance citizens paying for the victims when they pass away, Mr. Batterson perpetuating their memory with his stately monuments, and our <b>fire-insurance</b> comrades {{taking care of their}} hereafter. I am glad {{to assist in}} welcoming our guest--first, because he is an Englishman, and I owe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of his fellow-countrymen; and secondly, because he is in sympathy with insurance, and has been the means of making many other men cast their sympathies in the same direction.|$|E
6000|$|We do {{not believe}} that Horatio ever thought he [...] "was not a pipe for Fortune's finger to play what stop she please," [...] till Hamlet told him so. That was Fortune's affair, not his; let her try it, if she liked. He is {{unconscious}} of his own peculiar qualities, as men of decision commonly are, or they would not be men of decision. When there is a thing to be done, they go straight at it, and for the time there is nothing for them in the whole universe but themselves and their object. Hamlet, on the other hand, is always studying himself. This world and the other, too, are always present to his mind, and there in the corner is the little black kobold of a doubt making mouths at him. He breaks down the bridges before him, not behind him, as a man of action would do; but there is something more than this. He is an ingrained sceptic; though his is the scepticism, not of reason, but of feeling, whose root is want of faith in himself. In him it is passive, a malady rather than a function of the mind. We might call him insincere: not that he was in any sense a hypocrite, but only that he never was and never could be in earnest. Never could be, because no man without intense faith in something ever can. Even if he only believed in himself, that were better than nothing; for it will carry a man a great way in the outward successes of life, nay, will even sometimes give him the Archimedean fulcrum for moving the world. But Hamlet doubts everything. He doubts the immortality of the soul, just after seeing his father's spirit, and hearing from its mouth the secrets of the other world. He doubts Horatio even, and swears him to secrecy on the cross of his sword, though probably he himself has no assured belief in the sacredness of the symbol. He doubts Ophelia, and asks her, [...] "Are you honest?" [...] He doubts the ghost, after he has had a little time to think about it, and so gets up the play to test the guilt of the king. And how coherent the whole character is! With what perfect tact and judgment Shakespeare, in the advice to the players, makes him an exquisite critic! For just here that part of his character which would be weak in dealing with affairs is strong. A wise scepticism is the first attribute of a good critic. He must not believe that the <b>fire-insurance</b> offices will raise their rates of premium on Charles River, because the new volume of poems is printing at Riverside or the University Press. He must not believe so profoundly in the ancients as to think it wholly out of the question that the world has still vigor enough in its loins to beget some one who will one of these days be as good an ancient as any of them.|$|E

50|$|He became {{engaged in}} the trust, <b>fire-insurance,</b> and relief-association {{businesses}} in Reading. He was a delegate to the 1880 Democratic National Convention at Cincinnati, Ohio. During {{a visit to the}} Capitol at Washington, D.C., in 1912 he was tendered a reception {{on the floor of the}} House of Representatives, because he was at the time the last surviving Member of the Thirty-seventh Congress which had been assembled at the extraordinary session called by Abraham Lincoln on July 4, 1861. He was engaged in banking and in the insurance business until his death in Reading in 1913. Interment in Charles Evans Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|After he had {{fulfilled}} {{his military}} service obligation, he worked {{a short time}} as a salesman {{and then as a}} tax man. After eight years, he became an executive functionary for the Rhenish railroad in Cologne and later part of the administration of a <b>fire-insurance</b> association in Aachen. He devoted his leisure time to writing. Besides the travel book, he published a book of poems (1841; reprinted in Boston, 1867), and after those involved himself in political writings. Two pamphlets, Die Ehre (Honor) and Die geheimen Konduitenlisten (Secret Lists of Leaders), undertook an objective criticism of the measures of the Prussian government. His tone was sharper in contributions he made to two newspapers, the Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung and the Rheinische Zeitung.|$|E
50|$|At 21 {{he began}} working at the Bell Telephone {{accounting}} division and, before even graduating from law school, he {{was admitted to the}} Missouri bar. In 1913, he was married to Freda Josephine Prill of Kansas City. At age 24, Lynn took and passed the Missouri certified public accountant exam, earning the highest score on that exam ever made. Soon after, {{he began working}} for the largest underwriting insurance company in the country, U.S. Epperson, and quickly worked his way up in the company. By the age of 30, Lynn had taken out a significant and risky loan to buy the U.S. Epperson Underwriting Company. That step launched a successful business career that included insurance underwriting, oil well and orchard ownership, and large investments in the railroad business. He would become a prominent businessman in the Kansas City area as head of vast oil interests and as president of the world's largest reciprocal <b>fire-insurance</b> exchange.|$|E
5000|$|Without {{a number}} : Stockholm Palace, and {{opposite}} to Slottsbacken {{the statue of}} Gustav III (1746-1792) by Tobias Sergel (1740-1814) inaugurated in 1808. It is made in bronze and describes the kings landing on the quay after the Russian war 1788-90. The statue {{was inspired by the}} Apollo Belvedere marble, and the artist described his work as [...] "is in movement, holding a helm in one hand, while offering an olive branch signifying peace with the other. He wears a navy uniform with a large cape fastened at the left shoulder."N.20, Brandstodsbolagets hus ("House of the <b>Fire-insurance</b> Company"), designed by Isak Gustaf Clason (1856-1930) and built {{by the turn of the}} century 1900 in the style of Tessin the Younger. The exploitation demands of the modern era resulted in the building as being disproportionately large for the setting on its completion, a problem however dissolved by the adoption of its scale by several other buildings along Skeppsbron.|$|E
5000|$|Relative {{warranties}} are {{general in}} their content; {{they are not}} specific statements of what is required of the insured. The “reasonable person” {{is used as a}} yardstick to measure the insured’s conduct in relation to an alleged breach of warranty. An example of a general warranty is the [...] "iron-safe clause," [...] which is frequently included in <b>fire-insurance</b> policies. In terms of an iron-safe clause, the insured warrants that he will keep a complete set of books, showing a true and accurate record of all business transactions and stock-in-hand, and that the books will be locked in a fire-proof safe or removed to another building at night and at all times when the premises are not open for business. In Kliptown Clothing v Marine & Trade Insurance the plaintiff, a retail general dealer, obtained a burglary policy from the defendant. Subsequently the plaintiff suffered burglaries. In an action claiming a declaration that the defendant was obliged to make good the loss, Marine & Trade Insurance pleaded breach by the plaintiff of a warranty ...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} {{different}} languages foster different world views in their speakers {{is part of}} a tradition popularized by Wilhelm von Humboldt in the 18 th century long before it became associated with Whorf.   In this long process, another two American linguists, Boas and Sapir, are also well-known for their great contributions to this notion.   This paper tries to trace the linguistic relativity back to its origin and contextualize its diachronic developments from Europe to America.   It is true, however, that it was Benjamin Lee Whorf, the chemical engineer and <b>fire-insurance</b> by profession and the linguist by avocation, who had undertaken extensive research into the language Hopi during 1932 - 1935 and Maya in late 1930 s, and it was he who went further in indicating the relationship between language and thought.   As a core part of Whorf’s theory complex, the linguistic relativity was once interpreted in two ways: linguistic determinism which means that language determines the way people think and linguistic relativism which implies that language influences the way people think...|$|E
