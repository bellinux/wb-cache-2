5|$|Grissom {{was sent}} to the Lovelace Clinic and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to undergo {{extensive}} physical examinations and to submit to a battery of psychological tests. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from <b>hay</b> <b>fever,</b> but was permitted to continue when it was determined that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space. On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts.|$|E
5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including <b>hay</b> <b>fever,</b> asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} Davis has {{returned}} to directing for theatre and film. He wrote and directed three short films and co-wrote and directed several episodes of a television series for CBC Television, 49th & Main. In 2011 he directed two plays for The United Players of Vancouver, Waste by Harley Granville Barker and <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever</b> by Noël Coward. Most recently he directed The Habit of Art (2013) by Alan Bennett, Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Jersey Lily (2015) by Katie Forgette and Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons at the Jericho Arts Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Born in Teddington, {{south-west}} London, Coward {{attended a}} dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage début {{at the age}} of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever,</b> Private Lives, Design for Living, Present Laughter and Blithe Spirit, have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta Bitter Sweet and comic revues), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel Pomp and Circumstance, and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} people in the United States {{affected}} by <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> is between 20 and 40 million, and such allergy has proven to be the most frequent allergic response in the nation. There are certain evidential suggestions pointing out <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> and similar allergies to be of hereditary origin. Individuals who suffer from eczema or are asthmatic tend to be more susceptible to developing long-term <b>hay</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{efficient}} way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold, but <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear. The confirmation of <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> can be obtained after examination by a general physician.|$|E
25|$|Allergy studies. Studies of the {{geographic}} distribution and seasonal production of pollen, can help sufferers of allergies such as <b>hay</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> prompts {{him to see}} a doctor, {{where he}} meets and falls quickly in love with Kate (played by Emma Thompson), who works there as a nurse.|$|E
25|$|The Coachella Valley {{was once}} {{a safe haven for}} <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> allergy sufferers before the surge of golf courses and year-round lawns, and people with bronchitis, {{emphysema}} and asthma chose to relocate for health reasons in the early half of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In April 2006, Dench {{returned}} to the West End stage in <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever</b> alongside Peter Bowles, Belinda Lang, and Kim Medcalf. She finished off 2006 {{with the role of}} Mistress Quickly in the RSC's new musical The Merry Wives, a version of The Merry Wives of Windsor.|$|E
25|$|Arizona {{was once}} {{regarded}} as a haven for people with pollen allergies, although several ragweed species grow in the desert. However, as suburbs grew and people began establishing irrigated lawns and gardens, more irritating species of ragweed gained a foothold and Arizona lost its claim of freedom from <b>hay</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
25|$|Antihistamines are {{effective}} at treating mild cases of pollinosis, {{this type of}} non-prescribed drugs includes loratadine, cetirizine and chlorpheniramine. They do not prevent the discharge of histamine, {{but it has been}} proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this biogenic amine, which considerably lowers <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{allergic}} sensitization and {{the development}} of allergies varies with age, with young children most at risk. Several studies have shown that IgE levels are highest in childhood and fall rapidly between the ages of 10 and 30 years. The peak prevalence of <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under 10.|$|E
25|$|Early {{exposure}} to potential allergens may be protective. Treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens {{and the use}} of medications such as steroids and antihistamines. In severe reactions injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended. Allergen immunotherapy, which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, is useful for some types of allergies such as <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> and reactions to insect bites. Its use in food allergies is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Allergies, {{also known}} as {{allergic}} diseases, {{are a number of}} conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to something in the environment that usually causes little or no problem in most people. These diseases include <b>hay</b> <b>fever,</b> food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.|$|E
25|$|Leipheimer, riding for Team Einstein, won the 1996 U.S. National Criterium Championships in Grandview Heights, Ohio, but tested {{positive}} for ephedrine, a banned substance. He eventually forfeited his title, prize money and national champion's jersey as well as receiving a three-month suspension. Leipheimer's family later claimed that the positive test was not indicative of doping, but rather, {{the result of his}} taking allergy medicine Claritin-D to relieve <b>hay</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moderate {{hookworm}} infections {{have been}} demonstrated to have beneficial effects on hosts suffering from diseases linked to overactive immune systems. This is possibly explained by the hygiene hypothesis. Research at the University of Nottingham conducted in Ethiopia observed a small subset of people with hookworm infections were half as likely to experience asthma or <b>hay</b> <b>fever.</b> Potential benefits have also been hypothesized in cases of multiple sclerosis, Crohn's Disease and diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Allergic {{reactions}} {{is caused}} by IgE anti-allergen antibodies. When antibodies are bound to its antigens, histamine is released from mast cells and basophils. Either IgE antibodies from the donor's or recipient's side can cause the allergic reaction. It {{is more common in}} patients who has allergic conditions such as <b>hay</b> <b>fever.</b> Patient may feel itchy or having hives but the symptoms are usually mild and can be controlled by stopping the transfusion and giving antihistamines.|$|E
25|$|Nasal allergy to pollen {{is called}} pollinosis, and allergy {{specifically}} to grass pollen is called <b>hay</b> <b>fever.</b> Generally, pollens that cause allergies {{are those of}} anemophilous plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random {{and the likelihood of}} one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.|$|E
25|$|Some people {{experience}} an anaphylactoid reaction to eating strawberries. The {{most common form}} of this reaction is oral allergy syndrome, but symptoms may also mimic <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> or include dermatitis or hives, and, in severe cases, may cause breathing problems. Proteomic studies indicate that the allergen may be tied to a protein for the red anthocyanin biosynthesis expressed in strawberry ripening, named Fra a1 (Fragaria allergen1). Homologous proteins are found in birch pollen and apple, suggesting that people may develop cross-reactivity to all three species.|$|E
25|$|Fulton {{was first}} married to actress Ethel Scott, who {{appeared}} {{with him on}} The Rikki Fulton Show in 1960 and 1961. While separated from their respective partners, Fulton met Audrey Matheson Craig-Brown (known as Kate Matheson), an actress 13 years his junior. Matheson saw Fulton perform in a production of Noël Coward's <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever,</b> {{but it would be}} 17 years before they met in person. After one day together, Fulton proposed and they married in 1969. In 1976, Matheson became pregnant but later lost the baby.|$|E
25|$|They {{primarily}} {{deal with}} parasitic infections. Eosinophils {{are also the}} predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, <b>hay</b> <b>fever,</b> and hives; and also parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy these large parasites, such as hook worms and tapeworms, that are too big for any one WBC to phagocytize. In general, their nucleus is bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand. The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with eosin staining.|$|E
25|$|Barrager {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} MSM for <b>hay</b> <b>fever.</b> Fifty-five subjects consumed 2.6g of MSM per day for 30 days. This study was not blinded and did not include controls; while an improvement in symptoms was observed compared to initial baseline, no significant changes were observed in two indicators of inflammation (C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin E levels). A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an MSM-containing throat spray to reduce snoring reported a severity decrease of 28% {{in the placebo group}} and 54% for the treated group. The difference was statistically significant.|$|E
25|$|Amounts {{as low as}} 100mg of {{sesame seeds}} or flour and 3ml of oil can trigger {{allergic}} reactions in severe cases of sesame allergic individuals. Most patients, however, show allergic reactions after consuming 2–10g of sesame seeds or flour. The onset of the symptoms may occur {{within a few minutes}} up to 90 minutes after ingestion of a sesame seed product. Most patients had other allergic diseases such as asthma, <b>hay</b> <b>fever,</b> and eczema, and most patients also had a relative with an allergic disease. More than two-thirds of the patients with sesame allergy also had allergic reactions to other foods.|$|E
25|$|Rehearsals {{were still}} under way when the Lord Chamberlain took {{exception}} to the second act love scene, labelling it too risqué {{in light of the}} fact the characters were divorced and married to others. Coward went to St. James's Palace to plead his case by acting out the play himself and assuring the censor that with artful direction the scene would be presented in a dignified and unobjectionable manner. Coward repeats one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play, where the main characters tiptoe out as the curtain falls – a device that he also used in Present Laughter, <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever</b> and Blithe Spirit.|$|E
25|$|Harvey came to Lawrence, Kansas in 1945 {{to study}} at the University of Kansas, where he majored in theater and acted in scores of college stage productions, {{including}} <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever,</b> The Skin of Our Teeth, Beggar on Horseback, Juno and the Paycock, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Joan of Lorraine, Blithe Spirit, Harvey, and Hamlet. During his years at KU, Harvey served as vice-president of the Dramatics Workshop {{and was a member}} of the Owl Society, an honorary organization for male juniors. He earned a bachelor of science degree in education from the KU speech and drama department in 1948 and subsequently became employed by that department as an instructor, while also a graduate student.|$|E
25|$|The hygiene {{hypothesis}} {{was developed to}} explain the observation that <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> and eczema, both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were, it is presumed, exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child. The hygiene hypothesis has been extensively investigated by immunologists and epidemiologists and has become an important theoretical framework {{for the study of}} allergic disorders. It is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that have been seen since industrialization, and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. The hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to symbiotic bacteria and parasites as important modulators of immune system development, along with infectious agents.|$|E
25|$|On December 24, 2008 {{at about}} 3:30p.m. (JST), Iijima {{was found dead}} in her 21st floor Tokyo apartment, not far from Shibuya Crossing. She was found lying face-down on the floor when medics forced their way into her place. She had been dead for about seven days, police said. On March 3, 2007, Sports Nippon had {{reported}} that Ai Iijima was suffering from <b>hay</b> <b>fever,</b> pyelitis (ascending urinary tract infection that has reached the pyelum (pelvis) of the kidney), cystitis, and acute backache. She had written in her blog that she had kidney problems and inflammation of the urinary tract and bladder. In February 2009, police announced that the pathology examination showed she had died of pneumonia, {{and that there was no}} suggestion of either suicide or murder.|$|E
25|$|Ingle was a well-liked captain, {{according}} to David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, and unlike some Somerset amateurs got on {{well with the}} limited numbers of professionals the county employed. The life of a Somerset captain in the inter-war years was rarely easy, because the county rarely had {{more than half a}} dozen professionals, and the team was perennially made up of an itinerant band of amateurs of variable talent. In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches. Ingle himself missed some games most seasons because of chronic <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> which, {{according to}} Foot, he maintained was made worse by long train journeys: he told Foot that he would travel in the luggage rack to get some sleep and some respite from the dust.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Noël Coward's Relative Values, {{played at}} the theatre, having premièred there in 1951, an {{original}} run of 477 performances. Tom Stoppard's Travesties, with Antony Sher was next, and in 1994 the musical She Loves Me played, with Ruthie Henshall and John Gordon Sinclair. These were followed by Terry Johnson's Dead Funny; Alan Ayckbourn's Communicating Doors (which transferred to the theatre in 1996), with Angela Thorne; J. B. Priestley's When We Are Married, with Dawn French, Alison Steadman, and Leo McKern; and Ben Travers' Plunder, with Griff Rhys Jones and Kevin McNally. In 1997 a group led by Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen was given management of the theatre by The Savoy Group. Productions that followed included Simon Callow in The Importance of Being Oscar; Pet Shop Boys in concert, Ian Richardson in Pinero's The Magistrate; Edward Fox in A Letter of Resignation; the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Richard III, with Robert Lindsay; and Coward's <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever,</b> with Geraldine McEwan in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{leaving the}} NT in 1988, Hall {{launched}} his own commercial company with productions in the West End and on Broadway of Tennessee Williams' Orpheus Descending (with Vanessa Redgrave) and The Merchant of Venice (with Dustin Hoffman). The Peter Hall Company {{went on to}} stage more than sixty plays in association {{with a number of}} producing partners including Bill Kenwright and Thelma Holt. In addition to an ensemble repertory season at the Old Vic (1997), the company enjoyed a long collaboration with the Theatre Royal, Bath where a series of summer festivals were staged from 20032011: many productions were subsequently performed on domestic and international tours and in the West End. The plays produced included Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband (1992), Pam Gems' Piaf (1993, with Elaine Paige), Hamlet (1994, with Stephen Dillane), Henrik Ibsen's The Master Builder (1995, with Alan Bates), A Streetcar Named Desire (1997, with Jessica Lange), Julian Barry's Lenny (1999, with Eddie Izzard), As You Like It (2003, with Rebecca Hall and Dan Stevens), Brian Clark's Whose Life is it Anyway? (2005, with Kim Cattrall), the fiftieth anniversary production of Waiting for Godot, Coward's <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever</b> (2006, with Judi Dench) and Shaw's Pygmalion (2007, with Tim Pigott-Smith and Michelle Dockery). Hall's final acclaimed productions for his company were Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 (2011), staged at the Theatre Royal Bath.|$|E
500|$|Due to an enquiry about a {{cancellation}} {{insurance for}} the upcoming tour, insurance carriers demanded a medical exam by a doctor they trusted. In February 2009, Jackson had an examination performed by Dr. David Slavit of New York.

[...] A second medical exam {{was supposed to take}} place on July 6, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Norman Stewart [...] "Mandy" [...] Mitchell-Innes (7 September 1914 – 28 December 2006) was {{an amateur}} cricketer for Somerset, {{who played in}} one Test match for England in 1935. Between 1931 and 1949 Mitchell-Innes played 132 {{first-class}} matches, appearing 69 times for Somerset, and 43 times for Oxford University. In these matches he scored 6,944 runs, including 13 centuries and a top score of 207. He was well-regarded {{for the grace of}} his batting, but his cricket career was limited by both <b>hay</b> <b>fever</b> and his overseas work commitments.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} The Vortex in both London and America caused a great demand for new Coward plays. In 1925 he premiered Fallen Angels, a three-act comedy that amused and shocked audiences with the {{spectacle}} of two middle-aged women slowly getting drunk while awaiting the arrival of their mutual lover. <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever,</b> the first of Coward's plays to gain an enduring place in the mainstream theatrical repertoire, also appeared in 1925. It is a comedy about four egocentric members of an artistic family who casually invite acquaintances to their country house for the weekend and bemuse and enrage each other's guests. Some writers have seen elements of Coward's old mentor, Mrs Astley Cooper, and her set in the characters of the family. By the 1970s the play was recognised as a classic, described in The Times as a [...] "dazzling achievement; like The Importance of Being Earnest, it is pure comedy with no mission but to delight, and it depends purely on the interplay of characters, not on elaborate comic machinery." [...] By June 1925 Coward had four shows running in the West End: The Vortex, Fallen Angels, <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever</b> and On with the Dance. Coward was turning out numerous plays and acting in his own works and others'. Soon, his frantic pace caught up with him, and he collapsed on stage in 1926 while starring in a stage adaptation of The Constant Nymph and had to take an extended rest, recuperating in Hawaii.|$|E
500|$|Le Mesurier played The Wise Old Bird in the 1980 BBC Radio 4 series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and {{appeared}} on the same station as Bilbo Baggins in the 1981 radio version of The Lord of the Rings. In the spring of 1980 he took the role of David Bliss alongside Constance Cummings—as Judith Bliss—in a production of Noël Coward's 1920s play <b>Hay</b> <b>Fever.</b> Writing for The Observer, Robert Cushman thought that Le Mesurier played the role with [...] "deeply grizzled torpor", while Michael Billington, reviewing for The Guardian, saw him as a [...] "grey, gentle wisp of a man, full of half-completed gestures and seraphic smiles".|$|E
