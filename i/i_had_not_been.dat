He commanded the 43rd Battalion until July 1930 when he transferred to the Unattached List, and continued as president of the RSSILA until 1931, leading the RSSILA delegation to the biennial conference of the British Empire Service League in London in 1929. Upon his return from the conference and a tour of the former battlefields and war cemeteries, he offered his personal opinion that World War <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> worthwhile, as the tremendous loss had resulted in little gain. This resulted in some public criticism by potential political opponents.|$|E

500|$|As Caragiale senior died, Mateiu {{initially}} {{planned to}} join the mainstream Conservative Party and demand a post from Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest and a close associate of Bogdan-Pitești. Nevertheless, he came to define this position as [...] "a bad solution", and, as Maiorescu and Ionescu formed an alliance, he successfully requested appointment from Bădărău, eventually obtaining it through the means of a decree signed by King Carol I. Caragiale later commented: [...] " [...] entrusted me with this golden key, which I had wanted for so long, and which, for all of this, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> desperate to obtain." [...] This contradicted another one of his accounts, in which he confessed that, initially received with indifference by Bădărău, he had claimed that him joining the Conservative-Democrats had been Ion Luca's dying request. Șerban Cioculescu would comment: [...] "There {{could not have been}} a more complete distortion of a parent's last wish!" ...|$|E
500|$|The bottom {{section of}} Tilden's [...] "promontory" [...] extension, {{the dining room}} {{contains}} the original suite of table and dining chairs designed by Heal's to Churchill's exacting requirements – (see box). An early study for an planned picture by William Nicholson entitled Breakfast at Chartwell hangs in the room. Nicholson, a frequent visitor to Chartwell who gave Churchill painting lessons, drew the [...] study for a finished picture which {{was intended as a}} present for the Churchills' Silver Wedding anniversary in 1933 but, disliking the final version, Nicholson destroyed it. The picture depicts the Churchills breakfasting together, which in fact they rarely did, and Churchill's marmalade cat, Tango. The tradition of keeping a marmalade cat at Chartwell, which Churchill began and followed throughout his ownership, is maintained by the National Trust in accordance with Churchill's wishes. In a letter to Randolph written in May 1942, Churchill wrote of a brief visit to Chartwell the previous week, [...] "the goose and the black swan have both fallen victim to the fox. The Yellow Cat however made me sensible of his continuing friendship, although <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> there for eight months".|$|E

Moore's name was floated by some of his associates, and a background check was initiated with several state and county agencies, including the Etowah County district attorney's office. Moore's former political opponent Jimmy Hedgspeth, who still helmed the D.A.'s office, recommended Moore despite personal reservations, and Moore was installed in the position {{he had failed to}} win in 1982.

2500|$|Egyptian self-government, education, and the {{continued}} plight of Egypt's peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it {{took the form of}} an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation. Sheikh Muhammad Abduh, the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar Mufti, was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the modernist interpretations of Islam that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were Mustafa Kamil and Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved {{in the creation of a}} secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the surface, the {{two main}} {{characters}} have little in common. As O'Brian wrote in The Ionian Mission, [...] "Although (they) were almost as unlike as men could be, unlike in nationality, religion, education, size, shape, profession, habit of mind, they were united in a deep love for music, and many and many an evening had they played together, violin answering cello or both singing together far into the night." [...] This musical connection began in the first paragraph of the first book in the series, when the two characters meet at a concert. They also share a delight in puns and dry witticisms, and particularly memorable wordplay is sometimes repeated in subsequent novels in the series, years later in book-time. One character in the novel, Sir Joseph Blaine, saw the two friends as romantics, in his remarks on Maturin in HMS Surprise Chapter 4: [...] "As I was saying, strong; but not without his weaknesses. He was blaming his particular friend for romantic notions the other day - the friend who is to marry the daughter of that woman we saw just now - and if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> so shocked by his condition, I should have been tempted to laugh. He is himself a perfect Quixote: an enthusiastic supporter of the Revolution until ‘93; a United Irishman until the rising, Lord Edward’s adviser.... And now Catalan independence. Or perhaps I should say, Catalan independence from the beginning, simultaneously with the others. But always heart and soul, blood and purse in some cause from which he can derive no conceivable personal benefit." ...|$|E

2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> able to do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Our Rabbis {{taught that}} the {{obligation}} to confess sins comes {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, as it grows dark. But the Sages said that one should confess before one has eaten and drunk, lest one become inebriated in the course of the meal. And even if one has confessed before eating and drinking, one should confess again after having eaten and drunk, because perhaps some wrong happened during the meal. And even if one has confessed during the evening prayer, one should confess again during the morning prayer. And even if one has confessed during the morning prayer, one should do so again during the Musaf additional prayer. And even if one has confessed during the Musaf, one should do so again during the afternoon prayer. And even if one has done so in the afternoon prayer, one should confess again in the Ne'ilah concluding prayer. The Gemara taught that the individual should say the confession after the (silent recitation of the) Amidah prayer, and the public reader says it in the middle of the Amidah. Rav taught that the confession begins: [...] "You know the secrets of eternity [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Samuel, however, taught that the confession begins: [...] "From the depths of the heart [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Levi said: [...] "And in Your Torah it is said, [...] " [...] (...) Rabbi Johanan taught that the confession begins: [...] "Lord of the Universe, [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Rav Judah said: [...] "Our iniquities are too many to count, and our sins too numerous to be counted." [...] Rav Hamnuna said: [...] "My God, before I was formed, I was of no worth, and now that I have been formed, it is as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> formed. I am dust in my life, how much more in my death. Behold, I am before You like a vessel full of shame and reproach. May it be Your will that I sin no more, and what I have sinned wipe away in Your mercy, but not through suffering." [...] That was the confession of sins used by Rav all the year round, and by Rav Hamnuna the younger, on the Day of Atonement. Mar Zutra taught that one should say such prayers only if one has not already said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] but if one has said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] no more is necessary. For Bar Hamdudi taught that once he stood before Samuel, who was sitting, and when the public reader said, [...] "Truly, we have sinned," [...] Samuel rose, and so Bar Hamdudi inferred that this was the main confession.|$|E
