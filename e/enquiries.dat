5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and <b>Enquiries</b> in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to <b>enquiries</b> from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

A few algorithms such as seek only steps that satisfy end points of EH.

As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|Following the urgings of Superintendent George {{and various}} {{official}} <b>enquiries,</b> new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. The western workshops, located between the entry complex and the Female Division, were built from 1900–1901 of squared limestone rubble with openings dressed in brick. An open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights covered the five spaces {{designed for the}} five traditional workshops: tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} for researchers and practitioners interested in using online environments to provoke student <b>enquiry</b> in any discipline in higher education.

We explain why a social presence is important in the establishment of a Community of <b>Enquiry</b> and we also align particular web technologies to the various stages in the <b>enquiry</b> process and the students’ achievement of a unit’s learning outcomes.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the perceptions and practices about <b>enquiry</b> based teaching held by Social Studies teachers in private English Medium schools in Karachi (Pakistan). 257 teachers participated in the survey.

The results of the study showed that the Social Studies teachers in private English medium schools have a poor understanding about the nature of enquiry-based teaching. They also lack the appropriate pedagogical skills and competencies which are probably due to the low quality of training that they received. However, {{it is important to note}} that Pakistani teachers do make efforts to use <b>enquiry</b> in their Social Studies classrooms. While implementing an <b>enquiry</b> approach, the teachers recognize that <b>enquiry</b> has a positive impact on students 2 ̆ 7 learning in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes.

They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed just one of the club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. The defender later noted the irony that having been released as an injury concern, he ended up playing more games the following season than any of his teammates.|$|E

After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
