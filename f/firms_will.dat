5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction {{on the sale of}} units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E
25|$|Like perfect {{competition}}, under {{monopolistic competition}} also, the firms can enter or exit freely. The <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> enter when the existing firms are making super-normal profits. With {{the entry of}} new firms, the supply would increase which would reduce the price and hence the existing <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> be left only with normal profits. Similarly, if the existing firms are sustaining losses, some of the marginal <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> exit. It will reduce the supply due to which price would rise and the existing <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> be left only with normal profit.|$|E
40|$|A {{low-cost}} dominant <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> {{drive all}} competitive fringe firms {{out of the}} market if all firms have rational expectations; however, the dominant <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> not predate (price below marginal cost). Since a dominant <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> not drive out fringe firms if they have myopic expectations it may be in the dominant firm's best interests to inform the fringe.

5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> stay out and the foreign <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> enter.|$|R

25|$|When {{investing}} in a startup, there are different types of stages in which the investor can participate. The first round is called seed round. The seed round generally is when the startup {{is still in the}} very early phase of execution when their product is still in the prototype phase. At this level angel investors will be the ones participating. The next round is called Series A. At this point the company already has traction and may be making revenue. In Series A rounds venture capital <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> be participating alongside angels or super angel investors. The next rounds are Series B, C, and D. These three rounds are the ones leading towards the IPO. Venture capital firms and private equity <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> be participating.|$|E
5000|$|In economics, a <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> {{choose to}} {{implement}} a shutdown of production when the revenue received {{from the sale of}} the goods or services produced cannot even cover the fixed costs of production. In that situation, the <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> experience a higher loss when it produces, compared to not producing at all.|$|R

25|$|How many <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> an MC market {{structure}} support at market equilibrium? The answer depends on {{factors such as}} fixed costs, economies of scale {{and the degree of}} product differentiation. For example, the higher the fixed costs, the fewer firms the market will support.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} in equilibrium, each firm's expectations of how other <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> act are shown to be correct; when all is revealed, no firm wants to change its output decision. This idea of stability was later taken up and built upon as a description of Nash equilibria, of which Cournot equilibria are a subset.|$|E
25|$|A supply {{schedule}} is a table {{that shows the}} relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied. Under the assumption of perfect competition, supply is determined by marginal cost. That is, <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive.|$|E

500|$|The Phillips curve {{appeared}} {{to reflect a}} clear, inverse relationship between inflation and output. The curve broke down in the 1970s as economies suffered simultaneous economic stagnation and inflation known as stagflation. The empirical implosion of the Phillips curve followed attacks mounted on theoretical grounds by Friedman and Edmund Phelps. Phelps, although not a monetarist, argued that only unexpected inflation or deflation impacted employment. Variations of Phelps's [...] "expectations-augmented Phillips curve" [...] became standard tools. Friedman and Phelps used models with no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Instead of the Phillips curve they used models based on the natural rate of unemployment where expansionary monetary policy can only temporarily shift unemployment below the natural rate. Eventually, <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> adjust their prices and wages for inflation based on real factors, ignoring nominal changes from monetary policy. The expansionary boost will be wiped out.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{the credit}} crunch has {{prompted}} buyout firms to pursue {{a new group of}} transactions in order to deploy their massive investment funds. [...] These transactions have included Private Investment in Public Equity (or PIPE) transactions as well as purchases of debt in existing leveraged buyout transactions. [...] Some of the most notable of these transactions completed in the depths of {{the credit crunch}} include Apollo Management's acquisition of the Citigroup Loan Portfolio (2008) and TPG Capital's PIPE investment in Washington Mutual (2008). [...] According to investors and fund managers, the consensus among industry members in late 2009 was that private equity <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> need to become more like asset managers, offering buyouts as just part of their portfolio, or else focus tightly on specific sectors in order to prosper. [...] The industry must also become better in adding value by turning businesses around rather than pure financial engineering.|$|E
500|$|A general {{difficulty}} with {{the application of the}} model, like many game theoretic models, {{is that it does not}} easily lend itself to econometric testing and parameter estimation. As a result, the two avenues of empirical research that have been pursued in subsequent literature have been estimates of a [...] "conjectural variation" [...] parameter for particular industries, and calibration of the models using behavioral parameters from other studies. The former approach assumes that firms have a [...] "conjecture" [...] as to how the other <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> react to their own choice of output and base their decision on this belief. However, the approach is problematic, both from an analytical (it is not internally consistent) and an empirical point of view (there's no guarantee that the parameter, even if it makes conceptual sense, remains stable when a new policy – the government's subsidy – is introduced). Calibrations of models of industry structure on the other hand have generally found that most industry are neither Cournot (in which case the Brander–Spencer policy prescription would be an export subsidy) nor Bertrand (in which case the optimal policy is an export tax). As a result, it is hard to say in which industries exactly the Brander–Spencer policy prescription may apply.|$|E
50|$|However, a firm cannot {{continue}} to incur losses indefinitely. In the long run, the <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> {{have to earn}} sufficient revenue to cover all its expenses and must decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere. The long-run decision {{is based on the}} relationship of the price and long-run average costs. If P ≥ AC then the <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> not exit the industry. If P < AC, then the <b>firm</b> <b>will</b> exit the industry. These comparisons will be made after the firm has made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments. In the long run a firm operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs.|$|R

2500|$|Furthermore, many {{venture capital}} <b>firms</b> <b>will</b> only seriously {{evaluate}} {{an investment in}} a start-up company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove {{at least some of}} its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services. To achieve this, or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors. This practice is called [...] "bootstrapping".|$|E
