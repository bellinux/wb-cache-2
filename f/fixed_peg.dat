40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of a new theory of price determination (due to Leeper, Woodford and Sims) {{for the maintenance of}} various exchange rate systems – crawling <b>pegs,</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>pegs,</b> and common currency areas. It shows that deeper monetary integration requires more fiscal discipline, especially if price stability is an objective; these monetary arrangements cannot be achieved by monetary policy alone, as conventional wisdom would seem to suggest. A particularly striking result is that a currency peg is simply not sustainable if fiscal surpluses are determined by an exogenous political process; maintenance of a <b>fixed</b> currency <b>peg</b> requires the government to guarantee fiscal solvency for any equilibrium sequence of prices (which Woodford calls a Ricardian Regime). Interestingly, the debt and deficit constraints that were written into the Maastricht Treaty, and will continue in the Stability Pact after EMU, are examples of the fiscal discipline that is required.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} nature of fiscal {{discipline}} under alternative exchange rate regimes. First, it shows that fiscal agencies under a currency union with a fixed exchange rate can have a larger incentive to overspend or "free ride" than those under other exchange rate regimes, owing to the agencies' ability to spread the costs of overspending in inflation tax across both time, given the fixed exchange rate, and space, given the currency union. In contrast, such free-riding behavior does not arise under flexible regimes owing to the immediate inflationary impact of spending. Next, empirically, fiscal stances in countries with <b>fixed</b> <b>pegs</b> and currency union regimes demonstrate greater free-riding behavior than do countries with more flexible regimes in fifteen Caribbean countries from 1983 to 2004. currency unions, exchange rates, fiscal policy,...|$|R

However, {{the availability of a}} devaluation option provides a policy tool for handling large shocks.

50|$|Because a nation's {{exchange}} rate {{has a big}} impact on its 'balance of trade' and its 'balance of payments', many economists favour freely floating {{exchange rate}}s over the older, <b>fixed</b> (or <b>pegged)</b> rates of foreign currency exchange. Floating exchange rates allow more regular adjustments in exchange rates to occur, allowing the greater opportunity for international payments to maintain equilibrium.|$|R
50|$|A {{central bank}} that {{implements}} a {{fixed exchange rate}} policy may face a situation where supply and demand would tend to push {{the value of the}} currency lower or higher (an increase in demand for the currency would tend to push its value higher, and a decrease lower) and thus the central bank would have to use reserves to maintain its fixed exchange rate. Under perfect capital mobility, the change in reserves is a temporary measure, since the fixed exchange rate attaches the domestic monetary policy to that of the country of the base currency. Hence, in the long term, the monetary policy has to be adjusted in order to be compatible with that of the country of the base currency. Without that, the country will experience outflows or inflows of capital. <b>Fixed</b> <b>pegs</b> were usually used as a form of monetary policy, since attaching the domestic currency to a currency of a country with lower levels of inflation should usually assure convergence of prices.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crawling}} peg attempts to combine flexibility and stability using a rule-based system for gradually altering the currency's par value, [...] typically at a predetermined rate or {{as a function}} of inflation differentials.

Among variants of fixed exchange rates, it imposes the least restrictions, and may hence yield the smallest credibility benefits. The credibility effect depends on accompanying institutional measures and record of accomplishment.|$|E

50|$|Djibouti has {{experienced}} stable {{economic growth in}} recent years as a result of achievements in macroeconomic adjustment efforts. Fiscal adjustment measures included downsizing the civil service, implementing a pension reform that placed the system on a much stronger financial footing, and strengthening public expenditure institutions. From 2003 to 2005, annual real GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent driven by good performance in the services sector and strong consumption. Inflation has been kept low (only 1 percent in 2004, compared with 2.2 percent in 2003), due to the <b>fixed</b> <b>peg</b> of the Djibouti franc to the US dollar. However, as mentioned above, unemployment has remained high at over 40 percent in recent years.

40|$|Monetary policy {{design has}} {{experienced}} major changes {{over the last}} twenty years. These changes had their origin in changes in mac-roeconomic theory, {{a better understanding of}} the importance of achiev-ing and maintaining low inflation, and the abandonment of <b>fixed</b> <b>pegs</b> in favor of floating exchange rate regimes. The new macroeconomic models emphasize the role of microeconomic foundations and expec-tations and highlight the need to develop and strengthen institutions. One of the key consequences of this process is the recognition that stabilization policies cannot achieve permanent gains in output or employment. The emphasis on credibility and the incorporation of explicit for-ward-looking expectations have similarly contributed to the recogni-tion that monetary policy must have a forward-looking design. Given the lags between policy decisions and their effect on the real economy, it is necessary to contemplate not only the current values of relevant variables, but also forecast values in the right horizon.

40|$|Many {{emerging}} market economies have experienced large buildups {{of foreign exchange}} rate reserves over the last decade.

While Asian economies have become significant gross creditors in bonds and other fixed income assets, their liability position in equity and FDI assets has also grown significantly. This suggests that a full understanding of the reserve growth episode must be seen as part of an overall model of portfolio choice. The paper constructs a model of the interaction between an emerging market and an advanced economy in which an optimal general equilibrium portfolio structure implies that emerging market economies simultaneously build up a stock of foreign exchange rate reserves while receiving FDI flows from the advanced economy. The model can provide a reasonable quantitative account of the recent Asian experience. Asia Financial globalization FDI Foreign exchange rate reserves...|$|R

50|$|Conversion to {{the angle}} of {{disparity}} dγ is performed by inserting the position difference dz in the formulawhere a is the interocular separation of the observer and z {{the distance of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>peg</b> from the eye. To transfer dγ into the usual unit of minutes of arc, a multiplicative constant c is inserted whose value is 3437.75 (1 radian in arcminutes).

For the average interocular distance of 6.5 cm, a target distance of 6m and a typical stereoacuity of 0.5 minute of arc, the just detectable depth interval is 8 cm. As targets come closer, this interval gets smaller by the inverse square of the distance, so that an equivalent detectable depth interval at ¼ meter is 0.01 cm or the depth of impression of the head on a coin. These very small values of normal stereoacuity, expressed in differences of either object distances, or angle of disparity, makes it a hyperacuity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} that an open economy, like Oman, could often enjoy partial {{monetary policy}} independence despite operating with a <b>fixed</b> <b>peg,</b> which may {{appear as a}} clear violation of the 'macroeconomic trilemma'. While explaining the country-specific factors that create the scope for partial monetary policy independence, the paper underscores that for meaningful use of this partial monetary policy independence to attain domestic goals of inflation and output, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy must work effectively. Empirical analyses {{presented in this paper}} for Oman, however, suggest the presence of not only the 'interest rate puzzle' but also the 'IS puzzle' and the 'Phillips curve puzzle', which together signal the presence of significant transmission weaknesses. The paper, thus, concludes that costs stemming from loss of any monetary policy independence because of the <b>fixed</b> <b>peg</b> may not be very significant for Oman, and hence, any alternative exchange rate regime cannot be viewed as appropriate just on the grounds that an alternative regime could deliver greater monetary policy independence. monetary policy transmission, Oman, interest rate puzzle, IS puzzle, Phillips curve puzzle, monetary policy independence, <b>fixed</b> <b>peg,...</b>|$|E
