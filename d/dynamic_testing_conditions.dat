40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether the cognitive performance of reading disabled and poor readers can be separated under dynamic assessment procedures, and whether measures related to dynamic assessment add unique variance, beyond IQ in predicting reading achievement scores. The sample consisted of 70 children (39 females and 31 males). Within this sample four groups of children were compared: children with reading disabilities (n= 12), children with math/reading disabili-ties (n= 19), poor readers (n= 14), and skilled readers (n= 25). Intelligence, reading and math tests, and verbal working memory (WM) measures were administered (presented under static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions).</b> Two important findings emerged: (a) hierarchical regression analyses found that a dynamic assess-ment measure factor score contributed unique variance to pre-dicting reading and mathematics, beyond what is attributed to verbal IQ and initial scores related to WM; and (b) poor readers and skilled readers were more likely to change and maintain their WM score gained under the <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> than children with reading disabilities or children with a combination of math/reading disabilities. Implications for a valid classification of reading disabilities are discussed. H. LEE SWANSON, Ph.

40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the validity of the}} use of the cadaver in making estimates of the living human response to cardio-thotacic impact a series of tests were performed under similar conditions comparing the force-deflection response of the anaesthetized and the embalmed Rhesus monkey. Twelve primates (100 tests) were subjected to controlled thoracic impact with a Remington Humane Stunner while seated in a sled held firmly in place. Tests on 8 of the monkeys were performed while they were anaesthetized and again 30 days after being embalmed. Four monkeys were tested only after embalming. X-rays were used to evaluate rib fractures. Results showed clear significant differences between anaesthetized primates and those tested 30 days after being embalmed. Forces developed under the same test conditions were I 32 per cent higher for the embalmed primates compared to anaesthetized monkeys under static test conditions at maximum displacement and 25 - 50 per cent higher under <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> for all but the initial part of the tests. The results of these studies indicate that the mechanical characteristics of the primate thorax are dramatically affected by death and/ or subsequent embalming procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{graduate}} thesis was {{to develop}} a mathematical model of a standard wheelchair with a humanoid model while the human is firmly secured in the wheelchair. In the United States, there are, on average, 50 wheelchair related deaths and 36, 500 wheelchair related emergency room visits every year. About 3 out of every 4 of these incidents can be attributed to wheelchair instability, or more explicitly, the wheelchair’s ability to remain upright when moving up or down a slope or undergoing a collision with its surroundings. There have been investigations to examine the static and dynamic stability of wheelchairs in the past, but there is the need for a published theoretical analysis of wheelchairs under a range of experimental conditions. In order to analyze the stability of a wheelchair, Bruno stimulated a variety of tests by placing the wheelchair on a stable platform for static testing and by rolling the wheelchair down the ramp, for dynamic testing. The static stability was determined by measuring the maximum angle that the system of the wheelchair and human could be tilted without tipping over. Dynamic stability was evaluated by changing in the angle of the ramp that the wheelchair was pushed on and by noting any issues with the wheelchair. The results of the analysis showed a correlation with the experimental values and the mathematical model proved to be accurate in the case of static stability. The dynamic stability results showed some accuracy, but did not correlate as effectively with experimental data because of the instability and movement throughout the wheelchair system during <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|E

Quasi-static and dynamic J- R resistance curves were obtained on both the parent and weld material. Three point bend specimens were used with a width of 30 mm and a thickness of 15 mm. All specimens were sidegrooved {{to a depth of}} 10 % on each side. In the case of the welded specimens the notches were located in the weld centre line. All tests were carried out in accordance with the ESIS protocol on R curve <b>testing</b> of plastics. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out over a range of impact velocities between 0. 5 and 1 m/sec. Load time data were obtained using a piezoelectric force transducer and displacement was derived from the double integration of the acceleration. Energy to maximum displacement was used to calculate J. Little difference was observed between the parent and the weld materials under both quasi-static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Impact loading significantly reduced the level of the J- R curves for both the parent and weld materials particularly at higher values of ∆a. J 0. 2 values were reduced by up to 50 %.

Bureau of Mines Pittsburgh Research Center research showed that, under static <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> electrical current levels permitted under present regulations may not limit cable temperatures {{to less than}} the 90 20 C rating of reeled trailing cable. Continuing research under the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) addresses thermal characteristics of reeled trailing cable under <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> more representative of field conditions, where operators constantly reel in and pay out cable. This research is in support of efforts by industry associations and the Mine Safety and Health Administration to establish safety guidelines for cyclically rated reeled machines.

Temperature measurements are reported to be accurate to within 12120 C. The test setup requires access to only one end of the trailing cable, allowing researchers to freely reel in and pay out cable while temperature measurements are made, simulating field conditions.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if postural sway data could predict the incidence of lateral ankle injury in collegiate level soccer players. Postural sway data was collected using the Chattecx Balance System. At the beginning of the fall 2000 soccer season, 33 subjects were tested under sixteen different conditions. These test conditions involved single leg stance with both the dominant and non-dominant lower extremities, a static and dynamic force platform, eyes open and eyes closed, and shoes on and shoes off variables. The athletes were then followed throughout the soccer season and the incidence of ankle injury was recorded. At the conclusion of the playing season the postural sway data along with the injury data were analyzed using a stepwise discriminant analysis and a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. One testing condition was found to significantly predict ankle injury. Postural sway data recorded from that test condition which involved a dynamic platform, the dominant lower extremity, eyes open, and shoes off, (condition M) were found to have predictive characteristics for ankle injury. Under condition M, 72. 7 % of the 33 subjects were correctly classified as either injured or uninjured. During the season six athletes incurred lateral ankle injuries and of those six, 100 % were classified correctly as injured under condition M. However, nine non-injured athletes were incorrectly classified as injured. Analysis of variance demonstrated significant interaction among conditions. When comparing eyes open to eyes closed conditions {{there was a significant difference}} as expected. In addition, a significant difference was demonstrated when comparing static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> From our results we found evidence that it may be possible to predict those athletes at greater risk for ankle injury using specific single leg stance conditions to measure postural sway data. However, further research with greater numbers of participants is needed to determine why only a dynamic platform, dominant lower extremity, eyes open and shoes off test condition, (condition M) was found to be of significantly related to ankle injury...|$|E

The regulations specify full-scale <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> on production seats. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> are designed to demonstrate the structural integrity of the seat to withstand an emergency landing event and occupant safety. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standard, AS 8049, supports detailed information on <b>dynamic</b> seat <b>testing</b> procedures and acceptance criteria. Full-scale <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> in support of certification is expensive and repeated testing due to failures drastically increases the expense. Involvement of impact environments, flexibility in interior configurations and complexity of seat engineering designs make analysis of these problems quite complex, so that classical hand calculations are practically impossible. Efforts {{have been made to}} improve the occupant safety and to reduce the testing costs through substantiation via computer modeling analysis techniques. Development in Dynamic Finite Element Analysis (DFEA) methodology helps the aircraft industry in designing and certifying seats and other interiors more economically and confidently. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide a methodology for aircraft seat certification by using DFEA techniques. The goal of the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in product development is not only to design a seat but also to substantiate the certification tests or replace the certification tests. The case of a certification by substantiation tests increases the necessity of validation of the Finite Element model. The US government Advisory Circular (AC) 20 - 146 demonstrates the methodology for dynamic seat “Certification by Analysis” for use in Parts 23, 25, 27 and 29 airplanes and rotorcraft. This AC provides guidance on how to validate the computer model and under what conditions the model may be used in support of certification or Technical Standard Order (TSO) approval/ authorization and same validation process utilizes in this research work. In the methodology of this dissertation, the seat certification process for business jet aircraft is defined in 3 stages: 1. Evaluation of seat critical options by using a simple FE – one-dimensional (1 D) seat model, 2. Non linear FE analysis of seat worst loading condition and validation with the test results, 3. Substantiation of certification test or tests by using validated FE model and updation of the certification plan.

"The {{increasing}} {{trend of}} carrying babies in aircraft {{raises the question}} of their safety. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) states that all occupants should be restrained during takeoff, landing, and turbulent conditions and that all infants and small children should be restrained in an approved child restraint system appropriate to their height and weight. The present child seats are primarily developed for automotive applications and not tested for aerospace applications; therefore, {{there is a need to}} test these child restraint systems for aerospace <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Also, the cost of actual testing and the secrecy maintained by manufacturers make research process difficult and increase the importance of computer simulations. The need for validated computer models is imperative. The 12 -month-old and 3 -year-old child seats used in this research have been approved for use in automobiles but not in aircraft. This research attempts to develop and validate a child restraint seat model for aerospace application. Two types of child restraint seat models - 12 -month-old and 3 -year-old child seat models were developed and validated using the computational tool MADYMO. The surface models of these two types of seat were exported in IGS format and meshed using Hypermesh. The meshed model was then defined as a facet in MADYMO. These models were validated for the type II <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> specified according to FAA regulations. Validation was carried out by comparing the kinematics in the simulations and the actual sled tests. To ensure validity, a comparison of various acceleration profiles and force/moments experienced by the occupant under <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> were compared. Furthermore, the injury levels sustained by the occupant in the actual sled tests and the simulations were compared. Thus, the seat models were validated for their practical applications. These simulated models can help in future research on child safety and to generate guidelines for child restraint use in aircraft...|$|R

The fabrication of shear thickening fluid (STF) made from ethylene glycol and fumed silica was studied and its properties were measured with a rheometer under state steady and <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> The temperature effect on shear thickening fluid was also investigated and a numerical function was proposed to express {{the relationship between the}} temperature, viscosity, and concentration of fumed silica. Adding fumed silica to a currently used commercial electrolyte resulted in a shear thickening electrolyte with a higher ionic conductivity than the commercial electrolyte. Furthermore, the batteries using this shear thickening electrolyte provided extra mechanical protection than those batteries containing commercial electrolyte. The magnetorheological shear thickening fluids (MRSTFs) can be gained by combining the magnetorheological fluid (MRF) and shear thickening fluid. This new MRSTFs were tested and revealed both a magnetorheological effect and shear thickening properties. Moreover, the damper filled with MRSTF had unique properties coming from both magnetorheological fluid and shear thickening fluid. Shear stiffened elastomers (SSEs) made of silicone rubber and silicone oil were fabricated and observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). A cluster structure was observed and the sample with a higher concentration of silicone oil had longer clusters of silicone rubber. The rheology of shear stiffened elastomers was measured with a rheometer and it showed that the sample with a higher concentration of silicone oil had a longer linear range and a lower shear modulus. During the <b>dynamic</b> frequency sweep <b>tests</b> when the shear strain amplitude was above a critical value, the shear stiffened elastomer sample was seen to change from solid to liquid and then from liquid to solid, which was the onset of shear stiffened...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> in the <b>condition</b> {{assessment}} of existing bridges {{to support their}} rehabilitation and strengthening designs is becominga common procedure, yet additional <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> after rehabilitation is rare. Nevertheless, combining the results of <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> beforeand after bridge rehabilitation produces unique and valuable information regarding changes occurred in a bridge¿s dynamic properties. Such dual testing would allow researchers to verify the behavior predicted {{at the design stage}} and to assess the stiffness variation, which wouldeliminate the need for mandatory field static testing. This article reports the modal analysis of a unique centenary steel-arch bridge that wasrecently rehabilitated and strengthened. The ambient vibration test conducted after the construction works is described, and the data arecompared with those collected before the rehabilitation. Structural identification is completed by means of experimentally validated threedimensional(3 D) finite-element (FE) models simulating both phases. The results bring to light important findings concerning variation in bridgestiffness, changes in the modal parameters, and the impact of support conditions and structure of decks in bridge dynamic properties...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In the {{automotive}} industry, {{more and more}} it is compulsory to develop new grades of stainless steels, such as high resistant Martensitic Stainless Steels (MA-SS) and Ferritic Stainless Steels (FSS) in order to realise certain or many complex deep drawn pieces. For these grades, resistance spot welding (RSW) is the most widespread process used largely for {{many parts of the}} car body in {{the automotive}} industry. This paper aims to characterise mechanical behaviour (toughness) of the different steel grades under <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Design/methodology/approach: A special crash test device is used in different temperatures and the simulated crash tests are performed at a constant speed of 5. 52 m/s. Findings: The specimen is submitted to impact tensile test at different temperatures. According to testing temperature, fracture mode varies: At low temperatures, brittle fracture occurs: due to stress concentration, fracture always occurs in the notched section. At high temperatures, the specimen fails by ductile fracture. Toughness of the steel sheets (base metals, BM or welded parts) is well compared at different materials and <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Research limitations/implications: Evaluation of welded thin sheets submitted to the dynamic loading in order to correlate in real service conditions in order to realize a useful correlation between the transition temperature and deep drawability can be used for evaluating of the welding conditions and also of the material characteristics. For detail study, this type of the test needs a standard formulation. Practical implications: This is a new conception of specimen and of the impact/crash machine. It is widely used in automotive industry for practical and economic reason to give rapid answers to designer and also steel makers for ranking the materials. Originality/value: New developed test called impact crash test for evaluating the toughness of thin welded joints (tailored blanks) / mechanical assemblies in high formability steel sheets for stamping submitted to dynamic loads such as experienced in real crash tests...|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} PV generator {{is presented}} in this paper, whose target application is the <b>dynamic</b> <b>test,</b> in controllable <b>conditions,</b> of MPPT algorithms or circuits. The system comprises three main components: a solid state lamp, its power supply and control electronics, and a PV module. The instrument uses the controlled light emission of the solid state lamp to induce photogeneration in the PV module. The LED drivers are designed so that the incident radiation intensity can be modulated within a relatively large bandwidth (in the kHz range). Thus, the PV module power output can be precisely controlled and, in particular, relatively rapid and pre-determined variations can be induced. These features allow the implementation of repeatable <b>dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> of any converter connected to the PV module and, in particular, of its built-in MPPT strategy. From this standpoint, the instrument outperforms both existing optical solar simulators, e. g. based on gas discharge or incandescent lamps, and electrical simulators, based on suitably controlled power supplies. Indeed, the former offer very limited dynamic performance, the latter only replicate the static PV generator characteristics. To prove {{the effectiveness of the}} instrument, a ripple correlation MPPT strategy is tested. Experimental results are presented...|$|R
40|$|Coefficients of {{friction}} and wear lifetime for machine elements are usually estimated from pin-on-disc tests under fixed <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> The experimental {{design of a}} tribotester with variable sliding path, dynamically changing normal loads, and sliding velocities is {{presented in this paper}} together with a preliminary evaluation of sliding properties for engineering polymers. The design of a dynamic loading mechanism and control of the sliding motion are detailed. The importance of <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> is illustrated for polyamides and polyacetals under pure, internally lubricated and glass fibre-reinforced <b>conditions.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> induce lower friction compared with static tests because of influences of visco-elastic deformation, inertia forces, and possibly molecular orientation on the sliding surface. Internal lubricants efficiently reduce friction and wear both under static and dynamic conditions. Glass fibres more effectively reduce wear rates on <b>dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> indicating different wear debris mobility in the interface...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Left {{ventricular}} assist device (LVAD) therapy can be live-saving {{for advanced}} heart failure patients. Conventional anastomosis (surgical connection) of LVAD outflow grafts to the aorta requires aortic clamping and hand-suturing. Aortic clamping {{increases the risk}} for neurological complications. Hand-suturing may be time-consuming and requires significant surgical dexterity. There is currently no commercially available device for sutureless anastomosis of large vascular grafts (diameter 3 ̆e 5 mm). To overcome these limitations, a prototype LVAD outflow graft anastomosis device (GrAD) that facilitates sutureless anastomosis was developed and tested to demonstrate proof-of-concept and feasibility for (1) secured attachment withstanding physiological pressures, and (2) comparable attachment strength to conventionally hand-sewn sutured anastomosis. Methods: To demonstrate proof-of-concept, prototype GrADs were fabricated using a nitinol wire connector attached to a 15 mm graft, felt flanged cuff, and cyanoacrylate adhesive. To demonstrate feasibility, the GrAD was anastomosed to bovine descending aorta and tested in a mock flow loop over a range of static (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 mmHg) and dynamic pressures (normal, hypertension, heart failure, LVAD support) to quantify v leakage. The maximum pull-out force for the GrAD and sutured anastomosis were also measured after completing static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> in the mock flow loop model. Results: The GrAD remained securely attached during all static and <b>dynamic</b> pressure <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> as evidenced by minimal leak rates during clinically equivalent normal (22. 1 ± 9. 3 ml/min), hypertension (23. 1 ± 10. 1 ml/min), heart failure (16. 4 ± 6. 4 ml/min), and LVAD support (16. 4 ± 4. 3 mL/min) <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Significantly larger leak rates at normal dynamic pressure (120 / 80 mmHg) between the GrAD and previously reported results for hand-sutured anastomosis were not observed. Differences in peak pull-out force between GrAD (43. 57 ± 17. 31 N) and hand-sutured anastomosis (63. 48 ± 8. 72 N) were statistically indiscernible (paired t-test, p 3 ̆c 0. 5). No indications of device damage were observed. Conclusion: A prototype GrAD enabling a sutureless, adaptable, and angled LVAD outflow graft anastomosis was developed with preliminary feasibility testing demonstrating proof-of-concept. The proposed LVAD outflow GrAD may facilitate surgical implant by {{eliminating the need for}} hand-suturing, decrease implant time, and increase reliability and reproducibility with the potential to improve patient outcomes...|$|R
