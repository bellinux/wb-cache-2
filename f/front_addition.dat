5|$|Originally, {{the plant}} {{consisted}} of the company offices and the large Manufacturing Building. The Mason house, which would become the company office was originally constructed in 1861. It is a two-story brick Italianate style house that was converted {{to be used as}} an office building and significantly modified throughout the years. The 1929 addition added a wing that connected it to the metal products building which was built that year. In 1942, a two-story <b>front</b> <b>addition</b> was added and another addition to the west was added around 1950. These additions also resulted in the removal of the cupola, brick chimneys, front entry, and veranda. The Manufacturing building, constructed from 1912 to 1913, is three stories high on the river side and two stories on the east. It is divided into 31 bays with pilasters. At each end of the building are stairs and elevator towers. The structural remains of the original glass house survive as a sub-basement in a one-story extension {{at the south end of}} the building.|$|E

The Mawdsley House is located on 228 Spring Street and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The house was owned by Historic New England (SPNEA) until it was sold in the late twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{serving as}} the {{township}} hall, the building was originally the meeting place for the IOOF lodge whose datestone appears on the facade; the lodge was chartered just one year before the building was built. In the late 1970s, the building was no longer used as a government or fraternal building, but {{despite the presence of}} the unsympathetic addition to the facade, it was still seen as a high-quality work of institutional architecture. By this time, it had been adaptively reused, and it was home to an engineering firm, which decided to remove the <b>front</b> <b>addition</b> in conjunction with a grassroots effort to revitalize the neighborhood. By the early 2010s, it had become home to a dance studio.|$|E
50|$|Craig House is a {{historic}} home located near Lancaster, Lancaster County, South Carolina. The House was originally owned by John Craig, Esquire, whose family originated in southwestern Scotland, immigrated to South Carolina from Northern Ireland in 1772. After receiving a land grant in Lancaster County from King George III, Craig bought additional land in the Waxhaws in 1773. John Craig, Esquire {{and several of his}} sons fought in the Revolutionary War battles that occurred in the vicinity. The current Craig House dates from the early 1830s, and was originally a federal-style farmhouse. In 1901, it was significantly enlarged with a Victorian <b>front</b> <b>addition</b> by John Edgar and Amanda Drennan Craig, who were married in 1883 at Kilburnie, then the residence of the Drennans.|$|E

50|$|In 1959 county voters {{approved}} a bond issue {{for a new}} county government complex in Queensbury, along Route 9 several {{miles south of the}} village. It was built and opened in 1963, at which time the old courthouse was finally abandoned. It was vacant for several years, and considered for demolition until the newly formed Lake George Historical Association was able to persuade the Town of Lake George, which owned it by then, to reopen it for use as the association's offices and museum. Shortly afterwards, in 1969, the 1885 <b>front</b> <b>addition</b> was torn down to restore the original view of the front of the building. In 1977, the Lake George Arts Center joined the historical society, opening a gallery in the former courtroom in addition to using the building as its headquarters as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{house and}} land have seen several changes over their lifetime. A <b>front</b> <b>addition</b> to reorient {{the house to}} face Bardstown Road was created in 1820. A front porch was added in 1890. A back porch {{conversion}} from a laundry room and servant's quarters into a structure to house the latest invention (an automobile) was made in 1914. The sun-room built off the original south-facing front door was added in 1920. Parts of the property were parceled off and sold due to pressure for suburban growth after World War II. Seneca High School and Goldsmith Elementary School were built on parcels from the farm in the 1950s. More land was sold off due to demand from the ever-growing suburbs and it was eventually reduced to roughly 2 and a half acres to create a remnant green space in its suburban context. A rain garden, extensive landscaping, along with structural improvements and cosmetic enhancements were made in 2007-2008.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{adsorption}} {{and mechanical}} entrapment {{are two major}} causes of polymer retention in porous media. Physical adsorption is considered an equilibrium process and is often modeled by assuming a Langmuir isotherm. The outcome is a steady state pressure response because the permeability reduction is also accounted for by adsorption. However, some experimental data show gradual increase of pressure with time, implying that polymer retention is a time-dependent process. We discuss simultaneous effect of sorption and mechanical entrapment on the polymer retention in porous media. An exact solution for 1 -D flow problem for the case of constant filtration coefficient and Langmuir-sorption isotherm, including explicit formulae for breakthrough concentration and pressure drop across the core is derived. The general model with a varying filtration coefficient was successfully matched with experimental data confirming the occurrence of simultaneous sorption with deep-bed filtration during polymer flow in porous media. In the absence of mechanical entrapment, the physical adsorption causes delay in the polymer front and {{does not affect the}} polymer concentration behind the <b>front.</b> <b>Addition</b> of mechanical entrapment results in slow recovery of the injected concentration at the outlet (for a varying filtration coefficient) or reaching to a steady state concentration, which is {{only a fraction of the}} injected concentration (for a constant filtration coefficient). Accurate assessment and quantification of the polymer retention requires both pressure and effluent concentration data at the outlet of the porous medium. </p...|$|E
