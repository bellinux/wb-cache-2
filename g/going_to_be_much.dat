25|$|Both armies were sobered by {{the fierce}} {{fighting}} and many casualties, {{and realized that}} the war was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> longer and bloodier than either had anticipated. The Battle of First Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of {{the first year of the}} war. Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, tactical intelligence was nil, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively. McDowell, with 35,000 men, was only able to commit about 18,000, and the combined Confederate forces, with about 32,000 men, committed only 18,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{entirety}} of the 4.7 mile-long Route 132-A {{was to be}} constructed underground through tunneling and cut-and-cover. Station mezzanines; the line north of 92nd Street, where the rock profile drops away sharply; and the area around 48th Street, {{where there is a}} crevice in the rock profile, would be constructed using cut-and-cover. The temporary decking of Second Avenue was required for this construction to take place and to allow for traffic aboveground to proceed. The remaining portions of the line were to be built through tunneling. Only one business relocation was planned for the construction of the line. A gas station at the southeast corner of 63rd Street and Second Avenue was to be relocated as the site needed to be used for a construction and ventilation shaft, in addition to being used for a permanent ventilation superstructure. Underground easements were to be required under thirteen properties in the vicinity of 63rd Street. Compared to other subway lines, the Second Avenue line was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> quieter.|$|E
2500|$|However {{it turned}} out that the {{sandbank}} on which Mascot had been beached was actually quicksand which was being pushed downwards under the weight of the boat. [...] The steamer Undine left Portland on the evening of January 6 with a barge and lifting equipment to raise Mascot off the bar. [...] The raising was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more difficult than had been originally thought.|$|E

His wounds are not so severe as the General's, and he is a much younger man, and, as I should say, with a good constitution. If there is no {{complication}} he ought to be about again in a month's time. He is perfectly sensible. Let him lie quiet for a day or two; after that it would be as well if some of you who have met him at the General's would drop in occasionally for a short chat with him; but of course we must wait {{to see if there is}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> fever." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gordon {{turned to}} Nasmyth.

6000|$|... "Well, it corroborates {{the young}} man's {{story to the}} extent that the will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday. It is curious--is it not?--that a man should draw up so {{important}} a document in so haphazard a fashion.

60|$|My Dear Hutchinson,--This is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of a letter, so don't expect what can't be had. Uncle Lloyd and Palema made a malanga[21] to go {{over the}} island to Siumu, and Talolo was anxious to go also; but how could we get along without him? Well, Misifolo, the Maypole, set off on Saturday, and walked all that day down the island to beyond Faleasiu with a letter for Iopu; and Iopu and Tali and Misifolo rose very early on the Sunday morning, and walked all that day up the island, and came by seven at night--all pretty tired, and Misifolo most of all--to Tanugamanono.[22] We at Vailima knew nothing at all about the marchings of the Saturday and Sunday, but Uncle Lloyd got his boys and things {{together}} and went to bed.|$|E

She {{included}} them all in her forecast, she included them all in her maternity, although the party comprised William Pepper and Miss Allan, both of whom might have been supposed to have seen a fair share of the panorama. [...] "When I see how the world has changed in my lifetime," [...] she went on, [...] "I can set no limit to what may happen in the next fifty years. Ah, no, Mr. Pepper, I don't agree with you in the least," [...] she laughed, interrupting his gloomy remark about things going steadily from bad to worse. [...] "I know I ought to feel that, but I don't, I'm afraid. They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> better people than we were. Surely everything goes to prove that. All round me I see women, young women, women with household cares of every sort, going out and doing things that we should not have thought it possible to do." ...|$|E
60|$|Mary Erskine {{was very}} much {{interested}} in this plan. She would {{like to live in}} a handsome house as well as any other lady, only she preferred to wait until she could have one of her own. Now that that time had arrived, she was greatly pleased with the prospect of having her kitchen, her sitting-room, and her bed-room, in three separate rooms, instead of having them, as heretofore, all in one. Then the barns and barn-yards, and the pens and sheds for the sheep and cattle, were all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more convenient than they had been; so that Albert could take care of a greater amount of stock than before, with the same labor. The new house, too, was going to be built in a much more pleasant situation than the old one, and the road from it to the corner was to be improved, so that they could go in and out with a wagon. In a word, Mary Erskine's heart was filled with new hopes and anticipations, as she saw before her means and sources of happiness, higher and more extended than she had ever before enjoyed.|$|E
