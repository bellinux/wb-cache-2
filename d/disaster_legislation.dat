40|$|Disaster {{research}} and scholarship is now advocating {{a shift from}} focusing on the hazard event to processes that generate vulnerability and loss of resilience to <b>disasters.</b> <b>Disaster</b> <b>legislations</b> are among prominent instruments that can highlight the tensions as well as challenges that are being encountered towards this change in focus. Using textual analysis, this paper presents a study that investigated whether five post- 2002 <b>disaster</b> <b>legislations</b> have shifted emphasis from the hazard to the vulnerability and resilience paradigms. The five examples illustrate that {{while there is a}} slight change, at least in rhetoric, from response to a prevention focus, <b>disaster</b> <b>legislations</b> largely promote a centralised institutional framework, with inadequate resource commitments and limited participation from vulnerable communities. Consequently, while generalisations simply cannot be made without a wider analysis of many more examples from different countries, the five <b>disaster</b> <b>legislations</b> appear to re-emphasise the response focus with less attention on the processes that reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience. The conclusion is that while the rhetoric has changed, the <b>disaster</b> <b>legislations</b> have not significantly moved from the hazard to vulnerability and resilience focus suggesting that reduction of losses and damages to disasters remains a big challenge...|$|R

40|$|Among {{a myriad}} of {{recommendations}} on commodity programs, conservation, trade, res-earch, and rural development was a solitary recommendation on disaster assistance policy: eliminate the federal crop insurance program, which had existed since 1938, {{and replace it with}} a standing disaster program. The crop insurance program was criticized for low par-ticipation (less than 25 % of the eligible area was enrolled in the program prior to 1989), poor financial performance, and the failure to prevent the passage of costly ad hoc <b>disaster</b> <b>legislation</b> when crop losses were widespread. The proposal noted that the combined costs for federal crop insurance and ad hoc disaster assistance averaged more than $ 1. 1 billion annually from 1981 – 88 (U. S. Department of Agriculture 1990). While Congress failed to act on the Bush administration’s recom-mendation, frustration with the federal crop insurance program was widely felt (Glauber and Collins 2002).

40|$|When a {{disaster}} strikes the United States, Congress typically feels heavy pressure to enact legislation, including tax legislation, to provide relief. This Article discusses features of two tax legislative initiatives, which responded to two quite different disasters: first, {{the response to}} the devastation of the fall 2005 hurricane season and, then, {{the response to the}} earlier terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon of September 11, 2001. The Article first raises the possibility that some of the provisions of these acts may be vulnerable to indirect constitutional challenge under the Uniformity Clause. In examining some of the problems inherent in post-disaster tax legislation, it discusses the role, usually unfortunate, of sympathy in tax legislation. It goes on to consider how, {{despite the fact that the}} targets of relief legislation are generally thought to be people in need, it nevertheless seems to be the case that a good deal of the benefits of <b>disaster</b> <b>legislation</b> in the tax area goes to relatively high-income and high-wealth taxpayers. It asks whether a better approach can be institutionalized. It suggests that Congress identify those provisions enacted in response to the recent disasters that make sense generally, such as five-year carryback of net operating losses, and amend the tax code to adopt these rules generally. It further recommends that Congress identify those provisions needed in particular when a whole area is devastated-a five-year period for replacing destroyed property, credit for wages to pre-disaster employees, and routine extensions of filing deadlines-and make them available to any declared disaster area. It urges as well two kinds of longer-term approaches. One is to consider and evaluate disaster tax relief provisions as a kind of national insurance against disasters that the private market does not supply.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the Philippines, policy, {{legal and}} {{institutional}} arrangements for disaster management originated in 1941 when the nation’s second president, Manuel Quezon, created the Civilian Emergency Administration {{in anticipation of}} the war in Europe moving to the Pacific. Almost forty years later, in 1978, the same procedures instigated under Quezon’s Executive Order EO 335 were transferred by President Marcos via Presidential Decree PD 1566. In 2005 these two directives still comprise the basic arrangements for the nation’s disaster management system. Efforts to identify approaches that can streamline disaster risk management institutions in the Philippines have recently been embarked on. One of these has concentrated on drafting new <b>disaster</b> management <b>legislation</b> that incorporates features relevant to the Philippines, some of which have been taken from disaster laws recently enacted elsewhere. This draft legislation is discussed below. If the Philippines legislature approves the tenets identified in this draft, it will enable the nation to move beyond its current reactive posture, will facilitate the country’s organized resources to effectively coordinate activities in areas that will have the best outcomes for the nation’s development, and will be the owner of a model disaster risk management law...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{identify}} how local populations, particularly at the municipaland village levels, can enhance their capacity to prepare and respond more effectively and efficiently to the logistic challenges that they face {{in the aftermath of}} a natural disaster. Design/methodology/approach - Using a phenomenological approach, a qualitative research study was conducted from an interpretative, constructivist perspective. Through a series of semi-structuredinterviews the researchers gathered stories about the experiences of local responders at municipal level in the capital city region of the Republic of the Philippines in the aftermath of specific natural disaster event (Typhoon Ondoy - September 2009). A number of key differences between the espoused strategies expressed in <b>disaster</b> management <b>legislation</b> and the actual experiences of local people on the ground were identified and, as a result, a conceptual model was developed that, if implemented, would enhance the capacity of local populations to prepare and respond in a more efficient and effective manner. Findings - Results from the study indicate that the ability of local populations to contribute to the logistic preparation and response processes has been considerably undervalued and underutilised. A revised model is therefore developed that better incorporates their potential contribution to the management of both the demand and supply sides that would lead to swifter, more accurate, and more efficient logistic response mechanisms. Originality/value - The developing canon of humanitarian logistic literature has, to date, been relatively silent on the subject of the contribution of the local population to the overall logistic management challenge. The paper provides important insights into the issues on which the government of a developing country could usefully focus attention in their approach to natural disaster preparedness and response, and it offers a conceptual model for future testing and evaluation.

40|$|The {{disaster}} {{occurring in}} the Eastern Italian Alps {{in the summer of}} 1985 was caused by the failure of two tailings dams located just upstream from the village of Stava in the municipality of Tesero (Trento province, Italy). The structure comprised two small storage basins for the deposition of tailings from the separation process of the Prestavel fluorite mine. On their downstream sides, the basins were contained by steep earth embankments, whereas upstream they rested directly on the natural slope. The total height {{from the base of the}} lower dam to the crest of the upper dam was over 50 m. On 19 July 1985, the front of the upper dam suddenly burst, triggering a vast mudflow (180 000 m 3 ) that flowed down-channel through Stava, a small village of 20 buildings. The mudflow rapidly traveled over 4. 2 km along the Stava Valley and passed through Tesero, before flowing into the Avisio River. The mudflow destroyed many buildings and resulted in 268 fatalities and 20 injuries. From an analysis of the data collected and field observation, several factors may be cited as having contributed to increasing instability, as the upper dam continued to be raised until the disastrous collapse of 19 July. Foremost among these factors is the mistaken assumption that the tailings deposited in the impoundments would consolidate fairly quickly. Indeed, no monitoring system was ever installed to verify the assumed consolidation. Other operational shortcomings and construction errors were contributing factors. Regulations requiring construction standards, operational monitoring, and independent periodic inspection could have prevented this <b>disaster.</b> Comprehensive <b>legislation</b> is required to effectively limit the adverse consequences of tailings dam failures by providing a regulatory environment where the safety and welfare of the local area can be balanced with the economic benefits of mining operations...|$|R
40|$|Federal {{income support}} {{programs}} provide producers {{with only a}} limited degree of income protection {{in the event of}} a widespread crop failure. As an alternative to supplemental disaster assistance, we propose a modification of the deficiency payments program in which a producer's payment would be based on the difference between a target revenue and the average revenue in the producer's region. A regional target revenue progam would provide improved individual income protection without promoting moral hazard and would limit regional revenue shortfalls, thereby eliminating the demand for supplemental disaster assistance and reducing government costs. Key words: deficiency payments, disaster assistance, revenue insurance, risk and uncertainty. Much of the debate surrounding the 1990 farm bill focused on the best means of providing pro-ducers with income protection {{in the event of a}} widespread crop failure. The debate is not new. Prior to 1980, the U. S. Department of Agricul-ture (USDA) provided disaster assistance mainly through direct cash payments. Because of strong criticism that the disaster payment program was too expensive, restrictive in scope, and encour-aged production in high-risk areas, Congress en-acted the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 to replace the disaster payment program with crop insurance as the primary means of providing catastrophic ncome protection to farmers. The federal crop insurance program, how-ever, has failed to perform as expected. A 1 -though the 1980 act authorized the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to subsidize producer premium payments and to expand coverage, participation in the program between 1980 and 1 1988 never exceeded 25 % of eligible acreage. Adverse selection and moral hazard problems also seriously undermined the actuarial perfor-mance of the program and led to large govem-ment outlays (Chambers, Nelson and Loehman, Skees and Reed). 2 Most significantly, however, the federal crop insurance progam failed to eliminate federal disaster assistance.

40|$|To {{increase}} earthquake preparation, it {{is beneficial}} {{to understand the}} effects {{of different types of}} information used in risk communications. This thesis adapts methods that have been used with other hazards or in hypothetical situations and applies them to increasing support for current earthquake-strengthening legislation in Wellington, New Zealand (NZ). Study 1 examined valence and numerical format framing. Expressing the number of buildings affected by the legislation as a negatively-valenced frequency was found to be most effective at increasing earthquake-related judgments¹. Study 2 examined descriptive and injunctive norms and found that a range of subject factors such as age and previous knowledge of the legislation influenced the effects of norms. Study 3 used the same manipulation and included a sample from Palmerston North, where earthquake risk perceptions are lower. This study showed several clear norm effects, with the combination of both descriptive and injunctive norms the most effective at increasing support for the earthquake legislation. All three studies showed that belief in the effectiveness of strengthening earthquake-prone buildings predicted support for the legislation and lower earthquake-risk tolerance, suggesting that this could be a key perception to target in communications. Overall, these studies suggest that certain messages are more effective at increasing support for the governmental legislation, but also that framing and social norm effects on real-world issues interact with other variables such as age and knowledge which ought to be examined further to increase the usefulness of psychological research to risk communication. ¹ The results of this study have been accepted for publication as a peer-reviewed journal article: Vinnell, L.

40|$|This paper shows a {{comparison}} {{from the perspective}} of flood risk management between two regions of different countries: Tokyo Metropolis (Japan) and Catalonia (Spain). The comparison is based on flood damage data for a 30 -year period (1981 - 2010), <b>legislation,</b> <b>disaster</b> management plans, recovering measures, and communication strategies. A total of 219 flood events and 110 deaths were recorded in Catalonia during 1981 - 2010, while there were 191 floods in Tokyo, during the same period, giving place to 27 deaths and missing people. In both countries, most of the deaths occurred outdoors and the majority as a consequence of imprudent behavior. Nearly 10 % of flood victims in Catalonia were foreign citizens. Regarding the institutions from the state and the communities involved in flood risk management, we have found a similar structure between the two countries. In accordance with the European Floods Directive, all the Spanish regions susceptible of having floods have flood hazard maps for different return periods, including 500 years while in the case of Japan the return periods are usually shorter. Recently, flood risk maps have been built for Catalonia, but none is available in a foreign language. Although all the maps are available in Internet, in Spain it is not mandatory to distribute maps to the public neither evacuation maps in flood-prone areas. On the contrary, evacuation and hazard maps in Japan have some parts written in different languages. In both countries, flood hazard maps are not compulsorily linked to other countermeasures such as land-use regulation (the municipality has the last decision) or flood insurance. Thresholds of heavy rain warnings are similar in both countries, using rain amounts over both short and long periods. Although the Japanese method appears more sophisticated using humidity and runoff indexes, it is too complicated for people to understand it. In contrast, only Catalonia has forecast thresholds considering probability levels. On flood insurance, only Spain has governmental aid to the flood insurance system. The level of flood risk perception is low among the population in both countries, and social communication for flood risk is insufficient, mainly in Catalonia. Thus, {{it is very important that}} individuals recognize the flood risk in the area to reduce the number of victims...|$|R

The research evaluates if the Disaster Management Unit in Johannesburg municipality is prepared in terms of policies, community campaigns on flood disasters as well as forming organizations that will assist in times of disaster. It also refers to other South African townships with regard to where most affected townships are located, how the community is affected and how the local government responds. Disaster management infers preparedness for disaster; therefore, measures of preparation from the local government need to be in place to reduce extreme losses, pro-active policies should be in place to guide officials on how to manage disasters affecting their areas. The South African local government as the third sphere of government is closest to the people and mostly responsible for the community’s wellbeing. It {{is for this reason that}} local governments should have a strategy on how to deal with disaster. Having experienced natural disaster incidents, most countries in the world have been compelled to develop <b>legislations,</b> <b>disaster</b> management and mitigation plans that guide them on how to prevent and respond to disasters. In view of a several unimagined disaster incidents in South Africa, the researcher maintains that the concept and practice of disaster management is rather new in South Africa, and many local governments do not have well-informed strategies to manage natural disasters. Unlimited rain caused by climate change, the position of residence and overpopulation can be major attributes to disasters hazards. Floods can easily flow into residential dwellings and destroy the property, not only that, but it can also result in the loss of lives and enhance the spread of diseases. It becomes more of tragedy as most people living in these areas are poor and have all their belongings in the same place which makes them even more vulnerable to disaster. The location of Stjwetla settlement along the Alexandra Township riverbanks becomes relevant at this point in case. The residents of Stjwetla are exposed to flood threats, they are very much aware of the risk associated with the low-lying geographical patterns, overpopulation and the riverbanks. However, they still occupy the disaster prone sites because they cannot afford elsewhere. Stjwetla is an illegal settlement where no one pays rent; there is a serious lack of basic municipal services such as water and electricity in the area. The residents claim to have arrived in this area simply because Johannesburg seems to offer informal job opportunities; therefore, they anticipate good opportunities in terms of employment. Most of them are from Limpopo province and have more than twenty years residing in Stjwetla, and are still unemployed. The community has formed rescue groups that help in times of regular disasters such as floods and fire. The rescue groups also mediate between the community and the northern Johannesburg municipal Disaster and Emergency Unit. The Disaster and Emergency Unit have formed good relations with the community leaders for support and emergency response. Other organizations, for instance Red Cross Society make regular input, by offering food and clothes to the people affected. Red Cross Society and other organizations work together with the local government to help Stjwetla residents deal better with disaster effects. However, the residents feel that other government departments, such as social development, health and housing must assist as well. Residents are of an idea that the disaster management unit alone cannot conquer the disaster risk in Stjwetla but social development should help with psychological therapy while health department should intervene to reduce long-term effects of injuries.

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The South African Police Service's (SAPS) main responsibility, {{according}} to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, is to protect and safeguard the inhabitants of South Africa. The SAPS had to adjust to different regime changes as occurred both before 1994 and after 1994. The main aim of the previous dispensation was to deliver a service to {{a minority of the}} population. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act, Act 57 of 1996 changed the face of Government. The new dispensation brought on after 1994 was that every person in this country has a right to receive service from National, Provincial and Local Government. The change from the old dispensation to the new caused a vacuum between the different Government departments in terms of disaster risk reduction. To bridge this gap, the Cabinet in 1997 established the Inter–Ministerial Committee on Disaster Management (IMC). This resulted in a Cabinet resolution to follow international trends and take a new look at the whole concept of civil protection. The Inter–Ministerial processes consulted a wide array of stakeholders in South Africa and this led to the publishing of the Green Paper on Disaster Management in February 1998. The Green Paper, which highlighted the need for a holistic mechanism for the management of disasters in South Africa, was followed in the following year by the White Paper process and in January 1999, for the first time, South Africa had a national policy on the management of disasters. The newly elected democratic government resolved to move away from traditional thinking that nothing could be done to prevent disasters. They developed strategies in line with global trends by integrating risk reduction methodologies into development initiatives, to build resilience in households, communities and areas known to be at risk. The SAPS role in the Civil Protection Act, Act 67 of 1977, was limited merely to giving help and assistance as requested by National, Provincial and Local Government. The Disaster Management Act, Act 57 of 2002, emphasises the multi–disciplinary and multi–sectoral role of disaster risk management in South Africa. The South African Police has had to adapt to these changes. Local Government and all relevant role–players and disaster risk management structures' main responsibility is to protect and safeguard South African citizens. The SAPS' role and responsibility must be incorporated into existing disaster risk management structures, yet the application of disaster risk management within the SAPS itself is also crucial. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore what is expected from the SAPS in terms of disaster risk management, and to compare it with what is actually happening at the frontline. The SAPS can only fully participate in disaster risk management functions if the SAPS understands its own role and functions itself. This study's aim was to identify any shortcomings internally which prevented the SAPS from achieving its rightful place in the disaster risk management realm using the geographical area of the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality as the focus area of the research. The qualitative research focus of this mini–dissertation necessitated that the researcher use semi–structured interviews (face–to–face or telephonically) in order to explore, define and obtain the data relevant to the research. Interviews with officials who are daily deployed on the frontline revealed information about their needs and frustrations experienced with the present approach to disaster risk management in the SAPS. Information collected from the interviews was grouped and analysed, key concepts were identified and received attention. Constant comparisons were drawn between the experience received from the frontline officials in the SAPS and the theory underlying this study. The research found that the SAPS in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality area is not up to standard in its approach to disaster risk management and its needed institutional capacity. The SAPS spends most of its time, funds, and resources on its primary function. Disaster risk reduction and institutional capacity development for disaster risk management will become part of the SAPS' duties in its daily activities. Structures and policies are needed in the SAPS to achieve such success. The research recommends that if the SAPS wants to establish itself as a role–player in the disaster risk management realm, attention must be given to the development and establishment of structures and policies. Structures and policies will bring all the SAPS disaster risk management role–players into line with the requirements of the <b>disaster</b> risk management <b>legislation</b> and policy, and will lead to a uniform approach to disaster risk management in the SAPS within the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality. Mr Mandela (1994 : 202), in his inauguration speech as the first democratically elected black President of South Africa emphasised: “The truth is that we are not yet free; we have merely achieved the freedom to be free, the right not be oppressed. I have walked a long road to freedom. But I discovered that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended”. Disaster Risk Management in the SAPS can be seen as one of these processes which never will be for finalised, but needs constant focus and effort to be successful. Master...|$|R
