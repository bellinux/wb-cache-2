5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E

5|$|Allenby {{reviewed}} {{the threat of}} counterattack and his supply situation and decided that a force large enough to attack into the Judean Hills and a separate force to operate on the maritime plain could be maintained far from base. He decided to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Ottoman 7th Army in the Judean Hills {{with the hope of}} capturing Jerusalem. This would keep pressure on this army <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> denying them time to complete their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E
5|$|At the February 1974 general {{election}} the Heath government was narrowly defeated.

He returned to the House of Lords {{at the end of}} 1974 when he accepted a life peerage, becoming known as Baron Home of the Hirsel, of Coldstream in the County of Berwick.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft {{carrying}} the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, {{and at least one}} officer drowned {{in a desperate attempt to}} swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the day by the cutter Aiguille.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 2009, THSRC's {{cumulative}} losses were equivalent to two-thirds of its equity capital. In response to global financial crisis and domestic economic recession, THSRC proposed to increase income and reduce expenditures in several aspects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> raising operation performances.

5|$|By this time, Hogan {{had begun}} to lose the trustees' support. At some point soon thereafter, he left the city. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell {{partially}} capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.|$|E

New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, {{and the availability of}} faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 {{the state}} Apportionment Board, {{controlled}} by a 32 Republican majority despite the party's 6138 minority in the state House of Representatives, redrew state legislative districts following {{the results of the}} 1990 Census, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> retaking control of the state House. The new boundaries created nine districts each with two resident incumbent Democrats, pairing Cordray with the twenty-two-year incumbent Mike Stinziano. Unable to be elected in another district due to a one-year residency requirement, Cordray opted not to run for re-election.|$|E
