6000|$|... "I {{will take}} care of meself, Dicky, and now that you will have nobody to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of your scrapes, you will have to mind {{yourself}} too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on a moment, sir, if you please; I'll come {{on board}} you. Perhaps I can <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of your difficulty; for I happen to know {{something}} of that ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{surely you}} want it in the papers, don't you?' I urged. 'With a scandal like this, one couldn't, in justice to the democracy, be exclusive. We'd {{syndicate}} it here and in the United States. I <b>helped</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of the sack, if you remember.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to-night, Norris," [...] she said. [...] "I have {{something}} else to do; but before I go I want you to answer me a question. Once before, when my father had you in a corner, I <b>helped</b> <b>you</b> <b>out,</b> and <b>you</b> know the price I paid." ...|$|R
60|$|Gom. Why, am not I a friend, then, to <b>help</b> <b>thee</b> <b>out?</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} been fumbling half an hour for this excuse. But, as I remember, you promised to storm my citadel, and bring your {{regiment}} of red locusts upon me for free quarters: I find, colonel, by your habit, there are black locusts in the world, as well as red.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Good evening!' I said genially. 'Let me <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of that.' The head glared. 'We've got 'em,' I went on. 'They came {{to quite}} the wrong shop {{for this sort}} of game--quite the wrong shop.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course it}} is not necessary! Few {{things in the world}} really are! I only wanted to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of your troubles; but if you do not wish me to [...] . !' Leonard {{interrupted}} in alarm: ...|$|E

"Or, supposing I had chosen, myself, {{to indulge}} in those {{expensive}} habits, which would have absorbed my income, and left me unable to do more for you, than many other noblemen in my position do for their sons--do you ever reflect how impossible it would then have been {{for me to have}} <b>helped</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of your difficulties?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hulton nodded. [...] "Thank <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>helped</b> him <b>out.</b> <b>You</b> have no {{ground to}} think he was embarrassed by the need of money on the night he died?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Demetria," [...] I said, [...] "tell me how I {{can serve}} you? I cannot guess {{the nature of}} the trouble you speak of, but if it is one I can <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of, speak to me without reserve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless the what's-its-name if it {{has settled}} him," [...] cried Jack. [...] "He is a contemptible fellow not to stay and <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of the scrape he got you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble {{yourself}} about him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think I can <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> if {{you want}} me to," [...] came from Fatty, good-naturedly. [...] "If Professor Brice is willing, I'll move over to number twenty-three, and that will give you four fellows numbers sixteen, eighteen, twenty, and twenty-two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, you've got me, Ans. It {{seems to}} me I've heard the women folks home talk about shimmies, but they were always kind o' private about it, so I don't think I can <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out.</b> That little thing goes underneath, sure enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{business}} doesn't occupy all {{my thoughts}} {{and you have}} made a blamed poor joke! Here am I and your friends, trying to grapple with an awkward situation and puzzling how we're to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out,</b> and you laugh. So far as I can see, there's nothing humorous--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is what a}} feller gets for tryin' to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> two <b>out</b> of a scrape. I've {{kept the}} detectives away so far, an' now you're goin' {{to give me the}} dead shake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I {{ask you to}} let me <b>help</b> <b>you</b> carry <b>out</b> your plan of life, and to save all you have done, and all you have hoped, from waste--as your husband. Think"-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hilda is a {{very nice}} girl. I verily {{believe that we are}} fond of each other, and as I am more than double her age, she now and then favors me with her confidence. In fact, she {{suggested}} that I might be able to <b>help</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> of a difficulty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not used}} to being interviewed myself," [...] he said slowly, [...] "so I don't {{know very much about}} it. We're both green hands together, I imagine.

6000|$|... 'Well,' said Wegg, contemptuously, though, perhaps, perceiving some hint {{of danger}} otherwise, 'keep {{it from your}} old lady. I ain't going to tell her. I can have you under close {{inspection}} without that. I'm as good a man as you, and better. Ask me to dinner. Give me the run of your 'ouse. I {{was good enough for}} you and your old lady once, when I <b>helped</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> with your weal and hammers.

60|$|Anne {{climbed the}} ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole, {{balanced}} herself uprightly on that precarious footing, {{and started to}} walk along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably {{high up in the}} world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination <b>helped</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> much. Nevertheless, she managed to take several steps before the catastrophe came. Then she swayed, lost her balance, stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding down over the sun-baked roof and crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia creeper beneath--all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous, terrified shriek.|$|R
