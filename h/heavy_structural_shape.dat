Then a new fixture {{was developed for}} testing full-size <b>structural</b> <b>shapes,</b> which presents all {{the advantages of the}} coupon fixture. Particularly, splitting {{of the end of the}} sample is prevented while reducing the stress concentration factor at the ends, yielding compression failures at the center of the specimen. All the fiber reinforcements of <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> (CSM, 45, and roving) were tested individually and combined to support the development of a simple model for compressive strength of <b>structural</b> <b>shapes.</b> A simple formula is developed for prediction of compressive strength of pultruded <b>structural</b> <b>shapes.</b> Comparisons between experimental data and predicted values are presented...|$|R

Since the strength-to-stiffness ratio of composites is much larger than that of steel or concrete, deflections are ofmajor concern to the structural designer. In this paper, it is shown how to predict axial, bending, and shear stiffnesses of the <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> based on the fiber and resin properties and their arrangement in the cross section. Correlations between properties predicted by this method and measured by full size) sting of commercially available <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> (PULTREX™) are shown.

This work also selVes {{as the basis for}} more complex analysis of the behavior ofpultruded <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> that are addressed in companion papers.

40|$|Abstract—The {{motivation}} for {{this paper is}} to develop an approach to optimization of beam design. Under given loading and support conditions, the comparative strength of three (3) common <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> was determined. This led to the conclusion that a particular <b>structural</b> <b>shape</b> together with its dimensions will give the optimal solution in beam design in terms of the least cross-sectional area to support the given load, which would then translate to savings in cost and reduction in weight of the structural member. An investigation was also conducted to take into consideration the effect in the dimensions of the <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> of uncertainties due to manufacturing limitations and tolerances. This resulted in an assessment of the order of magnitude of this effect on the design variables. In solving the resulting optimization problems, MATLAB’s Genetic Algorithm and Direct Search Toolbox was employed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to evolutionary optimization of structural morphology based on two evolutionary paradigms. In the first one, the <b>structural</b> <b>shape</b> is optimized by simulating the growth process of natural structures. In the second one, the structural topology is optimized by removing material at low stress level. The proposed approach, called Morphologic Evolutionary Structural Optimization (MESO), combines these two design paradigms and leads to optimize simultaneously <b>structural</b> <b>shape</b> and <b>structural</b> topology. The extension of the proposed procedure to evolutionary optimization of non-homogeneous structures is also presented. The effectiveness of the procedure is shown through applications...|$|R

For instance, the wing structural weight and elastic deformations couple to aerodynamic loads and aircraft performance through drag. This coupling makes <b>structural</b> <b>shape</b> optimization a subtask in the overall vehicle synthesis. Decomposition methods for optimization and sensitivity analysis allow the specialized disciplinary methods to be used while the disciplines are temporarily decoupled, after which the interdisciplinary couplings are restored at the system level. Application of decomposition methods to structures-aerodynamics coupling in aircraft is outlined and illustrated with a numerical example of a transport aircraft. It is concluded that these methods may integrate <b>structural</b> and aerodynamic <b>shape</b> optimizations with the unified objective of the maximum aircraft performance...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A simple {{procedure}} is {{developed for the}} selection of pultruded <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> {{to be used as}} beam-columns in structural design. The design equations are then validated by comparison with experimental data gathered during beam-column testing of wide-flange and I-beam pultruded <b>structural</b> <b>shapes.</b> The design procedure accounts for axial load eccentricity and bending action induced by lateral loads and end-moments. The design equations are set in the context of load and resistance factor design, considering both strength and serviceability. This paper addresses the methodology to determine the resistance factors, which should be used with properly selected load-factors accounting for the variability and uncertainty of the loads. The design equations use section-properties, such as the bending stiffness (El), which must be measured and supplied by industry. It is found that the section-properties used in the design of beams and columns are sufficient for the design of beaql-columns. Therefore, the cost and time involved in testing <b>structural</b> <b>shapes</b> are minimized. This paper also addresses the means by which section-properties can be generated effectively and inexpensively...|$|R
