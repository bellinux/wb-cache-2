5|$|Before 2010, the {{computing}} {{reliability of}} GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence {{related to the}} lack of built-in <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> and correction in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected soft errors in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side <b>error</b> <b>detection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Handshake packets {{consist of}} only a single PID byte, and are {{generally}} sent in response to data packets. <b>Error</b> <b>detection</b> is provided by transmitting four bits, which represent the packet type twice, in a single PID byte using complemented form. The three basic types are ACK, indicating that data was successfully received; NAK, indicating that the data cannot be received and should be retried; and STALL, indicating that the device has an error condition and cannot transfer data until some corrective action (such as device initialization) occurs.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the fault}} {{detection}} in uncertain multivariate nonlinear non-Gaussian stochastic systems is further investigated. Entropy is introduced {{to characterize the}} stochastic behavior of the <b>detection</b> <b>errors,</b> and the entropy optimization principle is established for the fault detection problem. The principle is to maximize the entropies of the stochastic <b>detection</b> <b>errors</b> {{in the presence of}} faults and to minimize the entropies of the <b>detection</b> <b>errors</b> in the presence of disturbances. In order to calculate the entropies, the formulations of the joint probability density functions (JPDFs) of the stochastic errors are presented in terms of the known JPDFs of both the disturbances and the faults. By using the novel performance indexes and the formulations for the entropies of the <b>detection</b> <b>errors,</b> new fault <b>detection</b> design methods are provided for the considered multivariate nonlinear non-Gaussian plants. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed fault detection algorithm...|$|R

Typically a DSP in the electronics inside the HDD takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses PRML and Reed–Solomon error correction to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface.

The proposed higher resolution Level 2 (1981) was not adopted in Britain (in-vision services from Ceefax & ORACLE did use it at various times however, though even this was ceased by the BBC in 1996), although transmission rates were doubled from two to four lines a frame.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC), the noise reduction performance of a recently developed multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) technique {{does not depend on}} the validity of a priori assumptions about the signal model. This provides a potential benefit of the MWF over the GSC. However, both techniques also rely on a speech detection algorithm. In this paper, we analyze the average effect of speech <b>detection</b> <b>errors</b> on the performance of the GSC and the MWF both theoretically and experimentally. In the GSC case, it is the simultaneous presence of signal model <b>errors</b> and speech <b>detection</b> <b>errors</b> that affects performance. Incorporating a constraint on the noise sensitivity of the GSC limits the drastic impact of speech <b>detection</b> <b>errors</b> at the expense of reduced noise reduction performance. It is shown that the MWF preserves its benefit over the GSC for a reasonable speech <b>detection</b> <b>error</b> rate of 20 % or less, even when the GSC is supplied with a noise sensitivity constraint. Real data experiments confirm the theoretical results. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{process is}} subject to both burst errors and random errors. Burst errors include those due to disc {{material}} (defects of aluminum reflecting film, poor reflective index of transparent disc material), disc production (faults during disc forming and disc cutting etc.), disc handling (scratches – generally thin, radial and orthogonal to direction of recording) and variations in play-back mechanism. Random errors include those due to jitter of reconstructed signal wave and interference in signal. CIRC (Cross-Interleaved Reed–Solomon code) {{is the basis for}} <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> and correction in the CD process. It corrects error bursts up to 3,500 bits in sequence (2.4nbsp&mm in length as seen on CD surface) and compensates for error bursts up to 12,000 bits (8.5nbsp&mm) that may be caused by minor scratches.|$|E

In chemistry, the last digit of the CAS registry number (a number which is unique for each chemical compound) is a check digit, which is calculated by taking the last digit of the first two parts of the CAS registry number times 1, the previous digit times 2, the previous digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} MTs {{attached}} to one kinetochore is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals {{there can be}} among 15-35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and {{they are responsible for}} spindle length) and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of <b>error</b> <b>detection</b> and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one chromatid towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.|$|E
