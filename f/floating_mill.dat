60|$|Suggested on the Thames by {{the sight}} of one of those <b>floating</b> <b>mills</b> that used to be seen there. This I noticed on the Surrey side, between Somerset House and Blackfriars Bridge. Charles Lamb was with me at the time; and I thought it {{remarkable}} that I should have to point out to him, an idolatrous Londoner, a sight so interesting as the happy group dancing on the platform. Mills of this kind used to he, and perhaps still are, not uncommon on the Continent. I noticed several upon the river Saone in the year 1799; particularly near the town of Chalons, where my friend Jones and I halted a day when we crossed France, so far on foot. There we embarked and floated down to Lyons.|$|R

2500|$|Rome was {{too large}} for the Goths to {{completely}} encircle. So they set up seven camps, overlooking the main gates and access routes to the city, in order to starve it out. Six of them were east of the river, {{and one on the}} western side, on the Campus Neronis, near the Vatican. This left the southern side of the city open. The Goths then proceeded to block the aqueducts that were supplying the city with its water, necessary both for drinking and for operating the gristmills. The mills were those situated on the Janiculum, and provided most of the bread for the city. Although Belisarius was able to counter the latter problem by building <b>floating</b> <b>mills</b> on the stream of the Tiber, the hardships for the citizenry grew daily. Perceiving this discontent, Vitiges tried to achieve the surrender of the city by promising the Roman army free passage, but Belisarius refused the offer, telling his foe: ...|$|R
50|$|Vertical water wheels {{were well}} known to the Romans, {{described}} by Vitruvius in his De Architectura of 25 BC, and mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia of AD 77.

50|$|<b>Floating</b> {{allows the}} <b>mill</b> {{to operate with}} the same power despite {{changing}} water levels. The efficiency of the mill can at best match a standard undershot mill. Ship mills could potentially run full-time, good for tasks that demanded constant power.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s {{the site}} was bought by the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, which brought up to 1 million board feet of timber here {{annually}} by rail from all over Thurston and Lewis counties until it closed the site in 1984. A former logging railroad crosses Woodard Bay on a wooden trestle and a narrow peninsula. It runs out onto a pier in Henderson Inlet across the mouth of Chapman Bay. Here logs were dumped in the water, gathered into rafts and <b>floated</b> to <b>mills</b> in Everett, Washington.|$|R
50|$|In 1841, John Stronach {{and party}} {{came to the}} Manistee area and started a lumber mill. During the {{following}} twenty years, the City of Manistee grew as virgin forests were cut, and the logs put into the Manistee rivers to <b>float</b> to the <b>mills</b> on Manistee Lake.|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} development of Bogstadvannet was {{largely due to}} the works of the Bogstad estate.

25|$|It {{is thought}} that the wheels were {{overshot}} water wheels with the outflow from the top driving the next one down and so on, {{to the base of}} the hill.

Nearby Link Road served as the log rafting area, to be <b>floated</b> to the <b>mills</b> at Cleveland and Wellington Point. Sugar plantations, custard apples, grapes, passion fruit, pawpaws, pineapple, tomatoes, cabbages, cucumbers constituted some of the farming activities.

40|$|The {{recycling}} of packaging waste {{is an important}} part of the EU circular economy package, with a political focus on raising the recycling targets for post-consumer plastic packaging waste (PPW). The {{recycling of}} PPW involves at least three steps; collection, sorting and mechanical recycling. In contrast to the first two steps, mechanical recycling is poorly documented, as it is considered a free market activity. In order to provide a complete chain description the mechanical recycling yields were determined. The recovery of mass was determined for the main plastic sorting products from both major collection systems: separate collection (SC) and mechanical recovery (MR) from municipal solid waste. This technical assessment was conducted with a laboratory set-up for a standard mechanical recycling process. This analysis showed that there is a substantial sample-to-sample variation in polymeric composition between similar feedstocks and this variation is also observed in recovered masses. Next, the mechanical recycling of polyethylene feedstocks was studied more in depth. Six PE feedstocks with a gradual increasing level of complexity (from only transparent PE bottle bodies to the complete PE sorting product according to DKR 329), were prepared and mechanical recycled with the laboratory set-up. Since the polymeric composition of both the six feedstocks and the six <b>floating</b> <b>milled</b> goods were known, the net PE recycling yield could be calculated. The net PE yields are close to 100 % for such a standard recycling process. Additionally, the compositional analysis revealed that contaminants are only partially removed by the standard mechanical recycling process...|$|R
50|$|The {{widespread}} use of water mills or grain crushers in Italy is mentioned in passing by Pliny the Elder in 79 AD. A sequence of water mills was established at the terminus of the highest Roman aqueduct, the Aqua Traiana {{in the second century}} AD by the emperor Trajan. Traces of the water channels and equipment have been excavated on the Janiculum. Protecting this valuable industrial complex was important, as attested by the actions of Belisarius in the Siege of Rome (537-538) when the city was besieged by the Ostrogoths. When the water supply to the aqueduct was cut off, he built a bridge of boats across the Tiber and used <b>floating</b> paddle <b>mills</b> to crush the grain, and so kept the supply of bread intact.|$|R
50|$|Vertical water mills {{were well}} known to the Romans, being {{described}} by Vitruvius in his De Architectura of 25 BC, and mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia of 77 AD. There are also later references to <b>floating</b> water <b>mills</b> from Byzantium and to sawmills on the river Moselle by the poet Ausonius. The use of multiple stacked sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels was widespread in Roman mines, especially in Spain and Wales. It {{is possible that the}} mills at Barbegal may also have been used for sawing timber and stone when not grinding wheat. The Hierapolis sawmill from the 3rd century AD shows a crank-activated frame saw being used in this way, and another has been excavated at Ephesus.|$|R
50|$|Cheboygan {{was founded}} as a lumbering town to cut timbers {{harvested}} from the Cheboygan River's drainage and <b>floated</b> down to <b>mills</b> (now mostly vanished) {{at the mouth}} of the river. Today, one of the biggest industries of the town and river of Cheboygan is pleasure boating up and down the river. The river is a key artery of the Inland Waterway, a pleasure-boat necklace of waterways in the northern section of Michigan's Lower Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|John Egan opened {{logging in}} central Ontario in the 1840s {{with a string}} of saw and grist mills along the Ottawa River. The {{drainage}} area for the river allowed timber rafts to be <b>floated</b> to the <b>mills</b> from an enormous area, and Egan purchased lands throughout central Ontario to feed timber to the mills. In 1854 a crash in red pine prices forced the entire empire into bankruptcy, and Egan turned his attention to politics.|$|R
50|$|However, the Romans {{made many}} {{significant}} technological advances, {{such as the}} invention of hydraulic cement and concrete. They used such new materials to great advantage in their structures, many of which survive to this day, like their masonry aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard, and buildings, such as the Pantheon and Baths of Diocletian in Rome. Their methods were recorded by such luminaries as Vitruvius and Frontinus for example, who wrote handbooks to advise fellow engineers and architects. Romans knew enough history {{to be aware that}} widespread technological change had occurred in the past and brought benefits, as shown for example by Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia. That tradition continued as the empire grew in size and absorbed new ideas. Romans thought of themselves as practical, so small-scale innovation was common (such as the development of the ballista into the polybolos or repeating ballista). The traditional view is that their reliance on a plentiful slave labour force and a lack of a patent or copyright system have both been cited as reasons that there was little social or financial pressure to automate or reduce manual tasks. However, this view is being challenged by new research that shows they did indeed innovate, and on a wide scale. Thus the watermill had been known to the Greeks, but it was the Romans who developed their efficient utilisation. The set of mills at Barbegal in southern France were worked by a single aqueduct, which drove no fewer than 16 overshot mills built into the side of a hill. They probably were built by the army and supplied flour to a wide region. <b>Floating</b> <b>mills</b> were also used to exploit fast flowing rivers.|$|R
25|$|Ngai Tai {{along with}} members of other Hauraki tribes, lived in the Omana park area for many generations. The park was part of William Fairburn's Maraetai Mission Station which {{included}} a small school for Maori from 1837 - 42. Omana {{was part of the}} mission farm, developed from 1837. The forest covering the park and surrounding area was felled for timber by European settlers who cleared the land for farming during the mid-1840s. Kauri felled in the Maraetai hills behind Omana was hauled by bullock teams down to the sea and then <b>floated</b> to <b>mills</b> in Auckland. The Omana park area was also dug for kauri gum and even prospected for gold and silver. In 1852 following the discovery of gold in Coromandel many searched the hills digging shafts wherever quartz veins could be located.|$|R
5000|$|A mobile {{distillery}} {{also served}} the numerous plantations along the rivers. This was the steam operated [...] "Walrus", a boat {{which was built}} at Cleveland in 1864 as a sailing vessel, then sold in 1869 to James Stewart who converted it to steam and installed a still. A license to operate as a floating distillery was reluctantly granted on 14 April 1869 by the Inspector of Distilleries, although he deemed the boat unsuitable for the purpose, as there was then no other licensed distillery in the area. The boat then operated as the Pioneer <b>Floating</b> Sugar <b>Mill.</b> Its licence was not renewed in 1872 as it did not fulfil the requirement to carry cane-crushing equipment and acted solely as a distillery, producing rum from molasses. This is the thick syrup remaining after cane juice has been crystallised by boiling to produce sugar. Rum is produced from this by-product by adding water and yeast and fermenting the mixture. This is then boiled and the alcohol vapour separated out by distillation, the condensate being collected, perhaps charcoal filtered, and stored in casks to mature.|$|R
6000|$|Reuben Whitney {{was the son}} of a miller, near Tipping. John Whitney {{had been}} {{considered}} a well-to-do man, but he had speculated in corn and had got into difficulties; and his body was, one day, found <b>floating</b> in the <b>mill</b> dam. No one knew whether it was the result of intention or accident, but the jury of his neighbours who sat upon the inquest gave him the benefit of the doubt, and brought in a verdict of [...] "accidental death." [...] He was but tenant of the mill and, when all the creditors were satisfied, there were only a few pounds remaining for the widow.|$|R
50|$|After growing up, {{he carried}} on the {{traditional}} business of precious gems of his family. His father Dalpatbhai Bhagubhai was also in cotton trading business since the 1870s As an expansion of his cotton trading business, he decided {{to start his own}} cotton mill and in 1896 he <b>floated</b> the Saraspur <b>Mills</b> floowed by Raipur Mills in 1897. These two mills laid the foundation of present-day Lalbhai group. The group was later expanded by his sons and noted nationalist and philanthropist, Kasturbhai Lalbhai, Narottambhai Lalbhai, Chimanbhai Lalbhai and grandsons like Shrenik Kasturbhai Lalbhai, Arvind Narottambhai Lalbhai and Chinubhai Chimanbhai. The group now consists of mills like Arvind Mills, Atul Limited among others.|$|R
5000|$|The Triumph {{mine was}} first {{discovered}} in 1883 with {{the recording of}} the North Star claim. Additional claims were grouped together over the next 20 years and operated as 14 separate mining companies. All the ore was processed by the Philadelphia Mining and Smelting Company in Ketchum. The North star mill was built in 1889 by the Freedman's of The Philadelphia Company. They were bought out by George Hurst around 1927 and his San Louise Mining Company. In 1933, fire destroyed the stamp mill works and ore was stockpiled. Around 1937 the Department of the interior, {{under the control of}} The War Department, expanded the Triumph Mine. Federal money built a modern sink <b>float</b> <b>mill,</b> new offices, warehouses and a Main Tunnel that went straight into the mountain for a mile and a half. The small companies were joined to form [...] "The Triumph Mining Co" [...] which, at its WW2 peak, employed 200 men, 24 hours a day, and held the world record for zinc. By 1959, lead, silver, and zinc prices had fallen to half of the WW2 price while union labour was demanding higher wages. The mine was shut down in 1959 and sold to the foreman. Rupert House formed the Triumph Mineral Company in 1964 and began mining again in 1970. In 1982 the mine was leased to The Getty Mining Company and they did an extensive drilling and exploration of both the Mine and the Tailings. Company records show about $45,000,000 in gold left in the tailings but the gold was not a strategic metal and was not of interest to the War Department. In 1988 the EPA listed Triumph as a potential hazard so in the next 10 years they spent millions on a clean up. The EPA and State, instead of recovering the gold to pay for the cleanup, buried it. In 2007 the Triumph Mine was purchased by Carl Massaro. The goal was to build a small solar village on the mill site and a large solar collector as suggested by the new EPA's [...] "Mine Scarred Program". ( [...] See Triumph Village [...]net [...] ) This solar project met with public criticism and ultimately failed. The mountain was sold to Denovo in 2008 but [...] "The Triumph Mineral Co" [...] holds the tailings with plans for a solar project in the works for that site. The Denovo Company has cleaned the site and plans additional land uses. Although the mine still has resources, an agreement was reached by state and local authorities, to never mine again.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{formation}} of the new Province, the former Inland Water Commission was moved to the new government's Board of Works. The new government broke the power of the Family Compact, and reduced the influence of its French counterpart, the Château Clique. But it also resulted in a body whose decisions often separated along regional lines. By this time a new force had entered the process, central Ontario lumber barons. They used the many rivers of the province to <b>float</b> logs to <b>mills,</b> notably John Rudolphus Booth's mill in Ottawa, at that time the largest sawmill in the world. Locks presented a barrier to their rafts, as would any traffic on the rivers, so they were opposed to any further work on the system.|$|R
