50|$|It {{was also}} a luxurious car with the well {{equipped}} interior featuring leather seats as standard. The individual seats in front separated by a high transmission tunnel and the rear seats had a small centre armrest and could also be tilted <b>forwards</b> to increase <b>luggage</b> space. Standard colours (1955) were black, ivory, imperial crimson, moonbeam grey, Boticelli blue, deep green and Tampico beige.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{with the}} boot of its predecessor, {{capacity}} is increased by 76 litres to 500 litres {{with the back}} seats at their rear-most position (versus the Golf’s 380 litres and the Estate’s 605 litres). Moving the rear seats <b>forwards</b> increases the <b>luggage</b> capacity to 590 litres, while folding the rear seats liberates up to 1,520 litres of room. The front passenger seat can also optionally fold fully forward, creating a load space which is up to 2,484 mm long.|$|R
5000|$|The H.2 was {{designed}} to be powered by a , water-cooled V-12 Rolls-Royce Eagle IX engine mounted in the nose, though the only completed prototype had a [...] Eagle VII because of Handasyde's limited finances. Its honeycomb radiator was mounted underneath the cowling between the forward undercarriage struts. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat-sided and deep, with the pilot in an open cockpit recessed into the wing leading edge. The passenger cabin was behind the pilot and under the wing, entered by forward doors on each side. There were three seats on each side, each with a window; the cabin had a <b>forward</b> space for <b>luggage</b> and a toilet at the rear. In an emergency passengers could escape through a roof trapdoor at the wing trailing edge.|$|R
40|$|As {{statistics}} show, {{air travel}} {{is one of}} the most prevalent in this society of ours from day to day is increasing its use. Characteristic of air travel and transport is his speed but that speed depends from many factors. Some of these factors are: the speed and capacity of the aircraft, the speed of transport of goods to and from the airport warehouses them to planes, the speed of data processing for passengers and their <b>luggage</b> <b>forwarding</b> to the appropriate place for loading the plane, the speed of system transfer the luggage of a passenger to the appropriate place for loading the plane and the speed of the staff handled it. Hereafter will talk about all these factors which affect to a fast and successful air transport...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an LS-DYNA simulation of a vertical drop test of an ATR 42 - 300 twin-turboprop high-wing commuter-class airplane. A 30 -ft/s drop test of this aircraft was performed onto a concrete impact surface at the FAA Technical Center on July 30, 2003. The purpose of the test was to evaluate the structural response of a commuter-class aircraft when subjected to a severe, but survivable, impact. The aircraft was configured with crew and passenger seats, anthropomorphic test dummies, <b>forward</b> and aft <b>luggage,</b> instrumentation, and onboard data acquisition systems. The wings were filled with approximately 8, 700 lb. of water to represent the fuel and the aircraft weighed a total of 33, 200 lb. The model, which consisted of 57, 643 nodes and 62, 979 elements, was developed from direct measurements of the airframe geometry, over a period of approximately 8 months. The seats, dummies, luggage, fuel, and other ballast were represented using concentrated masses. Comparisons were made of the structural deformation and failure behavior of the airframe, as well as selected acceleration time history responses...|$|R
60|$|The {{morning of}} our halt, a general order was promulgated which filled us with consternation. No baggage {{whatever}} {{is to be}} henceforward allowed either for men or officers. Soldiers are to carry their greatcoat, a blanket, and waterproof sheet, {{in addition to their}} rifle, ammunition, havresack, &c. This will bring the weight to be carried by each man up to fifty-five pounds; an overwhelming weight over such a tremendous country as that which we have to traverse, and beneath a tropical sun. I question very much whether the men will be able to stand it, and several of the medical staff to whom I have spoken are quite of that opinion. What the roads are likely to be, is manifest enough by a portion of the general order, which says that in future no mule is to carry over 100 pounds; and yet the authorities put more than half that weight upon a man’s shoulders. It is not even as if the men had their knapsacks, in which the greatcoat, &c. could be packed, and carried with comparative ease; they will have to be slung over the shoulders by the coat-arms, and will distress the soldier far more than they would have done if carried in knapsacks. It was an extraordinary oversight leaving the knapsacks behind at Antalo; for it was evident even then that they would be required. Unmounted officers are to have a greatcoat, blanket, and waterproof-sheet carried for them, and mounted officers may carry what they can put upon their horses. No baggage-animals whatever are to go <b>forward</b> with <b>luggage.</b> The men are to be packed twenty in a bell tent, and twelve officers are to have the same accommodation. More than a fourth part of the soldiers are out on picket and guard every night; therefore the number of men in each tent will be practically about the same as the officers. Fancy twelve officers in a tent! They will be packed like herrings in a tub; and men are calculating to-day how many square inches of ground each will possess. Everyone takes it good-humouredly, and there is no grumbling whatever; but for all that, it is rather a serious business. If it were for two or three days, it would be all well enough; but Magdala is a considerable distance from here. The Quartermaster-general’s department talk about a six days’ march. Captain Speedy says that sixteen is very much nearer the mark; and as he has a knowledge of the country, while the Quartermaster’s department have uniformly been wrong in their distances, it is safe to assume that it is a fifteen days’ march; that is to say, even without allowing a day for the capture of Magdala, or for arranging matters there, we cannot be back to Lât under a month. There is some talk of the baggage coming up after us; but this will certainly not come to anything. I know that we have barely animals enough with us to carry our food, and every available mule in the rear is coming on with Staveley’s Brigade. We may, then, calculate with tolerable certainty that we shall not get any of our baggage until we return to Lât, which, at the very earliest, will be a month hence, and not improbably twice that time. We are told that the cold at night is very great on ahead, and that the rains are heavy and frequent. It is therefore a very serious matter for men to start without a single change of clothes of any kind. Putting aside the rain, the men will suffer so greatly from the heat, and from the labour of climbing mountains with so heavy a load upon their backs, {{that it would be a}} most material matter for them to have at any rate a dry flannel-shirt to put on when the cold evening wind begins to blow. Time will show how the men stand it; but it is certainly a hazardous experiment.|$|R
