Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found {{to be very difficult to}} start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements.

5|$|Flight testing {{began with}} the first flight of the second AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early <b>flight</b> <b>tests,</b> a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was flying at low altitude in ground effect. As the flight envelope was expanded, this instability and other minor problems were discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the primary}} goal of a <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> program is to gather {{accurate}} engineering data, often on a design that is not fully proven, piloting a <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> aircraft requires a high degree of training and skill. As such, such programs are typically flown by a specially trained test pilot, the data is gathered by a <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> engineer, and often visually displayed to the <b>test</b> pilot and/or <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> engineer using <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> instrumentation.|$|R

ARJ21-700 aircraft has conducted the function {{and reliability}} <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> strictly in accordance with <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> plan and successfully completed the special inspection of various systems. Since the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> was officially started on October 29, AC105 has successively conducted 83 flights in the routes among ten airports in Chengdu, Guiyang, Guilin, Haikou, Fuzhou, Zhoushan, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Yinchuan and Xianyang to simulate operations in routes. The cumulative flight time was 173 hours and 55 minutes.|$|R
5|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>tests</b> of {{the four}} B-1A prototypes for the B-1A program {{continued}} through April 1981. The program included 70 flights totaling 378 hours.

5|$|The {{design work}} was {{supported}} by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio delta wings. A supersonic Fairey Delta 2 was modified to carry the ogee planform, and, renamed as the BAC 221, used for <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> of the high speed flight envelope, the Handley Page HP.115 also provided valuable information on low speed performance.|$|E
5|$|During the manufacturer's <b>flight</b> <b>tests,</b> the Yak-19 {{became the}} first Soviet {{aircraft}} to exceed 900km/h. Major Sergei Anokhin was the primary test pilot and reported that the aircraft had pleasant and predictable flying characteristics and presented no difficulties for the average pilot. Before the testing was completed, Anokhin led the jets participating in the flypast at Tushino Airfield on 3 August.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the scope}} of <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> {{engineering}} efforts may vary among organizations, all point to a common theme: <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> engineering is an interdisciplinary effort to test an asset in its operational flight environment.

5|$|The first orbiter, Enterprise, {{was built}} solely for {{atmospheric}} <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> {{and had no}} orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Challenger and Columbia were destroyed in mission accidents in 1986 and 2003 respectively, killing a total of fourteen astronauts. A fifth operational orbiter, Endeavour, was built in 1991 to replace Challenger. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of STS-135 by Atlantis on 21 July 2011.|$|E

5|$|As {{the program}} (and PAVN air defences) evolved, {{so did the}} relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in <b>flight</b> <b>tests,</b> McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|During {{tests with}} the Ju 87 A-2, new {{technologies}} were tried out {{to reduce the}} effects of g forces. The pressurised cabin was of great importance during this research. Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g could cause death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. When the United States Army occupied the Junkers factory at Dessau on 21 April 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> with the Ju 87.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> {{engineer}} {{generally has}} overall {{responsibility for the}} planning of a specific <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> phase, which includes preparing the test plans {{in conjunction with other}} analytical and/or systems engineers, overseeing the buildup of the aircraft to the proper configuration, working with the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> instrumentation engineer to ensure the sensors and recording systems are installed for required data parameters, and preparing the maneuver-by-maneuver plan for each <b>test</b> <b>flight</b> (enshrined typically in a higher level document called a [...] "test plan" [...] and then an operational document usually called the [...] "test cards").

5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations.

5|$|Originally, the {{aircraft}} was to conduct <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> at Gostomel {{for three months}} before transferring to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky, near Moscow. However, the first prototype was lost when it was making its fourth flight on 10 February 1995. During the flight, {{the aircraft}} suffered a sudden deviation from its intended flightpath and collided with the An-72 chase plane before spiralling into the ground, erupting into flames; the test crew of seven were killed. Although there were initial allegations of technical issues with the aircraft, it was later determined that the crash had been caused by human error.|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to detail}} the {{educational}} <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> activities {{performed at the}} Department of Aerospace Science and Technology at the Politecnico di Milano (DSTA-PoliMi), including the development of low-cost, reliable <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> instrumentation (FTI) and {{the administration of the}} graduate course in <b>flight</b> <b>testing.</b> Design/methodology/approach - The <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> course program closely adheres to the typical content of an introductory course offered in a professional <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> school. However, within academic courses, it has a unique feature: each student is required to plan, perform and report on a real <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> experience, acting as a <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> engineer. Educational activities in this framework have been successfully matched to applied research and technical support for private companies. Findings - At the educational level, several elements arise that are rarely concentrated within a single course, such as multidisciplinary integration, individual conceive-design-implement-operate (CDIO) project, real-life experimental procedures and techniques, teamwork, communication and reporting, relation with non-academic partners. Practical implications - Based on the development of a FTI system for light aviation and on the <b>flight</b> <b>testing</b> course, DSTA-PoliMi has built a solid capability in <b>flight</b> <b>testing,</b> introducing graduate students to this specific niche of expertise and empowering co-operation with companies in the light aviation environment, while offering capabilities and tools that are typically regarded as a prerogative of major aerospace companies.

40|$|Considerable {{effort is}} put into the safety risk {{assessment}} of any <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> programme - and rightly so, since failures to apply best practice in this area may cause significant expense, and in extremis loss of life. However, {{it must also be}} remembered that the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> programme itself is an essential component {{in the development of the}} aircraft or system, and that even if safety is never compromised, the failure of a test programme to deliver the required results on time and budget can cause failure of the entire aircraft programme. This paper considers the areas in which planning and conduct of a <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> programme should be protected. In particular it considers the conduct of <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> personnel in ways which go beyond only safety training, the important of documenting all <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> planning and conduct and the continuous justification of <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> conclusions, planning project manning to ensure that the loss (for whatever reason) of key personnel or equipment does not cause complete failure of the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> programme, how to recover from significant programme disruptions, and most importantly whilst protecting or recovering the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> programme – how to ensure that safety is not compromised in the process...|$|R
5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet {{prototype}} for a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10. It featured a number of innovative concepts including a cockpit mounted {{on top of the}} engine, directly behind the propeller, and wing-mounted autocannon that could be adjusted on the ground to fire level or depressed 23° to allow the aircraft to strafe ground targets while remaining in level flight. However it was slower than the Il-10, and its M-47 engine was problematic in <b>flight</b> <b>tests</b> in 1948–49. It was not placed into production. The test pilots called the aircraft the Gorbach (Hunchback).|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} aircraft, registered N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981.
