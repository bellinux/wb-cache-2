5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to <b>feed</b> <b>ram</b> air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{targeted}} at identifying {{if it is}} possible to select a barley cultivar that has a higher NDF digestibility (NDFD) which can be ensiled in following years for livestock feed in order to increase digestibility and animal performance. Three barley cultivars, CDC Cowboy (H-NDFD), CDC Copeland (I-NDFD), and Xena (L-NDFD) were selected based on respective high, intermediate, and low NDFD following 30 h in vitro digestion of silage collected from commercial farms. The objective of the first study was to determine if a higher NDFD of a barley cultivar would alter the fermentation pattern of the silage compared to cultivars with lower NDFD. This was accomplished by ensiling the three barley cultivars in mini-silos to be opened at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 60 d after ensiling to measure fermentation parameters and microbial enumeration. Barley cultivars were also ensiled in bunker-silos for the feeding trial. Following 60 d ensiling, the silage was exposed to air to measure aerobic stability with temperature change measured continually, and fermentation parameters and microbial enumeration measured after 3, 7, 14, and 21 d of exposure. Chemical analysis compared fresh forage to 60 d silage, and silage from the bunker-silos used in the feeding trial, as well 60 d mini-silos and bunker-silo samples underwent in vitro NDFD analysis to compare to the selection criteria. There was no difference in in vitro NDFD of the three cultivars grown for this study. The H-NDFD cultivar had lower pH and higher lactate levels. Starch was higher in L-NDFD, and I-NDFD had higher ADF and NDF than the other cultivars. Bunker-silos had higher VFA concentrations than the mini-silos, and pH of I-NDFD and L-NDFD was lower in bunker-silos than mini-silos. Aerobic spoilage was only apparent in H-NDFD which saw silage temperature increase, lactate decrease and pH increase compared to the other cultivars. The objective of the second trial was to determine whether increased in vitro NDFD would increase digestibility and animal performance through improved intake, weight gain, or carcass traits. A replicated 3 x 3 Latin square used rumen cannulated wethers to measure total tract digestibility of the three barley cultivars as part of a 50 : 50 barley silage to concentrate diet (DM basis). Rumen pH was measured using in dwelling pH probes to record pH over 48 h. Total collections were conducted over four days with rumen fluid collection on the fourth day at 0, 3, 6, 12 h after feeding for VFA, ammonia, and protozoa enumeration. A lamb performance trial was conducted feeding 42 lambs equally divided ram and ewe lambs between the three barley cultivars with diets comprised of 40 : 60 silage to concentrate (DM basis). Intake was recorded daily, and lamb weight weekly, for ADG and F:G calculations. Following 72 d on <b>feed,</b> <b>ram</b> lambs were slaughtered and carcass characteristics recorded. The L-NDFD digestibility trial diet had lower ADF and NDF, and higher starch than the H-NDFD diet, but {{there was no difference in}} total tract digestibility, consistent with lack of in vitro NDFD differences. Average rumen pH was lower for lambs fed L-NDFD. The 40 % silage diets in the performance trial saw no difference between cultivars. Lambs fed I-NDFD had lower DMI than the other two cultivars, but no difference was observed in terms of weight gain. Carcass characteristics were similar between cultivars, with dressing percentage of L-NDFD lambs being higher than I-NDFD lambs. The results of this thesis suggest that selecting a barley cultivar with improved NDFD is more difficult than selecting the cultivar with the highest in vitro NDFD. Differences in fermentation patterns and lamb performances when fed different cultivars suggest that selection for barley cultivar to improve NDFD might have some merit though plant maturity has a strong effect...|$|E

5000|$|The flat, toothless rostrum {{may have}} {{supported}} an avian-like bill, or perhaps rows of baleen {{as seen in}} cetaceans of the suborder Mysticeti. It seems that hupehsuchians were adapted to continuous <b>ram</b> <b>feeding,</b> a form of mobile suspension feeding. The large skull and lack of a fixed symphysis with the lower jaw is indicative of such a feeding method, but the narrowness of the rostrum {{and the existence of}} marine vertebrates with larger skulls that were not completely edentulous (e. g. ichthyosaurs) seem to point against it. The long necks of hupehsuchians would seem to inhibit continuous <b>ram</b> <b>feeding</b> at high speeds through the water, so {{it is more likely that}} they practiced intermittent <b>ram</b> <b>feeding</b> at slower speeds. [...] The purpose of the dorsal dermal plates of hupehsuchians is unknown. These plates as well as the ventral gastralia and the tendency for pachyostosis would have added considerable weight to hupehsuchians, allowing them to have neutral buoyancy. However, the position of the dorsal plates are high above the center of gravity, and it seems that this would have made the bodies of hupehsuchians unstable. Hupehsuchians were among the largest marine animals of their time, so there would be no need for dorsal plates as a protective measure. The tendency for the dorsal plates to be more developed anteriorly may have allowed the anterior portion of the vertebral column to remain relatively rigid while the posterior portion could freely undulate.|$|R

Weight gain and average daily gain (ADG) were significantly (P> 0. 01) higher in the ram lambs fed three crop residues based complete rations than sole grazed animals.

40|$|The cerato-mandibular (c-md) {{ligament}} is a synapomorphy within Pomacentridae {{that creates}} a tight link between the lower jaws and the hyoid bars. However, this morphological trait has been secondarily lost in multiple lineages during evolution. A previous study revealed {{that the loss of}} this trait acted as a release of evolutionary constraints, leading to a cascade of morphological changes such elongated buccal jaws and a slender body. Ecomorphological interpretations suggested the loss of the c-md ligament has ultimately led to a new adaptive peak in zooplanktivory through an optimization of the <b>ram</b> <b>feeding</b> mode associated with a specialization in pelagic feeding. Here, we tested these hypotheses by comparing functional and diet diversity between damselfish species with and without the c-md ligament. Although species lacking the c-md ligament presented a conserved kinematic pattern resulting from high ram and low suction performances, our results did not support an optimization of the <b>ram</b> <b>feeding</b> mode. Indeed, some species with the c-md ligament showed the same or exceeded the ram performance of species without the c-md ligament. The species with the c-md ligament had a more diverse kinematic pattern exploring the entire ram-suction functional range in damselfishes. Finally, our results did not show any diet variations associated with the loss of the c-md ligament.
