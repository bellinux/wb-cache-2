She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E

25|$|Spain {{recovered}} {{during the}} truce, ordering her finances and doing much to restore her prestige {{and stability in}} the run-up to the last truly great war in which she would participate as the leading power. In the Netherlands, the rule of Philip II's daughter, Isabella Clara Eugenia, and her husband, Archduke Albert, restored stability to the southern Netherlands. But Philip III and Lerma lacked the ability to make any meaningful change in the country's foreign policy. They clung to the idea of placing the infanta Isabella on the English throne after Queen Elizabeth's death and sent a limited expeditionary force to Ireland to aid the Spanish-supplied rebels. The English defeated it, but the long war of attrition there had drained England of money, men, and morale: Elizabeth's successor, James <b>I,</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> fresh start to his reign. The war that had been going on between the two countries since 1585 finally ended. War with France threatened in 1610, but shortly after, Henry IV was assassinated, and the country fell into civil war again. Up until 1630, Spain was at peace and continued its dominant position in Europe. Meanwhile, Lerma's enemies expelled him from office in 1617, and Baltazar de Zúñiga began calling for a more aggressive foreign policy.|$|E

Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was [...] "immediately sure" [...] of how the dress should look. She stated in the interview, [...] "I {{knew it had to}} be leather and I knew it had to be linked to Tywin. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim her ankles, so that you could see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei."

For quite some time, the casting executive at ABC, Keli Lee, had been trying to convince Chopra to do television in the United States, something that Chopra was not sure of. However, when Chopra was first considering the possibility of doing a television series in America, Lee learned that another studio was also trying to sign her, to which she reacted by saying, [...] "No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India." [...] Later, Lee traveled to India and was finally able to convince her to accept the offer. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Chopra revealed the only condition she put forward to Lee for doing a show was that she wanted them to find her a series that would put her in the same position that she currently enjoyed in India. She said [...] "There were TV shows and movies that were offered [...] before this one as well. But <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> part that put me on the same platform as [...] India.

500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up in my face, and I was picking up on bad vibes. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong."

500|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of the first season of [...] on Fox, Warner Bros. {{assigned}} Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at Arkham Asylum and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea's concept, however, was considered [...] "too brainy", as it required Batman to be inmobile during a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode [...] "Trial", which was aired after the movie's release. Although the Joker does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular rogues gallery. Burnett also cited he [...] "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> story that got into his head." [...] In reality, the creative team had said that they originally didn't want to use the Joker in the film. Conversely, Paul Dini stated that the Joker was always part of the film from the beginning of its production. The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, but writer Michael Reaves said, [...] "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story {{in a way that we}} never could in live-action." [...] In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, Bruce Timm and Burnett convinced frequent Animated Series writer Paul Dini to not use Harley Quinn in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously [...] used in the episodes [...] "Joker's Wild" [...] and [...] "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".|$|E
500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E
