40|$|In an {{unfamiliar}} environment, {{there are various}} way-finding methods during fire accidents. The most common tool used is the <b>emergency</b> <b>sign.</b> In Taiwan it is still unclear how emergency signs assist with way-finding and most people may not clearly identify the meaning {{of these types of}} signs. Previous studies did not conduct emergency experiments in a reality-based setting. Thus, this study utilizes virtual reality to conduct experiments that simulate the cognition effectiveness of emergency signs and sign improvement. Results indicate that through virtual experiments, the assistance effectiveness of sign cognition toward way-finding is observed and proper improvement of signs present better assistance effectiveness. In addition, after improvement, subjects demonstrate higher understanding values than the ISO suggests by 67 %. As a result, this study offers modified reference results for future studies...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} medical electronic-computerized {{platform}} for diagnostic use, which allows doctors {{to carry out}} a complete cardio-respiratory control on remote patients in real time. In the context of telemedicine the proposed system can be considered as a really innovative product in which all the most advanced technologies of biomedical engineering converge to guarantee an efficient and reliable home assistance that allows the patient a highly better quality of life in terms of prophylaxis, treatment and reduction of discomfort connected to periodic patient controls and/or hospitalization. Moreover the system has been equipped to be employed also to real-time rescue in case of emergency without the necessity for data to be constantly monitored by a medical centre. In fact, when an <b>emergency</b> <b>sign</b> is detected through the real-time diagnosing system, it sends a warning message to people able to arrange for his/her rescue. A Global Positioning System (GPS) also provides the patient coordinates. The proposed system, in its version for diagnostic use, has been verified by the heart specialists of the Institute of Cardiology in the General Hospital (Polyclinic) of the University of Bari, Italy...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{visibility}} in a smoke laden environment. For many years, {{researchers and}} engineers in fire safety {{have criticized the}} inadequacy of existing theory in describing the effects such as colour, viewing angle, environmental lighting etc. on the visibility of an <b>emergency</b> <b>sign.</b> In the current study, the author has raised the fundamental question {{on the concept of}} visibility and how it should be measured in fire safety engineering and tried to address the problem by redefining visibility based on the perceived image of a target sign. New algorithms have been created during this study to utilise modern hardware and software technology in the simulation of human perceived image of object in both experiment and computer modelling. Unlike the traditional threshold of visual distance, visibility in the current study has been defined as a continuous function changing from clearly discemable to completely invisible. It allows the comparison of visibility under various conditions, not just limited to the threshold. Current experiment has revealed that different conditions may results in the same visual threshold but follow very different path on the way leading to the threshold. The new definition of visibility has made the quantification of visibility in the pre-threshold conditions possible. Such quantification can help to improve the performance of fire evacuation since most evacuees will experience the pre-threshold condition. With current measurement of visibility, all the influential factors such as colour, viewing angle etc. can be tested in experiment and simulated in numerical model. Based on the newly introduced definition of visibility, a set of experiments have been carried output in a purposed built smoke tunnel. Digital camera images of various illuminated signs were taken under different illumination, colour and smoke conditions. Using an algorithm developed by the author in this study, the digital camera images were converted into simulated human perceived images. The visibility of a target sign is measured against the quality of its image acquired. Conclusions have been drawn by comparing visibility under different conditions. One of them is that signs illuminated with red and green lights have the similar visibility that is far better than that with blue light. It is the first time this seemingly obvious conclusion has been quantified. In the simulation of visibility in participating media, the author has introduced an algorithm that combines irradiance catching in 3 D space with Monte Carlo ray tracing. It can calculate the distribution of scattered radiation with good accuracy without the high cost typically related to zonal method and the limitations in discrete ordinate method. The algorithm has been combined with a two pass solution method to produce high resolution images without introducing excessive number of rays from the light source. The convergence of the iterative solution procedure implemented has been theoretically proven. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated by comparing with the analytical solution of a point radiant source in 3 D space. Further validation of the simulation model has been carried out by comparing the model prediction with the data from the smoke tunnel experiments. The output of the simulation model has been presented {{in the form of an}} innovative floor map of visibility (FMV). It helps the fire safety designer to identify regions of poor visibility in a glance and will prove to be a very useful tool in performance based fire safety design...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{disparity in}} mortality-related factors in 1 - 59 months children across Iran using hospital records of emergency units. Materials and Methods: After designing and validating a national questionnaire for mortality data collection of children 1 - 59 months, all 40 medical universities {{has been asked}} to fill in the questionnaires and return to the main researcher in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Age and sex of deceased children, the type of health center, staying more than 2 h in emergency unit, the reason of prolonged stay in emergency, having <b>emergency</b> (risk) <b>signs,</b> vaccination, need to blood transfusion, need to electroshock and so on have also been collected across the country. There was also a comparison of children based on their BMI. Chi-square test has been applied for nominal and ordinal variables. ANOVA and t-student test have been used for measuring the difference of continuous variables among groups. Results: Mortality in 1 - 59 months children was unequally distributed across Iran. The average month of entrance to hospital was June, the average day was 16 th of month, and the average hour of entrance to hospital was 14 : 00. The average of month, day and hour for discharge was July, 16, and 14 : 00, respectively. The hour of discharge was statistically significant between children with and without risk signs. More than half (54 %) of patients had referred to educational hospital emergency units. There were no statistically significant differences between children with and without <b>emergency</b> <b>signs.</b> There were statistically significant differences between children with and without <b>emergency</b> <b>signs</b> in age less than 24 months (0. 034), nutrition situation (P = 0. 031), recommendation for referring (P = 0. 013), access to electroshock facilities (P = 0. 026), and having successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (P = 0. 01). Conclusion: This study {{is one of the first}} to show the distribution of the disparity of early childhood mortality-related factors within a developing country. Our results suggest that disparity in 1 - 59 months mortality based on hospital records in emergency units needs more attention by policy-makers. It is advisable to conduct provincially representative surveys to provide recent estimates of hospital access disparities in emergency units and to allow monitoring over time...|$|R
