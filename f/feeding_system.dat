5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod <b>feeding</b> <b>system.</b> Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{existing}} airstrip at Turatam near the cosmodrome was small, {{the dogs and}} crew had to be first flown aboard a Tu-104 plane to Tashkent.

5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive <b>feeding</b> <b>system.</b> Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} design the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> of high speed Computer Numerical Control (CNC) lathe, the static and dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> driven by linear motor in high speed CNC lathe were analyzed. The slide board was taking as the main moving part of the <b>feed</b> <b>system,</b> and the guide rail was the main support component of the linear motor <b>feed</b> <b>system.</b> The mechanical structure static stiffness of <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> is researched through the slide board statics analysis. The simulation {{results show that the}} maximum deformation of the slide board occurs {{in the middle of the}} slide board where the linear motor is placed. The linear motor <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> control model was established based on analysis of high-speed linear <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> control principle, and the linear motor <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> transfer function was established, and servo dynamic stiffness factors were analyzed. The control parameters of the servo system and actuating mechanism parameters of <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> on the effect of the linear motor servo dynamic stiffness were analyzed using MATLAB software. The simulation results show that the position loop proportional gain, speed loop proportional gain and speed loop integral response time are the biggest influence factors on servo dynamic stiffness. The displacement response is reduced under the cutting interference force step inputting, the servo dynamic stiffness is increased, the number of system oscillation is also reduced, and the system tends to be stable.   </p...|$|R
5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a <b>feeding</b> <b>system,</b> in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although they were never used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{designed}} to have a length no greater than a man's shoulder width, {{to allow it to}} be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle. To achieve this, the weapon's design uses the unconventional bullpup configuration, in which the action and magazine are located behind the trigger and alongside the shooter's face so that there is no wasted space in the stock. The P90's dimensions are minimized by its unique horizontally mounted <b>feeding</b> <b>system,</b> wherein the box magazine sits parallel to the barrel on top of the weapon's frame. The weapon overall has an extremely compact profile—it is the most compact fixed-stock submachine gun to be made. The standard version of the weapon has an overall length of 500mm (19.7in), a height of 210mm (8.3in), and a width of 55mm (2.2in).|$|E

50|$|The {{key element}} of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> {{mechanically}} via a hopper with actively driven feeding auger, as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the <b>feed</b> <b>system.</b> Each cell of the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> has a particular volume. The portion {{is defined by the}} rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor’s rotation distance by the number of the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} {{the action of the}} weapon {{combined}} functions of several different machine guns of the same era. The action consisted of a sliding breech block connected to a rotary crank, which in turn was operated by an off-set connecting rod, driven by the piston rod of the weapon. The <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> was also unconventional, utilizing a box magazine mounted {{on the left side of}} the gun, holding 10 stripper clips with five rounds each. The stripper clips were fed one at a time through the gun from left to right where the empty clips were ejected (japanese type 11 light machine gun utilised similar feature). It used the rear sight and the barrel of the Krag–Jørgensen rifle.|$|E
500|$|The {{main body}} cavity is a hemocoel through which blood circulates; their circulatory systems are mainly open. The [...] "generalized" [...] mollusc's <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of a rasping [...] "tongue", the radula, and a complex digestive system in which exuded mucus and microscopic, muscle-powered [...] "hairs" [...] called cilia play various important roles. The generalized mollusc has two paired nerve cords, or three in bivalves. The brain, in species that have one, encircles the esophagus. Most molluscs have eyes, and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of molluscan reproductive system relies on external fertilization, but more complex variations occur. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults.|$|E
2500|$|Pigs are {{naturally}} omnivorous and are generally fed {{a combination of}} grains and protein sources (soybeans, or meat and bone meal). [...] Larger intensive pig farms may be surrounded by farmland where feed-grain crops are grown. [...] Consequently, piggeries are reliant on the grains industry. [...] Pig feed may be bought packaged, in bulk or mixed on-site. [...] The intensive piggery system, where pigs are confined in individual stalls, allows each pig to be allotted a portion of feed. [...] The individual <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> also facilitates individual medication of pigs through feed. This has more significance to intensive farming methods, as the proximity to other animals enables diseases to spread more rapidly. To prevent disease spreading and encourage growth, drug programs such as vitamins and antibiotics are administered preemptively.|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of ion thruster technology on the Deep Space 1 technology demonstration mission {{paved the way for}} its first use on the Dawn science mission, which launched in September 2007. Both Deep Space 1 and Dawn used a "bang-bang" xenon <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> which has proven to be highly successful. This type of <b>feed</b> <b>system,</b> however, is complex with many parts and requires a significant amount of engineering work for architecture changes. A simplified <b>feed</b> <b>system,</b> with fewer parts and less engineering work for architecture changes, is desirable to reduce the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> cost to future missions. An attractive new path for ion thruster <b>feed</b> <b>systems</b> is based on new components developed by industry in support of commercial applications of electric propulsion systems. For example, since the launch of Deep Space 1 tens of mechanical xenon pressure regulators have successfully flown on commercial spacecraft using electric propulsion. In addition, active proportional flow controllers have flown on the Hall-thruster-equipped Tacsat- 2, are flying on the ion thruster GOCE mission, and will fly next year on the Advanced EHF spacecraft. This present paper briefly reviews the Dawn xenon <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> and those implemented on other xenon electric propulsion flight missions. A simplified <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> architecture is presented that is based on assembling flight-qualified components in a manner that will reduce non-recurring engineering associated with propulsion system architecture changes, and is compared to the NASA Dawn standard. The simplified <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> includes, compared to Dawn, passive high-pressure regulation, a reduced part count, reduced complexity due to cross-strapping, and reduced non-recurring engineering work required for <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> changes. A demonstration <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> was assembled using flight-like components and used to operate a laboratory NSTAR-class ion engine. <b>Feed</b> <b>system</b> components integrated into a single-string architecture successfully operated the engine over the entire NSTAR throttle range over a series of tests. Flow rates were very stable with variations of at most 0. 2 %, and transition times between throttle levels were typically 90 seconds or less with a maximum of 200 seconds, both significant improvements over the Dawn bang-bang <b>feed</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

2500|$|They breed {{all year}} round and this has clear effects on the {{detailed}} structure of their behaviour [...] and bulls occupy and share [...] "home territories" [...] {{with other members of}} the herd, and with two or three, or more, other bulls. [...] Home ranges overlap, and are not thought of as defended territories although bulls participate in sparring matches with their home range partners. Studies during winter hay feeding showed that at this time when the cattle were forced into close proximity, cows had a complex social structure apparently based on individual pairwise relationships, while bulls had a linear hierarchy or [...] "peck order". Those studies were made many years ago and the <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> now in operation does not bring the cattle into such close proximity. The cattle are extremely vocal with characteristic calls which echo around the area, especially when the bulls are excited by the discovery that a cow is coming into season.|$|E
2500|$|On a CT scan, {{subdural}} hematomas are classically crescent-shaped, with a {{concave surface}} {{away from the}} skull. [...] However, {{they can have a}} convex appearance, especially in the early stage of bleeding. [...] This may cause difficulty in distinguishing between subdural and epidural hemorrhages. [...] A more reliable indicator of subdural hemorrhage is its involvement of a larger portion of the cerebral hemisphere since it can cross suture lines, unlike an epidural hemorrhage. [...] Subdural blood can also be seen as a layering density along the tentorium cerebelli. This can be a chronic, stable process, since the <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> is low-pressure. In such cases, subtle signs of bleeding such as effacement of sulci or medial displacement of the junction between gray matter and white matter may be apparent. [...] A chronic bleed can be the same density as brain tissue (called isodense to brain), meaning that it will show up on CT scan as the same shade as brain tissue, potentially obscuring the finding.|$|E

40|$|The poor low-frequency {{performance}} of geometrically designed beam-waveguide (BWG) antennas {{is shown to}} be caused by the diffraction phase centers being far from the geometrical optics mirror focus, resulting in substantial spillover and defocusing loss.
