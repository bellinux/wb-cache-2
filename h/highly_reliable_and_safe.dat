40|$|Abstract. Over {{the past}} few years {{semi-autonomous}} driving function-ality was introduced in the automotive market, and this trend continues towards fully autonomous cars. While in autonomous vehicles data from various types of sensors realize the new highly safety critical autonomous functionality, the already complex system architecture faces the challenge of designing <b>highly</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> autonomous driving system. Since sensors are prone to intermittent faults, using different sensors is better and more cost effective than duplicating the same sensor type because of diversity of reaction of different sensor typesto the same environmen-tal condition. Specifying and validating sensors and providing technical means that enable usage of data from different sensors in case of fail-ures is a challenging, time-consuming and error-prone task for engineers. Therefore, in this paper we present our model-based approach and a run-time system that improves the safety of autonomous driving systems by providing reusable framework managing different sensor setups in a ve-hicle in a case of a error. Moreover, the solution that we provide enables adaptive graceful degradation and reconfiguration by effective use of the system resources.

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} few years {{semi-autonomous}} driving functionality was introduced in the automotive market and this trend continues towards fully autonomous cars. While in au-tonomous vehicles, data from various types of sensors realize the new highly safety critical autonomous functionality, the already complex system architecture faces the challenge of designing <b>highly</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> autonomous driving system. A common approach to build a reliable real-time system is using hardware replication; however the solution tends to be very costly. An alternative approach is providing support for adaptive error and state management and effective resource utilization that allows a system to adapt and reconfigure after failures of part of the system without requiring the user intervention. In addition, the end-customer is used to the possibility of easy personalization or extensibility of the electronic systems with new HW or SW. In this paper we present our model-based framework and run-time system that enables system extension and improves the safety of autonomous driving systems by providing reusable formal scheme enabling adaptive error and resource management. A case study explaining the applicability of the approach is presented. Keywords—dependability, safety, autonomous driving systems I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Designing {{industrial}} robot systems for welding, painting, and assembly, is challenging {{because they are}} required to perform with high precision, speed, and endurance. ABB Robotics has specialized in build-ing <b>highly</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> robotized paint systems based on an inte-grated process control system. However, current validation practices are primarily limited to manually designed test scenarios. A tricky part of this validation concerns testing the timing aspects of the control system, which is particularly challenging for paint robots that need to coordinate paint activation with the robot motion control. To overcome these challenges, we have developed and deployed a cost-effective, automated test generation technique based on Constraint Pro-gramming, aimed at validating the timing behavior of the process control system. We designed a constraint optimization model in SICStus Prolog, using arithmetic and logic constraints including use of global constraints. This model has been integrated into a fully automated continuous inte-gration environment, allowing the model to be solved on demand prior to test execution, which allows us to obtain the most optimal and diverse set of test scenarios for the present system configuration. After three months of daily operational use of the constraint model in our testing process, we have collected data on its performance and bug finding capabilities. We report on these aspects, along with our experi-ences and the improvements gained by the new testing process. ...|$|E

40|$|Vasectomy {{has been}} {{accepted}} for family planning by approximately 42 million couples worldwide, the majority of whom live in developing countries. It is a <b>highly</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> contraceptive method, which has been extensively studied. Recently, however, renewed concerns have been raised about a possible effect between vasectomy and cancer of the prostate many years after the procedure has been performed. These concerns are based on research conducted in the USA, {{where there is a}} high and rising incidence of prostate cancer. This review discusses the evidence for this association and its potential impact in developing countries. The factors influencing the development and growth of prostate cancer are poorly understood and complicate any research into risk factors for the disease. Overall incidences of prostate cancer in some developed countries, such as the USA, are fifty times higher than in some developing countries, such as China. The majority of epidemiological studies on the relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer have been based in the USA, but the findings are inconsistent and the reported associations weak. On the basis of currently available data, no changes in family planning policies with regard to vasectomy are warranted, but the concerns raised by these studies require that research into any possible association be undertaken in developing countries where vasectomy is widely practised...|$|E
40|$|Space {{exploration}} {{follows a}} logical set of steps, starting with basic knowledge and culminating, hopefully, in a sustained human presence in space. The next step, {{according to the}} Global Exploration Roadmap, released in September 2011 by the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), which reflects the international effort to define feasible and sustainable exploration pathways to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids and Mars, is the Moon as second home in the Solar System. On the basis of risk, cost and technology readiness criteria, the present paper aims to provide quantitative results {{to set up a}} Deep Space- Habitat, as an exploration gateway, at the Earth Moon Lagrange point n° 2 (EML 2), {{on the way to the}} Moon, Mars and asteroids colonization. <b>Highly</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> systems are crucial as interplanetary resupply missions from Earth cannot reach the crew at short notice and a quick return to Earth is not possible. This problem is the strong link with the last year’s article “Mission analysis for a space medical center of an exploration gateway at a lunar libration point”, published at IAC in Cape Town, in 2011. Here a further analysis will be carried out on how to develop the preliminary bibliographical studies and to go deeper into the modeling of scenarios. In a first analysis, a local optimization of the deployment of the Deep-Space Habitat for an international space heaven located at EML 2 is performed. After investigating different propulsion technologies, a general analysis in order to minimize the cost to join the permanent outpost in the Earth-Moon system is run. The future needs an exploration gateway at a lunar libration point which will be developed for a 2035 timeframe, as indicated by the Global Exploration Strategy, might slightly change. As a direct consequence, the number of modules composing the Deep-Space Habitat is not specified to make the analysis more generic and flexible. Secondly, special emphasis is placed on locally optimizing the operational phase, with the mission analysis of the resupply cargo. The time to come back to Earth is the dimensioning parameter in order to guarantee safety in emergency cases for the crew. Finally, a global optimization for the entire Deep-Space Habitat mission, encompassing deployment and operational phase can be started...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is an {{important}} association of paediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) found in 30 - 50 % of all children presenting with first UTI. Contrast-enhanced voiding ultrasonography (ceVUS) has become {{an important}} radiation-free method for VUR detection in children. Its sensitivity in detecting VUR has greatly improved due {{to the development of}} the contrast-specific ultrasound techniques and the introduction of the second-generation ultrasound contrast agent, superseding the diagnostic accuracy of standard radiological procedures. AIM: This article aimed to summarise the current literature and discuss the first local pilot study performed in our institution on detection of vesicoureteric reflux by contrast-enhanced voiding ultrasonography with second- generation agent (SonoVue, Bracco, Italy). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the first 31 ceVUS (24 girls, 7 boys) was presented.   Age range was 2 months to 18 years (mean = 6. 4 ± 4. 9). RESULTS:  All examinations were well tolerated without any adverse incident. VUR was shown in 20 (64. 5 %) children in 32 / 62 (51. 6) nephroureteral units (NUUs). In 18 NUUs, VUR was grade II/V, in 11 Grade III/V and in 3 grade IV/V, respectively. Urethra was shown in 19 / 31 children and in all boys, without pathological finding. In two girls spinning top urethra has been detected. Subsequent urodynamic studies revealed functional bladder problem in both.   CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography using intravesical second generation ultrasound contrast agent could be recommend  as a valid alternative diagnostic modality for detecting vesicoureteral reflux and evaluation of the distal urinary tract in children, based on its radiation-free, <b>highly</b> efficacious, <b>reliable,</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> characteristics...|$|R

[Background]The IUD is a <b>highly</b> effective, <b>reliable,</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> {{contraceptive method}} that is under-utilised {{in many countries}} due to persistent fears that it causes pelvic infection. Reliable evidence of the safety of this contraceptive method has not been enough to effect a change in use. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the knowledge and acceptability of the IUD among clients and providers in the Family Planning services in Cape Town and to attempt to identity obstacles to use. [Methods] A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted at eight Family Planning clinics in Cape Town. Two hundred and sixteen clients aged between 18 and 50 years, and 30 providers from the same clinics, were interviewed using structured questionnaires. [Results] Awareness of the IUD among clients was low - 81 women (41 %) had heard of this contraceptive method. Ever and current use were very low. Only 9 women (4 %) had ever used an IUD and 3 women were still using this method. Both the women who were interested in using this method in the future (n= 77; 36 %) and the women who were ambivalent or not interested in future use (n= 139; 64 %) cited a lack of knowledge as an obstacle to use. Although most providers were aware of the availability of the IUD (n= 26; 87 %). their factual knowledge was limited. Infection (n= 14; 47 %) and increased menstrual bleeding (n= 12; 40 %) were frequently mentioned as disadvantages. Referrals for and insertions of the IUD were low, and this method was often not discussed with women considering tubal ligation. Providers identiﬁed lack of client knowledge, myths and rumours among clients, lack of skilled providers to insert the device, and lack of promotion of the IUD, as signiﬁcant obstacles to greater use of this method. [Conclusion] Although the IUD is available in the public sector services, it is not being utilized. Better education of both clients and providers is essential in order to improve accessibility and acceptability of this highly effective and cost effective contraceptive method...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundGustatory sweating, {{the main}} symptom of Frey's syndrome, usually occurs after parotid gland surgery. Numerous medical and {{surgical}} treatments {{have been proposed}} to treat this condition, but there are various drawbacks. Botulinum toxin type A intracutaneous injection {{is a relatively new}} treatment modality; its use has never been reported in Taiwan. Here, we present our preliminary experience with this technique and review the literature. MethodsBetween March 2002 and June 2005, 10 consecutive patients with severe gustatory sweating were managed with intracutaneous injection of botulinum toxin type A for a total of 16 times. The affected skin was visualized by Minor's starch-iodine test and then recorded. The interinjection distance was 1 cm and a mean dose of 46. 4 U (at a concentration of 2. 5 U/ 0. 1 mL) was used. ResultsIn all 10 cases, gustatory sweating improved within 2 days after injection, with no side effects. Patients in whom the first 13 injections were performed experienced recurrence of gustatory sweating. Mean duration of effectiveness was 9. 3 months; the shortest duration of effectiveness was 2 months and the longest was 28 months. One patient also had gustatory flushing, but this symptom did not improve even after 3 treatments. ConclusionIntracutaneous injection of botulinum toxin type A is a <b>highly</b> <b>reliable,</b> effective, <b>safe,</b> <b>and</b> minimally invasive treatment for gustatory sweating. Some patients had long-lasting therapeutic results. We recommend it as a valuable treatment option for severe cases of gustatory sweating. However, in our experience, it had no effect on facial skin flushing. Therefore, in addition to acetylcholine, there might be other neurotransmitters that are responsible for skin vasodilatation...|$|R
