25|$|The eighteenth {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial, with a finish on the Mont Ventoux. It was won {{with a great}} margin by Jean-François Bernard, who became the new leader of the general classification, and the new hope of the French cycling fans. Bernard was a good climber and a good time-trialist, and {{had the support of}} a good team, so he could be able to stay leader {{until the end of the}} race. But already in the next stage, Bernard lost considerable time. He had a flat tire just before the top of a climb, and lost contact with the other riders while he had to wait for repairs, and had to spend energy to get back. His rivals Mottet and Roche had made a plan to attack in the <b>feed</b> <b>zone,</b> where cyclists could get their lunch. Mottet and Roche had packed extra food at the start of the stage, and attacked while Bernard was at the back of the peloton. Bernard chased them, but was not able to get back to them, and lost four minutes in that stage, which made Roche the new leader, closely followed by Mottet and Delgado.|$|E

40|$|Abridged] We {{present an}} {{extensive}} suite of terrestrial planet formation simulations that allows quantitative {{analysis of the}} stochastic late stages of planet formation. We quantify the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> width, Delta a, as the mass-weighted standard deviation of the initial semi-major axes of the planetary embryos and planetesimals {{that make up the}} final planet. The size of a planet's <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> in our simulations does not correlate with its final mass or semi-major axis, suggesting there is no systematic trend between a planet's mass and its volatile inventory. Instead, we find that the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> of any planet more massive than 0. 1 M_Earth is roughly proportional to the radial extent of the initial disk from which it formed: Delta a~ 0. 25 (a_max-a_min), where a_min and a_max are the inner and outer edge of the initial planetesimal disk. These wide stochastic <b>feeding</b> <b>zones</b> have significant consequences for the origin of the Moon, since the canonical scenario predicts the Moon should be primarily composed of material from Earth's last major impactor (Theia), yet its isotopic composition is indistinguishable from Earth. In particular, we find that the <b>feeding</b> <b>zones</b> of Theia analogs are significantly more stochastic than the planetary analogs. Depending on our assumed initial distribution of oxygen isotopes within the planetesimal disk, we find a ~ 5 % or less probability that the Earth and Theia will form with an isotopic difference equal to or smaller than the Earth and Moon's. In fact we predict that every planetary mass body should be expected to have a unique isotopic signature. In addition, we find paucities of massive Theia analogs and high velocity moon-forming collisions, two recently proposed explanations for the Moon's isotopic composition. Our work suggests that there is still no scenario for the Moon's origin that explains its isotopic composition with a high probability event.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of coal-fired power station operations, elevated selenium concentrations {{have been reported in}} the sediments and biota of Lake Macquarie (New South Wales, Australia). In the present study, an ecosystem-scale model has been applied to determine how selenium in a seagrass food web is processed from sediments and water through diet to predators, using stable isotopes (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) to establish the trophic position of organisms. Trophic position, habitat, and <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> were examined as possible factors influencing selenium bioaccumulation. Selenium concentrations ranged from 0. 2 [*]μg/g dry weight in macroalgae species to 12. 9 [*]μg/g in the carnivorous fish Gerres subfasciatus. A mean magnification factor of 1. 39 per trophic level showed that selenium is biomagnifying in the seagrass food web. Habitat and <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> influenced selenium concentrations in invertebrates, whereas <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> was the only significant factor influencing selenium concentrations in fish. The sediment–water partitioning coefficient (Kd) of 4180 showed that partitioning of selenium entering the lake to particulate organic material (POM) is occurring, and consequently availability to food webs from POM is high. Trophic transfer factors (invertebrate[*]=[*] 1. 9; fish[*]=[*] 1. 2) were similar to those reported for other water bodies, showing that input source is not the main determinant of the magnitude of selenium bioaccumulation in a food web, but rather the initial partitioning of selenium into bioavailable POM. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Last {{year the}} first {{robotized}} milking machines {{were introduced in}} Latvia. Their main peculiarity {{lies in the fact}} that cows are milked without the help of people. The animals can go to the milking place independently at their own will and at any time of the day. After milking they can move to the <b>feeding</b> <b>zones</b> as well as to the recreation zones. For trafficking of animals from one functional zone to another several solutions have been elaborated. On the training and research h farm “Vecauce ” of the Latvia University of Agriculture where the research was carried out the cows are milked by two robots and the feed first cow traffic system is applied. In this case the cows can get to the concentrated <b>feed</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> going through the sorting gate. Here the animals are identified and the necessity for milking is evaluated and depending upon it the cows are directed to the pre-milking area or to the zone where the concentrated feed distribution stands are located. In Vecauce also another innovation is introduced – the cows after leaving the first robot get back to the pre-milking area and only after that through a separate sorting gate they can get into the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone.</b> The aim of our research was to state how often the cows attend robots during a day and to evaluate the cow traffic system applied in Vecauce. In the research it was stated that the cows are milked in robots in the average 2. 9 times a day. But the trafficking of cows milked in the first robot to the <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> through the pre-milking area is not rational as a part of the milked cows return to the robot repeatedly so increasing the load of this robot. In order to eliminate this disadvantage proposals have been developed for reconstruction of the pre-milking area and for improvement of the animal trafficking system. Key words: milk cows, robotic milking, milking frequency, cow trafficking system...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} how {{the volume and}} temporal heterogeneity of water supply changed the vertical distribution and mortality of a belowground herbivore, and consequently affected plant biomass. Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae) seedlings were grown at one per pot under different combinations of water volume (large or small volume) and heterogeneity (homogeneous water conditions, watered every day; heterogeneous conditions, watered every 4 days) in {{the presence or absence}} of a larva of the belowground herbivorous insect, Anomala cuprea (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). The larva was confined in different vertical distributions to top <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> (top treatment), middle <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> (middle treatment), or bottom <b>feeding</b> <b>zone</b> (bottom treatment); alternatively no larva was introduced (control treatment) or larval movement was not confined (free treatment). Three-way interaction between water volume, heterogeneity, and the herbivore significantly affected plant biomass. With a large water volume, plant biomass was lower in free treatment than in control treatment regardless of heterogeneity. Plant biomass in free treatment was as low as in top treatment. With a small water volume and in free treatment, plant biomass was low (similar to that under top treatment) under homogeneous water conditions but high under heterogeneous ones (similar to that under middle or bottom treatment). Therefore, there was little effect of belowground herbivory on plant growth under heterogeneous water conditions.
