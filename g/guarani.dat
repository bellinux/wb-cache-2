5|$|In 1750 as {{a result}} of the Treaty of Madrid seven {{missions}} in present-day Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil were transferred from Spanish to Portuguese control. The native <b>Guaraní</b> tribes were unhappy to see their lands turned over to Portugal (their enemy for over a century) and they rebelled against the decision, leading to the <b>Guarani</b> War. In Europe, where the Jesuits were under attack, they were accused of supporting the rebellion and perceived as defending the native peoples. In 1758, the Jesuits were accused of a conspiracy to kill the king of Portugal, known as the Távora affair. All members of the Society of Jesus were evicted from Portuguese territories in 1759, and from French territories in 1764. In 1766 Jesuits were accused of causing Esquilache Riots in Madrid; consequently in February 1767, Charles III of Spain signed a royal decree with expulsion orders for all members of the Society of Jesus in Spanish territories.|$|E
5|$|José de San Martín was {{the fifth}} and last son of Juan de San Martín, an {{unsuccessful}} Spanish soldier, and Gregoria Matorras del Ser. He was born in Yapeyú, Corrientes, an Indian reduction of <b>Guaraní</b> people. The exact year of his birth is disputed, as there are no records of his baptism. Later documents formulated during his life, such as passports, military career records and wedding documentation, gave him varying ages. Most of these documents point to his year of birth as either 1777 or 1778. The family moved to Buenos Aires in 1781, when San Martín was {{three or four years}} old.|$|E
5|$|While {{the mission}} towns in Paraguay flourished, the evangelization of the <b>Guaraní</b> (Chiriguanos) in Bolivia proved difficult. With {{encouragement}} from Agustín Gutiérrez de Arce, {{the governor of}} Santa Cruz, the Jesuits focused their efforts on the Chiquitania, where the Christian doctrine was more readily accepted. Between 1691 and 1760 eleven missions were founded in the area; however, fires, floods, plagues, famines and attacks by hostile tribes or slave traders caused many missions to be re-established or rebuilt. The Chiquitos missions were spared large-scale epidemics, unlike those in Paraguay, mainly because of their remote locations {{and the lack of}} transportation infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|The new Jesuit reducciones were {{constantly}} {{threatened by the}} slave-raiding mamelucos, who survived by capturing natives and selling them as slaves to planters in Brazil. Having depleted native populations near Sâo Paulo, they discovered the richly populated reducciones. The Spanish authorities chose not to defend the settlements, and the Jesuits and <b>Guaranís</b> had little means of defense against such raids. The mameluco threat ended only after 1639. After thousands of <b>Guaranís</b> had been enslaved the viceroy in Peru finally allowed <b>Guaranís</b> to bear arms. Well-trained and highly motivated native units attacked the raiders and drove them off. This victory {{set the stage for}} the golden age of the Jesuits in Paraguay. Life in the reducciones offered <b>Guaranís</b> higher living standards, protection from settlers, and physical security. The reducciones, which became quite wealthy, exported goods and supplied Indian armies.|$|R

5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country's indigenous population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three indigenous languages, Quechua, Aymara, or <b>Guaraní,</b> within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought to encourage more indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that half of the students enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.|$|E
5|$|Roa Bastos' {{life and}} writing {{were marked by}} {{experience}} with dictatorial military regimes. In 1947 he was forced into exile in Argentina, and in 1976 he fled Buenos Aires for France in similar political circumstances. Most of Roa Bastos' work was written in exile, but this did not deter him from fiercely tackling Paraguayan social and historical issues in his work. Writing in a Spanish that was at times heavily augmented by <b>Guaraní</b> words (the major Paraguayan indigenous language), Roa Bastos incorporated Paraguayan myths and symbols into a Baroque style known as magical realism. He is considered a late-comer to the Latin American Boom literary movement. Roa Bastos' canon includes the novels Hijo de hombre (1960; Son of Man) and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor), as well as numerous other novels, short stories, poems, and screenplays.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{set up his}} {{government}} in Chuquisaca, where he presided over the change of regime for the entire region. He planned the reorganization of the Mines of Potosi, and a reform at the University of Charcas. He proclaimed the end of native slavery and servitude in Upper Peru, and the natives were granted political rights equal {{to those of the}} criollos. Castelli forbade the establishment of new convents and parishes to avoid the common practice that, under the guise of spreading Christian doctrine, the natives were forced into servitude by religious orders. He authorized free trade and redistributed land expropriated from the former workers of the mills. The decree was published in Spanish, <b>Guarani,</b> Quechua, and Aymara; he established several bilingual schools as well. Several Indian chiefs participated in {{the first anniversary of the}} May Revolution, celebrated in Tiahuanaco, where Castelli paid tribute to the ancient Incas and encouraged the people to rise against the Spanish. Despite their welcome, however, Castelli was aware that most of the aristocracy supported the auxiliary army out of fear instead of genuine support.|$|E

5|$|In Toulouse Roa Bastos taught <b>Guaraní</b> and Spanish {{literature}} at the University of Toulouse. Although {{he had been}} allowed to visit Paraguay to work with a new generation of Paraguayan writers, starting in 1970, he was again barred from entry in 1982, for purportedly engaging in subversive activities. There is however, little evidence that he participated in sectarian politics of any kind. In France, Roa Bastos faced the second forced relocation of his life, but he also won a new readership for his work during this time. Helen Lane's English translation of Yo, el Supremo, I, The Supreme, published in 1986, was greeted with widespread acclaim in the English-speaking world. However, in France, Roa Bastos' writing focus was primarily academic, and his literary output did not match that of his time in Argentina. In 1985 Roa Bastos left his post at the University of Toulouse. Following the downfall of the oppressive Alfredo Stroessner regime in 1989, Roa Bastos returned to Paraguay at the request of its new leader Andrés Rodríguez.|$|E
5|$|As the 1992 Copa CONMEBOL winner, Atlético Mineiro {{qualified}} for the following year's edition of the competition, and for the 1993 edition of the Copa de Oro, a new tournament organised by CONMEBOL, contested between the winners of all the continental competitions of the previous year: Copa Libertadores, Copa CONMEBOL, Supercopa Libertadores, and Copa Master de Supercopa. In the Copa de Oro, Atlético faced its biggest rivals Cruzeiro in the semi-final, played as a single match at the Mineirão, the home stadium for both clubs, {{in front of a}} crowd of both team's fans. The game ended 00, and Atlético advanced to its second continental finals after winning a penalty shootout by 54. The team faced the Boca Juniors in the finals, and finished as runner-up after drawing the first leg 00 at the Mineirão, and losing the second 10 at La Bombonera. In the Copa CONMEBOL, Atlético again eliminated Fluminense in the first round (this time in a penalty shootout), and defeated Peru's Sipesa in the quarter-finals with an aggregate score of 21. Atlético club was eliminated in the semi-finals by Botafogo, the eventual winner of the tournament, after winning the first leg 31 at home, but losing the second 30.Absent from continental football for one season, Atlético Mineiro returned to the Copa CONMEBOL in the 1995 edition, qualifying after finishing fourth in the 1994 Brasileiro. The team eliminated Brazil's <b>Guarani</b> in the first stage with an aggregate score of 21, before defeating Venezuelan club Mineros de Guayana, with a club record home (60) and aggregate (100) win scores. In the semi-finals, Atlético faced Colombia's América de Cali, and advanced after winning a penalty shootout by 43, following a 43 away defeat, and a 10 home win. In its second Copa CONMEBOL final, Atlético faced Argentine side Rosario Central, and secured a significant advantage in the series with a 40 win at the Mineirão. However, in the second leg of the finals played in the Gigante de Arroyito, Atlético suffered a shocking 40 defeat, with a goal scored by Rosario at the 87th minute. The title was decided on penalties, with a 43 score favouring Central. In the following year, Atlético took part in the Copa Master de CONMEBOL, a single-edition competition contested in Cuiabá between the past winners of the Copa CONMEBOL: Atlético, Botafogo, São Paulo, and Rosario Central. Only {{a few months after the}} previous year's defeat, Atlético faced Central again, this time winning 109 on penalties after a 00 draw. Atlético lost to São Paulo 30 in the final match, played at the Verdão.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater {{resources}} {{supply water}} to some small urban settlements and small and medium scale irrigation {{systems in the}} interior. The most important groundwater reserves in Paraguay in terms of capacity are the <b>Guaraní</b> and the Raigon Aquifer.

50|$|The {{missions}} {{were turned}} over to priests of other orders, chiefly Franciscans, but under a code of regulations drawn up by the viceroy and modeled largely on the Jesuit system. Under a chaotic political regulation, the missions rapidly declined. Most <b>Guaranís</b> returned to the countryside. According to the official census of 1801, fewer than 45,000 <b>Guaranís</b> remained; cattle, sheep, and horses had disappeared; the fields and orchards were overgrown or cut down, and the churches were in ruins. The long period of revolutionary struggle that followed completed the destruction. In 1814, the mission Indians numbered 8,000, and in 1848 the few who remained were declared citizens.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Guaraní,</b> the Cario, Tapé, Itatine, Guarajo, Tupí, {{and related}} subgroups, were generous people who {{inhabited}} an immense area {{stretching from the}} Guyana Highlands in Brazil to the Río Uruguay. The <b>Guaraní</b> were surrounded by hostile tribes, and were frequently at war. They believed that permanent wives were inappropriate for warriors, so their marital relations were loose. Some tribes practiced polygamy intended {{to increase the number}} of children. Chiefs often had twenty or thirty concubines, whom they shared freely with visitors, yet they treated their wives well. At the same time, they often punished adulterers with death. Like the area's other tribes, the <b>Guaraní</b> were cannibals. As part of a war ritual, they ate their most valiant foes captured in battle in the hope that they would gain the bravery and power of their victims. The <b>Guaraní</b> accepted the arrival of Spaniards and looked to them for protection against fiercer neighboring tribes. The <b>Guaraní</b> also hoped the Spaniards would lead them against the Incas.|$|E
25|$|Along with Paraguay (where {{it is one}} of two {{official}} languages), {{sectors of}} Argentina (Corrientes) speak <b>Guaraní.</b> However, the Mercosur does not provide all, or even most, services in <b>Guaraní.</b> The official website, almost all official summits are only held in Spanish and Portuguese.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflicts}} over the Southern colonial frontiers {{led to the}} signing of the Treaty of Madrid (1750), in which Spain and Portugal agreed to a considerable Southwestward expansion of colonial Brazil. According to the treaty, Colonia de Sacramento was to be given to Spain in exchange for the territories of São Miguel das Missões, a region occupied by Jesuit Missions dedicated to evangelizing the <b>Guaraní</b> natives. Resistance by the Jesuits and the <b>Guaraní</b> led to the <b>Guaraní</b> War (1756), in which Portuguese and Spanish troops destroyed the Missions. Colonia de Sacramento kept changing hands until 1777, when it was definitively conquered by the colonial governor of Buenos Aires.|$|E
