40|$|<b>Flexible</b> {{forms of}} <b>employment</b> This thesis {{deals with the}} <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment</b> as an {{alternative}} to an indefinite term employment with eight-hour working days and as an instrument for increasing employment relationship flexibility. These forms of employment, also called atypical or precarious, are attractive for employees who want to achieve a balance between their professional and personal lives, or for employers who can use these forms of employment as a competitive advantage or as an instrument to solve their economic problems. The thesis is divided into introduction, conclusion and five chapters which are divided into sub-chapters. The first chapter briefly describes the terms and principles which are important for the characterization of <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment.</b> The second chapter contains the definition of <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment,</b> their enumeration and brief summary of the survey on how czech employers use the <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment.</b> The third chapter deals with the <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment</b> provided for in the Labour Code.

The aim is to {{describe}} different kinds of <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment,</b> their use and development in the Czech republic and their regulation in the legislation. The practical part is focused on women - it describes their position on the labour market and analyses ways and possibilities to use <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment</b> and other benefits to provide support for women on the labour market. Important part of the thesis is comparison of using flexible forms of empoyment in the Czech Republic and other European Union countries...|$|R

New types of <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment</b> which are used in Germany's labour market were discussed as well.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{concerns with}} {{the phenomenon of}} <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment</b> in the Czech Republic.

The thesis is divided into three parts. In the first, theoretical part is described the current situation on the Czech labor market, subsequently is explained the term flexibility and are defined the <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment,</b> their advantages and disadvantages and their legal regulation. The second, practical part is based on a research in form of a questionnaire that discovers what forms of employment are used by the students and which forms would the students prefer.

50|$|Academicians see {{flexible}} {{working as an}} element which can both prevent and create opportunities. The findings revealed generally positive relationship between {{flexible working}} and perceptions of job quality in term of work-life balance and helping to improve and control autonomy particularly for remote workers, but some factors such as opportunities for advancement will be negatively affected due to the variations on different dimensions of job quality. <b>Flexible</b> <b>employment</b> {{is one of the}} vital factor in the European Union policy discourse.

40|$|In recent years, {{particularly}} in the European Union, {{it is believed that}} the reduction of labor costs will contribute to the competitiveness and adaptability of enterprises and thus to maintain existing and create new jobs. Since the early 1990 s, Greece following the guidelines of the European Union, gradually pushed a series of legislative changes relating to payments, working time, etc. aiming to promote flexible working. This paper examines the relationship of <b>flexible</b> working, <b>employment</b> and unemployment in the Greek labor market. More specifically, we study the evolution of <b>flexible</b> forms of <b>employment</b> during the period 2000 - 2013 and examine whether these changes {{had an impact on the}} overall scale of employment and unemployment. The main conclusion of the study supports findings of other researches that the significant increase in flexible working, particularly after 2009, failed to increase employment and reduce unemployment in the Greek labor market...|$|R

To achieve a lightweight service discovery and deals with appliance mobility, the bootstrapping mechanism in push model and the query/reply mechanism in pull model are designed based on the on-demand multicast routing protocol.

40|$|In {{this article}} it is {{investigated}} {{to what extent}} <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> at labour market entry negatively affects the early career of school-leavers in the Netherlands in the period 1986 - 2008. Additionally, the question is raised to what extent educational differences exist in this relationship. To answer these questions, Dutch panel data from the OSA Labour Supply Panel are analysed. The results correspond with previous findings from studies on other European countries, supporting the stepping-stone rather than the entrapment hypothesis. A flexible start in the Dutch labour market {{increases the likelihood of}} repeated <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> and unemployment in the early career, and coincides with less occupational status development and income growth. However, the detrimental effects of <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> at labour market entry are only temporary and diminish after some years.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how <b>flexible</b> <b>employment,</b> particularly temporary and part-time employment, affect {{political support for}} social policy protection. Although their implications are a priori uncertain, the paper lays out how <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> conditions {{can be expected to}} generate various kinds of economic insecurity for workers that ought in turn to spur support for social-welfare policies. The paper finds broad support for such expectations in individual-level survey data from 15 EU member states. In particular, part-time employment, temporary employment and their combination tend to increase several measures of an individual’s subjective economic insecurity. Further, partly due to such increases, the same measures of <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> tend to spur support for social policy assistance targeted at the unemployed...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to examine (1) the association between <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> and nurses' intention to leave the profession, and (2) whether or not support at work mediates the association between <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> and nurses' intention to leave the profession. <b>Flexible</b> <b>employment</b> is analyzed objectively using non-permanent contract, part-time employment status, casual employment status, involuntary hours and on-call work, and subjectively using job insecurity. Support at work refers to organizational, supervisor and peer support. Methods Data come from our survey of 1396 nurses employed in three teaching hospitals in Southern Ontario. Descriptive statistics are provided. Bivariate correlations, hierarchical regression analysis and mediation tests are conducted. Results Compared to those in full-time employment, nurses in part-time employment {{do not intend to}} leave the profession. None of the other objective <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> factors are associated with intention to leave the profession. Perceived job insecurity is associated with intention to leave the profession. Low support at work contributes to intention to leave the profession and mediates the association between job insecurity and intention to leave the profession. Conclusions The study provides evidence to health sector managers and policy makers that part-time employment, perceived job security and support at work are important factors to consider in efforts to retain nurses in the profession.

40|$|For {{the past}} 35 years, {{borderland}} industry has opened employment {{opportunities for women}} in the community of Nogales, Arizona. However, the expansion of free trade with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has aggravated economic instability by promoting the flexible use of labor, a practice that women have increasingly accommodated. Case studies of women engaged in the retail and maquiladora industries illustrate the interplay between <b>flexible</b> <b>employment,</b> reproduction, and education. These cases suggest that a strong connection between <b>flexible</b> <b>employment</b> and reproduction is sustained by ideologies that see these as mutually complimentary. At the same time, the connections between education and employment and reproduction activities are notably absent or weak. We argue that investing in the education of women, which could lead to more predictable employment, is in this way subverted by regional economic instability.
