40|$|The {{morphogenesis}} of the Drosophila embryonic heart tube {{has emerged}} as a valuable model system for studying cell migration, cell-cell adhesion and cell shape changes during embryonic development. One of the challenges faced in studying this structure is that the lumen of the heart tube, as well as the membrane features that are crucial to heart tube formation, are difficult to visualize in whole mount embryos, due to the small size of the heart tube and intra-lumenal space relative to the embryo. The use of transmission electron microscopy allows for higher magnification of these structures and gives the advantage of examining the embryos in cross section, which easily reveals {{the size and shape of}} the lumen. In this video, we detail the process for reliable fixation, embedding, and sectioning of late stage Drosophila embryos in order to visualize the heart tube lumen as well as important cellular structures including cell-cell junctions and the basement membrane. Protocol 1. Freshly prepare 2 ml of a fixative solution containing 12. 5 % Glutaraldehyde in 50 mM Cacodylate buffer (pH 7. 4) in a 20 ml <b>glass</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial.</b> Add 8 ml of n-heptane and shake vigorously. Allow the two phases to separate. Remove upper phase containing n-heptane saturated with glutaraldehyde, place into a clean scintillation vial and set aside. This will be the fixative solution. 2. Collect 0 - 20 hour embryos using an embryo collection chamber, which is a small basket with a removable mesh insert.

40|$|Heavy metals {{often occur}} as co-contaminants with {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and reportedly have adverse effects on biodegradation. In this study, the development of C- 14 -phenanthrene mineralisation in soil co-contaminated with aged or freshly added Al or Fe amendment was assessed. C- 14 -phenanthrene mineralisation was assessed using respirometry; respirometers incorporated a Teflon-lined screw-capped CO 2 trap containing 1 -M NaOH within a <b>glass</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial.</b> The production of (CO 2) -C- 14 was assessed {{by the addition of}} Ultima Gold liquid scintillation fluid to the CO 2 traps and subsequent liquid scintillation counting. Enumeration of phenanthrene-degrading bacteria was achieved by counting the colony forming unit count using the spread plate method. This investigation considered the effects of Al and Fe (50, 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg) on C- 14 -phenanthrene biodegradation in soil over 63 -day contact time. Fresh Al amendments at lower concentrations (50 and 100 mg/kg) stimulated phenanthrene catabolism (p < 0. 05) at t = 21 and 42 days which may reflect an 'Arndt-Schulz' effect, but phenanthrene catabolism was significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) in 500 mg/kg aged Al this could be due to Al toxicity to phenanthrene degraders. Phenanthrene mineralisation was stimulated in the highest Fe concentration (500 mg/kg) in aged and fresh Fe amendments at t = 21 days. This could be because Fe is an essential requirement for microbial growth. The impact of Al or Fe on the catabolism of C- 14 -phenanthrene was dependent on incubation time and Al was more toxic than Fe to soil PAH catabolic activity. This could be because Al is a non-essential microbial requirement. Bioremediation of soils co-contaminated with PAH and heavy metal is a complex problem; therefore, studies on the impact of metals on PAHs biodegradation highlight the risks and biodegradation potential in contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|Author: Microscopy Laboratory (This {{procedure}} {{can also}} be used for virtually any material that must be pelleted prior to fixation and thin sectioning) ### Primary fix: - 2 % glutaraldehyde (from 25 % or 10 % stock) in microtubule assembly buffer. - For better contrast of the tubulin, you can add 0. 1 -. 5 % tannic acid. ### Secondary Fix: 0. 5 - 1 % OsO 4 in the same buffer. OsO 4 is kept in the refrigerator in a jar and is made as a 4 % solution in water. It is very volatile and must be used in the hood. Osmium crystals take about a day to dissolve, so be certain that there is sufficient stock before you start your experiment. 1. Pellet microtubules at 15 - 20, 000 rpm in eppendorf tubes. Try to obtain a small and tightly packed pellet. - Remove supernatant and overlay pellet with glutaraldehyde solution. Fix at room temperature for ~ 1 hour. If necessary, this can be left overnight at room temperature. - If the pellet is large, loosen it {{from the bottom of the}} tube by making a small wedge with a Q-tip stick and using the stick to slide the pellet off the bottom. Then cut the pellet into small pieces with a razor blade. - Rinse the pellet with 2 - 4 changes of fixation buffer without the glutaraldehyde. - Postfix with 0. 5 - 1 % OsO 4 in the microtubule assembly buffer or in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7. 0 for ~ 1 hr at room temp or on ice. - Rinse the pellet with several changes of water and soak in 1 % uranyl acetate for 30 min - overnight, room temperature. NOTE: the pH of uranyl acetate is ~ 4. 0 so your water rinse should remove any PIPES, that would precipitate at low pH, or phosphate buffer, which precipitates as uranyl phosphate crystals. - Transfer the pellet to a <b>glass</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial</b> and rinse with water. Then dehydrate specimen by 10 - 15 min incubations in acetone:water mixtures of 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and at least two 100 % acetone rinses. - Infiltrate the samples with plastic. Incubate 4 hrs-overnight in 1 / 3 resin and 2 / 3 acetone. Remove the resin and add 2 / 3 resin: 1 / 3 acetone and incubate for another 4 - 6 hours in the hood on the rotator. Finally, transfer to 100 % spurr plastic and incubate for 2 - 6 hours. - I like to use a reasonable volume of the 1 / 3 plastic: 2 / 3 acetone mixture, put it on the rotator in the hood with the cap off overnight, and allow the acetone to gradually evaporate in the hood. Be certain that there is enough plastic to cover the specimen and that the acetone does not evaporate and leave the specimen exposed to the air. Then simply remove remaining resin and add 100 % resin to the sample and keep on the rotator for another 4 - 6 hours. - Pour resin in the flat embedding molds, position your sample near the front (pointy) part of each mold, and insert a note at the back of the block to identify it.

40|$|Introduction The goal of {{this work}} is to advance the {{production}} and use of 52 Mn (t½ = 5. 6 d, β+: 242 keV, 29. 6 %) as a radioisotope for in vivo preclinical nuclear imaging. More specifically, the aims of this study were: (1) to measure the excitation function for the natCr(p,n) 52 Mn reaction at low energies to verify past results [1 – 4]; (2) to measure binding constants of Mn(II) to aid {{the design of a}} method for isolation of Mn from an irradiated Cr target via ion-exchange chromatography, building upon previously published methods [1, 2, 5 – 7]; and (3) to perform phantom imaging by positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging with 52 Mn and non-radioactive Mn(II), since Mn has potential dual-modality benefits that are beginning to be investigated [8]. Material and Methods Thin foils of Cr metal are not available commercially, so we fabricated these {{in a manner similar to}} that reported by Tanaka and Furukawa [9]. natCr was electroplated onto Cu discs in an industrial-scale electroplating bath, and then the Cu backing was digested by nitric acid (HNO 3). The remaining thin Cr discs (~ 1 cm diameter) were weighed to determine their thickness (~ 75 – 85 μm) and arranged into stacked foil targets, along with ~ 25 μm thick Cu monitor foils. These targets were bombarded with ~ 15 MeV protons for 1 – 2 min at ~ 1 – 2 μA from a CS- 15 cyclotron (The Cyclotron Corporation, Berkeley, CA, USA). The beamline was perpendicular to the foils, which were held in a machined 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy target holder. The target holder was mounted in a solid target station with front cooling by a jet of He gas and rear cooling by circulating chilled water (T ≈ 2 – 5 °C). Following bombardment, these targets were disassembled and the radioisotope products in each foil were counted using a high-purity Ge (HPGe) detector. Cross-sections were calculated for the natCr(p,n) 52 Mn reaction. Binding constants of Mn(II) were measured by incubating 54 Mn(II) (t½ = 312 d) dichloride with anion- or cation-exchange resin (AG 1 -X 8 (Cl− form) or AG 50 W-X 8 (H+ form), respectively; both: 200 – 400 mesh; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in hydrochloric acid (HCl) ranging from 10 mM- 8 M (anion-exchange) and from 1 mM- 1 M (cation-exchange) or in sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) ranging from 10 mM- 8 M on cation-exchange resin only. The amount of unbound 54 Mn(II) was measured using a gamma counter, and binding constants (KD) were calculated for the various concentrations on both types of ion-exchange resin. We have used the unseparated product for preliminary PET and PET/MR imaging. natCr metal was bombarded and then digested in HCl, resulting in a solution of Cr(III) Cl 3 and 52 Mn(II) Cl 2. This solution was diluted and imaged in a <b>glass</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial</b> using a microPET (Siemens, Munich, Germany) small animal PET scanner. The signal was corrected for abundant cascade gamma-radiation from 52 Mn that could cause random false coincidence events to be detected, and then the image was reconstructed by filtered back-projection. Additionally, we have used the digested target to spike non-radioactive Mn(II) Cl 2 solutions for simultaneous PET/MR phantom imaging using a Biograph mMR (Siemens) clinical scanner. The phantom consisted of a 4 × 4 matrix of 15 mL conical tubes containing 10 mL each of 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mM concentrations of non-radioactive Mn(II) Cl 2 with 0, 7, 14, and 27 μCi (at start of PET acquisition) of 52 Mn(II) Cl 2 from the digested target added. The concentrations were based on previous MR studies that measured spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1) versus concentration of Mn(II), and the activities were based on calculations for predicted count rate in the scanner. The PET/MR imaging consisted of a series of two-dimensional inversion-recovery turbo spin echo (2 D-IR-TSE) MR sequences (TE = 12 ms; TR = 3, 000 ms) with a wide range of inversion times (TI) from 23 – 2, 930 ms with real-component acquisition, as well as a 30 min. list-mode PET acquisition that was reconstructed as one static frame by 3 -D ordered subset expectation maximization (3 D-OSEM). Attenuation correction was performed based on a two-point Dixon (2 PD) MR sequence.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dextranases (EC 3. 2. 1. 11) from the oral {{isolates}} Actinomyces israelii and Bacteroides ochraceus on water-insoluble glucan production by the Streptococcus mutans dextransucrase (EC 2. 4. 1. 5) and sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth glass surfaces by S. mutans was studied.

Concentrations of A. israelii dextranase as low as 0. 002 U/ml inhibited insoluble glucan formation by 60 %. Similar results were obtained the the B. ochraceus enzyme. An assay for sucrose-stimulated adherence of S. mutans to smooth surfaces involved attachment of radioactively labeled nongrowing cells to the bottom of <b>glass</b> <b>scintillation</b> <b>vials.</b> This facile and sensitive assay was utilized to demonstrate that sucrose-dependent adherence was affected by low levels of dextranase from either A. israelii or B. ochraceus.

Treatment of S. mutans cells previously attached to glass with low concentrations of the dextranases resulted in removal of 50 % to 60 % of the bacteria. The results indicate that dextranase-producing oral bacteria may affect sucrose-dependent colonization of S. mutans on the tooth surface and offer a possible explanation for both the difficulties involved in implanting this bacterium into the human mouth and the limited intraoral transmission of S. mutans from one tooth surface to another...|$|R

Greenhouse gas sampling occurred on 1, 3, 8, 10, 13, 17, 22, 24, 27, 31, 36, 38 and 41  days after treatment application, by placing a rubber septum {{over the top of}} the columns and sampling gas (20  mL) with a gas-tight syringe immediately after capping and 1  h later. Gas samples were injected into pre-evacuated 12  mL Exetainer ® vials (Labco, England) for future analysis. Headspace volumes for each column were measured independently.|$|R
40|$|In a {{recently}} developed, two-compartment liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial,</b> {{the evolution of}} UC 02 resulting from bacterial metabolism of uniformly la-beled d-glucose was measured sensitively, cumulatively, and automatically in a liquid-scintillation counter. In each of eight species tested, a period of log-linear expansion of cumulative counting rate with time was observed. The exponential increase in cumulative counting rate was related to cell replication time by the integral of a first-order differential equation. Within a given species, the replication time measured by radioassay {{was found to be}} remarkably constant, unaffected by a fourfold variation in the activity of added labeled d-glucose, insensitive to the presence of carrier dextrose, and independent of the number of bacteria in the initial inoculum over a range of five orders of magnitude. These experiments demonstrate that the replication rate of an organism in culture is a highly reproducible charac-teristic that is susceptible to precise radiometric measurement in funda-mental units of time under a variety of experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Epithermal {{neutron capture}} and {{transmission}} measurements were performed using the time-of-flight method at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute linac using metallic Nb samples. The capture measurements {{were made at}} the 25 -m flight station with a 16 -section sodium iodide multiplicity detector and the transmission measurements at the 25 -m flight station with a 6 Li <b>glass</b> <b>scintillation</b> detector. Resonance parameters were determined for all resonances up to 500 eV with a combined analysis of capture and transmission data using the multilevel R-matrix Bayesian code SAMMY. The results are compared to those presented in ENDF/B-VI, updated through Release 3. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of high rare-earth-containing borosilicate glass {{have been investigated}} to assess the potential for using this material to construct electromagnetic calorimeters for particle physics. We report here on measurements of scintillation yield, transmission and decay time, on large blocks of Ce 3 +-doped Gd 2 O 3 -based glasses, the samples were excited by a high energy X-ray beam and the associated scintillation yield and decay time were measured. The optical transmission of the samples was measured. It was observed that scintillation yield of present <b>scintillation</b> <b>glass</b> is 10 - 20 % of BGO scintillation yield, decay time is in range of 60 - 80 ns, glass density is 5. 40 g/cm 3. It was concluded that higher density and availability and low cost make this glass become promising candidate for cerium doped dense scintillator.

Particle size distribution was determined on a Beckman Coulter LS 230 particle size analyzer using the small-volume accessory (Miami, FL). A PIDS obscuration water optical model was employed. Particle size distribution was computed by the software using Mie scattering theory. Potency, homogeneity, chemical stability, and solid-state stability were performed following the same procedure listed previously.

40|$|International audienceProduction of 14 CO 2 {{from water}} samples amended with 14 C-labeled {{molecules}} allows {{estimation of the}} mineralization rates {{of a variety of}} organic compounds. Diverse protocols have been already proposed for 14 CO 2 extraction and trapping. Yet, efficiency of carbon dioxide recovery greatly varies and, despite the application of operators, data from duplicate samples are often divergent. In order to propose a standardized protocol and to avoid the main source of artifacts, we suggest keeping the trapping agent for 14 CO 2 directly into a 20 ml <b>scintillation</b> <b>vial</b> hanging in the degassing bottle. To validate this protocol, we plotted the radioactivity (disintegration per minute) due to 14 CO 2 recovered after acidification of 42 seawater samples supplemended with sodium (14 C) -bicarbonate (NaH 14 CO 3) against the actual radioactivity of the corresponding added bicarbonate solutions. Efficiency of this protocol results satisfactory; as for these 42 assays the percentage of recovery is equal to 99 % with a very low variability (± 1 %, p ¼ 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Recently, we {{developed}} a simple method to determine the activity of 109 Cd by means of liquid scintillation spectrometry using commercial counters. The method {{is based on a}} spectrum analysis that allows determining the emission rate of conversion electrons. The results are in good agreement with the outcomes of other methods. However, the relative standard uncertainty was found to be 0. 65 % and is influenced by the peak area determination. In this paper, the results of further studies of the technique are presented. The main idea of these studies is to improve the counting efficiency, and thus to optimize the energy resolution of measured spectra. The studies comprise comparisons of various liquid <b>scintillation</b> <b>vials,</b> e. g. <b>glass</b> vials, glass vials covered with adhesive tape, etched glass vials, sandblasted glass vials, and polyethylene (PE) vials. We also tested promising liquid scintillation cocktails and mixtures. The measurements were carried out with 2 commercial spectrometers: a Wallac 1414 GuardianTM and a PerkinElmer Tri-Carb ® 2800 TRTM. A considerable reduction in the relative uncertainty has been achieved...|$|R
