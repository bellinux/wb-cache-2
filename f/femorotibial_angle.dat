These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.The angle of inclination formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum. Additionally, a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle, the torsion angle, which makes it possible for flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|E

Significant correlations were also found by multiple regression analysis. The multiple correlation coefficient of body mass index and femorotibial lateral angle to the procollagen IIC-propeptide concentrations was 0. 547  (p< 0. 0001).  CONCLUSIONS—The findings suggest that synthesis of type II collagen by chondrocytes is enhanced by abnormal mechanical stress, in this case obesity and varus alignment. It is concluded that procollagen IIC-propeptide concentrations in joint fluid are a useful marker of early OA. ...|$|E

Here, we report the operative, clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes of 17 long intramedullary nail arthodeses in patients with infection. HypothesisClinical and functional outcomes after long intramedullary nailing {{are at least as}} good as those obtained using other implants. Materials and methodsWe retrospectively reevaluated 17 patients after unilateral two-stage knee arthrodesis with a long titanium intramedullary nail and autologous bone grafting. We evaluated satisfaction, leg length discrepancy, and function (Lequesne and WOMAC indices). Radiographs were obtained to assess fusion, time to fusion, and <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angles.</b> ResultsNo cases of material failure were recorded. One or more complications occurred in seven patients. Mean limb shortening was 27. 6 mm. Of the 17 patients, 15 were satisfied with the procedure. The mean Lequesne index was 10. 5 / 24 and the mean overall WOMAC score was 26 / 88. Fusion was achieved in 16 patients, with a mean time to fusion of 5 months. Mean <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angles</b> were 178. 6 ° of varus and 1. 9 ° of flexion. DiscussionThis simple and rapid surgical technique provides functional outcomes similar to those obtained using modular nails. The fusion rate is high. Nail extraction is simple and causes minimal damage, in contrast to modular nails. Increased attention to misalignment is needed. Level of evidenceLevel IV, retrospective study...|$|R

The objectives were {{to determine if}} Smart software had the same accuracy of component positioning and whether registration and operative time were reduced. Methods: A total of 220 patients were recruited and had a navigated total knee arthroplasty performed. With {{the exception of the}} software, all patients had the same perioperative care. At 6 -week follow-up with an independent arthroplasty service, all patients had a computerized tomography scan. This was assessed by an independent radiologist to measure the mechanical alignment of the components. Results: The mean postoperative mechanical <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angles</b> were equivalent between groups (mean difference − 0. 2 °, 95 % confidence interval − 0. 7 ° to 0. 3 °, P =. 407).

40|$|Background: Patellar {{abnormalities}} are {{a common}} cause of pain and lameness in dogs; however, in vivo the relative motion between the femur and patella in dogs is not well described. The objective {{of this study was}} to define normal in vivo sagittal plane patellofemoral kinematics in three axes of motion using non-invasive methods. We hypothesized patellofemoral alignment in the sagittal plane would tightly correlate with the <b>femorotibial</b> flexion <b>angle.</b> Six healthy dogs without orthopedic disease underwent computed tomography (CT) of their hind limbs to create 3 -D models of the patella and femur. Normal stifle joint motion was captured via flat-panel imaging while each dog performed a series of routine activities, including sitting, walking, and trotting. The 3 -D models of the patella and femur were digitally superimposed over the radiographic images with shape-matching software and the precise movement of the patella relative to the femur was calculated. Results: As the femorotibial joint flexed, the patellofemoral joint also flexed and the patella moved caudally and distally within the femoral trochlea during each activity. Patellar flexion and distal translation during walk and sit were linearly coupled with the <b>femorotibial</b> flexion <b>angle.</b> Offset was evident while trotting, where patella poses were significantly different between early and late swing phase (p[*]≤[*] 0. 003). Patellar flexion ranged from 51 to 6 ° while trotting. The largest flexion angle (92 °) occurred during sit. The patella traversed the entire proximodistal length of the femoral trochlea during these daily activities. Conclusions: Using single-plane flat-panel imaging, we demonstrated normal in vivo patellofemoral kinematics is tightly coupled with femorotibial kinematics; however, trot kinematic patterns did not follow the path defined by walking and stand-to-sit motions. Our normal data can be used in future studies to help define patellofemoral joint kinematics in dogs with stifle abnormalities...|$|R

40|$|Knee {{alignment}} is {{a fundamental}} measurement in the assessment, monitoring and surgical management of patients with osteoarthritis [OA]. In spite of extensive research into the consequences of malalignment, our understanding of static tibiofemoral alignment remains poor with discrepancies in the reported weight-bearing characteristics of the knee joint {{and there is a}} lack of data regarding the potential variation between supine and standing (functional) conditions. In total knee arthroplasty [TKA] the lower limb alignment is usually measured in a supine condition and decisions on prosthesis placement made on this. An improved understanding of the relationship between supine and weight-bearing conditions may lead to a reassessment of current surgical goals. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between supine and standing lower limb alignment in asymptomatic, osteoarthritic and prosthetic knees. Our hypothesis was that the change in alignment of these three groups would be different. A non-invasive infrared position capture system (accuracy ± 1 ° in both coronal and sagittal plane) was used to assess the knee alignment for 30 asymptomatic controls and 31 patients with OA, both before and after TKA. Coronal and sagittal mechanical <b>femorotibial</b> (MFT) <b>angles</b> in extension (negative values indicating varus in the coronal plane and hyperextension in the sagittal plane) were measured with each subject supine and in bi-pedal stance. For the supine test, the lower limb was supported at the heel and the subject told to relax. For the standing position subjects were asked to assume their normal stance. The change in alignment between these two conditions was analysed using a paired t-test for both coronal and sagittal planes. To quantify the change in 3 D, vector plots of ankle centre displacement relative to the knee centre from the supine to standing condition were produced. Alignment in both planes changed significantly from supine to standing for all three groups. For the coronal plane the supine and standing measurements (in degrees, mean(SD)) were 0. 1 (2. 5) and − 1. 1 (3. 7) in the asymptomatic group, − 2. 5 (5. 7) and − 3. 6 (6) in the OA group and − 0. 7 (1. 4) and − 2. 5 (2) in the TKA group. For the sagittal plane the numbers were − 1. 7 (3. 3) and − 5. 5 (4. 9); 7. 7 (7. 1) and 1. 8 (7. 7); 6. 8 (5. 1) and 1. 4 ((7. 6) respectively. This change was most frequently towards relative varus and extension. Vector plots showed that the trend of relative varus and extension in stance was similar in overall magnitude and direction between the three groups. Knee alignment can change from supine to standing for asymptomatic and osteoarthritic knees, most frequently towards relative varus and hyperextension. The similarities between each group did not support our hypothesis. The consistent kinematic pattern for different knee types suggests that soft tissue restraints rather than underlying joint deformity may be more influential in dynamic control of alignment from lying to standing. In spite of some evidence suggesting a difference between supine and standing knee alignment a mechanical <b>femorotibial</b> (MFT) <b>angle</b> of 0 ° is a common intra-operative target as well as the desired post-operative weight-bearing alignment. These results indicated that arthroplasties positioned in varus intra-operatively could potentially become ‘outliers’ (> 3 ° varus) when measured weight-bearing. Mild flexion contractures may correct when standing, reducing the need for intra-operative posterior release. These potential changes should be considered when positioning TKA components on supine limbs as post-operative functional alignment may be different...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of coronal knee laxity via manual {{stress testing}} is {{commonly}} performed during joint examination. While {{it is generally}} accepted that the knee should be flexed slightly to assess its collateral restraints, {{the importance of the}} exact degree of flexion at time of testing has not been documented. The aim of this study therefore was to assess the effect of differing degrees of knee flexion on the magnitude of coronal deflection observed during collateral stress testing. Using non-invasive infrared technology, the real-time coronal and sagittal mechanical <b>femorotibial</b> (MFT) <b>angles</b> of three asymptomatic volunteers were measured. A single examiner, blinded to the real-time display of coronal but not sagittal alignment, held the knee in maximum extension and performed manual varus and valgus stress manoeuvres to a perceived end-point. This sequence was repeated at 5 ° increments up to 30 ° of flexion. This provided unstressed, varus and valgus coronal alignment measurements as well as overall envelope of laxity (valgus angle – varus angle) which were subsequently regressed against knee flexion. Regression analysis indicated that all regression coefficients were significantly different to zero (p < 0. 001). With increasing knee flexion, valgus MFT angles became more valgus and varus MFT angles became more. The overall laxity of the knee in the coronal plane increased approximately fourfold with 30 ° of knee flexion. The results demonstrated that small changes in knee flexion could result in significant changes in coronal knee laxity, an observation which has important clinical relevance and applications. For example the assessment of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries can be based on the perceived amount of joint opening with no reference made to knee flexion at time of assessment. Therefore, close attention should be paid to the flexion angle of the knee during stress testing in order to achieve a reliable and reproducible assessment...|$|R
40|$|Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is {{the most}} widely performed intervention for endstage osteoarthritis (OA) {{but in spite of}} limitations in surgical techniques, alignment measurements and clinical outcomes, the expectations of an active, aging population continue to increase. The aim of this thesis was to develop and validate a noninvasive kinematic assessment tool to improve the measurement of knee alignment and ligament laxity. An intra-operative infrared tracking system was adapted for non-invasive use through the development of external mountings that enabled alignment measurements to be made supine, standing and following manual collateral stress. Coronal and sagittal plane mechanical <b>femorotibial</b> (MFT) <b>angle</b> measurement was validated to a precision of approximately ± 1 ° by comparison to a custom made leg model, a flexible electrogoniometer and through repeatability measurements on 30 asymptomatic volunteers. Assessment of coronal laxity was quantified and standardised by controlling lever arm, applied manual load and knee flexion angle. Thirty one patients with end-stage OA were assessed before, during and six weeks following TKA and comparisons were made between invasive and non-invasive MFT angles and between supine and standing conditions. For osteoarthritic knees, varus and valgus angular displacements were greater intraoperatively in comparison to pre-operative non-invasive measurements, whereas invasive and non-invasive stress angles for prosthetic knees showed less variation. From supine to bi-pedal stance, MFT angles most frequently changed to relative varus and extension for all knee types suggesting that soft tissue restraints may be more important than rigid bony or prosthetic architecture for controlling this weightbearing alignment change. The development of a non-invasive infrared (IR) system enabled knee alignment to be quantified as a dynamic parameter in comparison to current static assessment techniques such as radiographs. The generation of subject-specific kinematic profiles could help with the surgical planning and post-operative follow-up of patients undergoing alignment dependent procedures such as TKA.

40|$|Aim: Outcome {{of primary}} total {{arthroplasty}} for osteoarthritis {{of the knee}} with valgus deformity. Materials and methods: Between 2005 and 2007, 28 primary total knee replacements were performed for osteoarthritis of the knee with valgus deformity. 21 cases were women and 7 men {{with a mean age}} of 66. 6 years (extremes 54 - 81). The clinical and radiological evaluations were done considering the knee range of motion, Knee Society Score (KSS) and <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> measured on the frontal standing long leg X-rays. Preoperatively, the knee valgus deformity angle was 6 to 15 degrees in 14 cases, 15 to 25 degrees in 10 cases and over 25 degrees in 4 cases. Results: After a mean follow-up time of 14 months (extremes 7 - 29), the knee range of motion improved from a mean of 71 degrees (extremes 52 - 87) preoperatively to a mean of 95 degrees (extremes 78 - 110) postoperatively. The KSS value improved from 21. 3 points (extremes 1 - 33) preoperatively to 80. 7 points (extremes 70 - 92) postoperatively and the frontal <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> from a mean value of 21 degrees (extremes 11 - 39) of valgus before surgery, to a mean of 9 degrees (extremes 0 - 12) of valgus after surgery. Conclusions: Long leg AP view X-ray examination in standing position is mandatory. The standard medial parapatellar approach is appropriate in this type of arthroplasty even if significant knee valgus deviations are present because it avoids the lateral approach complications. Postoperatively, one can get an aligned and stable knee if a judicious and progressive periarticular soft tissues balancing is achieved, in both flexion and extension position...|$|E

We enrolled 123 patients with medial knee osteoarthritis (OA) who had undergone unilateral minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty for the first time. The following factors were assessed preoperatively: the maximum isometric muscle strength of the knee extensors and flexors, maximum knee and hip joint angle, pain, 5 -m maximum walking speed, sex, age, body mass index, exercise habits, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle,</b> failure side (bilateral or unilateral knee OA), and functional independence measure. We re-evaluated physical function (i. e., muscle strength, joint angle, and pain) and motor function (5 -m maximum walking speed) 14 days postoperatively. Changes in physical function, motor function (5 -m maximum walking speed), and number of days to independent walking were used as explanatory variables. The postoperative duration of hospitalization (in days) was used as the dependent variable in multivariate analyses. These analyses were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, exercise habits, Kellgren-Lawrence grade, <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle,</b> failure side, and functional independence measure. The duration of hospitalization was significantly affected by the number of days to independent walking (p < 0. 001, β = 0. 507) and a change in the 5 -m maximum walking speed (p = 0. 016, β = - 0. 262). Multiple regression analysis showed that the radiographic knee grade (p = 0. 029, β = 0. 239) was a significant confounding factor.

Coronal and sagittal mechanical <b>femorotibial</b> (MFT) <b>angles</b> in extension (negative values varus/hyperextension) were measured supine and in bi-pedal stance and changes analysed using a paired t-test. To quantify this change in 3 D, vector plots of ankle centre displacement relative to the knee centre were produced. Alignment in both planes changed significantly from supine to standing for all three groups, most frequently towards relative varus and extension. In the coronal plane, the mean±SD(°) of the supine/standing MFT angles was 0. 1 ± 2. 5 /− 1. 1 ± 3. 7 for asymptomatic (p= 0. 001), − 2. 5 ± 5. 7 /− 3. 6 ± 6. 0 for osteoarthritic (p= 0. 009) and − 0. 7 ± 1. 4 / − 2. 5 ± 2. 0 for prosthetic knees (p< 0. 001). In the sagittal plane, the mean±SD(°) of the supine/standing MFT angles was − 1. 7 ± 3. 3 /− 5. 5 ± 4. 9 for asymptomatic (p< 0. 001), 7. 7 ± 7. 1 / 1. 8 ± 7. 7 for osteoarthritic (p< 0. 001) and 6. 8 ± 5. 1 / 1. 4 ± 7. 6 for prosthetic knees (p< 0. 001). The vector plots showed that the trend of relative varus and extension in stance was similar in overall magnitude and direction between the groups. The similarities between each group did not support our hypothesis. The consistent kinematic pattern for different knee types suggests that soft tissue restraints rather than underlying joint deformity may be more influential in dynamic control of alignment from lying to standing. This potential change should be considered when positioning TKA components on supine limbs as post-operative functional alignment may be different...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: When {{assessing}} knee ligament injuries, clinicians {{consider the}} side-to-side difference in knee rotational-laxity {{to be an}} essential information. Although, normally, this difference is assessed through a qualitative physical examination, arthrometers are available that allow a quantitative and standardized assessmentby imposing a preset torque and by measuring the consequent femorotibial rotation. This rotation measurement is affected by uncertainties due to soft tissue deformation and to lack of control of the subject posture and muscle contraction level. Since measurements on right (R) and left (L) knees are carried out in separate tests, relevant results can be affected by different uncertainties that reflect on an inaccurate assessment of side-to-side differences. The aim {{of the present study}} was to overcome this limitation by designing and validating a non-invasive bilateral rotational kneearthrometer (BiRKA) that allows the simultaneous assessment of both knees while the subject assumes a symmetrical, controllable, and reproducible posture and minimizes soft tissue artifacts. Materials and methods: The BiRKA consists of ametal frame on which a compound pulley is mounted. A torque, the magnitude of which can be adjusted through a dynamometric lever, is applied to a central pulley and equally transferred to two pulleys the axes of which are aligned with the longitudinal axes of the subject’s tibias. The latter pulleys, which can rotate independently, are connected to the subject shanks through two modified Aircast boots which minimize ankle movement and soft tissue artifacts. The rotation of each pulley [ [...] . ] is measured by means of an electronic goniometer and an estimate of the difference [ [...] . ] between the R and L knee rotation is made available. The device allows the generation of both internal and external torques with the patient in either supine or prone position with different knee joint flexion angles. For validation purposes, measurements were carried out with the subject prone on a table with the knees flexed at 30 ◦. Belts were used to fasten the subject to the table. Accuracy assessment – Two subjects, with no apparent deficit at their knees, underwent simultaneous computed tomography scanning (CT) and BiRKA assessment. The CT scan provided benchmark values of knee rotation and the difference between these values and those provided by the BiRKA was assumed to be an estimate of the inaccuracy of the latter device. Two loading conditions were tested (external torque = 0 and 10 Nm). Repeatability assessment – Three subjects were assessed by the same operator three times in three different days (external torque = 10 Nm). Results: Accuracy – <b>Femorotibial</b> rotation <b>angles</b> were consistently overestimated by the BiRKA and, within each subject, R and L errors were comparable. The [ [...] . ] values measured using the CT scans and the BiRKA differed by 1. 1 ° for S 1 and 3 ° for S 2. Repeatability – The mean absolute deviation of was [ [...] . ] 1. 3 °, 0. 3 °, 1. 1 ° for the three subjects, respectively. Discussion : A non invasive device able to measure the sideto-side difference in knee rotational-laxity has been presented. Preliminary results have shown accuracy and repeatability levels that are adequate to reveal the presence and severity of knee lesions. Due to the presence of soft tissue deformation and undesired movement of adjacent joints, the actual femorotibial rotations were overestimated by the device. However, the inaccuracies that affected R and L knee rotations were similar and cancelled each other thus allowing for a reliable side-to-side difference evaluation. </br...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} and radiologic features of radial tears of the medial meniscus posterior horn {{were compared with}} those of horizontal tears. Methods: From January 2007 to December 2008, 387 consecutive cases of medial meniscal tears were treated arthroscopically. Among these, 91 were radial tears in the medial meniscus posterior horn, and 95 were horizontal tears in the posterior segment of the medial meniscus. The patients ’ data (age, gender, duration of symptom, body mass index, and injury history), radiographic findings (Kellgren and Lawrence score, posterior tibial slope, and <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle),</b> and chondral lesions were recorded. Results: The patient factors of age, gender, and body mass index were related to radial tears of the medial meniscus posterior horn. Radial tears were significantly correlated with Kellgren and Lawrence score, varus alignment, posterior tibial slope, and severity of the chondral lesion. Conclusions: Radial tears of the medial meniscus posterior horn are a unique clinical entity that are associated with older age, females and obesity, and are strongly associated with an increased incidence and severity of cartilage degeneration compared to horizontal tears...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of medial-wedge insoles in valgus knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Thirty consecutive women with valgus-deformity knee OA a: 8 degrees were randomized into 2 groups: medial insole (insoles with B-mm medial elevation at the rearfoot [n = 161) and neutral insole (similar insole without elevation [n = 14]). Both groups also wore ankle supports. A blinded examiner assessed pain on movement, at rest, and at night with a visual analog scale (VAS), the Lequesne index., and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index. Femorotibial, talocalcaneal, and talar tilt angles were evaluated at baseline and after 8 weeks of insole use. Results. Significant reductions in the medial insole group were observed for pain on movement (mean +/- SD VAS pre- and postintervention 8. 1 +/- 1. 5 versus 1 4. 2 +/- 2. 4; P = 0. 001), at rest (5. 1 +/- 2. 3 versus 2. 7 +/- 2. 4; P = 0. 002), and at night (6. 1 +/- 2. 7 versus 3. 1 +/- 2. 1; P = 0. 001). In addition, a decrease in Lequesne (14. 7 +/- 3. 4 versus 9. 6 +/- 3. 8; P = 0. 001) and WOMAC scores (74. 1 +/- 14. 2 versus 56. 1 +/- 14. 9; P = 0. 001) was observed for the medial insole group. In the neutral insole group, a significant reduction was observed only for night pain (mean SD VAS pre- and postintervention 5. 8 +/- 2. 4 versus 4. 6 +/- 2. 4; P = 0. 019). An increase in <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> (169. 0 +/- 3. 4 versus 170. 8 +/- 2. 4; P = 0. 019). An increase in <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> (169. 0 +/- 3. 4 versus 170. 8 +/- 3. 7; P = 0. 001) occurred only in the medial 3. 7; P = 0. 001) occurred only in the medial insole group. Moreover, the difference in measured fernorotibial angles pre- and postintervention was 1. 84 +/- 1. 42 versus - 0. 18 +/- 0. 67 (P < 0. 001) for the medial and neutral insole groups. Conclusion.

40|$|Background: This study {{evaluated}} the preoperative distractive stress radiographs {{in order to}} quantify and predict the extent of medial release according {{to the degree of}} varus deformity in primary total knee arthroplasty. Methods: We evaluated 120 varus, osteoarthritic knee joints (75 patients). The association of the angle on the distractive stress radiograph with extent of medial release was analyzed. The extent of medial release was classifi ed into the following 4 groups according to the stage: release of the deep medial collateral ligament (group 1), release of the posterior oblique ligament and/ or semimembranous tendon (group 2), release of the posterior capsule (group 3) and release of the superfi cial medial collateral ligament (group 4). Results: The mean <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> on the preoperative distractive stress radiograph was valgus 2. 4 ° (group 1), valgus 0. 8 ° (group 2), varus 2. 1 ° (group 3) and varus 2. 7 ° (group 4). The extent of medial release increased with increasing degree of varus deformity seen on the preoperative distractive stress radiograph.

40|$|We have {{observed}} {{the natural history}} withouttreatment of 46 limbs in 29 patients with infantile tibia vara and a metaphyseal-diaphyseal angle (MDA) of more than 11 °. The <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> (FTA) and MDA were measured, and Langenskiöld’s classification of radiological changes in the proximal medial metaphysis of the tibia was used. In 22 limbs which were not in Langenskiöld stages II to III the condition resolved spontaneously without treatment. Of the remaining 24 which were in stages II to III, in 18 it resolved spontaneously {{by the age of}} six years, but six showed little or no improvement at the latest follow-up. It was impossible to differentiate by measuring the FTA or MDA whether spontaneous resolution could be expected before the age of four years. There was no difference in the rate of resolution of the deformity between those patients who had been treated by a brace and those who had received no treatment. We advise no initial treatment but review at six-monthly intervals until the age of four years, even in patients with Langenskiöld stage-II to stage-III deformity. When a deformity persisted or progressed we carried out a corrective osteotomy after the age of four years...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To mid-term {{evaluate}} {{patients who}} were submitted to total knee arthroplasty without patellar resurfacing. METHODS: It was realized a retrospective cross-sectional study of {{patients who were}} submitted to total knee arthroplasty without patellar resurfacing. In all patients clinical examination was done based on the protocol of the Knee Society Scoring System, which assessed pain, range of motion, stability, contraction, knee alignment and function, and radiological evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were evaluated. Of these, 07 were operated only on left knee, 12 only on right knee and 17 were operated bilaterally, totaling 53 knees. Ages ranged from 26 to 84 years. Of the 53 knees evaluated, 33 (62. 26 %) had no pain. The maximum flexion range of motion averaged 104. 7 &# 176;. No knee had difficulty in active extension.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{etiological}} factors of knee osteoarthritis {{and to provide}} the anatomical basis of corrective therapy for knee joint deformity by comparing the biomechanical differences of the knee joints between the osteoarthritis patients and the normal people. Methods: The sexes, ages, heights, weights, painful characters and accompanied symptoms were recorded, and the femoral angle, tibial angle, <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle,</b> joint space angle, and {{the height and width}} of condylus medialis and lateralis were measured for 29 selected knee osteoarthritis patients. And the biomechanical data of the patients were compared with those of the 19 normal people. Results: The femoral angle of the osteoarthritis patients was smaller and the joint space angle was greater statistically than that of the normal people, and the ratios of height and width of condylus medialis and condylus lateralis of the osteoarthritis patients were greater than those of the normal people. Conclusion: In the patients, the gravity line of the lower limb inclines to the condylus medialis, so the condylus medialis is more vulnerable. And the configuration of the condylus of the patients, which is narrower and longer, is {{different from that of the}} normal people.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{compared}} {{the results of}} rotating-platform high-flexion (RP-F) total knee arthroplasty with low contact stress (LCS) for clinical and radiographical assessment after a short-term period. Materials and Methods: 68 total knee arthroplasties using a RP-F and LCS system were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty-five of the 68 were osteoarthritic knees and were followed-up for more than 2 years. The clinical evaluation included range of motion (ROM), Knee Society Knee Score and Function Score (KSKS and KSFS), tailor position and kneeling. The radiographic evaluation included <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle,</b> position of implants, radiolucent line and position of patella. Results: The postoperative ROM, KSKS, and KSFS improved statistically in both implants. Comparing RP-F with LCS there were statistically no differences in ROM (p= 0. 863), KSKS (p= 0. 835), KSFS (p= 0. 535) and tailor position (p= 0. 489). There were no significant radiographic differences. Conclusions: Total knee arthroplasty with RP-F and LCS showed similar clinical and radiographic results; it also showed excellent and predictable results at the short-term follow up. However, in RP-F there was 1 case of early osteolysis, 1 case of patella clunk syndrome and 1 case of painful patella crepitus; therefore, further case studies and follow-up are needed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the compensatory correlation between knee and hindfoot in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This cross-sectional study included 218 patients (407 lower extremities). Radiographs of the hindfoot and full-length posteroanterior hip-to-calcaneus standing radiographs were evaluated. The destruction of the hindfoot was evaluated using the Larsen grading system. The coronal angular deformity of the knee and hindfoot was evaluated by the <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> (FTA) and the angle between the tibial shaft and the entire hindfoot (tibiohindfoot angle, THFA). The correlation between FTA and THFA was determined by Pearson’s coefficient. For all patients, FTA correlated to THFA (R = 0. 28, p< 0. 001). The correlation was observed as long as the talocrural joint was preserved (Larsen grade ≤ 2), even if the subtalar joint had been destroyed (Larsen grade ≥ 3). However, the correlation was not observed when the talocrural joint was destroyed (Larsen grade ≥ 3, R = − 0. 02, p= 0. 94). The pain in the hindfoot did not correlate with FTA or THFA. In conclusion, a compensatory deformity of the hindfoot against the deformity of the knee was observed in RA, and the correlation was lost when talocrural joint was destroyed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveRecent {{studies using}} various {{standardized}} radiographic acquisition techniques {{have demonstrated the}} necessity of reproducible radioanatomic alignment of the knee to assure precise measurements of medial tibiofemoral joint space width (JSW). The objective {{of the present study}} was to characterize the longitudinal performance of several acquisition techniques with respect to long-term reproducibility of positioning of the knee, and the impact of changes in positioning on the rate and variability of joint space narrowing (JSN). MethodsEighty subjects were randomly selected from each of three cohorts followed in recent studies of the radiographic progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA) : the Health ABC study (paired fixed-flexion [FF] radiographs taken at a 36 -month interval); the Glucosamine Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) (paired metatarsophalangeal [MTP] radiographs obtained at a 12 -month interval), and a randomized clinical trial of doxycycline (fluoroscopically assisted semiflexed anteroposterior (AP) radiographs taken at a 16 -month interval). Manual measurements were obtained from each radiograph to represent markers of radioanatomic positioning of the knee (alignment of the medial tibial plateau and X-ray beam, knee rotation, <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle)</b> and to evaluate minimum JSW (mJSW) in the medial tibiofemoral compartment. The effects on the mean annualized rate of JSN and on the variability of that rate of highly reproduced vs variable positioning of the knee in serial radiographs were evaluated. ResultsParallel or near-parallel alignment was achieved significantly more frequently with the fluoroscopically guided positioning used in the semiflexed AP protocol than with either the non-fluoroscopic FF or MTP protocol (68 % vs 14 % for both FF and MTP protocols when measured at the midpoint of the medial compartment; 75 % vs 26 % and 34 % for the FF and MTP protocols, respectively, when measured at the site of mJSW; P< 0. 001 for each). Knee rotation was reproduced more frequently in semiflexed AP radiographs than in FF radiographs (66 % vs 45 %, P< 0. 01). In contrast, the FF technique yielded a greater proportion of paired radiographs in which the <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> was accurately reproduced than the semiflexed AP or MTP protocol (78 % vs 59 % and 56 %, respectively, P< 0. 01 for each). Notably, only paired radiographs with parallel or near-parallel alignment exhibited a mean rate of JSN (±SD) in the OA knee that was more rapid and less variable than that measured in all knees (0. 186 ± 0. 274 mm/year, standardized response to mean [SRM]= 0. 68 vs 0. 128 ± 0. 291 mm/year, SRM= 0. 44). ConclusionThis study confirms the importance of parallel radioanatomic alignment of the anterior and posterior margins of the medial tibial plateau in detecting JSN in subjects with knee OA. The use of radiographic methods that assure parallel alignment during serial X-ray examinations will permit the design of more efficient studies of biomarkers of OA progression and of structure modification in knee OA...|$|E
40|$|Between 1975 and 1986, cementless total knee {{replacement}} (Okayama University Mark-II or KC- 1) {{was performed}} on 38 osteoarthritic knees of 30 patients over 65 years old. Five patients died of unrelated causes from 3 to 6 years after the surgery. A follow up study was carried out for over 3 years in 27 knees of 20 patients. The mean length of follow-up was 69 months, ranging from 36 to 116 months. The average clinical knee score by three university knee score system was 37. 1 points preoperatively and improved up to 77. 6 points at the follow up. Pain relief was clinically excellent and correction of the deformity was also sufficient. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were also made in correlation with osteoporosis of the knee. According to Foltin's classification of osteoporosis of the knee, operated knees were grouped into five grades (IV), and about 80 {{percent of the patients}} had osteoporosis of more than grade III. Radiographically, loosening or migration was observed in 5 knees (19 %) in this series, and all of the patients had severe osteoporosis. In other patients with osteoporosis, the clinical knee score improved similarly, but in about half of them there was some change in the <b>femorotibial</b> <b>angle</b> or medial or posterior angle of the tibial component.
