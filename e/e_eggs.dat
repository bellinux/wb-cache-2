40|$|Successfully {{enforced}} marine {{protected areas}} (MPAs) {{have been widely}} demonstrated to allow, within their boundaries, the recovery of exploited species and beyond their boundaries, the spillover of juvenile and adult fish. Little evidence is available about the so-called ‘recruitment subsidy’, the augmented production of propagules (i. <b>e.</b> <b>eggs</b> and larvae) due to the increased abundance of large-sized spawners hosted within effective MPAs. Once emitted, propagules can be locally retained and/or exported elsewhere. Patterns of propagule retention and/or export from MPAs have been little investigated, especially in the Mediterranean. This study investigated the potential for propagule production and retention/export from a Mediterranean MPA (Torre Guaceto, SW Adriatic Sea) using the white sea bream, Diplodus sargus sargus, as a model species.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the marine}} context, {{information}} about dispersal {{is essential for}} the design of networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). Generally, most of the dispersal of demersal fishes is thought to be driven by the transport of eggs and larvae in currents, with the potential contribution of dispersal in later life stages relatively minimal. Using otolith chemistry analyses, we estimate dispersal patterns across a spatial scale of approximately 180 km at both propagule (i. <b>e.</b> <b>eggs</b> and larvae) and juvenile (i. e. between settlement and recruitment) stages of a Mediterranean coastal fishery species, the two-banded seabream Diplodus vulgaris. We detected three major natal sources of propagules replenishing local populations in the entire study area, suggesting that propagule dispersal distance extends to at least 90 km. For the juvenile stage, we detected dispersal of up to 165 km. Our work highlights the surprising and significant role of dispersal during the juvenile life stages as an important mechanism connecting populations. Such new insights are crucial for creating effective management strategies (e. g. MPAs and MPA networks) and to gain support from policymakers and stakeholders, highlighting that MPA benefits can extend well beyond MPA borders, and not only via dispersal of eggs and larvae, but also through movement by juveniles...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A dietary calcium {{level of}} 1. 75 percent {{supplied}} as ground limestone was inadequate for individually caged medium weight turkeys from a line selected for increased egg production. Egg production was reduced {{but there was}} no significant effect on shell quality or hatchability of fertile eggs. This dietary calcium level was adequate for two large bodied strains. Replacement of two-thirds of the ground limestone in the 1. 75 percent calcium diet by hen-sized oyster shell alleviated the effect of this diet on egg production even though the amount of calcium consumed per egg was less than when all of the supplemented calcium was in the form of ground limestone. In a diet containing 2. 25 percent calcium, there was no effect of replacing two-thirds of the limestone with hen-sized oyster shell. The frequency of normal-shelled eggs decreased and the frequency of weak-shelled and "slab-sided " eggs (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>eggs</b> with a flattened side) increased as the laying season progressed for all dietary treatments.
