40|$|With the {{objective}} of choosing a practical and valid method to delimit <b>health</b> <b>service</b> areas of regional <b>health</b> <b>service</b> centres to build a regional basic <b>health</b> <b>service</b> network, we first drew lessons from traditional geographic methods of delimiting trade areas and then applied two methods to delimit <b>health</b> <b>service</b> areas, i. e. the proximal method and the gravity method.

Calculation of the similarity indices shows that <b>health</b> <b>service</b> areas delimited by the proximal method has an 87. 3 % similarity to the real <b>health</b> <b>service</b> area, while the gravity method gives 88. 6 %. Our conclusion is that both methods are suitable for delimiting <b>health</b> <b>service</b> areas at regional <b>health</b> <b>service</b> centres, but find that the proximal method is more practicable in operational terms for delimiting <b>health</b> <b>service</b> areas in region health planning...|$|R
