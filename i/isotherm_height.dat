40|$|Tropical and {{equatorial}} region exhibits significantly higher rainfall rate {{with regard to}} temperate region leading to extreme attenuation for satellite communication links. One relevant issue for radiowave propagation modeling in this particular region is the different structures of precipitation which {{play an important role}} in estimating rain fade. To this aim, an investigation of the rain characteristics of 0 °C <b>isotherm</b> <b>height</b> in Malaysia derived from the precipitation radar on-board the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite has been carried out. In fact, TRMM satellite precipitation radar appears as one of the powerful source of instrument in meteorology and telecommunication in estimating height of rainfall in tropical/{{equatorial region}}. In this work, one year of TRMM radar data have been analyzed from the stratiform rain event which there usually exists a well defined melting layer (or bright band). These results are then compared with the radiosonde measurement and ground meteorological radar obtained from earlier publication, together with the mean 0 °C <b>isotherm</b> <b>height</b> given in the ITU-R Recommendation P. 839. Comparisons show that the freezing heights typically occurred at the height higher than 4. 5 km as recommended by ITU-R Recommendation P. 839. The preliminary results suggest that by carefully consider the physical information of rain height derived from the various local databases should lead to substantial improvements in the rain attenuation prediction accuracy for equatorial and tropical region...|$|E
40|$|Attenuation due to rain is {{a primary}} cause of {{communication}} impairment on satellite-earth paths, especially above 10 GHz. Rainfall is a serious source of attenuation at such a frequency. This paper presents the characteristics of rain distribution in USM based on measured one minute rain rate. For attenuation of rain, predictions models like ITU and VIHT (Variable <b>Isotherm</b> <b>Height</b> Technique) model were used to estimate the effect of rain on Ku band signals. Data of rain attenuation and rainfall rates collected at USM are estimated and compared with the predicted models. The ITU model followed closely to the measured rainfall rate and attenuation data whereas the VIHT models overestimated the measured rainfall rate and attenuation data...|$|E
40|$|Radar {{measurements}} of rainfall at different climatological conditions {{have been taken}} into account emphasizing rain rate and associated radar reflectivity. It is observed from the analysis that thereflectivity measurement is being consistent at high rain intensities. From the knowledge of radar reflectivity, the rain drop size distribution is examined. The most probable drop size diameter and rain rate have been calculated wherefrom {{it appears that the}} most probable rain drop size vary exponentially with radar reflectivity and also with rain rate. The theoretical model implemented by using the measured rain drop sizes over the tropical sites also show similar kind of variation. For estimating rain attenuation two important parameters, viz., the point rainfall rates and the vertical and horizontal structures of rain have been considered. The elevation angle we have chosen is ~ 560 as most of the stations in India havethat value of elevation angle with geostationary satellite. Taking the frequencies 11 to 14 GHz separately and 00 C <b>isotherm</b> <b>height</b> as 5. 0 km, the effective rain height values are determined. The attenuation of radio waves due to rain are calculated for different rain rates assigning different γ-values. The attenuation is found to vary significantly with the γ-values. Also the attenuation curves are closer when the γ-values are of low order. An increase in attenuation with the γ-values is found to be more prominent for higher rain rates...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} polarimetric X-band radar-based quantitative precipitation estimations (QPE) {{under conditions of}} low freezing levels when, even at the lowest possible elevation angles, radar resolution volumes at longer ranges are in melting-layer or snow regions while it rains at the ground. A specifically adjusted vertical-profile-of-reflectivity (VPR) approach is introduced. The mean VPR is constructed based on the range–height indicator scans, {{and the effects of}} smoothing of brightband (BB) features with range are accounted for. A principal feature of the suggested QPE approach is the determination of the reflec-tivity BB boundaries and freezing-level heights on a beam-by-beam basis using the copolar correlation coefficient hv, which is routinely available from the X-band radar measurements. It is shown that this coefficient provides a robust discrimination among the regions of rain, melting hydrometeors, and snow. The freezing-level estimates made using hv were within 100 – 200 m from the corresponding estimates of the 0 ° <b>isotherm</b> <b>heights</b> from radiosonde soundings. The suggested VPR approach with the polarimetric deter-mination of the reflectivity BB boundaries was used for QPE during the wintertime deployment of the NOAA X-band radar as part of the 2006 Hydrometeorological Test Bed (HMT- 06) field experiment in the California Sierra Nevada foothills. It is shown that this approach noticeably improves radar-rainfall accu...|$|R

Arid and semi-arid or subhumid zones are characterized by temperature variations, low and erratic rainfall, periodic droughts and different associations of vegetative cover and soils. This article looks at current dry lands and general guidelines for finding the best area for dry land farming. Primary map of current dry lands were provided by using TM visual images from 2002 and subject maps (plant distribution maps, topography maps…). The maps were corrected by GPS {{and according to the}} dry lands. Other information such as rainfalls, <b>isotherms,</b> <b>height</b> profiles, slopes, soil depth, soil erosion and soil salinity were evaluated. The layers were classified due to Methods of Sizes et al (1991) then the dry land area were defined three layers of optimum, average and poor performance. The map showed that the farm areas is 513886. 7 ha equal to 18. 2 % of the total dry lands in Northern Khorasan. The results showed that the studied area were used for dry land farming with suitable slope 164525. 7 ha (22. 05 %), suitable soil, depth and texture 14295. 91 ha (27. 83 %), optimum height layer (less than 1700 m) 411339. 91 ha, with average temperature 454281. 99 ha (88. 2 %) and no salinity limitation 350573. 79 ha (68. 25). Successful dry land farming is not possible in 86. 1 % of dry lands in north Khorasan with sharp slope, low soil depth, unsuitable soil texture and soil erosion...|$|R
40|$|Cloud cover {{statistics}} and their diurnal variation {{have been obtained}} from in situ and satellite measurements for three equatorial locations. Cloud liquid water content, 0 °C <b>isotherm</b> <b>height</b> and cloud attenuation have also been obtained from radiosonde measurement using the so-called Salonen model at Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). The results show a strong seasonal variation of cloud cover and cloud liquid water content on the two monsoon seasons. The Liquid Water Content (LWC) obtained from radiosonde and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) is higher during the Northeast Monsoon season, which corresponds to the period of higher percentage cloud cover and high rainfall accumulation. The International Telecommunication Union—Region (ITU-R) model underestimates the cumulative distribution of LWC values at the present station. The relationship of the cloud attenuation, derived from the profiles of liquid water density and temperature within the cloud, shows an underestimate by the data obtained from the ITU-R model. The cloud attenuation at Kuala Lumpur is somewhat underestimated by the ITU-R model up to about 1. 2 dB at Ka (30 GHz) and 3. 4 dB at V (50 GHz) bands. The results of the specific attenuation {{can be used for}} the estimation of cloud attenuation at microwave and millimetre wave over earth-space paths. The present data are important for planning and design of satellite communications at Ka and V bands on the Earth–space path in the equatorial region...|$|E
40|$|Normal 0 false false false EN-GB X-NONE X-NONE Cloud cover statistics, {{cloud base}} and top height, cloud temperature, {{frequency}} of precipitation, freezing height, total cloud {{liquid water content}} (TCLWC) and cloud attenuation data have been obtained for the six major climatic zones of Africa. The present results reveal a strong positive correlation between the monthly distribution of low cloud cover, cloud top height, cloud temperature, and frequency of precipitation in the six zones. The cumulative distribution of the TCLWC derived from radiosonde measurement in each climatic zone shows {{a departure from the}} TCLWC recommended by the ITU Study Group 3 data, with an exceedance percentage difference of 32 % to 90 % occurring 0. 01 % to 10 % of the time. The underestimation of the TCLWC is greatest in the tropical rain forest. A comparison of the cloud attenuation cumulative distribution in the Ka and V bands reveals that the International Telecommunication Union – Region (ITU-R) is an intergovernmental organization that develops rain model based on collected data around the world. This model underestimates the cloud attenuation in all of the six climatic zones by 2. 0 dB and 4. 7 dB for the arid Sahara desert, 1. 3 dB and 3. 0 dB in semi-arid North Africa, 1. 3 dB and 1. 5 dB in savannah North Africa, 2. 0 dB and 3. 6 dB in the tropical rain forest, 1. 3 dB and 2. 9 dB in savannah South Africa and 0. 9 dB and 2. 6 dB in semi-arid South Africa, respectively, at 30 and 50 GHz. Overall, the cloud attenuation in the tropical rain-forest zone is very high because of the high annual total cloud cover (98 %), high annual frequency of precipitation (4. 5), low annual clear sky amount (8 %), high cloud depth (10, 937 m), high 0 °C <b>isotherm</b> <b>height</b> (4. 7 km), high TCLWC (4. 0 kg/m 2 at 0. 01 %) and low seasonal cloud base height (356 m). <!
