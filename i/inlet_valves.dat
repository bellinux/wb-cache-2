5|$|A sponge's body is {{hollow and}} {{is held in}} shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like {{substance}} made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable <b>inlet</b> <b>valves.</b> Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all {{other parts of the}} mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those {{at the base of the}} animal are responsible for anchoring it.|$|E
25|$|In PWRs reactor {{power can}} be viewed as {{following}} steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity feedback of the temperature change caused by increased or decreased steam flow. (See: Negative temperature coefficient.) Boron and control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the operator throttles shut turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>valves.</b> This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the density of the primary reactor coolant water to decrease, allowing higher neutron speeds, thus less fission and decreased power output. This decrease of power will eventually result in primary system temperature returning to its previous steady-state value. The operator can control the steady state operating temperature by addition of boric acid and/or movement of control rods.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the low {{demand for}} luxury {{motorcycles}} during the Great Depression, Indian not only continued {{production of the}} Four, but continued to develop the motorcycle. One of the less popular versions of the Four was the [...] "upside down" [...] engine on the 1936-37 models. While earlier (and later) Fours had inlet-over-exhaust (IOE) cylinder heads with overhead <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> and side exhaust valves, the 1936-1937 Indian Four had a unique EOI cylinder head, with the positions reversed. In theory, this would improve fuel vaporization, and the new engine was more powerful. However, the new system made the cylinder head, and the rider's inseam, very hot. This, along with an exhaust valvetrain that required frequent adjustment, caused sales to drop. The addition of dual carburetors in 1937 did not revive interest. The design was returned to the original configuration in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|Both inlet and {{exhaust valves}} {{were in the}} {{cylinder}} heads. The automatic <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> of earlier Anzani engines, opened by atmospheric pressure and closed by valve springs were retained, but fuel was fed from a mixing chamber in the crankcase via inlet tubes placed {{at the rear of}} the engine to avoid cooling of the mixture by the oncoming airflow. [...] This arrangement placed the exhaust valves at the front of the engine, where they were operated from a cam in the rear of the crankcase via push rods and rockers. [...] A single carburettor fed the crankcase chambers from below. [...] Some versions used a single Gibaud magneto, running at 3,000 rpm, though others built by British Anzani had a pair of Bosch magnetos, running slower. [...] Plugs (K.L.G. for the British variant) were mounted in the sides of the cylinder heads, sloping upwards to avoid plug fouling by lubricating oil. The exhaust was collected by a prominent pair of semi-circular manifolds.|$|E
2500|$|By December 1909 Anzani had a [...] 3-cylinder {{air-cooled}} true {{radial engine}} running, {{developed from the}} earlier 3-cylinder fan configuration engines (semi-radials) that had powered Bleriot across the Channel. [...] By about March 1910 he had completed the first two-row radial engine, a 6-cylinder unit made by merging two 3-cylinder units together, one slightly behind the other and at an angle of 60Â°. [...] The engine therefore had {{a lot in common}} with the early 3-cylinder motors: cylinders were a single iron casting with built-in valve cells and ribs, and pistons were steel with cast-iron rings. [...] The early versions were side-valve engines with automatic (atmospheric pressure opened) <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> and exhaust valves mechanically operated via cams in the crankcase. [...] By the end of 1912, as with the smaller engines the exhaust valves were moved to the cylinder heads and operated by push-rods and rockers. [...] The exhaust valves were {{at the front of the}} engine, with the fuel inlet manifold at the rear. [...] A prominent pair of 150Â° exhaust tubes were fitted. Plugs were mounted in the cylinder sides, in the plane of the engine and on the upper side to minimise plug fouling by lubricant.|$|E

40|$|This {{experimental}} work {{was concerned with}} comparison of <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> actuation strategies in a thermodynamic single cylinder spark ignition research engine equipped with a mechanical fully variable valvetrain on both the inlet and exhaust. The research involved study {{of the effects of}} the valvetrain on combustion, fuel economy and emissions when used to achieve variable valve timing alone and when applied together with early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing for so-called unthrottled operation. The effects of such early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closure were examined using either fully variable events or by simulating two-stage cam profile switching. While fully variable operation enabled the maximum fuel savings over the widest operating map, it was apparent that two-stage switching mechanisms can provide an attractive compromise in terms of cost versus CO 2 benefit on engines of moderate to large capacity. However, from speed-load maps obtained in the current study it would appear that a wide range of <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> durations would be necessary to obtain fuel savings sufficient to warrant a system any more sophisticated than current variable valve timing mechanisms in future aggressively downsized gasoline engines.

40|$|This work {{involved}} {{study of}} the effects of alcohol blends on combustion, fuel economy and emissions in a single cylinder research engine equipped with a mechanical fully variable valvetrain on the <b>inlet</b> and variable <b>valve</b> timing on the exhaust. A number of splash blends of gasoline, iso-octane, ethanol and butanol were examined during port fuel injected early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing operation, both with and without variable valve timing. Under low valve overlap conditions, it was apparent that the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> durations/lifts required for full unthrottled operation were remarkably similar for the wide range of blends studied. However, with high valve overlap differences in burning velocities and internal EGR tolerances warranted changes in these valve settings. In turn, it was concluded that high ethanol content blends facilitated minimum throttling at the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> itself and the largest relative savings in terms of fuel consumption, engine-out emissions of NOx and (corrected) unburned hydrocarbons.
