40|$|Abstract: Undersea <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> {{cable systems}} are an {{integral}} part of the international telecommunications infrastructure for supporting growing marketplace bandwidth needs and they have become a critical component to the constantly evolving Internet traffic content. The issue associated with existing undersea <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> cable systems is the scalability of the capacity in meeting and anticipating future capacity demands of the network. In order to meet increased traffic demands, telecoms companies are required to build new systems or upgrade the existing ones in order to address this issue of increased capacity demand. Building an undersea <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> cable system is an expensive venture, so much so that the system owners are reluctant to invest in newer <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> cable system whilst they have ownership on existing systems. They seek ways in which to optimise the existing system in order to extend the economic lifespan of the system. The research sought to demonstrate how effective it is to upgrade the existing undersea <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> cable systems given the technological advancements, expenditures as opposed to constructing a new undersea <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> cable system through a trade-off study of a new build versus upgraded existing undersea <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> cable system activities. It was found that upgrading an existing system to a capacity beyond the original design capacity was achievable through the enablers such as Wavelength Division Multiplex, spectral efficiency, coherent detection, modulation formats and forward error correction techniques. It was found that only the terminal station equipment gets altered whilst the submerged plant remains unchanged, making it possible to optimise the capacity on the existing undersea <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> system effectively in a timeous period and enable the exploitation of the increased traffic demand. Whereas to construct a new <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> cable system requires huge capital investments and time to implement the system can take a minimum of 24 months without delays, however delays are part and parcel of system construction, delays ranging from obtaining permits, equipment/material delivery, construction of both the submerged and dry plants.

40|$|The FU-Berlin, the Institute of Applied <b>Fibre</b> <b>Optics</b> Moscow and the ART-Photonics GmbH Berlin {{participated in}} the joint project. The FU-Berlin was the project coordinator. The aim {{of the project was}} the {{development}} of a two wavelengths measuring method for the determination of glucose in human blood samples. A water glucose calibration mixture was analysed by ATR spectroscopy {{in the first part of}} the project realisation to determine the optimum measuring parameters. Real human blood samples were analysed in the second part. The blood samples were analysed additionally in the rheological laboratory for calibration purposes. The Institute of Applied <b>Fibre</b> <b>Optics</b> Moscow had developed and realised a CO_ 2 laser emitting at two wavelengths simultaneously. The detector system for the measuring arrangement was developed and manufactured by the ART-Photonics GmbH Berlin. Both systems were the basis for the experimental arrangement for determination of glucose in human blood samples. The project was realised successful and in time. The results obtained demonstrate that the method developed in the frame of the project is well suited for the analysis of glucose in human blood samples. (orig.)

40|$|A {{comparison}} of macrobend losses in Single Mode Fibre (SMF) and Multimode Fibre (MMF) is presented. The increased demand on information has seen optical fibres slowly replacing {{the use of}} copper coaxial cables for signal transmission, and this, {{largely due to the}} high bandwidth and speed of transmission, large carrying capacity and security offered by optical fibres. Signal attenuation however remains a limitation to efficient and quality signal transmission and macrobending is one of the loss mechanisms that contributes to this signal attenuation. Appreciating the responses of the different <b>optic</b> <b>fibres</b> in use to macrobending is therefore instrumental in ensuring macrobending contribution to overall attenuation in <b>optic</b> <b>fibres</b> is minimum at all times. In this study the macrobend losses trends with bending diameter were investigated for the SMF and MMF in similar experimental setups. To do this improvisions were done for a light source using 555 timer astable multivibrator powering a green LED, a light detector using an LDR in a Wheatstone bridge circuit and <b>optic</b> <b>fibres</b> off-cuts. <b>Optic</b> power was measured at the input and output points of the <b>optic</b> <b>fibres</b> using the light detector in bend and straight conditions for determination of signal attenuation in each case. The experimental measurement results show that macrobending losses are more pronounced in a SMF than in a MMF. Characteristic values for macrobending loss are 1268 dB/km for SMF compared to 1155 dB/km for MMF for bending diameter value 4. 19 cm. In the SMF macrobending loss trend showed an exponential variation which agrees with work by previous authors. The contribution of macrobending loss in multimode fibre attenuation was however minimal and therefore difficult to quantify. Results also showed that MMF have a higher overall signal attenuation than SMF which justifies the use of SMF in long distance signal transmission. Research findings confirm the significant contribution of macrobending to <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> signal attenuation hence the need for careful iv consideration in installations for optimal operation of <b>optic</b> <b>fibres.</b> This would mean the choice of <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> in any particular instance should consider the high attenuation in MMF not neglecting the insignificant macrobending contribution of MMF to attenuation at any preferred wavelength in order to obtain required transmission characteristics.,University of Zimbabwe,DAAD and the Research Council of Zimbabw...|$|R
