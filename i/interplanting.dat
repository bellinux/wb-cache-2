40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>interplant</b> {{distance}} on differentiation and selection a) {{of the superior}} lines from a mixture of inbred lines, and b) of individual plants originating from the top lines, was studied in chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.). For this, 28 chickpea inbred lines were evaluated on a single plant basis in a honeycomb design {{and in the same}} field at three <b>interplant</b> distances, for four growing seasons, at Larissa, Greece. The <b>interplant</b> distances were 15 cm (520000 plants/ha, strong allo-competition), 30 cm (128630 plants/ha, medium allo-competition) and 100 cm (11500 plants/ha, without competition). In addition, the inbred lines were evaluated in replicated plot trials under an agronomically accepted plant stand (520000 plants/ha, crop environment) and the ranking of the 28 lines based on the average yield per plot over growing seasons was determined. Selection was applied in each season for each <b>interplant</b> distance and the three and six top lines with the highest average yield per plant were identified. These top lines from each <b>interplant</b> distance were compared with the three and six top lines (say: proven superior lines) identified after their evaluation under crop environment over seasons. In addition, selection was applied at the individual plant level with six selection pressures in each season and each <b>interplant</b> distance. Then we determined for each experiment and selection pressure the number of the selected plants which belonged to the six proven top lines. It was observed that the ranking obtained under crop environment was best correlated with the ranking at the intermediate <b>interplant</b> distance (30 cm), followed by the ranking at the high <b>interplant</b> distance (100 cm). In contrast this correlation was very weak for the ranking at low <b>interplant</b> distance (15 cm). In addition, the <b>interplant</b> distance identifying the highest number of the proven high yielding lines after their evaluation in one season was the intermediate <b>interplant</b> distance followed by the high <b>interplant</b> distance and certainly not the low <b>interplant</b> distance. The relative effectiveness was further increased when selection was based on average performance of the lines across seasons. This, together with the relatively small number of seeds produced per plant, renders selection at low <b>interplant</b> distance less favorable than selection at the intermediate or high <b>interplant</b> distance. The individual plant selection was effective at all three <b>interplant</b> distances. Selection effectiveness generally increased as the selection pressure increased. Again the best results were obtained when selection was applied at intermediate or at high <b>interplant</b> distance. It was concluded that line selection as well as individual plant selection was more effective at intermediate <b>interplant</b> distance and certainly not at low <b>interplant</b> distance...|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is}} thus to investigate the characteristics of organ development under increased <b>interplant</b> competition. A field experiment was conducted to investigate organ development across 4 maize plant densities i. e. 2, 6, 12 and 20 plants m (referred to PD 2, PD 6, PD 12 and PD 20 respectively). In response to increased <b>interplant</b> competition, lengths of both laminae and sheaths increased in lower phytomers, but decreased in upper phytomers. Sheath extension appeared to be less sensitive to increased <b>interplant</b> competition than lamina extension. Extension of laminae and internodes responded to increased plant density as soon as onset of mild <b>interplant</b> competition, but did not respond any further to severe competition. Both lamina width and internode diameter were reduced due to a smaller growth rate in response to increased plant density.

I use the weighted model to examine plant performance in artificial populations of Zinnia elegans, in which germination time is used as the weighting factor. It was found that spatial positioning of plants (as defined by the Dirichlet and unweighted Fraser tessellations) was itself a poor predictor of plant performance.

Planting E. camaldulensis with cowpeas and maize had no marked effect on the yields of the two annual crops. Sole clean-weeded E. camaldulensis had significantly thicker circumference than the Eucalyptus in the other treatments, but was comparable to Eucalyptus <b>interplanted</b> with the annual crops in terms of branching habit. However, E. camaldulensis <b>interplanted</b> with maize showed a slightly higher performance (branching and circumference) than that <b>interplanted</b> with cowpeas. This was probably related to the fertilizer added to the maize/£. camaldulensis intercrop since no fertilizer was added to the cowpea/£. camaldulensis intercrop. Management factors such as clean weeding in sole Eucalyptus markedly increased tree performance as observed through parameters of stem circumference and branching compared to those of the unweeded sole Eucalyptus situation. Neither tree branching pattern, height growth nor soil moisture were significantly affected by intercropping with annual crops.

Changes in leaflet and internode dimensions over thermal time were recorded for primary shoot expansion, on 83 plants from three crops grown in different climatic conditions and densities.

Leaflet or internode length was simulated as a logistic function of thermal time. The model was evaluated by cross-validation. We found that differences in leaflet or internode expansion kinetics between phytomer positions and between plants at a given phytomer position were due mostly to large differences in time of organ expansion and expansion rate, rather than differences in expansion duration. Thus, in the model, the parameters linked to expansion duration were predicted by values common to all plants, whereas variability in final size and organ expansion time was captured by input data. The model accurately simulated leaflet and internode expansion for individual plants (RMSEP = 7. 3 % and 10. 2 % of final length, respectively).

Many different environmental factors play an important part in the process of soybean germination and emergence. Environmental factors that can adversely affect germination and emergence are moisture, oxygen supply, temperature, and diseases. All of these factors can reduce the emergence percentage and increase the time for emergence of soybeans. In the past management options for a deficient soybean stand consisted of leaving the existing stand till harvest or destroying the present stand and starting over by replanting. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate a third option in managing deficient soybean stands: <b>interplanting.</b> <b>Interplanting</b> is the process of planting additional seeds into an existing deficient stand. With the cost of soybean seed doubling over the past 20 years, <b>interplanting</b> was evaluated as a way to decrease seed cost when dealing with a deficient stand.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} and nutritious food crops. Due to its adaptability to cool climates, production in Sri Lanka has been restricted to erosion-prone highlands. Vast potential exists for expansion of potato cultivation in the lowlands while production areas in the highlands are limited by crop saturation. High soil temperatures characteristic of lowland tropical areas strongly limit potato cultivation during warmer months. Previous research, however, revealed that soil temperature can be reduced by various techniques. Although soil temperature manipulation has been tried successfully, the effect of these techniques on potato growth, dry matter partitioning, and tuber yield has not been studied. Experiment addressing these questions was conducted in two consecutive cropping seasons from July to October of 1991 (Yala season) and December to March of 1991 - 1992 (Maha season) at the Regional Agricultural Research Center at Bandarawela (6 ° 5 l'N latitude, 80 ° 59 ' longitude, and 1300 m a. s. l.), Sri Lanka. The Yala season is warmer while the Maha season is cooler. Treatments included various soil temperature suppression systems such as rice straw mulching, <b>interplanting,</b> and hilling. Rice straw mulch suppressed soil temperature by 1 - 6 °C during the day. This system hastened emergence and canopy development and increased potato plant height, leaf area index (LAI), crop growth rate (CGR), and net assimilation rate (NAR) in both seasons. LAI and CGR showed a quadratic relationship with time under rice straw mulch system. <b>Interplanting</b> soybean (Glycine max L.), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) or double rows of potato resulted in no appreciable effect on soil temperature suppression, or plant growth in either season, except for emergence which improved under potato-soybean. Dry matter partitioning to tubers was highest and showed a linear relationship with time under rice straw mulch and rice straw-bridge systems while <b>interplanting</b> and hilling treatments did not influence these factors substantially. Further, straw mulch improved total dry matter (TDM) production, which showed a linear relationship with time.

This study was conducted over a 2 -year period (2003 and 2004) and included nine current or obsolete cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars grown in 5 plant densities designed to evaluate varying levels of <b>interplant</b> competition. Plant densities were single plant culture with plants spaced 3 m x 3 m, 2 m x 2 m, 1 m x 1 m, 1 m x 0. 3 m, and two commercial populations with plants spaced 1 m x 0. 1 m. Results were analyzed for each trait to determine whether genetic gains are interrelated with tolerance to <b>interplant</b> competition or strictly under genetic control. The rates of genetic gain for lint yield were highest in the 1 m x 0. 1 m, 1 m x 0. 3 m, and 1 m x 1 m treatment with slopes of 8. 7, 8. 2, and 7. 1 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 respectively. The slopes were each significantly smaller in the 2 m x 2 m and 3 m x 3 m spaced populations with gains of 3. 6 and 1. 5 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 respectively, implying that for lint yield, genetic gains have been made for tolerance to <b>interplant</b> competition.
