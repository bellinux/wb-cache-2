5|$|Screening for aneurysms is not {{performed}} on a population level; {{because they are}} relatively rare, {{it would not be}} cost-effective. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> two or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, screening may be worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the {{platelet count}} will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E

5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{true power}} of STR {{analysis}} {{is in its}} statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are independently assorted (having {{a certain number of}} repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the product rule for probabilities can be applied. This means that, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, we can say that the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x1018) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches. Moreover, since there are about 12 million monozygotic twins on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the name [...] "antlion" [...] is uncertain. It has been thought to refer to ants forming a large {{percentage}} of the prey of the insect, the suffix [...] "lion" [...] merely suggesting destroyer or hunter. In any case, the term seems to go back to classical antiquity. The antlion larva is often called a [...] "doodlebug" [...] in North America because of the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while relocating, which look as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> been doodling.|$|E

"Under the Milky Way" [...] {{features}} a 12-string acoustic guitar melody {{along with a}} solo composed with an EBow on a Fender Jazzmaster, and recorded [...] on a Synclavier, leading to a sound reminiscent of bagpipes.

It's not as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> put us together to write a hit song. It's more like sometimes when we write together, a song comes knocking on the door".

2500|$|A 1978 study {{examined}} the effect of sunlight on folate – a vitamin B complex – levels. The study found that even short periods of intense sunlight are able to halve folate levels <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> light skin. Low folate levels are correlated with neural tube defects, such as anencephaly and spina bifida. UV rays can strip away folate, which {{is important to the}} development of healthy foetuses. In these abnormalities children are born with incomplete brain or spinal cord. Nina Jablonski, a professor of anthropology and expert on evolution of human skin coloration, [...] found several cases in which mother’s visits to tanning studios were connected to neural tube defects in early pregnancy. She also found that folate was crucial to sperm development; some male contraception drugs are based on folate inhibition. It has been found that folate may have been {{the driving force behind the}} evolution of dark skin.|$|E
2500|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{are produced}} {{to express a}} reaction to a situation or event or to evoke a response from another individual or individuals. They are signals of emotion and social intent. People make faces in response to [...] "direct audience effects" [...] when they are watching sports, discussing politics, eating or smelling, in pain, and see or hear something humorous. While one may have the same emotional reaction to a particular situation, {{he or she is}} more likely to express this emotion via a facial expression if they are in a social situation. Smiles, in particular, are [...] "evolved signaling displays [...] are the result of selective pressures for conspicuous, stereotyped, and redundant communication". Smiling is a visual signal that requires eye contact from the recipient to the one smiling and is intended to communicate a feeling of happiness and joy. In an experiment by Alan Fridlund, smiling occurred least when one was watching a video alone, then more often when a person was alone watching the video but believed a friend was performing another task, even more often when that person believed a friend was simultaneously watching the video somewhere else, and most often when one was watching a movie with a friend physically present. This evidence shows that even <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>has</b> the same internal reaction to a stimulus (like a movie), {{they are more likely to}} externalize these feelings when surrounded by peers or under the assumption that peers are engaged in the same activity.|$|E
