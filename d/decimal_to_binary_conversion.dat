40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new method for hiding data in music scores. In {{contrast}} to previous published algorithms we investigate the possibilities of embedding information in clefs. Using the clef as information carrier has two advantages: First, a clef is present in each staff line which guarantees a fixed capacity. Second, the clef defines the reference system for musical symbols and music containing symbols, e. g. the notes and the rests, are not degraded by manipulations. Music scores must be robust against greyscale <b>to</b> <b>binary</b> <b>conversion.</b> As a consequence, the information is embedded by modifying {{the black and white}} distribution of pixels in certain areas. We evaluate simple image processing mechanisms based on erosion and dilation for embedding the information. For retrieving the watermark the b/w-distribution is extracted from the given clef. To solve the synchronization problem the watermarked clef is normalized in a pre-processing step. The normalization is based on moments. The areas used for watermarking are calculated by image segmentation techniques which consider the features of a clef. We analyze capacity and robustness of the proposed method using different parameters for our proposed method. This proposed method can be combined with other music score watermarking methods to increase the capacity of existing watermarking techniques...|$|R

Examples are, two decimal digits (8 bits) reexpressed as a seven-bit number, and three decimal digits (twelve bits) reexpressed as a ten-bit number. Fast <b>conversion</b> from <b>decimal</b> <b>to</b> <b>binary</b> {{is the subject of}} a previous memo [Reference 1]. I have studied the reverse conversion and hope to have interesting results shortly. 1. Bit Pattern Preservation There is no question that the equivalent binary number represents the closest a priori packaging scheme of the number; Further compression may be possible, but would require a detailed knowledge of the bit patterns. However, the binary mapping produces a garbled result which is not immediate-ly readable, and the forward and backward mapping technique call for hard-ware arithmetic. The question therefore arises, do there exist techniques of equivalent compression power which preserve the bit patterns to a degree? The answer is in the affirmativec There exist reversible schemes mapping 2 decimal digits into 7 bits or 3 decimal digits into 10 bits, which pre-serve the non-zero bit patterns. 2.

Highly adaptive communications devices onboard {{and on the ground}} must provide the greatest possible transmitted data density between deployed crew personnel, spacecraft and ground control teams. Regarding these requirements, this proposal borrows from research into quantum mechanical computing by applying the concept of a qubit, a single bit that represents 16 states, to radio frequency (RF) communications link design for exploration programs. This concept of placing multiple character values into a single data bit can easily make the evolutionary steps needed to meet exploration mission demands. To move the qubit from the quantum mechanical research laboratory into long distance RF data transmission, this proposal utilizes polarization modulation of the RF carrier signal to represent numbers from zero to fifteen. It introduces the concept of a binarytohexadecimal converter that quickly chops any data stream into 16 bit words and connects variously polarized feedhorns to a singlefrequency radio transmitter. Further, the concept relies on development of a receiver that uses lownoise amplifiers and an antenna array to quickly assess carrier polarity and perform hexadecimal <b>to</b> <b>binary</b> <b>conversion.</b> Early testbed experiments using the International Space Station (ISS) as an operations laboratory can be implemented to provide the most costeffective return for research investment.

Residue number principles and techniques are applied to process complex signal information in Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) digital filters. Residue coding of complex samples and arithmetic for processing complex data have been presented using principles of quadratic residues in the Residue Number System (RNS). In this work, we have presented modifications to the Quadratic Residue Number System (QRNS), which we have termed the Modified Quadratic Residue Number System (MQRNS), to process complex integers. New results and theorems have been obtained for the selection of operators to code complex integers into the new MQRNS representation. A novel scheme for residue <b>to</b> <b>binary</b> <b>conversion</b> has been presented for implementation using both the QRNS and MQRNS. Hardware implementations of multiplication intensive complex nonrecursive and recursive digital filters have been presented where the QRNS and MQRNS structures are realized using a bit-slice architectural approach. The computation of Complex Number Theoretic Transforms (CNTTs) and the hardware implementation of a radix- 2 NTT butterfly structure, using high density ROM arrays, are presented in both the QRNS and MQRNS systems. As an illustration, the computation of the CNTT developed in this work, is used to compute Cyclic Convolution for complex sequences. These results are verified by computer programs. The recursive FIR filter structure for uniformly spaced frequency samples on the unit circle developed by adapting the Complex Number Theoretic z-transform, has been implemented using the QRNS and MQRNS. In this work, the filter structure is extended for non-uniformly spaced frequency samples and has been termed the generalized number theoretic filter structure. It is shown that {{for the implementation of}} this generalized structure, the MQRNS is more efficient than the conventional RNS; the QRNS does not support appropriate fields for the generalized structure.
