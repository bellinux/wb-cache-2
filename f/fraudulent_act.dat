2500|$|In November 1999, {{twelve years}} after the {{imposition}} of NCAA's death penalty against the SMU football program, The Dallas Morning News reported on possible academic fraud involving SMU football. Former SMU football player Corlin Donaldson alleged that defensive line coach Steve Malin paid another person $100 to take Donaldson's ACT exam in 1998 so that Donaldson would be eligible to attend SMU. Malin, who had been suspended since August, was fired on December 8, 1999. On December 13, 2000, the NCAA placed SMU on two years' probation and vacated ten games from SMU's 1998 season in which Donaldson played, which reduced SMU's record to 1-1 for 1998. SMU's 2005 media guide indicates that the NCAA vacated the first ten games of the 1998 season. The NCAA reported that its infractions committee [...] "concluded that the assistant football coach [...] initially suggested that the prospective student-athlete [...] should participate in academic fraud, actively assisted in the initial <b>fraudulent</b> <b>ACT,</b> had actual knowledge of the fraud in the second ACT and finally, had reason {{to know that the}} prospect, after enrolling at the university and becoming a student-athlete, was ineligible to compete by reason of the academic fraud."

50|$|Using a trick, such as lying, to get {{possession}} of property is larceny. Larceny by trick is descriptive {{of the method}} used to obtain possession. The concept arose from Pear’s Case decided in 1779. The issue was whether {{a person who had}} fraudulently obtained {{possession of}} personal property (a horse) could be convicted of larceny. The chief impediment to conviction was the doctrine of possessorial immunity which said that a person who had acquired possession lawfully, that is with the consent of the owner, could not be prosecuted for larceny. Clearly the owner of the horse had given the defendant possession of the animal - he had agreed that the defendant could borrow the horse to ride to Surrey. The case would seem to have been cut and dried - the doctrine of possessorial immunity applied and the defendant was therefore not guilty of larceny. The court held that consent induced by fraud was not consent {{in the eyes of the}} law. The <b>fraudulent</b> <b>act</b> that induced the owner to transfer possession “vitiated” the consent. This concept of consent broadened the scope of larceny. Before, consent meant the voluntary relinquishment of possession and thus property was wrongfully taken only if the defendant acquired possession by stealth, force or threat of force.|$|E

Although each judge gave slightly different reasons, Lord Phillips, Walker and Brown held the ex turpi causa defence barred the company's claim against the liquidator for negligence. Since Mr Stojevic was the exclusive owner and controller, it was logically necessary that his fraudulent intentions {{be attributed to the}} company. More specifically, Lord Phillips identified that the <b>fraudulent</b> <b>act</b> was done {{for the benefit of the}} company, and therefore the act of Mr Stojevic was attributed to be the act of Stone & Rolls through the organic process of attribution.

The auditors owed a duty to perform their audit diligently to the company (not to individual shareholders or creditors), and so if the company tried to bring a claim for breach of that duty it would necessarily be relying on its own illegality. Accordingly, the defence of ex turpi causa non oritur actio should be open to the auditors. Both Lord Walker and Lord Brown rejected that there should exist any principle that the ex turpi causa defence would be overridden when the duty involved was to protect against one's own criminality.|$|E

5000|$|The offseason was a {{controversial}} {{one for the}} Rebels, where an ongoing NCAA investigation dominated college football headlines. The investigation began {{prior to the start}} of the 2015 season, where Ole Miss star offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil was arrested on charges of domestic violence after allegedly assaulting his stepfather, Lindsey Miller. Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze announced that Tunsil was defending his mother, Desiree Tunsil. A police report that was released days after the incident stated that Miller claimed Tunsil was [...] "riding around with football agents" [...] and that when a deputy arrived at the scene of the incident, [...] "Tunsil and the agents" [...] left in a yellow convertible. Days later, NCAA officials interviewed Miller about allegations of multiple violations of rules by the Ole Miss football program; Hugh Freeze later dismissed the possibility of a violation of rules, saying he's confident his program [...] "always does the right thing". In August 2015, Tunsil and Miller agreed to drop charges against each other and sign dismissal forms. However, Tunsil was suspended from the first seven games of the 2015 season, making his debut against Texas A&M. In October 2015, Ole Miss announced that Tunsil used three loaner vehicles over a six-month period without payment, among other impermissible benefits. Only a few days later, an NCAA investigation of Louisiana Lafayette revealed that former Ole Miss coach David Saunders may have potentially committed violations while at Ole Miss. Saunders allegedly helped five recruits receive <b>fraudulent</b> <b>ACT</b> scores at Wayne County High School, lied to the NCAA about his involvement and failed to cooperate with the subsequent investigation. He also allegedly gave a total of $6,500 to a player over the course of two semesters while at Louisiana Lafayette. In January 2016, after the Rebels' Sugar Bowl victory over Oklahoma State, Ole Miss received a notice of allegations from the NCAA. However, Ole Miss athletic director Ross Bjork stated that the majority of the violations occurred before his arrival at Ole Miss and before the hiring of Hugh Freeze. In February, Bjork said that the NCAA has completed its investigation of Ole Miss's football program, and also stated that he did not expect a [...] "second letter" [...] from the NCAA concerning additional violations and that Freeze was not named by the NCAA in any wrongdoing. At this point, the investigation was seemingly coming to an end, but on the night of the NFL Draft, Laremy Tunsil's Instagram account was hacked, and a video of him smoking a bong fashioned out of a gas mask is posted, as well as photos of text messages where Tunsil asks for money from an Ole Miss administrator. When asked if he ever received money while at Ole Miss, Tunsil admitted that he did, in fact, receive money. As a result of the investigation, Ole Miss self-imposed an 11-scholarship reduction over the course of four seasons. Along with the reduction of scholarships, the school has also suspended two unnamed assistants from recruiting, fined itself $159,352 and required current staff to go through additional training on NCAA rules and policy. In August 2016, it was announced that NCAA investigators have interviewed players at rival SEC schools about their recruitment by Ole Miss. NCAA Enforcement representatives have visited Auburn and Mississippi State, along with perhaps one other unnamed SEC West school during the summer of 2016. The players were granted immunity from possible NCAA sanctions in exchange for truthful accounts of their recruitment.|$|E
