5|$|The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche {{organizations}} {{on charges}} of securities fraud relating to $30million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, {{a decision by the}} State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their First Amendment rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication <b>Equities</b> Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed.

(2008) which expanded the Rust et al. (2000) ’s study on customer <b>equity.</b> We empirically examine if the customer <b>equity</b> drivers have a different impact on customer loyalty. This study hypothesizes that the rel-ative effect of customer <b>equity</b> drivers would be different depending on the purchasing behavior of consumers and exam-ines the effects of them on the relationship of the drivers of customer <b>equity</b> and customer loyalty. We use stepwise multiple regression analysis to empirically test the relationship of value <b>equity,</b> brand <b>equity,</b> and relationship <b>equity</b> and customer loyalty. Relationship <b>equity</b> influences customer loyalty more strongly than value <b>equity</b> and brand <b>equity.</b> Cus-tomers seem to build loyalty based on the careful assessment of all costumer <b>equity</b> drivers (value <b>equity,</b> brand <b>equity,</b> and relationship <b>equity).</b> In addition, their relative impact is different depending on the purchasing behavior of consumers. A company cannot maintain all customer <b>equity</b> drivers at a high level with limited marketing resources; therefore, mar-keting investment for all customer <b>equity</b> drivers need to be allocated differentially depending on the purchasing behavior of consumers.
