5000|$|In the Hammer universe, a powergun is {{a weapon}} which {{projects}} high energy copper plasma toward its target. This plasma {{is created by}} inducing an electrical field in a precisely aligned group of copper atoms; the atoms' alignment causes a resonance which greatly amplifies the field energy and ionizes the atoms. The resulting plasma is directed by a firing chamber and barrel made of refractory metal, such as iridium; the chamber and barrel are cooled between shots by <b>injected</b> <b>gas</b> (typically nitrogen). The copper atoms are stored as individual charges, with the atoms held in the correct alignment by a plastic matrix which is mostly consumed by the firing. All the parts of a powergun require extremely precise machining and advanced materials, which makes powerguns very expensive; only the most successful mercenary units (or technologically advanced planets) can afford large numbers of powerguns. Powerguns are easily identified by the extremely bright cyan color of their plasma bolts; the electrical field also generates a broadband radio frequency discharge which can {{be picked up by}} the appropriate equipment. A powergun's recoil is far lower than a projectile weapon of equivalent size or firepower, as the copper atoms have low rest mass; the primary limit for powergun rate of fire is its ability to dissipate heat.

30|$|To further {{observe the}} impact of the {{presence}} of ethane in the composition of the <b>injected</b> <b>gas,</b> a gas flow of 80 % methane and 20 % ethane was chosen to be injected into the reservoir. As can be seen in Fig.  6, the rise of ethane percentage in the <b>injected</b> <b>gas</b> is associated with an increased rate of condensate production (the curve designated as C 2 injection). Therefore, the increased condensate production under pipeline gas injection scenario may be attributed to the increased percentage of ethane component in the <b>injected</b> <b>gas.</b> To verify this, keeping the same percentages of other components in the pipeline gas composition, the volume of methane was reduced by 4 % while heavy components of C 7 + and C 17 + were increased by 2 %. In this way, a rich—in heavier compounds—gas flow with the compositions indicated in Table  6 was set as the <b>injected</b> <b>gas</b> to the reservoir to investigate the contributions of such compounds into the gas storage operations. Analyzing the results of this scenario, an increased condensate production rate was observed, particularly after several injection-withdrawal cycles. However, remembering that 4 % of heavy compounds already present in the <b>injected</b> <b>gas</b> composition, such an increase in the condensate production rate seems to be relatively insignificant. To sum up, the closer the <b>injected</b> <b>gas</b> composition be to the pipeline gas composition, the higher reservoir condensate recovery factor would be realized.|$|E

40|$|Underground Gas Storage (UGS) {{involves}} {{storage of}} {{large quantities of}} natural gas to support the natural gas demand in domestic, commercial and industrial areas. Storage of sour gas can be advantageous from economic standpoint, as it reduces treatment costs and increases the potential of production from shared reservoirs. This paper investigates feasibility of UGS in one of Iranian depleted fractured gas condensate reservoirs. Compositional simulation was employed to build dynamic reservoir model, develop the history matching phase of the reservoir and construct Injection/Withdrawal (I/W) cycles. One sweet gas stream and three sour gas streams with different compositions were tested for storage into reservoir during summer season. 				Results of simulation showed that presence of H 2 S and CO 2 in the <b>injected</b> <b>gas</b> stream improves condensate production. Condensate Production Enhancement (CPE), defined {{as the percentage of}} condensate recovery increase due to sour gas injection relative to the sweet gas injection, was calculated for different compositions of storage gas. Also, Condensate Holding Ratio (CHR), defined as the ratio of condensate in the withdrawn sour gas to that in the withdrawn CH 4, was estimated for different storage gas compositions. Results showed that CPE has a higher rate in earlier cycles and declines at later cycles. CHR is higher for sour gas storage compared to sweet gas. Furthermore, heating value of produced gas was calculated in all I/W cycles and compared with heating value of <b>injected</b> <b>gas.</b> It was indicated that difference between heating value of produced and <b>injected</b> <b>gas</b> increases with increase of H 2 S and CO 2 content of the <b>injected</b> <b>gas.</b> Also, {{it was found that the}} reservoir has lower pressure rise at the end of I/W cycles in the case of underground sour gas storage compared to sweet gas storage.

30|$|According to the {{simulation}} outputs, N 2 and C 1 as minor contaminants of that <b>injected</b> <b>gas</b> {{can have an}} adverse effect (i.e., an increase) on the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) between the reservoir fluid and the <b>injected</b> <b>gas.</b> This suggests that adding nitrogen or methane as contaminants into a CO 2 -rich gas injection stream is {{likely to result in}} an increased MMP for the reservoir fluid system (i.e., a negative impact). On the other hand, C 2 and C 3 as minor contaminants in a CO 2 -rich gas injection stream into the same oil sample were able to decrease the MMP between the reservoir fluid and the <b>injected</b> <b>gas.</b> The slope of the MMP versus CO 2 percent graph was steeper for C 3 compared to C 2. The addition of C 3 to a CO 2 -rich gas injection stream is therefore likely to improve its performance as an EOR mechanism by reducing the MMP of the reservoir fluid-injected gas system.|$|E
40|$|Gas {{condensate}} reservoirs suffer {{losses in}} well productivity due to near wellbore condensate dropout when the flowing bottom-hole pressure declines below {{the dew point}} pressure. Pressure maintenance and gas cycling are the common practices used in {{the oil and gas}} field to alleviate this problem and develop gas condensate reservoirs. The injection of dry gas into a retrograde gas condensate reservoir helps in vaporizing the condensate and increases its dew point. This article investigates the situation of one of the reservoirs located in southern Iran in Zagros area. First, based on the reservoir composition, the phase diagram has been plotted. Peng-Robinson equation of state for the equilibrium calculations and Lee-Kesler characterization of heavy fractions are used in this software. After that the effect of nitrogen, pure methane, a composition of ethane and methane, and carbon dioxide injections on reservoir recovery has been investigated and compared to a natural depletion scheme. The full system, including two separators and a stock tank, are simulated simultaneously and the effect of each type of injection on the liquid and gas production is investigated. Full mixing has been assumed in all of the injections studied. By comparing between the results it is concluded that in an injection process, required injection rate to maintain reservoir pressure above dew point pressure and avoid liquid formation in the reservoir for pure methane, a composition of ethane and methane, pure nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and liquid recovery in all cases are investigated. According to the results, with increasing ethane mole percent in the <b>injecting</b> <b>gas</b> a lower <b>injecting</b> rate for the same liquid recovery is needed. Because with increasing heavy components mole percent in <b>injecting</b> <b>gas,</b> average molecular weight of <b>injecting</b> <b>gas,</b> and reservoir gas becomes closer {{and there will be a}} better mixing between them and, therefore, liquid recovery will be improved. Thus, a composition of ethane and methane with more ethane mole percent is better than others. Â© 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
