5|$|In 2010, Emanuel was {{reported}} to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning <b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in midterm elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.|$|E

5|$|In July 2014, Baker {{was criticized}} by <b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> refusing {{to say whether}} he {{supported}} {{a provision in the}} new gun control law that gave police chiefs discretion to deny firearms identification cards, which are required to purchase shotguns and rifles. He later stated in a debate that he would have signed the gun control bill as it was signed by Governor Patrick.|$|E
5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested {{control of}} both houses of Congress from the <b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time since}} the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|A {{new round}} of snap {{elections}} in October 2014 resulted in a third GERB victory with around {{a third of the}} vote. A record of eight parties won seats, {{the first time since the}} beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by President Rosen Plevneliev to form a government, Borisov's GERB formed a coalition and members of the parties in the Reformist Bloc (<b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG), Alternative for Bulgarian Revival and Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS)) were chosen for Minister positions. However, Boyko Borisov made a vow in 2016 – should GERB President nominee Tsetska Tsacheva does not win the Bulgarian presidential election, 2016, he would resign as a Prime Minister. GERB lost at this election from the independent candidate Rumen Radev who was, nevertheless, supported by the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Subsequently, Boyko Borisov resigned for the second time.|$|E

5|$|In 1877, McClellan was {{nominated}} by the <b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> Governor of New Jersey, {{an action that}} took him by surprise because he had not {{expressed an interest in}} the position. He accepted the nomination, was elected, and served a single term from 1878 to 1881, a tenure marked by careful, conservative executive management and minimal political rancor. The concluding chapter of his political career was his strong support in 1884 for the election of Grover Cleveland. He sought the position of secretary of war in Cleveland's cabinet, for which he was well qualified, but political rivals from New Jersey were able to block his nomination.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 3, 1953, {{was the second}} held under the city charter of 1951 and represented the first test of the Democratic city government of Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. In the 1951 election, the voters had elected a Democratic mayor {{for the first time}} in 67 years, breaking the Republican hold on political power in the city. They had also elected a majority-Democratic City Council along with <b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> district attorney and other citywide offices (also called row offices). In 1953, the voters had the chance to continue the Democratic trend or to block it in the election for City Controller, Register of Wills, and various judges and magistrates. On election day, the Republican organization recovered from their 1951 losses, electing all their candidates citywide. Republicans celebrated the victory, but subsequent Democratic triumphs in the 1955 and 1959 elections made the 1953 result more of an aberration than a true comeback for the once-powerful Philadelphia Republican machine.|$|E
5|$|To {{serve in}} the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 {{years of age or}} older. Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years {{coincident}} with the federal election in which the President of the United States is not elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; {{the rest of the year}} the work of the Senate is light and most members hold another job during this time. It has been controlled by <b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> a number of years. In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.|$|E

5|$|The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche {{organizations}} {{on charges}} of securities fraud relating to $30million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, {{a decision by the}} State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their First Amendment rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent <b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was {{considered}} a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, {{had a reputation for}} honesty. Also like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election. Both candidates focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana, as well as the three southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled, amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and, to a lesser extent, the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks. <b>Democrats,</b> <b>for</b> their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration.|$|E
5|$|There was no Whig platform—the {{party leaders}} decided {{that trying to}} put one {{together}} would tear the party apart. So the Whigs ran on their opposition to Van Buren, blaming him and his <b>Democrats</b> <b>for</b> the recession. In campaign materials, Tyler was praised for integrity in resigning over the state legislature's instructions. The Whigs initially hoped to muzzle Harrison and Tyler, lest they make policy statements that alienated segments of the party. But after Tyler's Democratic rival, Vice President Johnson, made a successful speaking tour, Tyler was called upon to travel from Williamsburg to Columbus, Ohio, and there address a local convention, in a speech intended to assure Northerners that he shared Harrison's views. In his journey of nearly two months, Tyler made speeches at rallies. He could not avoid questions, and after being heckled into an admission that he supported the Compromise Tariff (many Whigs did not), resorted to quoting from Harrison's vague speeches. In his two-hour speech at Columbus, Tyler entirely avoided {{the issue of the}} Bank of the United States, one of the major questions of the day.|$|E
