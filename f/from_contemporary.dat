5|$|Acid Tongue was {{released}} to generally favorable reviews <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> music critics, receiving praise for Lewis' lyrics and vocals. However, some reviewers criticized the numerous collaborations {{and felt the}} sound overwhelmed Lewis. The album charted at number twenty-two in the United States and number fifty-five in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After the 1650s, Monteverdi's name quickly disappears <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> accounts, {{his music}} {{generally}} forgotten {{except for the}} Lamento, prototype of a genre that would endure well into the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Albert Julius Levine and Louis Marks {{proposed}} a broader set of categories in their 1928 book Testing Intelligence and Achievement. Some of the terminology {{in the table}} came <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> terms for classifying individuals with intellectual disabilities.|$|E

50|$|Del Mar {{received}} no scientific or academic recognition <b>from</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> {{and as a}} result of this his prescient views were totally excluded from the history of economics.|$|R
5|$|The College of Cardinals at {{the time}} {{did not have any}} {{cardinals}} that stood out, the number of papabili was larger than most conclaves. Accounts <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> sources listed up to 21 cardinals who were considered to have the possibility of being elected pope.|$|E
5|$|The album {{peaked at}} {{number one in}} eleven territories worldwide, {{including}} the United States (with first-week sales of 363,000 units), the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Switzerland. Invincible charted within the top ten in six other territories. Upon release, the album received mixed reviews <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> music critics.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> music critics, who complimented its serious tone. It {{was a hit}} on rock {{radio in}} the United States, where it peaked at number seven on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2001.|$|E

50|$|To this day, many {{bands are}} still highly {{influenced}} {{by the sound of}} Agression. The high-energy, surf guitar influenced sound and the distinctive voice of Hickey set them apart <b>from</b> <b>contemporaries</b> with their unique sound and attitude.|$|R
50|$|The stylistic {{influences}} on Rheinberger ranged <b>from</b> <b>contemporaries</b> such as Brahms to composers from earlier times, such as Mendelssohn, Schumann, Schubert and, above all, Bach. He {{was also an}} enthusiast for painting and literature (especially English and German).|$|R
5|$|A jazz fusion album, Songs of Experience {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by Gunther Schuller's Third Stream concept, which fused American jazz with European classical music. Axelrod supported his Baroque orchestrations {{on the album}} with rhythms and melodies from rock, R, and pop music. The album's suite is more orchestral and less rock-oriented than Song of Innocence. Its symphony is embellished with percussive sounds, British and Irish folk song elements, and stylistic innovations <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> arranger Gerald Wilson.|$|E
5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement, {{including those of the}} Narodnik agrarian-socialists. He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} those sessions, and {{subsequent}} sessions spanning decades from the original, have been culled and edited, with additions <b>from</b> <b>contemporaries</b> of Ellison into {{what has become}} a documentary following a rough arc of Ellison’s life and activities.|$|R
5|$|In {{this way}} he {{differed}} substantially <b>from</b> <b>contemporaries</b> such as Wagner and Berlioz, {{and even from}} Schumann and Chopin. The absence of significant stylistic development during Mendelssohn's career makes it appropriate to consider his works by genre, rather than in order of composition.|$|R
50|$|Wimber also {{differed}} <b>from</b> <b>contemporaries</b> in his {{rejection of}} the Word of Faith movement, and the associated doctrines and showiness. The pursuit of authenticity was {{at the core of}} Wimber's idea of church, and this was reflected in the worship as well.|$|R
5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
5|$|Gaga further {{clarified}} {{the ideas}} behind The Fame, and her inspirations and visions for the album. She {{believed that the}} most important thing missing <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> pop music was the combination of the visual imagery of the artist with the music. Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Dworkin {{published}} , which analyzes (and extensively cites examples drawn <b>from)</b> <b>contemporary</b> {{and historical}} pornography {{as an industry}} of woman-hating dehumanization. Dworkin argues that it is implicated in violence against women, both in its production (through the abuse of the women used to star in it), and in the social consequences of its consumption by encouraging men to eroticize the domination, humiliation, and abuse of women.|$|E
50|$|For example, John Jones (Talhaiarn) {{took his}} bardic name from his place of origin, to {{distinguish}} him <b>from</b> <b>contemporaries</b> {{with the name}} John Jones. The minister Joseph Harris (Gomer) selected his bardic name from the Bible. Others, such as Hedd Wyn, used poetic inventions.|$|R

5|$|In {{her book}} Bimal Roy's Madhumati: Untold Stories from Behind the Scenes, writer Rinki Bhattacharya {{compared}} the reincarnation theme of Magadheera {{with that of}} Madhumati (1958), Karz (1980), Karan Arjun (1995) and Om Shanti Om (2007). Touching the heroine unleashes locked memories within the hero that transport him to Rajasthan in 1609 <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> Hyderabad. Bhattacharya also compared Magadheera to another Telugu film, Mooga Manasulu (1964). Rajamouli told Subhash K. Jha that he was inspired by Karan Arjun to make films based on reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|Information <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> records {{regarding}} several writers {{from this}} period whose works are considered lost include: Maghanandi (probable author of Rama Kathe and guru of Kamalabhava of 1235), Srutakirti (guru of Aggala, and author of Raghava Pandaviya and possibly a Jina-stuti, 1170), Sambha Varma (mentioned by Nagavarma of 1145), Vira Nandi (Chandraprabha Kavyamala, 1175), Dharani Pandita (Bijjala raya Charita and Varangana Charita), Amrita Nandi (Dhanvantari Nighantu), Vidyanatha (Prataparudriya), Ganeshvara (Sahitya Sanjivana), Harabhakta, a Veerashaiva mendicant (Vedabhashya, 1300), and Siva Kavi (author of Basava Purana in 1330).|$|E
5|$|Offa's wife Cynethryth was {{the only}} Anglo-Saxon queen ever named or portrayed on coinage– in a {{remarkable}} series of pennies struck by the moneyer Eoba. These were probably derived <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> coins from {{the reign of the}} Byzantine emperor Constantine VI, who minted a series showing a portrait of his mother, the later Empress Irene, though the Byzantine coins show a frontal bust of Irene rather than a profile, and so cannot have been a direct model.|$|E

5|$|The Magyars, {{settled in}} the Pontic-Caspian steppe by the 830s, began a westward {{migration}} after their defeat {{by a coalition of}} Pechenegs and Bulgarians in about 895. They crossed the Carpathian Mountains, invading the surrounding area. Gelou is a local ruler described in the Gesta Hungarorum as an opponent of the invading Magyars. Anonymus did not write about Simeon I of Bulgaria, Svatopluk I of Moravia or other opponents known <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> sources, instead chronicling Magyar battles with local rulers (including Gelou, Menumorut and Salan) not mentioned in other primary sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, {{in terms of its}} actual page numbers, {{exhaustive}} research, and dense academic language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different <b>from</b> <b>contemporary</b> belief in social progress.|$|E
