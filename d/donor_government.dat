CGD first published the Index in Foreign Policy magazine in 2003 {{with the aim of}} provoking discussion, highlighting gaps in current knowledge, and encouraging policy reform. The Index was published annually in conjunction with Foreign Policy through 2006, and since published by CGD alone. David Roodman, Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development, is the chief architect of the Index with research and support from key collaborators for technical work on components. Although the formulas and analysis {{at the heart of the}} CDI remain the same, slight methodological changes occur every year and indicators are constantly updated. The CDI originally ranked 21 countries; South Korea was added in 2008 and five additional European countries were added in 2012: Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, and Slovakia. In 2008, regional CDIs were also published, assessing <b>donor</b> <b>government</b> policies and engagement to specific regions of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.|$|E

50|$|The Research Programme is reformulated {{every two}} years by the Institute’s {{director}} {{in consultation with the}} UNU-WIDER Board following extensive discussions with UNU-WIDER research staff, leading economists in the UN and elsewhere, and <b>donor</b> <b>government</b> representatives. Research projects are led by scholars (Research Fellows and External Project Directors) who elaborate the proposals before the projects are launched. Each project typically invites selected authors to write original research papers which are later presented and discussed at project workshops and conferences. In some cases, a more general 'call for papers' may be announced on the Institute’s website.Typically, two large development conferences are organized annually in Helsinki, each of which brings together around 100 individuals to present papers and to discuss current problems on development issues. Participants are usually researchers and policy makers from the academic, government, and development communities. Special attempts are made to encourage researchers from developing countries and to achieve a gender balance at these events.The research studies are published as WIDER working papers. The outcomes also often include a policy brief and an article in the WIDERAngle.|$|E
50|$|During its {{existence}} UNU-WIDER {{has produced a}} large amount of research on the broad topics of poverty, inequality and growth. The Research Programme changes every two years. It is constructed by the Director in consultation with the UNU-WIDER Board following extensive discussions with UNU-WIDER research staff, leading economists, and <b>donor</b> <b>government</b> representatives. Areas of research have spanned all facets and levels of development economics including topics like; Finance and trade; economic growth and the environment; women and development; international migration and refugees; micro-simulation of tax benefit reforms; social impact of privatization; fiscal policies for growth; transition and institutions; development aid; global trends in inequality and poverty; personal assets from a global perspective and many more. During the mid-1980s the Horn of Africa was confronting widespread famine. As this coincided with the launch of the very first UNU-WIDER research programme, the theme of “Hunger and Poverty: The Poorest Billion” was included in it. This research was directed by Jean Drèze and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen. It has been argued that the resulting three volumes of study transformed the thinking on issues of famine and food security at the time. In the late 1990s WIDER undertook a major study of income inequality trends throughout the world under the direction of its then director Giovanni Andrea Cornia. The study uncovered so called “new causes” of inequality linked to excessively liberal economic policies {{and the way in which}} economic reforms have been implemented. Furthermore, the study produced the first version of the World Income Inequality Database (WIID). It is a comprehensive and freely available database of statistics on inequality trends within countries. Since 2009, under director Finn Tarp, UNU-WIDER has concentrated widely on the “triple crisis” of food, climate change and finance.|$|E

There appear to be few cases of such joint coordination, especially in relation to the involvement of non-state armed groups, and very little information regarding lessons and best practices in relation to their principles, structure and processes. It is possible that much more joint coordination and lessons learning has occurred than can be found rapidly using open source searches, which makes it difficult to gauge what best practices for joint (<b>donor,</b> <b>government</b> and non-state armed actors) coordination of donor support for peace processes are...|$|E

40|$|How do {{the human}} rights {{practices}} abroad affect decisions about the allocation of foreign aid? This article provides {{a new approach to}} this long-standing question. We bring <b>donor</b> <b>government,</b> donor citizens, and recipients’ attributes together in a single analytical framework. We argue that donor citizens are more self-serving than previously assumed; they do not wholeheartedly support their government punishing human rights abusers when those states provide important policy benefits. When donor governments believe that their citizens will hold them accountable for their policy choices, they make foreign aid decisions that mirror citizens’ self-serving policy preferences. Thus, they avoid punishing repressive regimes that are the sources of valuable benefits. Our experimental and observational results provide support for our claims. Overall, our findings suggest that aid donors selectively punish human rights violators with aid cuts, but their variegated treatment of human rights violators largely stems from the self-serving policy preferences of their voters...|$|E

The structure of the competition {{is important to the}} donor in terms of achieving good governance, and to the recipients {{in terms of what they}} receive. The leaders of potential recipient countries look at aid availability through this contest as part of the competing objectives they face – some good, some not good. The donor country prefers a contest under which the aid will only go to one country while the leaders of the receiving countries prefer that each country obtains the proportion of aid relative to its governance quality. If poverty reduction is an independent goal as well, a poverty trap may be created. With good governance as a criterion, donors may work through both bilateral and multilateral agencies. foreign aid, governance, decentralization, rent seeking...|$|E

The results show that fractionalization increases donors’ aid budgets, representing the over-time variation of our instrument, while the probability of receiving aid introduces variation across recipient countries. Controlling for country- and period-specific effects that capture the levels of the interacted variables, the interaction provides a powerful and excludable instrument. Making use of the instrument, our results show no significant effect of aid on growth in the overall sample. We also investigate the effect of aid on consumption, savings, and investments, and split the sample according to the quality of economic policy, democracy, and the Cold War period.

40|$|Equalizing aid {{can be used}} by the fed-eral {{government}} to equalize fiscal out-comes or resources among subnational governments, or by states to equalize outcomes or resources among local gov-ernments. Although equalizing aid can sometimes be justified in part on effi-ciency grounds, we focus on its primary function, namely, to achieve equity ob-jectives. ’ The equity objective of a <b>donor</b> <b>government</b> can take many forms. The central theme of this paper is that the appropriate design for an equalizing aid program depends on the form of this objective. Intergovernmental aid is not, of course, the only tool higher-level governments can use to assist poor or troubled lower-level governments. State governments, for example, can achieve equity objec-tives by altering the fiscal arrangements within which local governments operate. A state could take over from local gov-ernments the financing of certain ser-vices, such as social services, that place large burdens on a few jurisdictions, * or, to counter fiscal disparities in education financing, a state could encourage the merger of school districts.

However, we find that aid provided by coordinated market economies increases military expenditure in the full sample of recipient countries, even after controlling for outliers.
