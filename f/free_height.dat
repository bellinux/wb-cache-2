40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to analyze the flow pattern of cooling fluids in the 3 D 2 ̆ 2 twister-effect 2 ̆ 2 mixing chamber and to approximate the free surface behaviors exiting the 2 D spray nozzle. The cone angle and <b>free</b> surface <b>height</b> located {{at the end of}} the free surface are two significant factors to determine the spraying area on a heated plane. This process is a reasonable representation of many industrial cooling application. The whole system consists of 4 inlet tubes connected to the top of the mixing chamber, and the spray nozzle is located under the chamber. Four different refrigerants, like FC- 72, FC- 77, FC- 87 and methanol were used for the turbulent flow simulations. According to different fluid properties, the cone angle, free surface, pressure drop and Reynolds number can be investigated at different flow rates. First, at a certain volumetric flow rates, the velocities in x, y, z directions were found on the positive x-axis (0 degree), y-axis (90 degrees), negative x-axis (180 degrees) and y-axis (270 degrees) at 8. 0 x 10 â»â´ m below the top of chamber. After the transformations, the interpolated and averaged radial, circumferential and axial velocities were used in the 2 D nozzle simulations. Finally, the cone angle, the radial locations of the free surface and the pressure drop were obtained in each scenario. As the results, higher volumetric flow rate produced higher <b>free</b> surface <b>height</b> and cone angle. Also, FC- 87 created the highest <b>free</b> surface <b>height</b> and cone angle among all four working fluids in both volumetric flow rates. It means that FC- 87 can produce the largest spraying area on the heated surface. Fluctuation, spinning and eddy circulation can be found in the velocity plot because of the turbulent flow syndromes. When comparing two different nozzle designs, it was found that the nozzle without mixing chamber gave a larger cone angle and <b>free</b> surface <b>height.</b> Alternatively, the design in this investigation produced a relatively narrow jet concentrated to the stagnation zone...|$|R

40|$|A {{thin layer}} of fluid flowing down a solid planar surface has a <b>free</b> surface <b>height</b> {{described}} by a nonlinear PDE derived via the lubrication approximation from the Navier Stokes equations. For thin films, surface tension {{plays an important role}} both in providing a significant driving force and in smoothing the free surface. Surfactant molecules on the free surface tend to reduce surface tension, setting up gradients that modify the shape of the free surface. In earlier work [12, 13 J a traveling wave was found in which the free surface undergoes three sharp transitions, or internal layers, and the surfactant is distributed over a bounded region. This triple-step traveling wave satisfies a system of PDE, a hyperbolic conservation law for the <b>free</b> surface <b>height,</b> and a degenerate parabolic equation describing the surfactant distribution.

40|$|For steady {{two-dimensional}} {{free surface}} flow over a horizontal impervious base, the Dupuit-Forchheimer theory {{assumes that the}} vertical component of velocity is zero, even for non-zero accretion rate at the free surface. -This is improved by assuming that the vertical velocity component is zero at the base, and is proportional to height above the base. This requires the piezometric head to depend linearly on {{the square of the}} height, and the two parameters in this relation can be fitted to the two boundary conditions at the free surface, to give an expression for the free surface slope in terms of accretion, <b>free</b> surface <b>height,</b> and the pressure integral. For problems in which the pressure integral is known explicitly, this first order of ordinary differential equation for the <b>free</b> surface <b>height</b> can be solved numerically.

40|$|The inner lining {{concept is}} a method to prevent water leakage {{and the risk of}} icing inside tunnels and is {{frequently}} used in countries with cold climate. Blocks of falling ice may result is a severe safety risk in both road and railway tunnels. Although several established inner lining systems exist, finding the optimal solution considering function, maintenance- and investment cost is a challenging task. A new system has recently been used in Sweden and is due to its success planned to be used for the Stockholm Bypass, an 18 km road tunnel project in Stockholm. A set of design criterions has been stipulated for the inner lining system. In this paper, the case of impact loading from falling rocks is studied. The inner lining system is required to withstand the impact of a 600 kg block landing on a square surface of 0. 2 x 0. 2 m. The <b>free</b> fall <b>height,</b> i. e. the distance to the rock surface, is typically less than 0. 5 m but may span up to 1. 5  m in some cases. A too conservative design may result in an unnecessary thick structure and lack of knowledge of the impact phenomena may result in an unsafe design. An extensive experimental program has been performed, consisting of representative parts of the inner lining system. A mass of 600 kg is dropped onto the structure and the results are compared with numerical simulations.
