30|$|The IGS {{real-time}} service (RTS) enables real-time precise {{point positioning}} (PPP) at a global scale. A long convergence time however {{is still a}} challenging factor. In {{order to reduce the}} convergence time, external troposphere corrections could be introduced to remove the troposphere effects on the coordinate solution. This paper proposes the use of a local troposphere model to augment real-time PPP. First, undifferenced observations from a network of multiple stations are processed to estimate the station-based troposphere zenith wet delay (ZWD). A set of local troposphere fitting coefficients are then derived using a proposed optimal fitting model. Finally, the determined troposphere fitting coefficients are broadcast to users to reduce the convergence time in the user solution. A continuous operating reference station (CORS) network is utilized to assess the performance of the proposed approach under quiet and active troposphere conditions. The numerical results show that the overall <b>fitting</b> <b>precisions</b> of the local troposphere model can reach 1.42 and 1.05  cm under the two troposphere conditions. The convergence time of the positioning solutions, especially the height solution, can be greatly reduced using the local troposphere model. The horizontal accuracy of 9.2  cm and the vertical accuracy of 10.1  cm are obtainable under the quiet troposphere condition after 20  min of initialization time, compared to the 14.7  cm horizontal and 21.5  cm vertical accuracies in the conventional troposphere estimation approach. Moreover, the horizontal accuracies of 13.0  cm and the vertical accuracies of 12.4  cm have also been obtained after 20  min under the active troposphere condition.|$|R

However, the impacts of dual tasking on performance and prioritization in ecologically-valid paradigms are less well-studied. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the changes in trunk kinematics, arm kinematics, speech, and syntactic complexity in a dual task requiring standing manual <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> and speech. ^ Methods: 15 young adult female participants participated in one experimental session in a one-factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) design, with the repeated factor of condition. They were asked to complete eight conditions of the dual task and a control condition of standing and speech (no <b>precision</b> <b>fitting).</b> For the manual <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> task, participants were asked to pick up a block, reach it into a board with an opening, and then hold it in the opening for 40 seconds without hitting the sides. Difficulty was varied by reach distance (near or far), opening size of the fitting board (large or small), and with the addition of speech (with speech or without speech). Kinematic measures included: peak arm velocity, acceleration, straightness of wrist motion, wrist – trunk coordination, and wrist – center of mass coordination. Speech and language measures included the total number of pauses per second, average duration of pauses for each trial, utterance length, sound pressure level, speech rate, and syntactic complexity. ^ Results: Overall, participants were able to successfully complete a dual task of <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> and speech without task failure. Participants generally prioritized precise completion of speech samples over accurate completion of the task. Number of pauses per second were lower for the standing and speech (no reaching) condition compared to any dual task conditions. Sound pressure level was higher for the standing and speech (no reaching) condition compared to the near distance small opening with speech condition. With the addition of speech to the task, maximum trunk velocity while reaching increased, as well as average wrist velocity and standard deviation of the wrist while holding the block in the opening. However, the addition of speech did not impact arm kinematics while reaching. With the large opening, acceleration/deceleration time and average wrist velocity increased. ^ Conclusions: In a dual task of <b>precision</b> <b>fitting</b> and speech of this type, participants maintained adequate performance on both tasks. They modified kinematic arm and trunk movements to complete the fitting task with little effect on speech, suggesting that young adults can effectively modify their kinematic movements to prioritize speech without compromising performance on the fitting task. Increased pausing was noted in the dual tasks, suggesting that young adults produce shorter utterances when engaged in a dual task. It is possible that this is a result of task switching in which young adults must attend to reaching and speech alternatively as opposed to standing and talking without a dual task. Further research is required to understand the factors which impact prioritization of this dual task and others, particularly those which have different consequences associated with task failure. ...|$|R

However, little research has examined the development of the coordination between posture and manual control throughout childhood.

The criteria used to assess the performance were based on <b>fitting</b> <b>precision,</b> accuracy and detection limit, determined from the analysis of international geochemical reference materials. The <b>fitting</b> <b>precision</b> of the B 2 XRS and PXRF was found to be in agreement with the Horwitz function (a benchmark relating the analysed concentration of an analyte to its uncertainty) over 4 orders of magnitude of concentration range from 10 - 1 to 10 - 5 g/g.

The detection limits for the spectrometers ranked in the same order as the accuracy as a result of improving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of elemental peaks, which is a direct consequence of improving resolution between these spectrometers.
