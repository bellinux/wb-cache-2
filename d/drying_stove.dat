50|$|Field then {{commenced}} {{the cultivation}} {{in his own}} garden, and from roots of his own growth produced beautiful specimens of colouring matter. A contrivance, both mechanical and chemical, was still wanted to reduce the liquor to its finest consistence. His invention of the ‘physeter’ or percolator by atmospheric pressure admirably accomplished this purpose. He exhibited his percolator, together with an improved <b>drying</b> <b>stove</b> and press, before the Society of Arts, and was awarded their gold Isis medal in 1816 ‘for his apparatus for preparing coloured lakes.’ Both apparatus are figured and described by him in the Society's ‘Transactions,’ xxxiv. 87-94. Oddly enough the percolator was patented by others several years after, and applied to the clearing of sugar. Field continued his application of science to {{the purposes of the}} artist with good effect; his dexterity and care in the preparation of delicate colours set all competition at defiance. Among his other inventions may be mentioned his metrochrome and his conical lenses, which produced a continuous rainbow with varied effects of refractions.|$|E
40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) {{cultivation}} in Ghana {{has been}} ongoing for centuries. Maize production in Ghana, is predominantly done under rain-fed conditions by poorly resourced smallholder farmers. The agro-ecological zones for maize cultivation in Ghana can be mainly grouped into four; Coastal savannah zone, forest zone, transition zone and Guinea savannah zone. Maize accounts for 50 % {{of the total}} cereal production in Ghana, with reported postharvest losses between 5 % and 70 %. Improving food security through a reduction of post-harvest losses is imperative for meeting current development objectives. Stored maize is attacked by 20 different species of insect pests including the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Mots.). There are traditional techniques still in use for maize storage (drying in field, on platform, on ground, and use of mud silos) and modern techniques (using metal silos, solar dryers, chemical, hermetic technique and Purdue Improved <b>Drying</b> <b>Stove).</b> There are various methods used in the maize shelling and storage. Purchasing of modern equipment for shelling and conditioning is highly unaffordable by these subsistence farmers. The lack of commercial or industrial processing of maize, and improper storage facilities is causing immense food losses and insecurity in Ghana. Due to this farmers are compelled to sell their bumper harvest at low prices, and those in barns and warehouses get rotten. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to review literature on the cultivation, post-harvest handling, and processing of maize grains in Ghana...|$|E

50|$|The sand may be {{delivered}} by gravity, by a steam-blast (steam locomotives) or by compressed air. Gravity sanding {{requires that the}} sand be dry so that it runs freely. Locomotives used multiple sandboxes, so that their delivery pipes could be short and near-vertical. Engine sheds in the UK were equipped with sand <b>drying</b> <b>stoves,</b> so that sandboxes could be refilled each morning with dry sand. Steam locomotives in the USA had a single sandbox, called a sand dome {{on top of the}} boiler where the rising heat helped to dry the sand. Even with this arrangement, sand pipes tended to clog, and by the 1880s, pneumatic sanding systems were being proposed.|$|R
40|$|The current {{paper is}} focused on the quality indexes of {{integral}} egg powder stored in different microclimate conditions. Failure of temperature and air moisture content leads to depreciation of egg powder quality in a more accelerated way than at eggs. From those reasons we aimed to study the evolution of qualitative parameters during storage in different environmental conditions. For that, we constituted 3 batches were we have determine the sensorial characteristics of the product, solubility and pH value. In addition with those determinations were effectuated a series of chemical analysis, tracking water content which was determined by <b>drying</b> <b>stove,</b> dry matter (%) and content in mineral substances (mg/ 100 g) which was determined through atomic absorption spectrometric method (AAS) with a GBC-AVANTA spectrophotometer type. The first observed modifications, after sensorial control, were mentioned in the 90 th day at batch Lexp- 2 which presented modifications of aspect and consistency (instable agglomerations). Regarding pH value this one suffer modifications during those 180 days of storage, the recorded values at final being higher with 1. 84 % at batch Lc, 8. 91 % at batch Lexp- 1 and with 10. 38 % at batch Lexp- 2. Regarding the chemical content of analysed product, experimental factors influenced only water content respectively the dry matter content, determinations being made on mineral substances (Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg). In conclusion we can say that the failure of pack type and of microclimate factors assured during storage leads to depreciation of the product in a quite short time.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Sun-dried pears of Portuguese S. Bartolomeu variety are {{relatively}} small fruits with peculiar organolephtic characteristics. The open sun drying has some disadvantages related with drying efficiency and food safety. However the drying with an economic and friendly energy is an important characteristic of the drying methods and therefore several {{attempts have been made}} to develop processes using solar drying. The present work studies two types of pears <b>drying,</b> namely solar <b>stove</b> and tunnel <b>drying,</b> using the solar energy and simultaneously reducing the exposure of fruits to contamination agents. Both processes were conducted in two consecutive years to analyse if the behaviour of each drying method shows evidence of a similar pattern. The results enable us to conclude that the variation of normalized moisture of pears with the drying time follows a linear relationship while an exponential decay is observed in the tunnel drying. Despite the different climatic conditions, it is possible still to observe that the behavior of each process is quite similar in both consecutive years. However, in the year of 2008 the drying tends to be faster in both processes. In addition, it is also possible to conclude that the Total Soluble Solids/Acidity ratio has a similar behavior along the drying in the two years for each process. However, the decrease of acidity of pears in solar stove is more pronounced than the TSS and consequently a higher ratio of Total Soluble Solids/Acidity is observed along the solar <b>stove</b> <b>drying</b> when compared with the tunnel drying...|$|R

60|$|Too much manure renders {{some kinds}} utterly sterile, as I have myself observed. The {{tendency}} to sterility from this cause runs in families; thus, according to Gartner (18/80. 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss der Befruchtung' 1844 s. 333.), {{it is hardly}} possible to give too much manure to most Gramineae, Cruciferae, and Leguminosae, whilst succulent and bulbous-rooted plants are easily affected. Extreme poverty of soil is less apt to induce sterility; but dwarfed plants of Trifolium minus and repens, growing on a lawn often mown and never manured, were found by me not to produce any seed. The temperature of the soil, and the season at which plants are watered, often have a marked effect on their fertility, as was observed by Kolreuter {{in the case of}} Mirabilis. (18/81. 'Nova Acta Petrop.' 1793 page 391.) Mr. Scott, in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh, observed that Oncidium divaricatum would not set seed when grown in a basket in which it throve, but was capable of fertilisation in a pot where it was a little damper. Pelargonium fulgidum, for many years after its introduction, seeded freely; it then became sterile; now it is fertile (18/82. 'Cottage Gardener' 1856 pages 44, 109.) if kept in a <b>dry</b> <b>stove</b> during the winter. Other varieties of pelargonium are sterile and others fertile without our being able to assign any cause. Very slight changes in the position of a plant, whether planted on a bank or at its base, sometimes make all the difference in its producing seed. Temperature apparently has a much more powerful influence on the fertility of plants than on that of animals. Nevertheless it is wonderful what changes some few plants will withstand with undiminished fertility: thus the Zephyranthes candida, a native of the moderately warm banks of the Plata, sows itself in the hot dry country near Lima, and in Yorkshire resists the severest frosts, and I have seen seeds gathered from pods which had been covered with snow during three weeks. (18/83. Dr. Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' page 176.) Berberis wallichii, from the hot Khasia range in India, is uninjured by our sharpest frosts, and ripens its fruit under our cool summers. Nevertheless, I presume we must attribute to change of climate the sterility of many foreign plants; thus, the Persian and Chinese lilacs (Syringa persica and chinensis), though perfectly hardy here, never produce a seed; the common lilac (S. vulgaris) seeds with us moderately well, but in parts of Germany the capsules never contain seed. (18/84. Gartner 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss' etc. s. 560, 564.) Some few of the cases, given in the last chapter, of self-impotent plants, might have been here introduced, as their state seems due to the conditions to which they have been subjected.|$|R

40|$|We {{the report}} {{results of a}} coordinated {{mitigation}} effort aimed at reducing arsenic (As) exposure in three counties of Guizhou province, China. Mitigation occurred in 2005 and encompassed 21 villages with 47, 000 inhabitants, {{who were exposed to}} high levels of As in their diet through consumption of As-contaminated chili peppers and corn <b>dried</b> over unventilated <b>stoves</b> that burned coal containing high levels of As. The coal was mined by villagers from local pits. Inhalation of air that contained high levels of As contributed to approximately 25 % of the daily As intake of 6 – 9 mg. Before mitigation, a baseline survey of 45, 364 residents in 2004 identified more than 2, 800 individuals with arsenicosis. The survey also found that many residents were aware of the health effects of As in general but lacked in-depth understanding of the link between coal use and arsenicosis. Consequently, an overwhelming majority (> 95 %) continued to use high-As coal. This survey provided the basis for a health education campaign that promoted lifestyle changes coupled with the shutting down of local coal pits and the installation of 10, 000 new stoves with chimneys for ventilation. The cost of the mitigation was about 4 million Yuan RMB (US$ 500, 000) and was financed mostly by the government. A postmitigation response survey in 2005 found that > 85 % of the residents now associate the use of coal with arsenicosis; > 90 % correctly learned to operate the new ventilated stoves; and > 90 % dry corn and chili peppers outdoors in the sun. Urinary As concentrations in the region decreased from 0. 198 ± 0. 300 mg/L (n = 144) in 2004 to 0. 049 ± 0. 009 mg/L (n = 50) in 2005 in individuals with arsenicosis (p < 0. 01), which is consistent with the behavior changes...|$|R
40|$|Echinostomiasis is a {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} intestinal trematodes and transmitted by the ingestion of mollusks, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, and reptiles, either raw or poorly cooked. Today human infection is endemic in Southeast Asia and the Far East, {{but has been}} reportedmore recently in {{other regions of the}} world. Interestingly eggs identified as Echinostoma sp. were found in coprolites fromamummified body human in Brazil, dated 560 ± 40 BP (before present). However, the specific diagnosis based on morphology of the eggs has not been resolved at the species level. As a follow-up to the previous finding, the current study now aims to standardize the methodology for molecular diagnosis and apply it to the coprolite, using current Echinostoma paraenseipositive feces as the reference, and also the same fecal material <b>dried</b> in a <b>stove</b> as an experimental coprolite model. Isolated eggs of E. paraensei and adultwormwere included to verify the sensibility and as positive control, respectively. An adult worm of E. luisreyi was used for comparison. PCR using primers in-house for ITS 1 region (126 bp) and cox 1 (123 bp) of Echinostoma spp. and subsequent nucleotide sequencing were performed. This is the first molecular paleoparasitological diagnosis for echinostomiasis. The methodology was able to amplify specific DNA fragments for the genus Echinostoma sp. in all samples: adult worm, feces, and a single egg of the parasite, in both the experimental coprolite and archaeological sample. Additionally we observed that ancient DNA can also be retrieved without rehydrating the material. The nucleotide sequences from E. paraensei and E. luisreyi are very similar in the fragment analyzed that difficult the differentiation these species, but DNA sequence analysis recovered in the parasite found in the mummy showed more similarity with the species E. paraensei...|$|R
