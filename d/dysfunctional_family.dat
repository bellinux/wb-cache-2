The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, <b>dysfunctional</b> <b>family</b> life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E

University of Jyväskylä. Department of Education. Inclusion {{has been seen}} in many {{communities}} as a useful strategy in addressing learners’ diversity. Children from dysfunctional background usually have various needs and problems. The theoretical framework of inclusion {{was used as a}} lens to study the support to the needs of diverse learners, including children form <b>dysfunctional</b> <b>families,</b> from the school part in Belarus. The {{purpose of the study was}} to understand how the scope of support to children from <b>dysfunctional</b> <b>families</b> carried out by schools in Belarus fits the idea of inclusion. Another matter of interest was to research into teachers' understanding of inclusion and their attitude and perception of children from <b>dysfunctional</b> <b>families.</b> In this study,I followed an interpretivist paradigm and adopted an instrumental case study design. The data was collected through the review of international and national documents governing school support and care of children from <b>dysfunctional</b> <b>families</b> and internal school documents. In addition, a web-based survey involving schoolteachers, altogether 12 people, was conducted. Teachers participated based on their availability and willingness. The results suggest that the Belarusian legislation system relative to child support meets the requirements of international laws. The system of school support is constructed on the provisions of the law and has the principle of humanism in its core. The school strictly monitors children from <b>dysfunctional</b> <b>families</b> and carries out their sustainable support. However, Belarusian teachers do not understand the concept of inclusion in its full scope and have numerous barriers towards implementation of inclusive practices at school...|$|R
