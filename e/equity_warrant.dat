5000|$|RBF {{is often}} {{described}} as sitting between a bank loan, typically requiring collateral or significant assets, and angel investment or venture capital, which involve selling an equity portion of the business in exchange for the investment. [...] In an RBF investment, investors do not take an upfront ownership stake (equity) in the business, usually taking a small <b>equity</b> <b>warrant</b> instead. RBF investments usually do not require a seat on the company's board of directors, and no valuation exercise is necessary to make the investment. Nor does RBF require the backing of the loan by founder's personal assets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether two securities {{that have}} identical payoffs, the <b>equity</b> <b>warrant</b> and the exchange traded option, are priced differently {{when they are}} subject to different microstructure issues. The results show that different trading processes, the behaviour of market makers and short-selling restrictions seem to have an effect on relative pricing. This study indicates that, on average, a warrant is priced higher relative to an equivalent option. It appears that this pricing difference may be related to greater liquidity in the warrant market as compared to the option market...|$|E

We investigate both the announcement and issuance price effect using an event study methodology with a 21 day event window. Taking into account outliers, it is shown that the introduction of equity warrants leads to a negative and permanent effect around both the announcement and issuance date. To test for the effect of warrant introduction on the volatility, we calculate the before and after, unadjusted and adjusted volatility to obtain the respective unadjusted and adjusted volatility ratios of the underlying stock. We find that no significant impact occurs on the volatility of the underlying stock neither at the announcement nor at the issuance event date...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of long term <b>equity</b> <b>warrant</b> markets has been {{hampered by the}} difficulty of providing dividend protection to investors in an easily understood form. A recent Australian innovation, the Endowment Warrant, is a long-term call option offering a form of dividend protection. Its simple structure has made it popular with retail investors. However, valuation of the option is complex, since {{it is a long}} term option with a stochastic strike price. This paper reviews what is meant by dividend protection and demonstrates that endowment warrants provide only a form of partial dividend protection. Examining the cost of incomplete dividend protection to investors indicates that the warrants issued have traded at prices significantly in excess of their fair value. Some possible causes of this divergence, and lessons for the construction of new securities are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} {{to assess the}} value of the financial claims issued by the firm, European equity options and warrantsin terms of the stock price. In our framework, the firm's asset is assumed to follow a standard stationary lognormal process with constant volatility. However, it is not the case for equity volatility. The stochastic nature of equity volatility is endogenous, and comes from the impact of a change in {{the value of the}} firm's assets on the financial leverage. In a previous paper we studied the stochastic process for equity volatility, and proposed analytic approximations for different capital structures. In this companion paper we derive analytic approximations for the value of European equity options and warrants for a firm financed by equity, debt and warrants. We first present the basic model, which is an extension of the Black-Scholes model, to value corporate securities either as a function of the stock price, or as a function of the firm's total assets. Since stock prices are observable, then for practical purposes, traders prefer to use the stock as the underlying instrument, we concentrate on valuation models in terms of the stock price. Second, we derive an exact solution for the valuation in terms of the stock price of (i) a European call option on the stock of a levered firm, i. e. a European compound call option on the total assets of the firm, (ii) an <b>equity</b> <b>warrant</b> for an all-equity firm, and (iii) an <b>equity</b> <b>warrant</b> for a firm financed by equity and debt. Unfortunately, to compute these solutions we need to specify the function of the stock price in terms of the firm's assets value. In general we are unable to specify this expression, but we propose tight bounds for the value of these options which can be easily computed as a function of the stock price. Our results provide useful extensions of the Black-Scholes model. corporate finance, financial structure, leverage effect, option pricing, security valuation, stochastic volatility, warrants, numerical methods,...|$|E

40|$|Discrepancies {{between the}} Black-Scholes value of Japanese <b>equity</b> <b>warrants</b> and their {{observed}} prices are explained {{in part by}} the stochastic volatility of changes in prices of the underlying stocks. We fit GARCH and EGARCH models to the stochastic volatility and briefly compare their performance to the CEV model. A hopscotch algorithm is used to value the warrants {{in the presence of the}} stochastic stock price volatility. The stochastic volatility-hopscotch warrant values still differ substantially from corresponding prices; in contrast, away-from-the-money short-term Nikkei 225 options valued with the same stochastic volatility models are close to observed prices.
