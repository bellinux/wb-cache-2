40|$|Campylobacter jejuni {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{sporadic}} food-borne bacterial disease in humans. In <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> and pig <b>rearing</b> systems the use of oral antibiotics is essential to maintain health. Consequently, there is a high risk for the thermophilic Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli resident in the intestinal tract of food animals to develop resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Contamination of meat or eggs with pathogenic strains of resistant Campylobacter could, therefore, result in a form of campylobacteriosis in humans that is difficult to treat. The aim of this investigation was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. isolated from pigs and poultry by the broth microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. A total of 482 samples from the Western Cape and Gauteng provinces was collected and analysed. Thirty-eight Campylobacter isolates were obtained. Analysis of data revealed that C. jejuni strains mainly of poultry origin were more resistant to the fluoroquinolones, macrolides and tetracyclines and the C. coli strains were more resistant to the macrolides and lincosamides. Multiresistance was also detected in 4 Campylobacter strains from the Western Cape. With the exception of tetracyclines, strains from high health Gauteng broiler farms were susceptible to antibiotics used to treat Campylobacter infections...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} work {{was made a}} review of {{possibilities}} to ensure the mineral requirements of <b>poultry</b> <b>reared</b> in organic farms from western area of Romania. Insufficient documentation related {{to the use of}} mineral resources in feeding the <b>poultry</b> <b>reared</b> in organic farms leads to the regarding of these as "chemicals" that may not be used for food. Therefore in this paper we proposed to introduce: - the need to use sources of macro and micro minerals to satisfy the requirements of different categories of <b>poultry</b> <b>reared</b> in organic farms; - the experience of advanced countries in this field and possibilities for design of local minerals premix in accordance with national and community legislation. It can be said that a ration for combined forages for <b>poultry</b> <b>reared</b> in organic farms in the western area of Romania it may be mineral equilibrated by respecting national and European regulations...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} potential ammonia impacts on a sand dune nature reserve 600 m upwind of an <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> unit. Ammonia concentrations and total nitrogen deposition were measured over a calendar year. A series of ammonia and nitrogen exposure experiments using dune grassland species {{were conducted in}} controlled manipulations and in the field. Ammonia emissions from the <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> unit were detected up to 2. 8 km upwind, contributing to exceedance of critical levels of ammonia 800 m upwind and exceedance of critical loads of nitrogen 2. 8 km upwind. Emissions contributed 30 % of the total N load {{in parts of the}} upwind conservation site.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to estimate the}} income from native poultry production and analyze the efficiency of resources used covering three coastal districts of Bangladesh namely Noakhali, Patuakhali and Satkhira. A total of 180 poultry rearers were selected from different villages of the districts using purposive sampling technique. Primary and secondary data were collected and analyzed following a combination of descriptive statistics, sensitivity analysis, statistical model and mathematical technique. Gross and net returns per household per day from native <b>poultry</b> <b>rearing</b> were estimated at Tk. 34. 04 and Tk. 27. 93, respectively. The undiscounted benefit cost ratio was 5. 57, implying that this enterprise is highly profitable. Moreover, the contribution from <b>poultry</b> <b>rearing</b> to total income was 8. 25 percent. Sensitivity analysis shows that the gross margins and benefit cost ratios were strongly influenced by the {{factors such as the}} cost of inputs, price of outputs and poultry inventory. Multiple Regression model revealed that almost all variables were influenced income from native <b>poultry</b> farming except <b>rearing</b> cost. Increasing returns to scale was found which indicates that there was bright prospect to earn more through the use of more inputs in the production process. Finally, a number of problems faced by the poultry farmers were identified and some suggestions were recommended accordingly...|$|R

25|$|According to the {{researchers}} and scientists, 74% of the world's poultry meat, and 68 percent of eggs are produced {{in ways that are}} described as 'intensive'. One alternative to <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> farming is free-range farming using lower stocking densities. Poultry producers routinely use nationally approved medications, such as antibiotics, in feed or drinking water, to treat disease or to prevent disease outbreaks. Some FDA-approved medications are also approved for improved feed utilization.|$|R
30|$|The {{rapid growth}} of <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> {{production}} has generated {{a large number of}} poultry by-products that creates a serious environmental problem (Jayathilakan et al. 2012). These by-products are potential sources of pathogenic microorganisms which can cause disease spread when not managed properly (Shih 1992). However, they are mainly organic materials and are convertible to useful resources (Brandelli et al. 2015). Therefore, waste management becomes an important consideration for sustainability of poultry production.|$|R
50|$|In {{part due}} to the {{conditions}} on <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> farms and recent recalls of large quantities of eggs, there is a growing movement for small-scale micro-flocks or 'backyard chickens'. This involves keeping small numbers of hens (usually no more than a dozen) in suburban or urban residential areas to control bugs, to utilize chicken waste as fertilizer in small gardens, and of course for the high-quality eggs and meat that are produced.|$|R
40|$|Diseases and infections {{have always}} been a major concern to <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> {{production}} industry. Pathogen contamination of farming environments can be prevented using proper health care products such as disinfectants. This study evaluated the efficiency of commonly used disinfectants against bacteria occurring in <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> farming environments in Imo State, Nigeria. The efficacy of six commercial disinfectants namely; Izal ®, Z-germicide ®, Diskol ®, Virkon ®, Vox ® and CID 20 ® in reducing the number of micro-organisms was assessed. Among the tested disinfectants, Virkon ® (oxidizing agents) was the most efficient, reducing the micro-organisms by 95 %. The in vitro test carried out to verify the effectiveness of disinfectants did not consider the adverse conditions found in the poultry farms. Therefore, the evaluation of the efficacy of on-farm reconstituted disinfectants over time was also carried out. The results indicated that efficacy of all the disinfectants was reduced during the afternoon. However, efficacy gradually increased during the evening for all the disinfectants {{but not as much as}} was observed in the morning. Temperature, it seems affects the activity of the disinfectants against the bacterial organisms...|$|R

Training courses in skills such as growing vegetables, tailoring and <b>poultry</b> <b>rearing,</b> and in forming and organising self-help groups, help women start small individual and group enterprises. Self-help groups support their members, and enable them to save small amounts regularly and address issues such as nutrition, health and education. MPRLP also runs leadership development courses to empower women from less well represented socio-economic groups.|$|R
25|$|The {{economy is}} chiefly agricultural. Cattle, sheep, pig rearing and some horse {{breeding}} {{are the main}} types of husbandry practiced. <b>Poultry</b> <b>rearing,</b> once popular, has very much declined. Wheat, barley, rapeseed, and oats are grown, as are potatoes. Sugar beet is no longer grown due to the withdrawal of EU subsidies. The numbers involved in farming have been declining {{for many years and}} many of the seasonal workers are now eastern Europeans. Mushrooms are also grown indoors. Tomatoes are grown under glass, for example at Campile.|$|R

40|$|Fifty-four fecal {{samples taken}} from broiler {{chickens}} from 1 to 45 days of age, and of pullets from 10 to 13 weeks of age, original from eight different poultry {{regions in the}} state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were collected from March 2008 to January 2010 for avian Orthoreovirus (ARV) and avian Rotavirus (AvRV) analyses. For the assay of ARV, RNA was immediately extracted (Trizolâ) and transcribed into cDNA for assaying in a nested-PCR with ARV-specific primers. For AvRV, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed with RNA extracts obtained by phenol-chloroform extraction. CAV was additionally investigated through a nested-PCR of thymus and spleen. Results found 5. 55 % positive for ARV and 9. 25 % for AvRV. Also, CAV and ARV genomes were detected in co-infection, in a highly prostrated and claudicating chicken flock. No ARV or AvRV infections were detected in pullets. Material of a clinically affected flock was inoculated into SPF embryos, resulting in embryonic hemorrhage, whitish foci in the chorio-allantoic membrane and death. Sequencing of ARV amplicons and isolate cDNA grouped local strains with the ARV S 1133 strain, historically used in live vaccines, suggesting the continued circulation of this vaccine virus strain in <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> regions. Detection rates for ARV and AvRV, as well as the presence of CAV, were additionally indicative of failing biosecurity strategies for the <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> regions examined...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 2, 840 1 -d-old broiler chicks and 450 1 -d-old layer chicks {{were used in}} three {{experiments}} to determine the nutritional value of corn- and sorghum-based diets in <b>poultry</b> <b>reared</b> in West Africa. In the broiler experiments, birds fed corn had greater average daily gain (P 0. 18). Particle size treatments did not affect growth performance or carcass characteristics (P> 0. 20).

30|$|Poultry play an {{important}} economic, nutritional and socio-cultural role in the livelihoods of poor rural households in developing countries, including Ethiopia. The total poultry population in Ethiopia is estimated at 43 million, 97 % of which are village chickens (Central Statistical Agency 2012). <b>Poultry</b> <b>rearing</b> is particularly important to women, who often own and manage chickens and the resulting income {{is often used to}} support education of children. Despite its role in raising incomes and reducing poverty in local communities of Ethiopia, poultry production is hampered by wide arrays of constraints among which infectious diseases, such as: Newcastle disease, Infectious Bursal Disease, Mycoplasmosis, Pasteurellosis and Salmonellosis, are the major ones (Chaka et al. 2012).|$|R
