2500|$|Fratele mai deştept al lui <b>Kalaşnikov,</b> which {{comprises}} several stories, received mixed reviews. According to Andrei Terian, {{the main}} one, Articolul 96 ("Article 96"), {{which is about}} a lecherous politician dating an anorexic model, has the same defects as Crime.... In contrast, Terian notes, Gârbea shows his [...] "sure hand" [...] in other pieces, where he parodies Povestea unui om leneş ("The Story of a Lazy Man") by 19th century Romanian classic Ion Creangă, or where he pokes fun at the 14th century Battle of Rovine, as well as the absurdist Întoarcerea tatei din război. Subiecte ("Father's Return from War. Subjects"), where the same narrative cliché is explored from several conflicting perspectives. According to Terian, the volume as a whole displays influences from poet and satirist Tudor Arghezi, as well as borrowings from fellow parodist Ioan Groşan.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} hours of the {{parliamentary}} election day, September 17, a local electronic dance music DJ and event promoter Aļiks <b>Kalašņikovs</b> was murdered outside the club while leaving the venue. Following a drunken brawl in a parking lot, the victim was shot seven times in the stomach with an illegally modified gun and died fifteen minutes later. The killer, Alfrēds Guže, who at age 29 already had six previous convictions for armed robberies, aggravated assaults, and burglary, was arrested by the police four days later in part because of testimony by Melnā Piektdiena staff and other eyewitnesses. He was found guilty of manslaughter and is currently serving his 9-year and 3-month sentence that includes an added year for another felony committed earlier. This cold blooded murder attracted an unusually high level of attention from the Latvian media venue.|$|R
