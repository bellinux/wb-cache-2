His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> organized the game.|$|E

25|$|Waishengren are descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{followed}} Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan {{after the}} Kuomintang lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949. These people included Kuomintang officials, soldiers, merchants, bankers, executives, scientists, intellectuals, refugees, {{and anyone else}} who feared Communist rule. Until the 1970s, these people controlled the political systems of Taiwan; this, along with the looting and corruption that occurred under Chen Yi's military government immediately following the Japanese surrender in 1945, generated resentment among benshengren {{and was one of}} the main causes of the Taiwan independence movement.|$|E
25|$|The Western Baltic Kurgans culture {{existed in}} Masuria, Warmia, Sambia and {{northern}} Masovia during the 650–50 BC period. It originated partially <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> migrated {{there from the}} Dnieper River area and assimilated elements of the Warmian-Masurian Lusatian branches (themselves preceded by the middle Bronze Age Sambian Kurgans culture), {{as well as of}} the old forest zone cultures. They were related in a number of ways, including funeral vessels, to their contemporary, the Pomeranian culture. Upon radial stone structures they built burial mounds – kurgans, or barrows, some of them quite large and containing a number of individual burials. A large kurgan site from the 3rd century BC was located and investigated in Piórkowo in Braniewo County. The dead were cremated and the ashes placed in urns. They built small fortified settlements at naturally suitable places, such as hilltops, and characteristically, within shallow bodies of water, which involved sinking logs and special pile construction. Underwater exploration allowed a conceptual reconstruction of such settlement (3rd–2nd century BC) on Orzysz Lake near Orzysz in Pisz County. The Western Baltic Kurgans economy was traditional, based on animal husbandry (herds kept in a semi-wild state). Land tilling was done to a lesser extent and only later in this culture's history. Hunting, fishing and gathering were also important. Tool manufacturing was old-fashioned, mostly non-metallic. Ceramic containers often had round (semi-spherical) bottoms and modest punctured or engraved ornamentation. The Western Baltic Kurgans culture is the predecessor culture of the Western Balt culture (cultural sphere of Western Baltic tribes), which developed during the first several centuries CE.|$|E
25|$|Corporate insolvencies {{happen because}} {{companies}} become excessively indebted. Under UK law, {{a company is}} a separate legal person <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have invested money and labour into it, and it mediates a series of interest groups. Invariably the shareholders, directors and employees' liability {{is limited to the}} amount of their investment, so against commercial creditors they can lose no more than the money they paid for shares, or their jobs. Insolvencies become intrinsically possible whenever a relationship of credit and debt is created, as frequently happens through contracts or other obligations. In the section of an economy where competitive markets operate, wherever excesses are possible, insolvencies are likely to happen. The meaning of insolvency is simply an inability to repay debts, although the law isolates two main further meanings. First, for a court to order a company be wound up (and its assets sold off) or for an administrator to be appointed (to try to turn the business around), or for avoiding various transactions, the cash flow test is usually applied: a company must be unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Second, for the purpose of suing directors to compensate creditors, or for directors to be disqualified, a company must be shown to have fewer overall assets than liabilities on its balance sheet. If debts cannot be paid back to everybody in full, creditors necessarily stand in competition with one another for a share of the remaining assets. For this reason, a statutory system of priorities fixes the order among different kinds of creditor for payment.|$|E

500|$|Harrington handed former SDS {{activist and}} New York City {{journalist}} Jack Newfield {{a speech by}} AFL–CIO President George Meany. Addressing the September 1972 Convention of the United Steelworkers of America, Meany ridiculed the Democratic Party Convention, which had been held in Miami: We heard from the gay-lib [...] {{people who want to}} legalize marriage between boys and boys, and between girls and girls... We heard <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> looked like Jacks, acted like Jills, and had the odor of Johns [...] about them. This gay-baiting taunt was attributed to Kahn by Harrington, and repeated by Newfield in his autobiography. [...] Maurice Isserman's biography of Harrington also described this speech as Kahn's selfhatred, as [...] "Kahn's resort to gaybashing".|$|E

[...] She now heads the women's division of Australian Basketball Alliance, [...] a new trade union for basketballers formed in 2015. A main pursuit of hers is getting tertiary education for all players. In May 2016, Jackson joined the new ownership group of the Melbourne Boomers, being named the team's commercial operations executive.

500|$|The Austrian {{failure to}} follow up with Frederick meant that the Prussians lived to fight another day. [...] Daun took great {{criticism}} for this, but not <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> mattered the most, the Empress and her minister Kaunitz. For Frederick, instead of having the war decided at Hochkirch, he had the opportunity over the winter to rebuild his army. In two years of fighting (1756–1757) Frederick had lost over 100,000 soldiers to death, wounds, capture, disease and desertion. By Hochkirch, many regiments were only half-disciplined. In the winter after Hochkirch, he could only replace his soldiers with untrained men, many of whom would be foreigners and prisoners-of-war; he would be starting 1759 with a half-trained army of recruits, and seasoned soldiers who were exhausted by the slaughter. The {{only way he could}} hire men would be with British gold.|$|E
500|$|Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy {{explains}} to Kathy {{that he has}} been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them {{that there is no such}} thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the [...] "all but human" [...] clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief. The film ends with Tommy dying on the operating table. Kathy is left alone, waiting for her donations which will begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in voice-over whether her fate is really any different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> will receive her organs; after all, [...] "we all complete".|$|E
