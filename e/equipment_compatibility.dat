50|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, the {{firefighting}} teams were initially overwhelmed by the firestorm. The winds were gusting at times in excess of 70 mi/h km/h, creating erratic and extreme fire behavior. Flames took out power lines to seventeen pumping stations in the Oakland water system. Outside fire teams faced various <b>equipment</b> <b>compatibility</b> issues such as hydrants having the wrong size outlets for the hoses used by neighboring counties. Oakland was also not {{able to communicate with}} many mutual aid resources due to antiquated equipment and lack of access to statewide radio frequencies brought on by the budget restrictions in the preceding years. In some areas, firefighters simply ran out of water, as there was no power to refill the emptied reservoirs. Additionally, many narrow, winding roads in the area were crowded with parked cars, including many in front of fire hydrants; this prevented fire trucks and ambulances from getting to certain areas and connecting fire hoses. The general situation was one of chaos and panic among residents in the area.|$|E

The exchange of experience and the discussions at our meetings help to gain new insights and to transfer the knowledge to the practice.A main task of the ICAR Avalanche Rescue Commission is to issue recommendations on safety measures to minimize avalanche accidents. Securing the <b>equipment</b> <b>compatibility</b> of avalanche search devices is another focus. Furthermore, the ICAR Avalanche Rescue Commission played a dominant role in the unification of the European avalanche danger scale. Currently, these efforts are extended to harmonize the European avalanche danger scale with the North American systems.The ICAR Avalanche Rescue Commission also provides information on avalanche accidents. The average number of annual avalanche accident fatalities in the Alps is 106. This is calculated from a 20-year record of fatal avalanche accidents in the alpine countries. Adding the number of the fatal accidents in North America, the average is 138. Most victims released the avalanche themselves during skiing or hiking in backcountry terrain. However, a significant number of people died while they were skiing or snowboarding off-piste or snowmobiling in the backcountry. For the latter groups, the annual numbers of fatal accidents are slightly increasing.There are two technical sub-commissions within the ICAR Avalanche Rescue Commission: Dog-Handlers and Prevention.|$|E

This study aimed to test the ease of passage of FOBs and AECs through paediatric ETT of different sizes and from different manufacturers when using current recommendations for dimensional <b>equipment</b> <b>compatibility</b> taken from text books and manufacturers information. METHODS Twelve different brands of cuffed and uncuffed ETT sized ID 2. 5 to 5. 0 mm were evaluated in an in vitro set-up. Ease of device passage as well as the locations of an impaired passage within the ETT were assessed. Redundant samples were used for same sized ETT and all measurements were triple-checked in randomized order. RESULTS In total, 51 paired samples of uncuffed as well as cuffed paediatric ETT were tested. There were substantial differences in the ease of ETT passage concordantly for FOBs and AECs among different manufacturers, but also among the product lines from the same manufacturer for a given ID size. Restriction to passage most frequently was found near the endotracheal tube tip or as a gradually increasing resistance along the ETT shaft.

40|$|The TOTEM {{experiment}} {{has been}} designed to measure the total proton-proton cross section and to study the elastic and diffractive scattering at the LHC energy. The measurement requires detecting protons at distances as small as 1 mm from the beam center: TOTEM uses Roman Pots, movable beam pipe insertions, hosting silicon detectors. In the first period of LHC operation no relevant problems were detected with Roman Pots retracted or inserted during special runs. However, when operating the LHC with high intensity beams, impedance induced heating has been observed during the Roman Pots insertion. In order to be compatible with the higher LHC beam current foreseen after the LS 1, {{a new version of the}} Roman Pot has been proposed and optimized with respect to the beam coupling impedance. In this work we present the bench impedance measurements carried out on the new Roman Pot prototype.

40|$|Lamp flicker levels which arise as {{a result}} of voltage {{fluctuations}} can exceed limits set by appropriate standards. New lamp types such as compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) are less sensitive to voltage fluctuations as their flicker characteristics are considerably different compared to those of the traditional incandescent lamp. These differences could support the moderation of the present voltage fluctuation and flicker standards and hence the associated limits. The potential detrimental effects on electrical equipment which may be caused by relaxation of these limits should be investigated before any changes to the present standards take place. The impact of voltage fluctuations on a fullbridge rectifier with a capacitor filter is considered as a case study in this paper. Such a circuit is found at the front end of many different types of equipment that are connected to the public AC supply network. The capacitor ripple current characteristic is of particular interest. The research reported in this paper indicates that the filter capacitor will accumulate and dissipate increased amount of charge when the rectifier is subjected to AC source voltage fluctuations. The consequence is that the RMS value of the capacitor current will increase where the magnitude of this increase is related to the modulation frequency and magnitude of the fluctuating voltage. Therefore, an AC supply with a voltage fluctuation component will cause a full-bridge rectifier with capacitor filter to sustain increased stress. This stress may accelerate the capacitor ageing process, eventually resulting in premature equipment failure. The research indicates {{that there is a need}} for indices other that the short-term and long-term flicker indices required for <b>equipment</b> <b>compatibility</b> levels...|$|E

Waste forms are to meet product criteria (e. g., safeguard termination limits, storage criteria, and target plutonium loading) and processing constraints (e. g., upper temperature limits, processing time, and <b>equipment</b> <b>compatibility).</b> The target waste form for ash is an agglomerated product, while that for SS&C is a fully encapsulated product. Laboratory scoping studies {{were conducted on}} glass formulations from six different glass families: (1) antimony vanadium phosphate, (2) iron vanadium phosphate, (3) tin zinc phosphate, (4) soda-lime silicate, (5) alkali borosilicate, and (6) alkali borate. Glass families were selected due to viscosity behavior in the temperature range of interest (< 800 C). Scoping study tests included gradient furnace tests to determine processing range and sintering temperature, thermogravimetric analysis to determine weight loss {{as a function of}} temperature, and crucible tests to determine frit compositions tolerance to variations in processing temperature, waste loading, and waste type. The primary screening criterion for the selection of frits for future studies was processing temperature below 400 C to minimize the potential for foaming in ash caused by the release of gases (main source of gas is combustion of carbon species) and to minimize processing cycle times. Based on this criterion, glass formulations from the tin zinc phosphate and alkali borosilicate families were selected for future variability testing. Variability testing will include final product evaluation, glass system tolerance to waste loading and composition variation, and identification of parameters impacting time/temperature profiles.

40|$|AbstractEmergency Medical Services (EMS) {{is a basic}} medical acts {{carried to}} an {{accident}} victim {{with the purpose of}} sustaining life and preventing a decline in body condition before the victim finally getting further treatment from medical personnel. One evacuation tool of first aid commonly used is Long Spinal Board (LSB). This tool is set up as an emergency stretcher boards made from wood or polymer with a flat surface that is used to perform the evacuation of the injured spinal cord. The basic principle of the LSB use is to immobilize the position of the spine so that the secondary injury on the spine due to swing, clash, or shocks that occurred during the evacuation process can be minimized. However, the existing LSB has several disadvantages, both in terms of user comfort, and also the effectiveness and efficiency of the evacuation process when done. A recent study found the LSB use can cause pain, discomfort, and respiratory disorders to the patients. Furthermore, the LSB can blockage the flow of oxygen in the tissue capillaries at the placement of strap. Therefore, it is important to improve the design of the LSB with the aims to achieve mobility and better <b>equipment</b> <b>compatibility</b> when used, so that the evacuation process can be done more effectively, efficiently and safely. This study identifies the design requirements of ergonomic LSB using Quality Function Deployment (QFD). QFD is an effective design method to integrate ergonomics needs and comfort into LSB design because it explicitly addresses the translation of customer requirements into engineering characteristics. Preliminary survey was conducted through direct observation of the actual use of LSB that exists today and interviews with volunteers from the Indonesian Red Cross of West Sumatera. Data gathered was translated into questionnaire and answered by 47 participants from medics, Red Cross, Ambulance Unit Medical Officer and rescue team of Padang, West Sumatera. Then it was clarified and used in the House of Quality matrix. The QFD analysis of the LSB revealed that the selection of LSB main board materials, the application of LSB strap systems, as well as the addition of LSB features were receiving the highest overall weighting, which means that improving the design of those criteria would lead to higher customer satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|To {{advance the}} state and nation toward clean energy, Hawaii is {{pursuing}} an aggressive Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), 40 % renewable generation and 30 % energy efficiency and transportation initiatives by 2030. Additionally, with support from federal, state and industry leadership, the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative (HCEI) is focused on reducing Hawaii's carbon footprint and global warming impacts. To {{keep pace with the}} policy momentum and changing industry technologies, the Hawaiian Electric Companies are proactively pursuing a number of potential system upgrade initiatives to better manage variable resources like wind, solar and demand-side and distributed generation alternatives (i. e. DSM, DG). As variable technologies will continue to {{play a significant role in}} powering the future grid, practical strategies for utility integration are needed. Hawaiian utilities are already contending with some of the highest penetrations of renewables in the nation in both large-scale and distributed technologies. With island grids supporting a diverse renewable generation portfolio at penetration levels surpassing 40 %, the Hawaiian utilities experiences can offer unique perspective on practical integration strategies. Efforts pursued in this industry and federal collaborative project tackled challenging issues facing the electric power industry around the world. Based on interactions with a number of western utilities and building on decades of national and international renewable integration experiences, three priority initiatives were targeted by Hawaiian utilities to accelerate integration and management of variable renewables for the islands. The three initiatives included: Initiative 1 : Enabling reliable, real-time wind forecasting for operations by improving short-term wind forecasting and ramp event modeling capabilities with local site, field monitoring; Initiative 2 : Improving operators situational awareness to variable resources via real-time grid condition monitoring using PMU devices and enhanced grid analysis tools; and Initiative 3 : Identifying grid automation and smart technology architecture retrofit/improvement opportunities following a systematic review approach, inclusive of increasing renewables and variable distributed generation. Each of the initiative was conducted in partnership with industry technology and equipment providers to facilitate utility deployment experiences inform decision making, assess supporting infrastructure cost considerations, showcase state of the technology, address integration hurdles with viable workarounds. For each initiative, a multi-phased approach was followed that included 1) investigative planning and review of existing state-of-the-art, 2) hands on deployment experiences and 3) process implementation considerations. Each phase of the approach allowed for mid-course corrections, process review and change to any equipment/devices to be used by the utilities. To help the island grids transform legacy infrastructure, the Wind HUI provided more systematic approaches and exposure with vendor/manufacturers, hand-on review and experience with the equipment not only from the initial planning stages but through to deployment and assessment of field performance of some of the new, remote sensing and high-resolution grid monitoring technologies. HELCO became one of the first utilities in the nation to install and operate a high resolution (WindNet) network of remote sensing devices such as radiometers and SODARs to enable a short-term ramp event forecasting capability. This utility-industry and federal government partnership produced new information on wind energy forecasting including new data additions to the NOAA MADIS database; addressed remote sensing technology performance and O&M (operations and maintenance) challenges; assessed legacy <b>equipment</b> <b>compatibility</b> issues and technology solutions; evaluated cyber-security concerns; and engaged in community outreach opportunities that will help guide Hawaii and the nation toward more reliable adoption of clean energy resources. Results from these efforts are helping to inform Hawaiian utilities continue to Transform infrastructure, Incorporate renewable considerations and priorities into new processes/procedures, and Demonstrate the technical effectiveness and feasibility of new technologies to shape our pathways forward. Lessons learned and experience captured as part of this effort will hopefully provide practical guidance for others embarking on major legacy infrastructure transformations and renewable integration projects...|$|E
40|$|A {{concept for}} a {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) system that would utilize a relatively weak magnetic field provides for several design features that differ significantly from the corresponding features of conventional MRI systems. Notable among these features are a magnetic-field configuration that reduces (relative to the conventional configuration) distortion and blurring of the image, {{the use of a}} superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer as the detector, and an imaging procedure suited for the unconventional field configuration and sensor. In a typical application of MRI, a radio-frequency pulse is used to excite precession of the magnetic moments of protons in an applied magnetic field, and the decaying precession is detected for a short time following the pulse. The precession occurs at a resonance frequency proportional to the strengths of the magnetic field and the proton magnetic moment. The magnetic field is configured to vary with position in a known way; hence, by virtue of the aforesaid proportionality, the resonance frequency varies with position in a known way. In other words, position is encoded as resonance frequency. MRI using magnetic fields weaker than those of conventional MRI offers several advantages, including cheaper and smaller <b>equipment,</b> greater <b>compatibility</b> with metallic objects, and higher image quality because of low susceptibility distortion and enhanced spin-lattice-relaxation- time contrast. SQUID MRI is being developed into a practical MRI method for applied magnetic flux densities of the order of only 100...|$|R
