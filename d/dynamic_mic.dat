500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a <b>dynamic</b> <b>mic</b> because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E

50|$|Typical high {{frequency}} horns, {{used in many}} professional sound speakers until the late seventies, had uneven dispersion of high frequencies. When {{in front of them}} the highs beamed and going off to the sides the highs were lower. The Constant Directivity Horn was invented at EV, where there was an even balance of frequencies across the listening field. This is now a common horn type in every concert sound system you might hear. In the late 1980s, EV became the first microphone manufacturer to use neodymium magnets in its microphones. The N/DYM microphones were introduced in the mid 1980s to provide higher output, greater {{high frequency}} response like a condenser mic, but yet rugged as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>mic.</b> Around the same time EV's first wireless microphones were being produced.|$|E

500|$|Although {{they wanted}} to {{reproduce}} an older sound, Saadiq and Brunghardt also wanted to capture more of the bass and drum parts to add a louder, modern element to the mix. They applied a more basic approach to miking the instruments and utilizing the outboard gear, using a Neumann U 47 for guitars, alternating overhead microphones for Saadiq's drum kit, a combination of <b>dynamic</b> and condenser <b>mics</b> for the kit's bass drum, and Ampex tape machines for extra warmth to the kit. Brungardt used various standard mics for the snare drum to achieve a more solid cracking sound, rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, and as Brungardt recounted, [...] "It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up so that I could play with the live room, using different reverbs to get a sound." [...] For Saadiq's bass, they used a DI unit to connect a microphone preamplifier, increased the gain on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.|$|R

Three implementations of the UT approach with different computational complexities were evaluated on Aurora 2 connected digits database, and significant performance improvements were achieved compared to log-normalapproximation-based PMC (Parallel Model Combination) and firstorder-approximation-based VTS (Vector Taylor Series) approaches.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach for lip tracking using dynamic deformable templates. The {{objective is to}} track lip parameters from an audio-visual corpus recording a voice talent who is reading text prompts in a natural and expressive way. The corpus presents challenges to the conventional method of lip tracking with deformable templates. s. This is because natural and expressive speech includes relatively large motions {{of the head and}} the lips. The head ad motions lead to changes in the illumination of the face ace region and changes in the observed lip shape. In addition, ion, emphathatic pronunciations lead to large changes in the lip shape. ape Video frames that are affected by face illumination umination n changes present additional difficulty in locating ng the mouth uth region (i. e. region of interest, ROI). Video frames rames that are affected by changes in lip shapes present additional deviations from the lip templates and hence lower wer tracking accuracies. Our proposed method incorporates tes es "dynamicity " in the deformable templates to render them em adaptive to changes in head pose, face illumination and lip shapes.

40|$|Multiple {{predictors}} of fluoroquinolone antimicrobial effects (AMEs) {{are not usually}} examined simultaneously in most studies. To compare the predictive potentials of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) -to-MIC ratio (AUC/MIC), the AUC above MIC (AUCeff), and the time above MIC (Teff), the kinetics of killing and regrowth of four bacterial strains exposed to monoexponentially decreasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin were studied in an in vitro <b>dynamic</b> model. The <b>MICs</b> of ciprofloxacin for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli 11775 (I) and 204 (II), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0. 6, 0. 013, 0. 08, and 0. 15 μg/ml, respectively. The simulated values of AUC were designed to provide similar 1, 000 -fold (S. aureus, E. coli I, and P. aeruginosa) or 2, 000 -fold (E. coli II) ranges of the AUC/MIC. In each case except for the highest AUC/MIC ratio, the observation periods included complete regrowth in the time-kill curve studies. The AME was expressed by its intensity, IE (the area between the control growth and time-kill and regrowth curves {{up to the point}} where the viable counts of regrowing bacteria are close to the maximum values observed without drug). For most AUC ranges the IE-AUC curves were fitted by an Emax (maximal effect) model, whereas the effects observed at very high AUCs were greater than those predicted by the model. The AUCs that produced 50 % of maximal AME were proportional to the MICs for the strains studied, but maximal AMEs (IEmax) and the extent of sigmoidicity (s) were not related to the MIC. Both Teff and log AUC/MIC correlated well with IE (r 2 = 0. 98 in both cases) in a species-independent fashion. Unlike Teff or log AUC/MIC, a specific relationship between IE and log AUCeff was inherent in each strain. Although each IE and log AUCeff plot was fitted by linear regression (r 2 = 0. 97 to 0. 99), these plots were not superimposed and therefore are bacterial species dependent. Thus, AUC/MIC and Teff were better {{predictors of}} ciprofloxacin’s AME than AUCeff. This study suggests that optimal predictors of the AME produced by a given quinolone (intraquinolone predictors) may be established by examining its AMEs against bacteria of different susceptibilities. Teff was shown previously also to be the best interquinolone predictor, but unlike AUC/MIC, it cannot be used to compare different quinolones. AUC/MIC might be the best predictor of the AME in comparisons of different quinolones...|$|R
