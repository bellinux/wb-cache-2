One can imagine subdelegations with the same conditions of dans les mêmes conditions of validity and effectiveness as the initial delegation. On the other hand, any co-delegation is ruled out: the delegate must enjoy an sutonomy and power incompatible with the collective <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation.</b>|$|E

The development of executive powers under section 5 (b) will first be discussed with an eye toward determining, through the legislative history, congressional intent underlying the section. The role of judicial review <b>of</b> the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> executive emergency powers will be examined, followed by an analysis of the theory underlying the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> such powers to the President. Finally, the constitutional limitations on the emergency powers of the executive will be examined...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a theory to explain cross-national {{variation}} in administrative law doctrines and practices. Administrative law regimes vary along three primary dimensions: the scope <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> to agencies, agencies’ <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> discretion, and judicial practices of deference to agencies. Working with a principal-agent framework, we show how cross-national differences in institutions’ capacities and the environments they face encourage {{the adoption of}} divergent strategies that lead {{to a variety of}} distinct, stable, equilibrium outcomes. We apply our model to explain patterns of administrative law in the United States, Germany, France, and Commonwealth jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of administrative {{procedures in the}} EU is currently a topic under much scruti-ny. This chapter addresses some of the debates regarding a possible innovative codification of EU administrative procedure law. It does so by looking at changing modes <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> powers for implementation of EU law and policy and the evolving legal context of the EU’s highly integrated multi-level system. The chapter therefore addresses questions such as which criteria should govern the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> powers delegated to the administration. It does so by looking at how effective decision-making procedures can be geared towards ensuring that basic constitutional principles and values are complied with in real-life administrative action. Answers to these questions also guide considerations about which elements should ideally be addressed by a possible codification of administrative procedure law of the EU...|$|R

40|$|Europe is {{a heavyweight}} in global finance. But {{does it have}} a {{presence}} in global financial governance to match? This paper employs a principal-agent approach to analyse patterns <b>of</b> policy-making <b>delegation</b> in the EU to explore this question. It finds a U-shaped relationship between the extent <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> and the 'European presence' in global financial governance: when member states either remain in control of policy or delegate extensive competencies, European stakeholders are well represented. In contrast, intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> can undermine the European presence by tying member states' hands without sufficiently empowering supranational agents to fill the gap. Patterns <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> are traced to the heterogeneity of member state interests and the pre-existence of international governance arrangements. These arguments about the origins and consequences <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> patterns are supported by evidence from three core domains of financial governance: banking regulation; accounting standards; and capital market regulation...|$|R
