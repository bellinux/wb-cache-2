Nevertheless, its numbers are still limited, even in its native country. As mentioned previously, today in France there are approximately 3500 dogs and in Germany approximately 500 of this breed. At present there are approximately 400 Berger Picards in the United States and Canada.|$|E
6000|$|But {{what most}} {{comes back to}} me as the very note and {{fragrance}} of the New York cousinship in this general connection is a time that I remember to have glanced at on a page distinct from these, when the particular cousins I now speak of had conceived, {{under the influence of}} I know not what unextinguished morning star, the liveliest taste for the earliest possible rambles and researches, in which they were so good as to allow me, when I was otherwise allowed, to participate: health-giving walks, of an extraordinarily matinal character, at the hour of the meticulous rag-pickers and exceptionally French polishers known to the Paris dawns of the Second Empire as at no time since; which made us all feel together, under the conduct of Honorine, bright child of the pavement herself, as if we, in our fresh curiosity and admiration, had also something to say to the great show presently to be opened, and were free, throughout the place, as those are free of a house who know its aspects of attic and cellar or how it looks from behind. I call our shepherdess Honorine even though perhaps not infallibly naming the sociable soubrette who might, with all her gay bold confidence, have been an official inspectress in person, and to whose <b>easy</b> <b>care</b> or, more particularly, expert sensibility and candour of sympathy and curiosity, our flock was freely confided. If she wasn't Honorine she was Clémentine or Augustine--which is a trifle; since what I thus recover, in any case, of these brushings of the strange Parisian dew, is those communities of contemplation that made us most hang about the jewellers' windows in the Palais Royal and the public playbills of the theatres on the Boulevard. The Palais Royal, now so dishonoured and disavowed, was then the very Paris of Paris; the shutters of the shops seemed taken down, at that hour, for our especial benefit, and I remember well how, the [...] "dressing" [...] of so large a number of the compact and richly condensed fronts being more often than not a matter of diamonds and pearls, rubies and sapphires, that represented, in their ingenuities of combination and contortion, the highest taste of the time, I found open to me any amount of superior study {{of the fact that the}} spell of gems seemed for the feminine nature almost alarmingly boundless. I stared too, it comes back to me, at these exhibitions, and perhaps even thought it became a young man of the world to express as to this or that object a refined and intelligent preference; but what I really most had before me was the chorus of abjection, as I might well have called it, led, at the highest pitch, by Honorine and vaguely suggesting to me, by the crudity, so to say, of its wistfulness, a natural frankness of passion--goodness knew in fact (for my small intelligence really didn't) what depths of corruptibility. Droll enough, as I win them again, these queer dim plays of consciousness: my sense that my innocent companions, Honorine en tête, would have done anything or everything for the richest ruby, and that though one couldn't one's self be decently dead to that richness one didn't at all know what [...] "anything" [...] might be or in the least what [...] "everything" [...] was. The gushing cousins, at the same time, assuredly knew still less of that, and Honorine's brave gloss of a whole range alike of possibilities and actualities was in itself a true social grace.|$|E

50|$|Tropical house crickets are {{relatively}} {{new to the}} pet trade, and are favored by many people, due to <b>easier</b> <b>care</b> requirements than the more-common House cricket or the Black field cricket.

They also have a lower chitin content than average crickets, making digestibility easier. Tropical house crickets are also immune to the CrPV virus. Care is similar to that of the House cricket.|$|R
5000|$|The African house snake (Boaedon fuliginosus) is {{a species}} of snake of the family Colubridae. Harmless to humans, it is widely kept and bred in captivity as a pet by herpetoculturists due to its small size, placid {{demeanor}} and <b>easy</b> <b>care</b> requirements.|$|E

50|$|Their {{generally}} docile {{temperament and}} small size make rosy boas an ideal choice for pet snakes {{due to their}} <b>easy</b> <b>care</b> and small enclosure size.

With other species, such as corn snakes, milk snakes, and ball pythons, dominating the majority of the market, the popularity of rosy boas has not been as high as other species.|$|E

5000|$|Like the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Klee Kai {{typically}} requires relatively <b>easy</b> <b>care.</b> They {{are extremely}} clean.

They are rather efficient, so no grooming is needed. An Alaskan Klee Kai should not be shaved unless for medical reasons. [...] They need their coat to keep them cool and to protect their skin.|$|E
5000|$|Saron marmoratus, the marbled shrimp, is {{a species}} of [...] "cleaner shrimp" [...] from the family Thoridae, {{although}} its taxonomic position is subject to some controversy as many authorities have considered {{it to be a}} member of the family Hippolytidae sensu lato.

50|$|Corriedale have a {{long life}} span, and are hardy and evenly {{balanced}} all over the body. Corriedales are docile, <b>easy</b> <b>care</b> mothers, with high fertility.

Corriedales produce a thick stapled, bulky fleece, which is popular with spinners and can be used for a range of handspun garments. Their dense fleece is medium-fine and high yielding, with good length and softness, somewhat between medium wool and long wool. Corriedale lambs produce good quality carcases and have a high pelt value.|$|E

The following month, Justin Marks made his Truck Series debut at the <b>Easy</b> <b>Care</b> Vehicle Service Contracts 200, with voodoo ride sponsoring, finishing 22nd. Marks ran the final three races of the season, posting a best finish of eighth place at the Ford 200.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{name for a}} deer mouse is Peromyscus. The species has 56 subspecies. They are all tiny mammals that are plentiful in number. The deer mouse {{is described as a}} small rodent that lives in the Americas and is closely related to the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. Because the two species are extremely similar in appearance, they are best distinguished through red blood cell agglutination tests or karyotype techniques. The deer mouse can also be distinguished physically by its long and multicolored tail. Deer mice are very often used for laboratory experimentation due to their self cleanliness and <b>easy</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
50|$|Echinocereus dasyacanthus is {{cultivated}} as an ornamental plant, for use {{in desert}} native plant natural landscaping, or as a house plant and in a greenhouse. As the Texas Rainbow cactus is a smaller cacti species, it can be <b>easier</b> to <b>care</b> for.|$|R

25|$|The cages are {{arranged}} in long rows as multiple tiers, often with cages back-to-back (hence the term 'battery cage'). Within a single shed, there may be several floors containing battery cages meaning that a single shed may contain many {{tens of thousands of}} hens. Light intensity is often kept low (e.g. 10 lux) to reduce feather pecking and vent pecking. Benefits of battery cages include <b>easier</b> <b>care</b> for the birds, floor eggs which are expensive to collect are eliminated, eggs are cleaner, capture at the end of lay is expedited, generally less feed is required to produce eggs, broodiness is eliminated, more hens may be housed in a given house floor space, internal parasites are more easily treated, and labor requirements are generally much reduced.|$|R
