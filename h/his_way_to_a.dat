When Louis was seven, the family lost their home, moving to Saratoga, New York, with help from Eliza's family. Edward's health collapsed, but he nonetheless {{took a job as}} a reporter for a Saratoga newspaper, later purchasing a small Democratic paper of his own, The Saratoga Sun. Louis's health, in contrast, improved during his teenage years, allowing him to leave the house more often and consider attending Yale University. On <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cousin's wedding rehearsal, he suffered a bicycle accident in which he fell into gravel, permanently scarring his face. Ultimately, the dual obstacles of his still-questionable health and finances caused him to abandon his university ambitions and instead take a job with his father's paper.|$|E

McClane pursues Gabriel, hijacking his semi and enlisting Warlock to trace Gabriel's vehicle. Gabriel accesses the communication system of a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II and, impersonating an air traffic controller, orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving.

Wearing the uniform of a war correspondent, he visited the Western Front from 5 July to 4 August 1917, a period which included the start of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July. Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Château d'Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an observation balloon above the Somme. Making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to his reputation for recklessness.|$|E

When a father-son rafting trip is scheduled, neither Bart nor Homer want to go together but the end up mistakenly offering and accepting the invitations to do so.

Due to Homer losing the map after making it into a makeshift hat, they accidentally take the wrong turn and find themselves lost at sea.
