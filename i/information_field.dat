Most leaders believe systemic change is needed, but unlikely to happen. Questions of the future of the academic <b>information</b> systems <b>field</b> are addressed.

50|$|The CMIS {{has been}} quantitatively tested and {{performs}} well {{when it comes}} to health information seeking behaviors (HISB). There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are: Antecedents, <b>information</b> <b>field,</b> and information seeking actions. The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information. Those factors are: Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs. These factors are fluid and can change during the health information seeking process. The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities. This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information. A person’s understanding is developed through the <b>information</b> <b>field.</b> The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the <b>information</b> <b>field.</b> The final schema involves information seeking actions. This is what the consumer does {{as a result of the}} first two schemas through information seeking. There are three major dimensions: the scope, depth, and method of information seeking.|$|E

In this setting, agents can make contingent contracts based on events that are commonly observed. With private information modelled as finite partitions of a compact and metrizable space of states of nature, we introduce a topology on information that takes into account the compatibility of <b>information</b> <b>fields</b> in assessing similarity between private <b>information</b> <b>fields.</b> This topology allows us to establish upper semicontinuity of the private core correspondence.

While each individual iSchool has its own strengths and specializations, together they share a fundamental interest in the relationships between information, people, and technology. The iSchools organization is governed by the iCaucus. Criteria for being recognized as an iSchool are not rigid, but schools are expected to have substantial sponsored research activity, engagement in the training of future researchers (usually through an active, research-oriented doctoral program), and a commitment to progress in the <b>information</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
