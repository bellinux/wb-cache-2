40|$|Introduction Purchasing {{and supply}} {{management}} {{is a relatively}} young twig on the tree of management science. There are excellent empirical studies that explore key issues in this subdiscipline, that are well designed and executed, and have far-reaching conclusions for the research community and/ or practitioners. One excellent study that springs to mind is that of Paul Joskow, first published in 1987 in the American Economic Review and reprinted in 1996 in Scott Masten’s book ‘‘Case Studies in Contracting and Organization’’. Joskow’s study empirically tests the importance of relationship-specific investments in determining the duration of coal supply contracts. The important question at stake {{in this study is}} about the governance of relations between buyers and suppliers. Moreover, the study is based on a well-defined general theory from which the core hypothesis is derived; the ‘case’ (purchase and supply of coal) is well argued, and a sample of coal contracts provides an excellent opportunity for testing the core hypothesis. This is a study in which qualitative and quantitative methods come together. Masten’s book offers yet more interesting examples of such hybrid studies, such as Thomas Palay’s study on the governance of rail <b>freight</b> <b>contracting</b> (Palay, 1984 / 1996), and Victor Goldberg and John Erickson’s case study of long-term petroleum coke contracts (Goldberg and Erickson, 1987 / 1996). In the introduction to their contribution to this JPSM special issue on research methods, for one reason or the other Anna Dubois and Luis Araujo state that they do not wish to conclude with a plea for such hybrid or mixed studies. I was amazed by that point of view. In my opinion such studies offer an excellent opportunity for accelerated growth of knowledge in purchasing and supply management research, and we should emphasize that as often as we can.

50|$|Shanghai Shipping Freight Exchange is {{the first}} {{electronic}} shipping freight exchange in the world. It has three lines of businesses, including International Dry Bulk, Domestic Coastal Coal, and International Container. The container freight derivatives were launched in 2011 and shortly became the most liquid container <b>freight</b> <b>contracts.</b> Based on the success and experience from container <b>freight</b> <b>contracts,</b> SSEFC launched coastal coal contracts in 2012. In 2014, {{in order to better}} achieve the risk shifting effect of shipping freight derivatives, SSEFC innovated and launched the world's first physical-deliverable shipping capacity contract.|$|R

50|$|BIFFEX, the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange, was a London-based {{exchange}} for trading ocean <b>freight</b> futures <b>contracts</b> with settlement {{based on the}} Baltic Freight Index. It started trading dry cargo <b>freight</b> futures <b>contracts</b> in 1985, and was modestly successful for some years. All contracts were cleared by the ICCH (International Commodity Clearing House), later renamed LCH.Clearnet (London Clearing House). A tanker <b>freight</b> futures <b>contract</b> was introduced in 1986, but never became popular and was suspended indefinitely the same year. Volumes in the dry cargo contracts dwindled over the years, and the contracts ceased trading {{due to lack of}} liquidity in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, Autolink {{had used}} the Norwegian State Railways, and {{subsequently}} their subsidiary CargoNet, for operation of the autorack trains. On 31 January 2007, Autolink bought 40% of the private railway company Ofotbanen, and transferred the <b>freight</b> <b>contract</b> to them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer. In March, Ofotbanen ordered additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million.|$|R

50|$|However, by {{the early}} 1840s, his {{relationship}} with the HBC began to weaken. The HBC, in order to curb the growing amount of free trade or illegal trade, denied McDermot a <b>freighting</b> <b>contract</b> with the HBC and by 1845, his goods from England were not being allowed passage on HBC ships. Furious with Governor Christie over these sanctions, he resigned from the Council of Assiniboia. He did rejoin the Council after an agreement was reached and partial reimbursement for his losses was paid.|$|R

50|$|The airline {{received}} {{a substantial amount}} of its business from the military, especially in its role connecting American bases in the U.S. to the Middle East. It also thrived on passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>contracts</b> with private organizations, such as the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League, as well as wet leases to other airlines. With such wet lease arrangements, World Airways essentially functioned as a cargo airline arm or subsidiary, of another airline in which a separate division would not be an efficient use of an airlines resources.|$|R

40|$|Coal {{transport}} in Australia is a non-contestable market: {{rail authorities}} have an effective, legislatively-based monopoly over {{the transport of}} coal in the major producing states of Queensland and New South Wales. Pricing policies and practices are critical to efficient resource allocation in non-contestable markets. The objectives of this paper are to explore pricing options for the rail freight of bulk minerals, and to illustrate their application to the export coal industry. Pricing options for both dedicated and multi-user lines are discussed and existing export coal rail <b>freight</b> <b>contracts</b> scrutinised.

50|$|In 1275 Charles of Anjou king of Sicily, {{issued an}} order for the {{construction}} of several galleys that provide the earliest evidence for the dimensions of the bireme galleys. Because of increased weight and breadth, which brought increased friction through the water, a trireme galley was not dramatically faster than a bireme. But the change to trireme produced more significant developments than a gain in tactical speed over short distances. Early bireme galleys escorted merchant ships but were rarely used to carry goods. A few Genoese <b>freight</b> <b>contracts</b> of the mid-13th century record charters for bireme galleys.|$|R
50|$|This {{was also}} the time when Skyways began {{experiencing}} growing financial difficulties {{as a result of}} the high cost of the Constellation lease, the failed joint venture in the Bahamas and BOAC's cancellation of its <b>freight</b> <b>contract</b> with Skyways that had generated three quarters of the latter's revenue. This resulted in Skyways Ltd's ownership passing to Euravia (London) Ltd, a newly formed British independent airline concentrating on IT and group charter flights from Luton.In October 1962, Euravia (London) took over Skyways for a nominal £1, including four Yorks and three Constellations but excluding the Coach-Air operation, which remained a separate entity.|$|R

50|$|The three {{partners}} {{divided the}} labor {{based on the}} skills that each member brought to the firm. William Waddell managed the finances and made sure that their business activities ran smoothly. William Russell was the company salesman, generating contracts {{with the government and}} others as well as dealing with bankers to secure financing. Alexander Major oversaw the freighting operations which included hiring labor, supervising the loading and transport of freight, and making sure the trains were operating on time. The relationship between the three men were generally fine; Majors and Waddell had a similar conservative temperament and though Russell was the opposite, he was often on the East Coast seeking new contracts and investments. With a virtual monopoly on all western <b>freighting</b> <b>contracting</b> Russell, Majors, and Waddell became the largest freighting company in western Missouri.|$|R
