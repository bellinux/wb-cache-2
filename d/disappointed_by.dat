5|$|Despite the band's intent, {{a future}} album {{from the group}} was uncertain. On June 12, 2008, Atlantic Records {{filed a lawsuit against}} Weiland and Eric Kretz, {{claiming}} the two had threatened to terminate their contract unless changes were made.

5|$|Miley: The Movement {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from mainstream critics, who appreciated Cyrus' seemingly genuine commentary, but were <b>disappointed</b> <b>by</b> {{its failure to}} fully discuss her recent controversies and public criticisms.

5|$|Super Monkey Ball was commercially {{successful}} upon {{release and}} remained one of Sega's best-selling {{titles in the}} United States through much of 2002.

5|$|A {{supporter}} of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was <b>disappointed</b> <b>by</b> the French and British policy of appeasement evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain {{good relations with the}} Soviet Union and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbors.|$|E

5|$|Adam Gutschmidt, {{reviewing}} the event for Online Onslaught, gave {{a rating of}} one-quarter star for the Nightstick on a Pole match and one-half star each for the High Energy vs. The Headshrinkers match and the Yokozuna vs. Virgil match. He enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, although he was <b>disappointed</b> <b>by</b> its lack of buildup prior to the event. He also felt that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect match {{was a good one}} until the ending got out of control. Pro Wrestling Torch columnist agreed, stating that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the best and that the Flair/Ramon vs. Savage/Perfect bout was also enjoyable, but he recommended fast-forwarding {{through the rest of the}} show.|$|E

On the September 16, 2011 episode of SmackDown, in his {{hometown}} of Toronto, Edge hosted The Cutting Edge between Mark Henry and the World Heavyweight Champion, Randy Orton. After the show went off the air, they held Edge Appreciation Night to celebrate his career.|$|E
5|$|Despite The Big Room being {{critically}} acclaimed, {{it was not}} as commercially {{successful as}} their first album, which Verdens Gang attributed to a lacklustre promotion campaign by Atlantic Records. Half way through their tour with Jewel in mid July, M2M were removed as the opening act by Atlantic who cited disappointing sales of The Big Room, which at that time had sold around 100,000 units in America. Shocked and <b>disappointed</b> <b>by</b> the decision, M2M returned to Norway, and ceased performing together. Raven was immediately offered a solo record contract from Atlantic, though she later withdrew from the offer.|$|E
5000|$|Enta da Stage is a {{stunning}} debut {{that does not}} <b>disappoint</b> <b>by</b> {{any stretch of the}} imagination. The only term that adequately describes Black Moons smooth combination of funky jazz rhythms and ferocious vocals is elegant madness. Its nice to see that there are still shining spots of originality to be found in a genre thats becoming increasingly overrun by bogus bandwagon jumpers just out to make a quick buck. Make this jammie a priority.|$|R
5000|$|... 2006-07 was <b>disappointing</b> <b>by</b> {{contrast}} with a 10th-place finish; however, {{the season was}} notable for cup successes in major competitions at Conference North, Leigh RMI in the FA Cup and Moor Green in the FA Trophy. Home successes were gained against Marine and Whitby Town.

5|$|Despite the success, ANIF was displeased {{with the}} film and halted its other non-documentary productions; one of the studio's cameramen, an Indo man named J.J.W. Steffens, {{suggested}} that ANIF's management preferred works of non-fiction as a more intellectual medium. <b>Disappointed</b> <b>by</b> the company's reaction, Balink left the Indies and emigrated to the United States in March 1938. Terang Boelan cast left ANIF not long afterwards and, after briefly touring Malaya, joined Tan's Film. They made their first film for Tan's, Fatima, in 1938. Mochtar, who soon married fellow Terang Boelan actress Soekarsih, continued to be cast as Roekiah's lover; the two were a popular screen couple until Mochtar left Tan's in 1940 over a wage dispute.|$|E
5|$|Development for Final Fantasy XII {{began in}} December 2000 and was headed by Final Fantasy Tactics {{director}} Yasumi Matsuno and Final Fantasy IX director Hiroyuki Ito. Matsuno provided the original concept and plot but {{was forced to}} bow out of his roles midway through production due to health concerns. The team was restructured as a consequence: the new directorial duo consisted of Ito and Hiroshi Minagawa, while Akitoshi Kawazu of SaGa series fame became the game's executive producer. Series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi was <b>disappointed</b> <b>by</b> Matsuno's departure and declined {{to play the game}} beyond its introduction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disappointed</b> <b>by</b> {{the failure}} to sink {{merchant}} ships in that battle, Adolf Hitler ordered {{the majority of the}} surface warships scrapped, though Admiral Karl Dönitz was able to convince Hitler to retain the surface fleet.

The ship was never restored to operational status, however, and on 3 May 1945, Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged her while she was in Kiel. Her crew scuttled the ship at her moorings, and in July 1945, she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948–1952 and her bell is currently on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E

5000|$|On its release, critics praised The Ten Commandments overall; {{however, the}} part of the film set in modern times {{received}} mixed reviews. Variety, for example, declared the opening scenes alone worth the admission price, but found the remainder of the film <b>disappointing</b> <b>by</b> comparison: [...] "The opening Biblical scenes of The Ten Commandments are irresistible in their assembly, breadth, color and direction ... They are immense and stupendous, so big the modern tale after that seems puny." ...|$|R
5|$|Goebbels was {{involved}} in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started {{having an affair with}} the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors. A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was <b>disappointed</b> <b>by</b> the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.|$|E

He was Mansfield's stand-in captain for a 1–1 away draw with Gateshead on 2 October 2010. However, after Mansfield signed defenders Rhys Day and Simon Grand, Smith became surplus to requirements and was made available on loan.|$|E
5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala {{to see if they}} could succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left Cobán in August 1693 to seek out the hostile Lakandon Ch'ols in the depths of the rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. <b>Disappointed</b> <b>by</b> their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action.|$|E

His performances in the Pro40 League, however, brought Kent to the verge of promotion.|$|R
