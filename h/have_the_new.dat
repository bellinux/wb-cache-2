5|$|All 12,400 Chevrolet Volts {{produced}} until December 2011, {{including all}} Amperas in stock at European dealerships, {{were scheduled to}} receive the safety enhancements. Since production was halted during the holidays, the enhancements were in place when production resumed in early 2012. Sales continued, and dealers modified the Volts they had in stock. General Motors {{sent a letter to}} Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012. General Motors also decided to replace the 120-volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10,000 Volts sold since late 2010. The new cords were enhanced to add durability, and some of the chargers built after February 5 <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> cords.|$|E
5|$|PennDOT has {{recently}} begun the Route 1011-Pond Eddy Bridge Replacement Project. Route 1011 is the internal designation for Flagstone Road, {{one of the}} two side roads in Pennsylvania along with the bridge. The state has proposed a four-span bridge with three connecting bridge piers, with four side options: replacing the bridge upstream, buying out the 26 residences on the Pennsylvania side, rehabilitating the structure to handle weights of 16-18 tons or maintain the bridge in its current form. Depending on which project is chosen, the estimated start would be in 2013, when the structure reaches its 110th year in use. The entire project would cost $8.5-11 million. Opponents of demolishing the bridge hope that they can find a place to move the bridge, which would cost $500,000, and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> owners maintain it.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the Combahee River Raid was identified to state and Federal officials by Jeff Grigg prior to a survey related to a bridge replacement project across the Combahee River on U.S. Highway 17.

State Representative Kenneth Hodges authored a resolution to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> bridge named after Harriet Tubman in recognition of her role in the historic raid. Also the site of a 1782 Revolutionary War battle, the immediate area has been proposed as an historic district.|$|E
25|$|The Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) for {{the project}} was issued in June 2017. Four {{alternatives}} for alignments under the Hudson River and the Palisades. Option 1 would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> tunnels run close to the existing tunnels with a ventilation site near the Lincoln Tunnel Helix. This option would have required a construction staging site within the Lincoln Tunnel Helix, thus displacing New Jersey Transit's Weehawken bus storage site, which would {{have a negative impact}} on the operation of buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Option 2 would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> tunnels run further south than the first option, with a shaft site north of 19th Street near JFK Boulevard East. This option would require the acquisition and demolition of an existing multi-story office building to build the shaft site. The third option would be further south with a shaft site south of 19th Street. This option would preclude the development of a portion of a planned residential development under construction at 800 Harbor Boulevard. The fourth option would be further south with a shaft site south of 18th Street–following the same horizontal alignment identified in the ARC FEIS. Alignment Option 4 was chosen for the build alternative even though it would have a slightly longer tunnel than in the other alternatives. Because of the additional length, there would be additional tunneling costs for this option. However, the first three options have greater pre-construction risks, meaning that if construction was delayed the cost difference would be minimized. In addition, Option 4 does not have the issues that the first three options have.|$|E

25|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the lame duck zoning commission reversed course in late November 1974 and approved the proposed revised zoning {{rules for the}} Georgetown waterfront. The Washington Post reported that the rezoning process would have to begin again under the home-rule zoning commission, and there was little chance that the new commission {{would be able to}} approve anything like the proposed regulations. The existing zoning commission acted, the newspaper suggested, because it would suffer no political retaliation (having gone out of business), its actions could give the home-rule zoning commission political cover to retain the rules, and because its members believed there had been enough delay and consideration of the rules. Development, the old commission felt, had to proceed now or it never would. The GCA immediately sued to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> zoning regulations overturned, and the D.C. Superior Court blocked all development in the area while the suit was pending.|$|E

500|$|The treaty-imposed design {{problems}} became irrelevant on 31 March 1938, {{when the}} signatories of the Treaty invoked its escalation clause because the Japanese refused {{to provide any}} information about their battleship construction programme and the signatories feared that their new ships could be outclassed by the new Japanese battleships.
