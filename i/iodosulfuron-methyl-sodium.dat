40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in 2006 - 2007 at six research stations of the Iranian Plant Protection Research Institute to study the efficacy of different herbicides to control weeds in wheat. Treatments included mesosulfuron-methyl plus <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> plus mefenpyr-diethyl (WG) at 45 + 45 + 135 g. a. i. /ha, respectively, sulfosulfuron at 21, 31. 5, 42 and 51 g. a. i. /ha, chlorsulfuron at 15 g. a. i. /ha, bromoxynil plus MCPA at 600 g. a. i. /ha with clodinafop propargyl at 64 g. a. i. /ha, sulfosulfuron plus metsulfuron-methyl at 36 g. a. i. /ha, mesosulfuron-methyl plus <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> plus mefenpyr-diethyl (OD) at 15 + 3 + 45 g. a. i. /ha, respectively, and a full season weed-free control. Herbicides were applied at wheat tillering. Results showed that sulfosulfuron plus metsulfuron-methyl, and bromoxynil plus MCPA with clodinafop propargyl resulted in satisfactory weed control and wheat grain yield at most locations. Weed control efficacy of both formulations of mesosulfuron-methyl plus <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> was variable across locations. Efficacy of the OD formulation appears to depend upon location, so that application of this herbicide at Shiraz and Gorgan resulted in better weed control compared to use of the WG. Satisfactory performance of the OD formulation at Gorgan and Shiraz could be attributed {{in part to the}} even pattern of rainfall distribution during the growing season and wheat cultivar used, respectively. With respect to grain yield, however, the OD formulation was better than WG formulation at most of the locations...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{influence}} of herbicides in the metabolism of the carotenoids in corn, {{the objective of the}} present study was to evaluate the effect of herbicides and genotype on carotenoids concentration. The green corn hybrids BRS 1030 and P 30 F 53 were subjected to a post-emergent herbicides application at 20 and 30 days after emergence. Carotenoids were extracted from corn grains and analyzed to quantify ß- and ß-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, ß-cryptoxanthin, total carotenoids (TC), and total of vitamin A carotenoids precursors (proVA). The application of foramsulfuron + <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> (40 + 2. 6 g ha- 1), nicosulfuron (20 g ha- 1), mesotrione (120 g ha- 1) and tembotrione (80 g ha- 1 and 100 g ha- 1) promoted higher concentration of carotenoids in fresh green corn. Lutein, zeaxanthin, ?-cryptoxanthin, ß-carotene, ß-carotene, proVA carotenoids, and TC concentration increased after foramsulfuron + <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> in late application (V 5 to V 6), nicosulfuron in both applications, mesotrione applied post-initial (V 3 to V 4), tembotrione (100 g ha- 1) in both applications and tembotrione (80 g ha- 1) in late post-application, at least for one hybrid. The content of carotenoids in the green corn kernels differed between 'BRS 1030 ' and 'P 30 F 53 '. Our results suggest a possibility of significant increase of carotenoids in green corn kernels through the handling of corn production with post-emergent herbicides. 201...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out over a two year period (2009 / 2010 and 2012 / 2013) on an {{experimental}} farm in the Alentejo region (Beja), in southern Portugal where rainfed malt barley (Hordeum distichum L.) is sown {{at the end of}} autumn or beginning of winter (November– December). The aim of this experiment was to study the efficiency of the herbicide <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> to control post-emergence broadleaved weeds in this cereal crop. The malt barley crop was established using no-till farming. This technology provides the necessary machine bearing capacity of the soil to assure the post-emergence application of herbicides at two diferente weed development stages. The herbicide <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> was applied at three doses (5. 0, 7. 5, and 10. 0 g a. i. · ha– 1) and at two different broadleaved weed development stages (3 to 4 and 6 to 7 pairs of leaves), that also corresponded to two diferente crop development stages (beginning of tillering and complete tillering). The results indicated that early herbicide application timing provided a significantly higher efficiency for all the applied herbicide doses, but this better weed control was not reflected in a higher crop grain yield. The lack of a higher crop grain yield was probably due to a crop phytotoxicity of the herbicide, when used at an early application timing...|$|E
40|$|On four {{winter wheat}} fields grown on soils of {{different}} textures in Belgium, 10 g a. i. ha- 1 of the sulfonylurea herbicide <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> was applied post-emergence in the spring. A procedure {{was developed for}} the analysis in field soils of iodosulfuron-methyl 1 and of its metabolites iodosulfonamide 2 and iodosaccharin 3 with a sensitivity limit of 0. 3 μg of equivalents of iodosulfuron-methyl 1 kg - 1 dry soil. GC and GC-MS was used after purification of the soil extracts by repeated TLC, and methylation. The results of the chemical analyses were confirmed by means of bioassays using sugar beet as test plants. On a winter wheat crop grown on sandy loam soil of pH 6. 2 at Melle, <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> 1 was applied {{at the beginning of}} April. The iodosulfuron-methyl 1 soil half-life in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer was 60 days. At the end of June, the sum of the concentrations of the metabolites 2 and 3 in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer attained a maximum corresponding to 27 % of the applied dose. Green manures were sown after the harvest of the wheat at the end of August. No phytotoxicity at all was observed during the growth of the green manures, in spite of the very low residues of iodosulfuron-methyl 1 remaining in soil in September and October. At the mid of November, iodosulfuron-methyl 1 and its metabolites 2 and 3 were no more detected in soil. On three other winter wheat crops grown on clay soils of pH of about 8 at Leke, Gistel and Zevekote, <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> 1 was applied at the beginning of May. The soil half-life of iodosulfuron-methyl 1 in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer was between 30 and 44 days. Since the application and until the mid of November, in all the trials made on sandy loam or clay soils, iodosulfuron-methyl 1 (and its metabolites 2 and 3 in the trial made on sandy loam soil) were never detected in the 10 - 15 and 15 - 20 cm surface soil layers, indicating their low mobilities in the field soils.

40|$|Bromus diandrus Roth is {{a common}} weed species that has {{increased}} in no-tillage dry-land cereal fields in NE Spain because of the limited control options. The fitness response of plants with different emergence times (ETs) and its influence on demography has huge implications in weed management. With this subject, three ETs (F 1, F 2 and F 3) of B. diandrus were established through three crop-sowing dates (D 1, Oct.; D 2, Nov.; D 3, Dec.) {{for each of the}} three years in a barley-wheat-wheat rotation. In barley, the herbicides applied were not specific for B. diandrus, whereas in wheat the specific herbicide mesosulfuron-methyl plus <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> was applied. Plant density after treatments and fitness characteristics were estimated for each weed ET. Weed density decreased for later ETs and fitness was density-dependent, showing significantly higher values when a non-specific herbicide was applied, except in number of caryopses per spikelet. The increasing fitness shown by plants with later ETs and the linear relationships of vegetative biomass vs reproductive biomass and fecundity were disrupted by the herbicide mesosulfuron-methyl plus <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium.</b> Plants that had survived this herbicide when wheat was growing had lower values for all the characteristics analysed. After three seasons, as a consequence of decreasing seed recruitment, a practical depletion of the B. diandrus population was achieved in F 2 and F 3 (< 2. 8 and < 1 plants/m 2, respectively) but not in F 1 (60. 5 plants/m 2). This study shows the importance of delayed crop sowing to optimize the control of B. diandrus in cereal fields with no tillage.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi confirmar a resistência de um biótipo da planta daninha losna-branca (Parthenium hysterophorus) aos herbicidas inibidores da enzima acetolactato sintase (ALS), proveniente de uma propriedade rural no município de Mandaguari, norte do Estado do Paraná. Plantas com suspeita de resistência foram tratadas com diversos herbicidas e doses e comparadas com plantas de uma população suscetível. Os tratamentos foram as doses recomendadas dos herbicidas, duas e quatro vezes superiores à dose recomendada.

As curvas de doseresposta do biótipo resistente foram inferiores às do biótipo suscetível em todas as doses e herbicidas estudados. O biótipo de losna-branca foi confirmado como resistente aos herbicidas inibidores da ALS. A ocorrência de resistência cruzada foi observada em relação aos herbicidas pertencentes aos grupos químicos das imidazolinonas (imazethapyr), triazolopirimidinas (cloransulam-methyl) e sulfoniluréias (chlorimuron-ethyl e <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> mais foramsulfuron). O herbicida 2, 4 -D, apresentou alto índice de controle de ambos os biótipos de losna-branca avaliados, confirmando que esse mecanismo de ação do herbicida é uma importante alternativa para manejar áreas com problemas de resistência. Weed control using {{herbicide application}} {{is a common}} agricultural practice. However, {{the application of the}} same herbicide or herbicides with the same mechanism of action, for consecutive years, in the same area, can result in the selection of herbicide resistant biotypes. The aim of this work was to confirm the resistance of a ragweed (Parthenium hysterophorus) biotype to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides. The plants were collected on a farm in Mandaguari, north of Parana State, Brazil. Plants with suspicious resistance were treated with several herbicides and rates and compared with those of a susceptible population. The herbicide treatments were established considering the recommended rates, double and four times higher than the recommended rate as follows: cloransulam-methyl 0. 0, 33. 6, 67. 2 and 134. 4 g a. i. ha- 1 plus adjuvant 0. 2 % v/v, chlorimuron-ethyl 0. 0, 20. 0, 40. 0 and 80. 0 g a. i., imazethapyr 0. 0, 100. 0, 200. 0 and 400. 0 g a. i. ha- 1, <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> plus foramsulfuron 0. 0, 3. 0 + 45. 0 ga. i. ha- 1 (150. 0 g c. p. ha- 1), 6. 0 + 90. 0 g a. i. ha- 1 (300. 0 g c. p. ha- 1) and 12. 0 + 180. 0 g a. i. ha¹ (600. 0 g c. p. ha- 1). In addition, a treatment with 2, 4 -D (536. 0 g a. e. ha¹) was applied. Resistant plant dose-response curves presented lower values when compared to the susceptible population, in all rates and herbicides studied. The ragweed biotype was confirmed as resistant to the ALS inhibiting herbicides.

40|$|Yield {{losses in}} cereal crops under {{temperate}} climate conditions due to weed-crop competition, namely Lolium rigidum G., can reach up to 80 %, {{depending on the}} season and infestation level. Nevertheless, the costs of chemical weed control and the environmental impact caused by herbicides recommend the search for strategies to reduce their input. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the possibility of reducing the input of different post-emergence herbicides (diclofop-methyl + fenoxaprop–p-ethyl and amidosulfuron + <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium)</b> to control Lolium rigidum G. and broad-leaf weeds in barley under no-till, and to monitor the effect on weed population levels and crop yields. A field experiment was carried out in 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009, in an experimental farm in the south of Portugal, combining different herbicide doses applied at different weed development stages.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out over two years (2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006) on a private farm in the Alentejo region (Évora), in the South of Portugal where rainfed wheat is sown {{at the start of}} the winter {{rainfall}} season. The wheat crop was established using no-till as this technology provides the necessary machine bearing capacity of the soil to assure the post-emergence application of herbicides at different weed development stages. Mesosulfuron-methyl (3 %) and <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> (0. 6 %) and mefenpyr-diethyl (9 %) were used at three doses and two dates with three different application volumes. The results of this study indicate that using lower doses than recommended (0. 4 kg ha− 1) this herbicide controls the annual grass weeds (Avena sterilis L. and Lolium rigidum G.) better than some broad-leaved weeds. For all doses and volume combinations, the application at the first weed development stage (beginning of tillering for grass weeds and 3 – 4 pairs of leaves for broad-leaved weeds) provided higher grain yields. The lower efficiency of control of more developed grass and broad-leaved weeds and a longer period of competition between crop and weeds for the second application date (complete tillering for grass weeds and 5 – 6 pairs of leaves for broad-leaved weeds) were responsible for the significantly lower crop yields for this application date. Within each application date no significant differences were obtained between all dose/volume combinations, indicating that the reduction of dose is possible. At the later application date, the lower herbicide dose seems to require a lower application volume to provide maximum grain yield...|$|E
40|$|Alopecurus myosuroides, a {{problematic}} weed of UK winter cereals, is predominantly controlled by post-emergent herbicides with ALS and ACCase modes of action (MOA). Evolved resistance to these MOA - endowed by {{the mechanisms of}} targetsite (TSR) and/or enhanced metabolism (EMR) – threatens the sustainable production of winter cereals in the UK. This project aims to establish the frequency of ALS and ACCase resistance in UK populations of A. myosuroides and the factors that drive its evolution. From a 2011 survey of 92 UK A. myosuroides populations, mesosulfuron-methyl + <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium</b> (ALS) resistance was confirmed in 81 populations; all 92 populations exhibited clodinofop-propargyl (ACCase) resistance. To understand how management affects resistance evolution, seventeen populations from the 2011 survey were resampled (2012 – 2014) so that estimated frequencies of phenotypic resistance, TSR and EMR could be compared to weed management histories. Fields in which spring crops were more frequently planted possessed A. myosuroides that exhibited lower levels of phenotypic resistance to both ALS and ACCase MOA. A simulation model was developed to describe A. myosuroides herbicide resistance evolution. However, this model could not be validated when parameterized with resistance and management data collected from the UK. In the 2011 survey, homozygous Pro- 197 -Thr ALS TSR mutations were absent. Phenotyping, germination, and genotyping experiments of plants from controlled heterozygous Pro- 197 -Thr crosses confirmed {{that there is a}} lethality associated with homozygous Pro- 197 -Thr mutations. To test the hypothesis that preexisting ACCase EMR increases the rate of ALS EMR selection, four A. myosuroides populations – three with ACCase EMR and one without - were selected over two generations with ALS herbicide.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} in weeds {{is a major}} threat to agricultural productivity, but the incidence of herbicide {{resistance in}} agricultural systems continues to increase. It is increasingly recognised that sustainable weed management can only be achieved by considering the ecological and evolutionary drivers of herbicide resistance evolution. Within this context, {{it has been suggested that}} selection within pre-existing variation in herbicide susceptibility, underpinned by additive genetic variation, may result in rapid evolution of herbicide resistance. In this thesis, these principles were tested in the major agricultural weed Alopecurus myosuroides (black-grass). Dose-response experiments demonstrated pre-existing phenotypic variation in response to two commercial herbicides with alternative modes of action (the ACCase inhibitor herbicide fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and the ALS inhibitors mesosulfuron-methyl and <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium)</b> in A. myosuroides with no history of exposure to herbicide. Selection within this pre-existing variation was then tested using low doses of the herbicide fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, demonstrating rapid increases in resistance following a single generation of selection. Recurrent selection showed further, but non-significant, increases in resistance. Competition experiments were then performed to compare fitness in the absence of herbicide between the original susceptible population, and a population following two generations of selection for fenoxaprop-P-ethyl resistance. Results suggested that both resistant and susceptible A. myosuroides populations were of similar fitness and competitiveness: seed output was highly variable, and both resistant and susceptible populations were highly competitive against wheat. Finally, the possibility of exploiting dose-dependent selection to limit resistance evolution was tested in a long-term dose rotation experiment using the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results showed that rotating between a very high herbicide dose and no herbicide application could limit resistance evolution, but overall population control was poor. There were indications that rotation between intermediate higher and lower herbicide doses could successfully control population sizes and limit resistance evolution, but these effects were only present in the earlier stages of the experiment...|$|E
40|$|The term ‘emerging contaminants’ is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to compounds previously not considered or known to be significant to groundwater (in terms of distribution and/or concentration) which are now being more widely detected. As analytical techniques improve, previously undetected organic micropollutants are being observed in the aqueous environment. Many emerging contaminants remain unregulated, but the number of regulated contaminants will continue to grow slowly over the next several decades. There is a wide variety of sources and pathways for these compounds to enter the environment and these include agriculture and urban areas. Some of these contaminants can have human or ecological health effects and {{there is a need for}} better understanding of their fate in environmental systems. This report provides a short review of the types of organic micropollutants which can be found in the aqueous environment. These include nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial additives and by-products, personal care products and fragrances, water treatment by-products, flame/fire retardants and surfactants, as well as caffeine and nicotine metabolites and hormones. Many of the compounds are relatively small polar molecules which are not effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment using activated carbon. Pesticides and some industrial compounds are presently covered by the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Regulations and the Drinking Water Directive. Additional parameters, such as bisphenol A and nonyl-phenol are anticipated to be covered by revisions to the Drinking Water Directive. Others are currently unregulated. In order to assess the hazards presented by such compounds, information on usage, persistence, leachability and a robust sensitive analytical method is required. The UK metaldehyde problem was not originally discovered due to lack of an analytical method and was exacerbated by recalcitrance in water treatment. For many pesticides these requirements are fulfilled and an assessment of risk of leaching to groundwater can be made. However, for pesticide metabolites this information can be sparse and for compounds such as pharmaceuticals it can be lacking. A simple hazard assessment for currently approved pesticides was made from information on UK usage, persistence, sorption to soil carbon and published leaching indices. The following compounds were assessed as having the greatest potential for leaching to water: 2, 4 -D, amidosulfuron, bentazone, clopyralid, dicamba, florasulam, fosthiazate, imazaquin, <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium,</b> maleic hydrazide, MCPA, MCPP-P, metribuzin, metsulfuronmethyl, quinmerac, oxamyl, and triclopyr with a further 46 also having potential. Of these, 19 had an octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) less than that of metaldehyde and therefore are likely to be incompletely removed by water treatment. A simple assessment for pesticide metabolites, based only on organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) and persistence data, in this study gave results which agreed in principle with other studies. The different approaches indicate that the metabolites of chlorothalonil, cyanazine, diflufenican, flufenacet, iodosulfuron-methyl, metaldehyde, metazachlor and metsulfuron-methyl are likely to pose the greatest risk to drinking water. In many cases these metabolites are derived from parents which have a lesser risk. Other organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, cannot as yet be assessed in the same way due to a lack of persistence data since the majority of persistence studies have been directed at water treatment. A range of organic micropollutants from urban settings have been detected in ground and surface water. Commonly detected compounds include: bisphenol A, carbamazepine, galaxolide, ibuprofen, iopamidol, phthalates, phenyl ethoxylates, and sulfamethoxazole. Case studies show that a small number of contaminants may be used to characterise the contaminant loading and also be used to assess the migration pathways in urban areas. Data interpreted by BGS from the Environment Agency’s monitoring programme for organic pollutants indicates that the 30 most frequently detected compounds comprise both established and emerging compounds and include a number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum compounds, triazine herbicides, chlorinated solvents, degradation products and THMs, caffeine, DEET and industrial compounds such as bisphenol A and tributyl phosphate. Specific determinands include a range of currently licensed and phased out pesticides with a few metabolites, pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine and triclosan, caffeine, nicotine and food additives and alkyl phosphates. These data exhibit hot spots which may indicate possible research areas. Future research should focus on a compound identified in the literature and detected by Environment Agency monitoring. Possible topics could be a study of migration through the unsaturated zone. In many cases the mechanism for migration of emerging contaminants from the surface to groundwater is very unclear...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{formulate}} a model of industrial ecology for wider application in the Nelson Mandel Bay (NMB) Metropole. To achieve this aim, the following objectives will be pursued: • A theoretical investigation of the concept of industrial ecology – in an attempt to establish its meaning, as well as the implications thereof. • A theoretical investigation of the operational implications of industrial ecology, including existing methodologies, such as Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that can be applied, in order to develop a system of industrial ecology between different companies. • The formulation of a methodology for application to the case study. • Presenting and discussing the research results produced by the application of the industrial ecology related methodology to the case study. • To present a synthesis of the research results of this study. This objective includes a critical evaluation of the research methodology and results, as well as some recommendations for the facilitation of industrial ecology. The methodology of the research involved conducting semi structured interviews, conducting a Material Flow Analysis and Life Cycle Analysis using SIMAPRO software. There interview with Goodyear management took place (see Appendix A), while the management at Sovereign Foods agreed to an interview however they didn’t honour the agreement. During the interview at Goodyear understanding of the operational process was achieved by conducting the interviews. The three areas that were discussed during the interview process were: 1. How the boiler works; 2. Current Air-Emission results; and 3. The process of steam generation. An MFA and an LCA on the production process of comparing the boiler functionality was conducted, so that there is an adequate understanding of the environmental performance of the two different boilers. The results of the MFA are presented as follows, namely: the goal and scope definition and the inventory results. Coal boiler versus fluidised boiler data where modelled. The modelling is done on comparing the flow of chemicals during steam production process, and which chemicals have a significant environmental impact. The LCA results looked at the basis of the symbiotic approach by identifying sustainable choices of design, production and consumption. The findings of this research have been obtained from the investigation of industrial ecology framework planning at Goodyear SA and Sovereign Foods. The findings have revealed that there is a synergy that exists between the two case-study areas. However, this is based on Goodyear changing the technology of the boiler they use (a boiler creates steam for the tyre-building process). The company will be required to use a fluidised boiler, instead of the current coal boiler. The use of the fluidised boiler will ensure that all waste streams at Goodyear will be reused and recycled, thereby creating the framework for industrial ecology. The results that are firstly drawn out of SIMAPRO is the Life Cycle Inventory. In this research, there is a flow of 1437 chemical materials and substances in the production of steam using both coal boiler and fluidized boiler. Due to the number of substance flow elements, the research has presented only the significant substances that influence the environmental performance of steam production using the two different feeder materials, which are coal and chicken matter (see Figure 4. 4). In the coal boiler process, sulfur comprises the largest amount of chemical substance. The other top five chemical components that contribute to the steam production process are: nickel, chromium, arsenic and <b>iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium.</b> The scale of figure 4. 4 is reduced to show the various number of chemical flows found in the steam production process through SIMAPRO software. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results were presented looking at namely the following characterization, normalization, weighting, single score and damage assessment (see Figure 4. 7 – 4. 10 p 87 – p 90). The figures are presented as taken directly from the reports drawn from the SIMAPRO software. Figure 4. 7 gives the characterisation results up to 100 %, where 0 % has a minimal environmental effect; whereas 100 % has the most significant environmental effect. Oxidation of coal is compared versus the oxidation of chicken matter, the coal boiler process has higher environmental impacts. Figure 4. 8 shows the normalisation results of the coal boiler versus the fluidised boiler for the functional unit steam production. The environmental degradation under normalisation between the two boilers are measured, based on three parameters, namely: human health, ecosystems and resources. In all three parameters that are measured under normalisation, the production of steam using the coal boiler has the highest impacts. The weighting results in Figure 4. 9 show a mirror image of the normalisation results. Finally, a gap analysis of the theoretical requirements for industrial ecology is displayed versus what currently exists in the case study area. The gap analysis will assist in the development of recommendations. These will be presented in the next chapter. A gap analysis of findings is discussed leading into the synthesis. The value of this research is that the baseline data of planning for an industrial ecology create a platform that can be used for implementing an industrial ecology between Goodyear SA and Sovereign Foods. This will, in time, have wider applications for the entire NMB metropole...|$|E
