5000|$|Succisa pratensis Moench, {{also known}} as devil's-bit or devil's-bit scabious, is a {{flowering}} plant in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae. It differs from other similar species in that it has 4-lobed flowers, whereas small scabious and <b>field</b> <b>scabious</b> have 5 lobes and hence it has been placed in a separate genus in the same family. [...] It also grows on damper ground.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{unimproved}} grassland {{and supports}} {{a variety of}} plants. There {{is a mixture of}} plants which flourish on neutral and calcareous soils. The ridges support a diverse flora and these include Cowslip, Burnet-saxifrage, Common Restharrow, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus) and <b>Field</b> <b>Scabious.</b> Lady's Bedstraw and Meadow Barley are also recorded.

50|$|Surveys have {{identified}} the following rare species: reed grass (Glyceria maxima); Carex aquatilis; viper's bugloss (Echium vulgare); marestail (Hippuris vulgaris); <b>field</b> <b>scabious</b> (Knautia arvensis); spiked water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum); shoreweed (Littorella uniflora); butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha); ivy-leaved crowfoot (Ranunculus hederaceus); weld (Reseda luteola); marsh yellow-cress (Rorippa islandica); bay willow (Salix pentandra); creeping yellow-cress (Rorippa sylvestris); and the relatively rare plant, bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), that grows in sheltered areas {{on the west bank}} of the loch.|$|E
50|$|Plants which grow on {{the western}} scree include {{pyramidal}} orchid, autumna gentian and wild mignonette. The areas of the quarry which are now grassed support tor-grass and upright brome mixed with other species. These include fairy flax, harebell, dropwort, <b>field</b> <b>scabious,</b> lady's bedstraw, quaking-grass and woolly thistle. It is recorded that the bare limestone rubble, {{which is on the}} face of the main excavation area, used to support the rare perfoliate or Cotswold pennycress. This has not been seen for some time.|$|E
50|$|The meadows {{support a}} show of {{thousands}} (estimated at 45,000) of green-winged orchid in May, a colony of some size {{in this part of}} Gloucestershire. Also flowering in the late spring are common twayblade, adder's-tongue, cowslip, bluebell, and pignut. Taller grass and flowers develop over the summer and produce a haycrop at that time. Recordings include quaking-grass, common knapweed, meadow vetchling, downy oat-grass, <b>field</b> <b>scabious,</b> meadow buttercup, yellow-rattle, oxeye daisy, common bird's-foot trefoil, goat's-beard, fairy flax and Devil's-bit scabious. Meadow saffron flowers following the hay cut.|$|E
50|$|Elham is {{situated}} {{deep in the}} heart of the North Downs and within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Whilst much of the countryside surrounding the village is arable farmland there are still patches of unimproved or semi-improved grassland where wildlife is allowed to flourish such as Baldock Downs and Hall Downs. These sites often support many typical chalk downland species such as Common Milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), <b>Field</b> <b>Scabious</b> (Knautia arvensis)and Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor) as well as orchids such as Fragrant (Gymnadenia conopsea), Common Spotted (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and Pyramidal (Anacamptis pyramidalis).|$|E
50|$|Andrena marginata, {{sometimes}} called the small scabious mining bee is a species of the sand bee (Andrena) genus. It feeds on different nectar-bearing plants of the family Dipsacaceae, like <b>field</b> <b>scabious</b> and Devil's-bit scabious (from which its common name derives), though has also been observed foraging on knapweed and creeping thistle. The female builds a nest {{in the ground and}} fills the cells with a mixture of nectar and pollen. One egg is placed in each cell and the larva hatches, grow and pupates within the nest. The adults emerge in spring after hibernation.|$|E
50|$|The name Grintovec {{is shared}} {{with several other}} {{settlements}} (e.g., Grintovec, Grintovec pri Osilnici, etc.). The name {{is derived from the}} Slovene common noun grintavec 'snowy/rocky bare area', 'dolomite', a univerbation of the phrase grintav (svet) 'empty area, rough area'. Simonič also suggests that the name could be derived from the plant <b>field</b> <b>scabious</b> (Knautia arvensis), known as grintavec in Slovene and Grindkraut in German. The longer Slovene name Grintovec pri Kočevju means 'Grintovec near Kočevje'. The longer German name Grintowitz bei Altlack means 'Grintovec near Stari Log'.|$|E
50|$|Cuddington Meadows is a Grade I Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation. The {{site was}} shown as two {{enclosures}} {{on the open}} Banstead Downs on an early nineteenth century map, and it was later part of Walnut Tree Farm, which became Cuddington Hospital in 1897. The hospital closed in 1984, and in the late 1990s the land was transferred to Sutton Council to be managed for nature conservation. It is mainly chalk grassland with some scrub. Its most important feature is a variety of unusual flowering plants, including greater knapweed, lady's bedstraw and <b>field</b> <b>scabious.</b>|$|E
50|$|Succisa pratensis is a {{perennial}} herb up to 1m tall, growing from a basal rosette of simple or distantly-toothed, lanceolate leaves. Its unlobed leaves {{distinguish it from}} Knautia arvensis (<b>Field</b> <b>scabious).</b> The plant may be distinguished from Centaurea scabiosa (greater knapweed) by having its leaves in opposite pairs, not alternate as in knapweed. The bluish to violet (occasionally pink) flowers are borne in tight compound flower heads or capitula. Individual flowers are tetramerous, with a four-lobed epicalyx and calyx and a four-lobed corolla. Male and female flowers are produced on different flower heads (gynodioecious), the female flower heads being smaller. The flowering period in the British Isles is from June until October.|$|E
50|$|Woodnook Valley {{has been}} a SSSI since March 1986. It {{is an example of}} a {{calcareous}} grassland. On the site are two types of orchid - the early purple orchid, and the man orchid. There is also the carline thistle, the mouse-ear hawkweed, harebell, glaucous sedge and the common centaury. Insect life is apparent when grassland plants are in flower. Garden bumblebees can be seen on <b>field</b> <b>scabious</b> and lycaenid butterflies typical of this habitat such as the small copper and common blue, and a variety of browns including meadow brown, gatekeeper and ringlet can also be seen. Raptors such as the kestrel, buzzard and red kite also inhabit the area, hunting small rodents and rabbits which inhabit the grassland.|$|E
50|$|Rifle Butts Quarry is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The {{particular}} interest of this reserve is the geological feature exposed on the quarry face. The site {{is owned by}} the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. The exposure which is identified as being of national importance in the Geological Conservation Review shows a Cretaceous unconformity, where sediments from the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods were eroded away. It shows a section of Red Chalk and White Chalk overlying Lias. A shelter has been constructed to protect the quarry face from erosion. The reserve is situated on {{the western edge of the}} Yorkshire Wolds, one mile south-east of Goodmanham and two miles from Market Weighton. The site, which was designated a SSSI in 1952, has over 150 plants recorded. It still displays some characteristic chalk species, including cowslip, marjoram, <b>field</b> <b>scabious</b> and wild basil. Breeding birds include willow warbler and yellowhammer.|$|E
