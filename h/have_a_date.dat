5|$|For unknown reasons, Ruisdael {{almost entirely}} stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five {{works from the}} 1660s have a, {{partially}} obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>date.</b> Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely based on detective work and speculation.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Don Brothwell {{considers}} {{that many of}} the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques, such as computer tomography (CT) scans, has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination. Of the 27bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> range from the early 1st to the 4thcenturies. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, when Elsa {{becomes a}} young adult, she {{is set to}} be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously {{preparing}} for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E

This culminates in him impersonating Durant himself, causing confusion among the mobster and his henchmen. When Westlake and Julie <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> at the carnival, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper and inadvertently reveals to Julie that there is indeed something wrong with him. She follows him as he flees (his 99 minutes were up,) and when she discovers his discarded mask, she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him, and after discovering the Bellasarious Memorandum on his desk {{while he was on}} the phone, confirms he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake.|$|E

500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano.

LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way we used to do the Beatles.

After the dance, Meg begins to think Brian is her boyfriend, despite Brian saying he has no feelings for her and citing his already existing relationship with Jillian.

2500|$|Unlike the USA and Canada {{which by}} policy never declare issued money invalid, Sweden {{and most other}} European {{countries}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> when older series of banknotes or older coin designs are invalid and are no longer legal tender. [...] From the years 2001 to 2008 banknotes and coins were circulated at a near constant level of around 12,000 krona per capita, but in 2006 a modified 1000-kronor banknote with a motion security strip was produced. Within 7 years the banknotes without the strip were declared invalid,leaving only a radically reduced number of banknotes with foil valid. The Vasa 1000-kronor banknotes without the foil strip became invalid after 31 December 2013, and the pieces with the foil strip are invalid after 30 June 2016. Also the Swish mobile payment system was established in Sweden in 2012 and become a popular alternative to cash payments.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, a Beaker period copper dagger blade was {{recovered}} from the Sillees River near Ross Lough, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. The flat, triangular-shaped copper blade was [...] long, with bevelled edges and a pointed tip, and featured an integral tang that accepted a riveted handle. Flint arrow-heads and copper-blade daggers with handle tangs, found in association with Beaker pottery in {{many other parts of}} Europe, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> later than the initial phase of Beaker People activity in Ireland. Also the typical Beaker wristguards seem to have entered Ireland by cultural diffusion only, after the first intrusions, and unlike English and Continental Beaker burials never made it to the graves. The same lack of typical Beaker association applies to the about thirty found stone battle axes. A gold ornament found in County Down that closely resembles a pair of ear-rings from Ermegeira, Portugal, has a composition that suggests it was imported. Incidental finds suggest links to non-British Beaker territories, like a fragment of a bronze blade in County Londonderry that has been likened to the [...] "palmella" [...] points of Iberia, even though the relative scarcity of beakers, and Beaker-compatible material of any kind, in the south-west are regarded as an obstacle to any colonisation directly from Iberia, or even from France. Their greater concentration {{in the northern part of}} the country, which traditionally is regarded as the part of Ireland least blessed with sources of copper, has led many authorities to question the role of Beaker People in the introduction of metallurgy to Ireland. However, indications of their use of stream sediment copper, low in traces of lead and arsenic, and Beaker finds connected to mining and metalworking at Ross Island, County Kerry, provide an escape to such doubts.|$|E

2500|$|Skepticism {{had existed}} even before Yamano's blog post. [...] The National Archive wrote in {{warning that the}} Archives version of the {{photograph}} did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>date.</b> [...] Dorothy Cochrane, a curator at the aeronautics department of the National Air and Space Museum, called the new evidence merely a [...] "blurry photograph" [...] and cited the existing evidence from radio transmissions that suggested that the Electra was at least close to Howland Island, 800 {{miles away from the}} Marshall Islands. [...] Author Fukiko Aoki, who researched and wrote a 1982 book, Looking for Amelia, was similarly critical before the revelations from Yamano. [...] Aoki located an elderly officer, part of the 1937 crew of the Kōshū Maru, who denied the ship's involvement. [...] Aoki subsequently researched the Kōshū Maru ship log which showed it as having been 1,500 miles away at the time of Earhart's disappearance. [...] It was also argued that to reach and somehow land on the remote atoll where she purportedly crashed would have required Earhart, though low on fuel, to change her northeast course as she neared Howland Island and fly hundreds of miles northwest. [...] Additionally, had Japanese officials found Earhart, they would have had substantial motivation to rescue and return her considering her fame. [...] The claims of a U.S. government cover-up also came under criticism; the documentary prominently mentions [...] "a report dated January 7, 1939 that Earhart was a prisoner in the Marshall Islands." [...] TIGHAR, a group that advocates the Gardner Island hypothesis of the disappearance, investigated the 1939 government report, which was not hard to find, and found that it was a report on an obvious prankan implausible tale found in France from someone who did not identify themselves. [...] The message told of being kidnapped by the Japanese, having his crew killed, finding Earhart in custody, then being sent to Europe on an unnamed Japanese ship. [...] TIGHAR wrote that the photo was [...] "neither lost nor evidence" [...] and that the picture had been [...] "exactly where it should be, and was exactly what it was labeled to be, a picture of Jaluit Harbor," [...] criticizing the [...] "lost and misfiled photo" [...] element of The Lost Evidence as well.|$|E
