5|$|In January 2015, the US National Transportation Safety Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> and transponders.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders,</b> or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater locator beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E

5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the JACC, a search of the ocean surface by aircraft continued until 28 April. An acoustic underwater search for underwater locator beacons attached to the aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> ended 14 April, followed by a sonar survey of the seafloor near an area where acoustic detections were made. The sonar survey finished on 28 May and found nil debris from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Initially, ground {{observers}} {{confirmed that}} pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure GNSS <b>Flight</b> <b>Recorders</b> that record the position {{every few seconds}} from GPS satellites. These recording devices now provide the proof that the turn-points have been reached.|$|E
5|$|The TSB made nine {{recommendations}} {{relating to}} changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture, as both <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training. These recommendations have led to widespread changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.|$|E
5000|$|At CES 2013, Parrot {{announced}} the <b>Flight</b> <b>Recorder</b> add-on for the AR.Drone 2.0. It adds 4GB of storage to the drone, along with GPS tracking and flight data recording. It will allow pilots {{to define a}} flight path by selecting a series of waypoints that the drone will follow. <b>Flight</b> <b>Recorder</b> features can be controlled via mobile phone and desktop applications, with [...] "Director Mode" [...] and [...] "Rescue Mode" [...] included. An extended battery designed to increase flight time by up to 50% was also launched alongside the <b>Flight</b> <b>Recorder.</b>|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{recovered}} the <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> from the crash site. The <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> was later taken to United Kingdom for further analysis. After investigators downloaded the content, {{they found that}} the recordings stopped abruptly while the flight was still in mid-air. Investigators concluded that a sudden explosive decompression caused this abrupt stop of the recordings.|$|R

5|$|With {{the loss}} of all 239 people on board, Flight 370 is the second deadliest {{incident}} involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines' history, behind Flight 17 in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight 370 and the downing of Flight 17; the airline was re-nationalised {{by the end of}} 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and <b>flight</b> <b>recorders,</b> including several issues raised four years earlier—but never mandated—following {{the loss of}} Air France Flight 447. In response to Flight 370's disappearance, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted new standards for aircraft position reporting over open ocean, extended recording time for cockpit voice recorders, and, from 2020, will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders,</b> or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} denied {{knowledge of}} the incident, but later admitted shooting down the aircraft, claiming that {{it was on a}} MASINT spy mission. The Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said it was a deliberate provocation by the United States to probe the Soviet Union's military preparedness, or even to provoke a war. The White House accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations. The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders,</b> which were released eight years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash {{and landed in}} the street below. Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up by}} a passerby who gave it to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the South Tower collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a folding knife, and pepper spray. In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E
50|$|According to the BEA, {{this was}} the first fatal {{accident}} in the Twin Otter whereby an accidental thrust selection caused a propeller to enter the Beta range. The investigation was hampered as there was no <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> installed on the plane. After the crash, the BEA made mandatory recommendation(s) to equip every transport plane with at least one <b>flight</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|R

5|$|At 10:03:11, near Indian Lake and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, {{the plane}} {{crashed into a}} field near a {{reclaimed}} coal strip mine known as the Diamond T. Mine owned by PBS Coals in Stonycreek Township in Somerset County. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the flight impacted at 563mph (906km/h, 252m/s, or 489 knots) at a 40-degree nose-down, inverted attitude. The impact left a crater eight to ten feet deep (c. 3m), and 30 to 50 feet wide (c. 12m). All 44 people on board died. Many media reports and eyewitness accounts said {{the time of the}} crash was 10:06 or 10:10; an initial analysis of seismographic data in the area concluded that the crash occurred at 10:06, but the 9/11 Commission report states that this analysis was not definitive and was retracted. Other media outlets and the 9/11 Commission reported the time of impact as 10:03, based on when the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> stopped, analysis of radar data, infrared satellite data, and air traffic control transmissions.|$|E
5|$|Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (also {{known as}} KAL007 and KE007) was a {{scheduled}} Korean Air Lines flight from New York City to Seoul via Anchorage, Alaska. On September 1, 1983, the South Korean airliner serving {{the flight was}} shot down by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor. The Boeing 747 airliner was en route from Anchorage to Seoul, but deviated from its original planned route and flew through Soviet prohibited airspace {{around the time of}} a U.S. aerial reconnaissance mission. The Soviet Air Force treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding U.S. spy plane, and proceeded to destroy it with air-to-air missiles, after firing warning shots which were likely not seen by the KAL pilots. The Korean airliner eventually crashed in the sea near Moneron Island west of Sakhalin in the Sea of Japan. All 269 passengers and crew aboard were killed, including Larry McDonald, a Representative from Georgia in the United States House of Representatives. The Soviets found the wreckage under the sea on September 15, and found the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> in October, but this information was kept secret until 1993.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to initial}} news reports, which stated that both <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> have been {{successfully}} read-out, the investigation team determined that the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> are non-analyzable because the CVR was inoperative for the past nine {{days leading up to}} the crash and the FDR was mysteriously found to have only recorded the first 14 minutes of the flight after which it stopped recording.|$|E
5000|$|In aviation, the <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> {{is often}} called a [...] "black box", {{especially}} by the media, although it is usually bright orange to facilitate its discovery after a crash. In an airplane or helicopter, the <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> consists of two independent devices that are usually combined in a single unit. The <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> logs information about controls and sensors, and the cockpit voice recorder preserves the most recent sounds in the cockpit, including conversation of the pilots. If an accident happens, investigators can use the recordings {{to assist in the}} investigation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Flight</b> Data <b>Recorders</b> (Black Boxes) {{generate}} {{data that}} is collected on an embedded memory device. A well-known difficulty with these devices {{is that the}} embedded memory device runs out of space. The worry of getting into this problematical situation compels the software of the <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> to operate in a watchful mode- it constantly makes efforts to minimize the use of memory space; otherwise a larger <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> will be needed; however a larger <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> can be very problematic because <b>flight</b> data <b>recorders</b> have very rigorous requirements; therefore an enlargement is very expensive and costly. In this paper it is suggested to send the data to a remote cloud, so the <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> memory device will be in actual fact unbounded...|$|R

25|$|However, {{according}} to an investigative report by the Turkish daily Sabah in February 2012, citing internal correspondence, the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> were never actually handed over to Lufthansa Technik. Instead, the <b>flight</b> <b>recorders</b> were consigned to the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU), where they were opened and investigated by Feridun Seren and his team himself.

25|$|Both <b>flight</b> <b>{{recorder}}s,</b> {{the cockpit}} voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) were recovered in the afternoon following the crash and were subsequently sent to the Lufthansa Technik laboratories in Germany for analysis.|$|E
50|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} (CVR) was quickly found and recovered; and on 30 November divers recovered the second <b>flight</b> <b>recorder</b> - the <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> (FDR) - and a third body, unidentified at the time.

40|$|Purpose – Extensive {{enlargement}} {{and safety}} of <b>Flight</b> Data <b>Recorder</b> memory. Design/methodology/approach – Moving the memory of <b>Flight</b> Data <b>Recorders</b> from an internal embedded device to a cloud. Findings – Our implementation has made the embedded memory device of <b>Flight</b> Data <b>Recorder</b> effectively unlimited and hence much more information can be stored. Research limitations/implications – The possibility of a <b>flight</b> data <b>recorder</b> to be damaged or lost in a crash is not so high, but our implementation can be very helpful in cases such as aerial disappearances. Practical implications – Larger and protected memory for <b>Flight</b> Data <b>Recorders.</b> Social implications – Faster finding of reasons for crashes and enabling to take immediate actions so as to remedy the failures. Originality/value – The use of Internet and cellphones in airplanes is nothing special in our time. It is suggested to take this technology for <b>Flight</b> Data <b>Recorders</b> as well...|$|R
