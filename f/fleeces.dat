5|$|The main {{centre of}} the new woollen {{industry}} was initially in south east Wales drawing on sheep from the monasteries of Margam, Neath and Tintern and the flocks of the Bohun family, which produced 18,500 <b>fleeces</b> in 1372.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. <b>Fleeces</b> are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fleece</b> jacket or <b>fleece</b> is a {{lightweight}} casual jacket made of polyester synthetic wool such as Polar <b>Fleece.</b> A <b>fleece</b> jacket will typically have a zipper up the middle, rather than buttons or other fasteners. A <b>fleece</b> will provide thermal insulation {{but is not}} normally weatherproof and so won't keep out wind and rain.|$|R
40|$|Gravid {{females of}} Lucilia cuprina (Wiedeman) in a {{laboratory}} cage orientated positively to samples of <b>fleece.</b> Newly-wetted <b>fleece</b> was significantly more attractive than dry <b>fleece,</b> an effect resulting from the action {{of water on the}} <b>fleece</b> and not just addition of water vapour to the volatile <b>fleece</b> kairomones. <b>Fleece</b> contaminated with serous exudate, resulting from myiasis by L. cuprina, was much more attractive than wet, uncontaminated <b>fleece</b> from the same sheep. Kairomones from wetted <b>fleece</b> consistently augmented the attractive effects of 2 -mercaptoethanol and indole in separate experiments, and of hydrogen sulphide (released from saturated aqueous sodium sulphide solution) in one trial out of three, but not overall. It is suggested that volatile <b>fleece</b> kairomones play a part in eliciting orientation to sheep by gravid L. cuprina. <b>Fleece</b> kairomones may augment the efficacy of kairomones released by putrefactive conditions in the <b>fleece,</b> which are known to predispose sheep to fly strike. They may also provide an input which helps to retain L. cuprina populations in the sheep 2 ̆ 7 s peridomestic precinct...|$|R
50|$|The Navajo-Churros {{possess a}} dual coat, {{which has an}} inner and an outer layer. The <b>fleece</b> is {{composed}} of an inner coat (80% of <b>fleece),</b> and outer coat that is hair fibers (10-20% of <b>fleece)</b> and kemp (a coarse, opaque fiber, less than 5% of <b>fleece).</b>|$|R
5|$|They have {{naturally}} short tails, {{which do}} not require docking. They also moult their fleece naturally, {{rather than having to}} be shorn annually, though older individuals do not moult as easily and may require additional shearing. <b>Fleeces</b> are grey or creamy white on the body, though darker individuals occur whose colouring is similar to the Soay sheep. Rough in quality, the wool is mostly used in the creation of tweeds or carpet yarns. A tweed is a rough-surfaced coarse cloth, typically made in Scotland. Its colour is a mix of flecked colours. The face and legs are wool-free and black and white, with the proportions varying between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool <b>fleeces.</b> The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} weaving of fine kersies and later serges was {{introduced}} to the area by weavers from the continent. This was largely a cottage industry and merchants would have premises where the <b>fleeces</b> would be combed and sorted. John Lane {{was one of the best}} known local cloth merchants (see Lane's Aisle in the section on St Andrew's church below). In the seventeenth century, Higher and Lower King's Mills were fulling mills for the local industry. In 1816 Mr Upcott employed 60 weavers and 'many spinners'. The Wellington based firm Fox Brothers had a branch factory built in 1890 and made high quality woolen and worsted cloth until 1977. During World War I, their entire output was of khaki cloth, employing over 200 people. In 1910 Mrs Gidley, wife of Dr Gustavus Gidley, set up a hand-weaving enterprise in the stables of Heyford House with the aim of giving employment to ex-servicemen and disabled people. To manage it she appointed two women, one a granddaughter of Bishop Phillpotts. Later the business evolved into machine knitted garments.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the entire}} <b>fleece</b> {{has been removed}} from the sheep, the <b>fleece</b> is thrown, clean side down, on to a wool table by a shed hand (commonly known in New Zealand and Australian sheds as a roustabout or roustie). The wool table top {{consists}} of slats spaced approximately 12 cm apart. This enables short pieces of wool, the locks and other debris, to gather beneath the table separately from the <b>fleece.</b> The <b>fleece</b> is then skirted by one or more wool rollers to remove the sweat fribs and other less desirable parts of the <b>fleece.</b> The removed pieces largely consist of shorter, seeded, burry or dusty wool etc. which is still useful in the industry. As such they are placed in separate containers and sold along with <b>fleece</b> wool. Other items removed from the <b>fleece</b> on the table, such as faeces, skin fragments or twigs and leaves, are discarded a short distance from the wool table so as not to contaminate the wool and <b>fleece.</b>|$|R

40|$|Variation between {{animals in}} clean <b>fleece</b> weight {{at the same}} fibre {{diameter}} {{can be attributed to}} a number of skin and follicle factors. The aim of this project was to determine what contributions various skin and follicle attributes make to variation in clean <b>fleece</b> weight. Two groups of ten sheep were selected from the CSIRO Finewool flock at the extremes of estimated breeding values for clean <b>fleece</b> weight and mean fibre diameter (high clean <b>fleece</b> weight and low fibre diameter, low clean <b>fleece</b> weight and low fibre diameter) and the differences between the groups {{in a wide range of}} skin and follicle attributes were determined. The associa-tions between the skin and follicle attributes with clean <b>fleece</b> weight and fibre diameter were also calculated. There were significant associations of follicle density, S/P ratio, dp/ds ratio, follicle branching and follicle shutdown on clean <b>fleece</b> weight. The correlations between staple length and clean <b>fleece</b> weight (0. 50) were of similar magnitude to the correlations between clean <b>fleece</b> weight and follicle density (0. 37 to 0. 48), follicle branching (0. 50), S/P ratio (0. 28) and dp/ds ratio (0. 40). The data presented here suggest that several skin and follicle attributes make contributions to the wide distribution of <b>fleece</b> weights that we commonly observe in flocks at any given MFD...|$|R
25|$|Like many breeds of island sheep, Santa Cruz sheep are {{relatively}} small and extremely hardy: they are good foragers and need no assistance with lambing.

25|$|In Greek mythology, Colchis was the {{location}} of the Golden Fleece sought by Jason and the Argonauts in Apollonius Rhodius' epic tale Argonautica. The incorporation of the Golden Fleece into the myth may have derived from the local practice of using <b>fleeces</b> to sift gold dust from rivers. Known to its natives as Egrisi or Lazica, Colchis was also the battlefield of the Lazic War fought between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persia.|$|E

25|$|In antiquity, {{pitches and}} resins were used {{commonly}} as medicines. Pliny mentions {{a variety of}} tar-like substances being used as medicine, including cedria and pissinum. Cedria was the pitch and resin of the cedar tree, being equivalent to the oil of tar and pyroligneous acid which {{are used in the}} first stage of distilling creosote. He recommends cedria to ease the pain in a toothache, as an injection in the ear in case of hardness of hearing, to kill parasitic worms, as a preventative for impregnation, as a treatment for phthiriasis and porrigo, as an antidote for the poison of the sea hare, as a liniment for elephantiasis, and as an ointment to treat ulcers both on the skin and in the lungs. He further speaks of cedria being used as the embalming agent for preparing mummies. Pissinum was a tar water that was made by boiling cedria, spreading wool <b>fleeces</b> over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them out.|$|E
25|$|The North Yorkshire Moors Railway {{was first}} opened in 1836 as the Whitby and Pickering Railway. The railway was planned in 1831 by George Stephenson {{as a means}} of opening up trade routes inland from the then {{important}} seaport of Whitby. The initial railway was designed and built to be used by horse-drawn carriages. Construction was carried out by navvies and coordinated by top engineers. Their three main achievements were cutting a 120-yard tunnel through rock at Grosmont, constructing a rope-worked incline system at Beck Hole and traversing the marshy and deep Fen Bog using a bed of timber and sheep <b>fleeces.</b> The tunnel is believed {{to be one of the}} oldest railway tunnels in the world. In its first year of operation, the railway carried 10,000 tons of stone from Grosmont to Whitby, as well as 6,000 passengers, who paid a fare of 1shilling to sit on the roof of a coach, or 1shilling and 3pence to sit inside. It took two and a half hours to travel from Whitby to Pickering.|$|E
