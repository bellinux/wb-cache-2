5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived him, and {{had no intention of}} making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had <b>known</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be.

He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of <b>known</b> <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

5000|$|In England, Keiko becomes {{increasingly}} solitary and antisocial. Etsuko recalls how, as Keiko grew older, she would lock {{herself in her}} room and emerge only {{to pick up the}} dinner-plate that her mother would leave for her in the kitchen. This disturbing behavior ends, as the reader already has learned, in Keiko's suicide. [...] "Your father," [...] Etsuko tells Niki, [...] "was rather idealistic at times...He really believed we could give her a happy life over here...

Vukovich declares that Ruth is working for him now, turning into the same [...] "whatever it takes" [...] agent that his partner was.|$|E
