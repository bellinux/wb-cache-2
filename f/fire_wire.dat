40|$|The {{ceramic powder}} {{prepared}} from {{the mixture of}} Mn 3 O 4 and La 2 O 3 have been characterized for NTC behavior and the same {{have been used as}} CT 2 C (continuous thermocouple) sensor {{in the form of a}} thin metal cable to detect over-heating. These materials have mega ohm resistance at room temperature and showed exponential drop in resistance with the rise in temperature over a temperature range of 100 - 400 °C. It has been observed that as the concentration of La 2 O 3 increases from 0 to 10 % the NTC behavior drops from (400 - 260 °C) ′ 10 %. The material was pressed into pellets and sintered at 700 °C for 3 h resulting in good bonding strength. Electrical characterization of the material was done by measuring the resistance over a temperature range of 100 - 400 °C The material showed reproducible NTC characteristics over the temperature range 400, 370, 340, 280, and 260 °C with decreasing thermistor constant values (B = 9588, 9210, 8500, 5170, 3330 K- 1) and activation energy (ΔE= 826, 794, 733, 445, 287 meV), respectively. The decrease in activation energy of the ceramic powder with increase in La 2 O 3 concentration makes it possible to fabricate thermal sensors which can be used in different temperature ranges.
