40|$|Contusion {{injuries}} in skeletal muscle commonly occur in contact sport and vehicular and industrial workplace accidents. Icing {{has traditionally been}} used to treat such injuries under the premise that it alleviates pain, reduces tissue metabolism, and modifies vascular responses to decrease swelling. Previous research has {{examined the effects of}} icing on inflammation and microcirculatory dynamics following muscle injury. However, whether icing influences angiogenesis, collateral vessel growth, or myofiber regeneration remains unknown. We compared the effects of icing vs. a sham treatment on the presence of neutrophils and macrophages; expression of CD 34, von Willebrands factor (vWF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and nestin; vessel volume; capillary density; and myofiber regeneration in skeletal after muscle contusion injury in rats. Muscle tissue was collected 1, 3, 7, and 28 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> Compared with uninjured rats, muscles in rats that sustained the contusion injury exhibited major necrosis, inflammation, and increased expression of CD 34, vWF, VEGF, and nestin. Compared with the sham treatment, icing attenuated and/or delayed neutrophil and macrophage infiltration; the expression of vWF, VEGF, and nestin; and the change in vessel volume within muscle in the first 7 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> (P < 0. 05). By contrast, icing did not influence capillary density in muscle 28 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> (P = 0. 59). The percentage of immature myofibers relative to the total number of fibers was greater in the icing group than in the sham group 28 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> (P = 0. 026), but myofiber cross-sectional area did not differ between groups after 7 d (P = 0. 35) and 28 d (P = 0. 30).

By 21 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> the number of fibroblasts in the granulation tissue of the moist wounds had fallen below that in the dry wounds, suggesting that progress from the proliferative into the remodelling phase of repair was more rapid in the moist wounds.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate injuries occurring to collegiate softball pitchers and associated influential factors. A web-based survey of 181 Division I (n = 45), II (n = 30), and III (n = 54) collegiate softball pitchers was conducted. The survey involved self-reported data from the previous year that addressed (a) demographic information, (b) pitching and game data, (c) training program information, and (<b>d)</b> <b>injury</b> reporting.

40|$|Mechanisms {{regulating}} how {{groups of}} cells are signaled to move collectively from their original site and invade surrounding matrix are poorly understood. Here we develop a clinically relevant ex vivo injury invasion model {{to determine whether}} cells involved in directing wound healing have invasive function and whether they can act as leader cells to direct movement of a wounded epithelium through a three-dimensional (3 D) extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Similar to cancer invasion, {{we found that the}} injured cells invade into the ECM as cords, involving heterotypical cell-cell interactions. Mesenchymal cells with properties of activated repair cells that typically locate to a wound edge are present in leader positions at the front of ZO- 1 -rich invading cords of cells, where they extend vimentin intermediate filament-enriched protrusions into the 3 D ECM. Injury-induced invasion depends on both vimentin cytoskeletal function and MMP- 2 / 9 matrix remodeling, because inhibiting either of these suppressed invasion. Potential push and pull forces at the tips of the invading cords were revealed by time-lapse imaging, which showed cells actively extending and retracting protrusions into the ECM.

40|$|While {{paralysis}} {{is widely}} appreciated to impact the quali ty-of-life after spinal cor <b>d</b> <b>injuries</b> (SCIs), neuropathic chronic pain may also occur in many cases. In this study, we investigated whether human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hUCMSCs) possess the therapeutic potential to reduce neuropathic pain following SCI in rats. Spinal cord hemitransection, {{which was used}} as a rat SCI pain model, induced tactile hypersensitivity in the hind paw and hyperexcitability of wild dynamic range neurons in response to natural cutaneous stimuli. Following hemitransection, we transplanted hUCMSCs into the spinal cord. Attenuation of neuronal hyperexcitability was observed in the hUCMSC - treated group compared with that observed in the vehicle-treated group. Immunohistochemistry showed that the transplanted hUCMSCs retained the expression of gammaamino butyric acid (GABA). The results suggest that transplanted hUCMSCs ameliorate GABAergic inhibition in the spinal cord. In summary, the production of GABA plays a critical role in the plasticity of neuropathic pain after implantation of hUCMSCs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms of {{oligodendrocyte}} death after {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) were evaluated by T 9 cord level hemisection in wild-type mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J and Bax/ mice), Wld s mice in which severed axons remain viable for 2 weeks, and mice deficient in the proapoptotic protein Bax (Bax/). In the lateral white-matter tracts, substantial oligodendrocyte death {{was evident in the}} ipsilateral white matter 3 – 7 mm rostral and caudal to the hemisection site 8 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> Ultrastructural analysis and expression of anti-activated caspase- 3 characterized the ongoing oligodendrocyte death at 8 d as primarily apoptotic. Oligodendrocytes were selectively preserved in Wld s mice compared with C 57 BL/ 6 J mice at 8 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> when severed axons remained viable as verified by antereograde labeling of the lateral vestibular spinal tract. However, 30 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> when the severed axons in Wld s animals were already degenerated, the oligodendro-cytes preserved at 8 d were lost, and numbers were then equivalent to control C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. In contrast, oligodendrocyte death was prevented at both time points in Bax/mice. When cultured oligodendrocytes were exposed to staurosporine or cyclosporin A, drugs known to stimulate apoptosis in oligodendrocytes, those from Bax/ mice but not from Bax/ or Bax/ mice were resistant to the apoptotic death. In contrast, the three groups were equally vulnerable to excitotoxic necrosis death induced by kainate. On the basis of these data, we hypothesize that the Wallerian degeneration of white matter axons that follows SCI removes axonal support and induces apoptotic death in oligodendrocytes by triggering Bax expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} moist and dry {{conditions}} {{on the process of}} angiogenesis during dermal repair was investigated. The moist conditions were achieved by covering excised wounds on porcine flank skin with the adhesive polyurethane dressing Opsite and dry conditions were achieved by exposure to air through dry gauze dressings. Angiogenesis was assessed during the period from 3 to 60 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> Quantitative studies, using computerized image analysis, were carried out on microfocal x-ray images of skin sections whose blood system had been perfused in vivo with a radio-opaque medium. The analytical technique yielded information with regard to vessel number per wound and also the area occupied by blood vessels per unit wound area. Three regions were assessed in each wound bed: upper zone, just {{below the surface of the}} wound; the lower zone, just above the base of the wound bed; and the middle zone, midway between the other two zones. The results showed that the wounds maintained in a moist environment revascularized at a greater rate than those maintained in a dry environment. This was apparent in all the zones of the wound bed examined. The development of new vessels occurred in a more orderly manner in the moist wounds. There was an early increase in vessel number rising to a peak around days 3 – 5, then a gradual decrease in number starting around day 7. In contrast, in the dry wounds the development of blood vessels was less rapid. Peak vessel number in the upper zone was significantly less than that achieved in the moist wounds, and was not reached until 7 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> The decrease in vessel number from the peak was less rapid in the dry wounds, suggesting that there was a delayed entry into the remodeling phase in comparison with the moist wounds. The results also showed that the total percentage area of the wound bed occupied by blood vessels was greater in the moist wounds than the dry wounds from 3 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> until day 7. This level of vascularization was maintained beyond 7 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> even when the vessel number in the moist wounds was significantly less than in the dry wounds, suggesting that the vessels in the moist wounds were larger and, presumably, more mature. In general, moist wounds showed a more rapid decline towards uninjured skin levels of vascularization than dry wounds...|$|R

40|$|The {{complement}} (C) system {{plays an}} important role in myelin breakdown during Wallerian degeneration (WD). The pathway and mechanism involved are, however, not clear. In a crush injury model of the sciatic nerve, we show that C 6, necessary for the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), is essential for rapid WD. At 3 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> pronounced WD occurred in wild-type animals, whereas the axons and myelin of C 6 - deficient animals appeared intact. Macrophage recruitment and activation was inhibited in C 6 -deficient rats. However, 7 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> the distal part of the C 6 -deficient nerves appeared degraded. As a consequence of a delayed WD, more myelin breakdown products were present than in wild-type nerves. Reconstitution of the C 6 -deficient animals with C 6 restored the wild-type phenotype. Treatment with rhC 1 INH (recombinant human complement 1 inhibitor) blocked deposition of activated C-cleaved products after injury. These experiments demonstrate that the classical pathway of the complement system is activated after acute nerve trauma and that the entire complement cascade, including MAC deposition, is essential for rapid WD and efficient clearance of myelin after acute peripheral nerve traum...|$|R

40|$|Objective The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the functional mode of mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) to exert the therapeutic effects on acute peritoneal fibrosis. Methods A total of 114 SD Rats were taken to make acute peritoneal adhesion models. Among which,six rats were injected with MSCs through the caudal vein(n= 3) or abdominal cavity(n= 3) 24 h after peritoneal scraping injury. The distribution of MSCs after injection was tracked by in vivo imaging,and the tracing effects of MSCs after two kinds of injections were compared,The remaining 108 rats were divided randomly into the serum-free conditioned medium(CM) treatment,MSCs treatment,and control groups(n= 36,respectively). The CM or MSCs(5 × 106),or PBS in 1 ml volume was injected into rats via the tail vein 24 h after peritoneal scraping. The peritoneal adhesion in each group was then evaluated. Peritoneal inflammation,fibrosis,and the repair of mesothelial cells were evaluated by Masson staining and immunofluorescence. Results The in vivo imaging demonstrated that the MSCs injected through the caudal vein mainly accumulated in the lungs,whereas the MSCs injected intraperitoneally mainly accumulated in the liver. However,no apparent MSCs were observed in the injured peritoneum. Compared with the control group,the macroscopic scoring of peritoneal adhesion can be improved in CM-treated rats(P < 0. 05),which was {{similar to that of the}} MSCs-treated rats. The Masson staining showed that the CM and MSCs can reduce the infiltration of inflammatory cells(2 <b>d</b> after <b>injuries)</b> and the numbers of collagen fibers(4 d, 6 d,and 14 <b>d</b> after <b>injuries)</b> in the same degree. The immunofluorescence analysis showed that CM can increase the numbers of mesothelial cells in 2 d, 4 d,and 6 d after peritoneal injuries,and reduce the numbers of the fibroblasts and the expression levels of transforming growth factor(TGF) -β 1 in 4 d, 6 d,and 14 <b>d</b> after <b>injuries.</b> Conclusion The action of MSCs to lighten acute peritoneal fibrosis may be related to the excretion of soluble factors rather than the fix planting of cells. CM may ameliorate acute peritoneal fibrosis by reducing inflammation,as well as by stimulating the repair of mesothelial cells...|$|R

40|$|Lung {{injury is}} {{associated}} with increased concentrations of hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA). HA modifies cell behavior through interaction with cell-associated receptors such as receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM, CD 168). Using a function blocking anti-RHAMM antibody (R 36), we investigated the expression and role of RHAMM in the inflammatory response to intratracheal bleomycin in rats. Immunostaining showed increased expression of RHAMM in macrophages 4 – 7 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> Surface biotin labeling of cells isolated by lavage confirmed increased surface expression of a 70 -kD RHAMM after lung injury, and in situ hybridization demonstrated increased RHAMM mRNA in macrophages responding to injury. Time-lapse cinemicrography demonstrated a 5 -fold increase in motility of alveolar macrophages from bleomycin-treated animals that was completely blocked by R 36 in vitro. Further, HA-stimulated macrophage chemotaxis was also inhibited by R 36. Daily administration of R 36 to injured animals resulted in a 40 % decrease in macrophage accumulation 7 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> Further, H&E staining of tissue sections showed that bleomycin-mediated changes in lung architecture were improved with R 36 treatment. Taken together with previous results showing the inhibitory effects of HA-binding peptide on inflammation and fibrosis, we conclude that the interaction of RHAMM with HA is {{a critical component of}} the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung after injury...|$|R

Controls were carotid arteries from sham operated rats. In the controls, the immunoreactivity to nitric oxide synthase-III and endothelin- 1 was localised in different proportions in vascular endothelial cells (36 · 9 %± 4 · 3 and 7 · 6 %± 2 · 7, respectively); immunoreactivity was confined to the cytoplasm and the membranes of intracellular organelles and structures. In contrast, staining with lectin was localised on the luminal surface of all endothelial cells. 1 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> platelets were adherent to the endothelium-denuded intima. Some of the platelets displayed immunoreactivity to nitric oxide synthase-III and endothelin- 1 and were stained with lectin. 28 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> a neointimal thickening of substantial size was present. Subpopulations of the regrown endothelial cells covering the luminal surface of the neointima showed positive immunoreactivity to nitric oxide synthase-III and endothelin- 1 {{but there was a}} significant decrease in the proportion of nitric oxide synthase-III-containing endothelial cells (17 · 2 %± 1 · 9; P < 0 · 001) and {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of endothelin- 1 -containing endothelial cells (36 · 9 %± 4 · 7; P < 0 · 001) compared with the controls. Staining with lectin was associated with the cell membrane of all endothelial cells and in addition with cells located ‘deeper’ in the neointima which showed lectin-positive plasmalemma, Golgi complex and multivesicular bodies/lysosomes. In conclusion, regenerated endothelial cells of the neointima showed reduced population (2 –fold) of nitric oxide synthase-III- and increased population (5 –fold) endothelin- 1 -positive cells. The subendothelial location of some lectin-stained cells after balloon catheter injury indicates the heterogeneity of the neointima and suggests that some of these cells are involved in early angiogenesis. 24 h and 28 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> some platelets showed positive immunoreactivity for nitric oxide synthase-III and endothelin- 1...|$|R

However, recent interest {{has focused on the}} brain-specific MT-III isoform, which has neurite-inhibitory properties. To investigate the effect of another MT isoform, human MT-IIA, on neurite growth, we used rat cortical neuron cultures. MT-IIA promoted {{a significant increase in the}} rate of initial neurite elongation of individually plated neurons. We also investigated the effect of MT-IIA on the neuronal response to axonal transection in vitro. MT-IIA promoted reactive axonal growth after injury, and, by 18 hr after transection, MT-IIA had promoted axonal growth across the injury tract. Exogenous application of MT-IIA after cortical brain injury promoted wound healing, as observed by a significant decrease in cellular degradation at 4 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> Furthermore, MT-IIA-treated rats exhibited numerous SMI- 312 -immunoreactive axonal processes within the injury tract.

Methods: Acute and follow-up SPECT and MRI scans from 61 patients who were admitted to a regional neurosurgical unit were examined. Patients had acute MRI and SPECT at 2 – 18 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> and on follow-up between 130 and 366 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> Thirty-two scans from non–head-injured patients were used as a SPECT control group. The SPECT images were first aligned to the Talairach–Tournoux atlas and then analyzed statistically with SPM. Results: SPECT detected more extensive abnormality than MRI in acute and follow-up stages. This effect was more pronounced on follow-up of patients with diffuse injury. Examination of a focal injury group indicated the involvement of frontal and temporal lobes and the anterior cingulate. Blood flow abnormalities persist, to a lesser extent, on follow-up scans. The diffuse group displayed low blood flow in the frontal and temporal lobes, including cingulate involvement, which persists at follow-up with additional involvement of the thalamus. Conclusion: SPM has a role in SPECT image interpretation because it allows better visualization than other methods of quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of abnormalities in focal and diffuse head injury.

Upregulation of MMPs activity {{is known to}} be required for the inflammatory cell infiltration after spinal cord injury (SCI) and most likely contributes to early blood spinal barrier disruption and inflammation, thereby leading to the impairment of functional recovery. Here, we examined the effect of ethanol extract of Bupleurum falcatum (BF) on functional recovery by inhibiting MMP- 2 and - 9 activation and inflammation after SCI. Rats received a moderate, weight-drop contusion injury to spinal cord were administered orally with BF at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 14 d and functional recovery was measured by Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor open field behavioral rating test, inclined plane test and foot print analysis. To examine the neuroprotective effect of BF, TUNEL staining and counting were also performed. In addition, the expression and/or activation of MMP- 2, MMP- 9 and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL- 1 β, COX- 2, and iNOS were examined by RT-PCR and gelatin zymography using spinal cord tissue from 1 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> Our data showed that BF significantly inhibited the expression and activation of both MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 after SCI.

While this {{central role of}} the macrophage has been well studied, the specific stimuli that recruit macrophages into sites of injury are not well understood. This study examines the role of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP- 1 alpha), a C-C chemokine with monocyte chemoattractant capability, in excisional wound repair. Both MIP- 1 alpha mRNA and protein were detectable in murine wounds from 12 h through 5 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> MIP- 1 alpha protein levels peaked 3 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> coinciding with maximum macrophage infiltration. The contribution of MIP- 1 alpha to monocyte recruitment into wounds was assessed by treating mice with neutralizing anti-MIP- 1 alpha antiserum before injury. Wounds of mice treated with anti-MIP- 1 alpha antiserum had significantly fewer macrophages than control (41 % decrease, P < 0. 01). This decrease in wound macrophages was paralleled by decreased angiogenic activity and collagen synthesis. When tested in the corneal micropocket assay, wound homogenates from mice treated with anti-MIP- 1 alpha contained significantly less angiogenic activity than control wound homogenates (27 % positive for angiogenic activity versus 91 % positive in the control group, P < 0. 01). Collagen production was also significantly reduced in the wounds from anti-MIP- 1 alpha treated animals (29 % decrease, P < 0. 05).

Rat carotid arteries were subjected to brief crushing and full thickness incision and were analysed up to 21 d thereafter. Adhesion and activation of platelets occurred 3 h after surgery. A neointima had formed 7 d after surgery, where immature cells entered from the lumen and gave rise to cells rich in organelles of the secretory pathway and endowed with bundles of phalloidin-binding microfilaments.

40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) is a mitogen and {{chemoattractant}} for vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) in vitro, but its activities in vivo remain largely undefined. We infused recombinant PDGF-BB (0. 01 - 0. 30 mg/kg per d i. v.) into rats subjected to carotid injury. PDGF-BB produced a small increase (two- to threefold) in medial SMC proliferation. More importantly, PDGF-BB greatly increased (20 -fold) the intimal thickening and {{the migration of}} SMC from the media to the intima during the first 7 <b>d</b> after <b>injury.</b> These data provide support for the hypothesis that PDGF, and perhaps other platelet factors, might {{play an important role}} in the movement of mesenchymal cells into zones of injury undergoing repair...|$|R
40|$|Detrended {{fluctuation}} analysis (DFA) provides {{valuable information}} regarding both train <b>ing</b> and <b>injury</b> {{when applied to}} running time series. However, there is limited information when applied to recreational runners, or within a real-time environment. Firstly, DFA {{was applied to the}} stride time series of select training runs and competitive runs for recreational runners completing a half marathon and full marathon. Results indicate recreational runners maintain similar stride time dynamics in a half marathon, compared to training, however, stride time variability becomes increasingly deterministic during a marathon, compared to training. Secondly, we explore the implementation of DFA in a real-time system and provide evidence to support the use of DFA in running feedback. PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Total {{upper and}} lower eyelid defect is usually {{secondary}} to the excision of malignant or benign tumours, trauma and burns. Reconstruction {{of this type of}} defect is important not only for the cosmetic result, but also for coverage of the cornea an <b>d</b> prevent <b>injury</b> to eyeball. Pyogenic granuloma is usually preceded by the history of trauma to the eyelid. But reports of giant pyogenic granuloma of both {{upper and lower}} eyelid are rare. We present here a ten year old boy diagnosed primary immune deficient with a large fungating mass over both upper and lower eyelid, which was excised and total upper and lower eyelid defect was reconstructed with paramedian forehead flap.

40|$|PURPOSE:: Creatine (Cr) supplementation {{may improve}} muscle {{functional}} capacity {{in patients with}} neuromuscular diseases, disuse atrophy, or muscular dystrophies. Activation of myogenic satellite cells {{has been reported to}} be enhanced by Cr both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we hypothesized that Cr supplementation may improve the early steps of regeneration after muscle injury and may accelerate the recovery of both muscle mass and phenotype. METHODS:: Degeneration of left soleus muscle was induced by notexin injection in rats supplemented or not with Cr. The mass of regenerated muscles was compared with contralateral intact muscles at days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 after injury. We also studied protein levels of the proliferator cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a marker of cell proliferation, expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MRF) as a marker of differentiation, and the myosin heavy chain (MHC) profile and activities of citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes as markers of muscle phenotype maturation. RESULTS:: Cr supplementation accelerated the recovery of muscle Cr content during the regeneration phase. Although there were no other differences between Cr-treated and nontreated rats, we observed that 1) regenerated muscle mass remained lower than that in intact muscle mass 42 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> 2) PCNA and MRF expression strongly increased in regenerated muscles, 3) the MHC profile of regenerated muscles was recovered 28 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> and 4) CS activity was fully recovered from day 14, whereas the specific H isozyme of lactate dehydrogenase activity remained lower than that in intact muscles until 42 d. CONCLUSIONS:: In contrast with results from in vitro studies, Cr supplementation had no effects in vivo on the time course of recovery of rat skeletal muscle mass and phenotype after notexin-induced injury...|$|R
40|$|Because injury of the CNS causes an astrogliosis, {{characterized}} by cell swelling and proliferation, {{similar to the}} effects of the serine protease thrombin on astrocytes, we hypothesized that a high level of thrombin at the site of injury might initially induce an astrocyte reaction and later increase the expression of its specific inhibitor, thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin could then stabilize the astroglial scar through its adhesive properties. Here, we studied the in vivo injury response of astrocytes in the anterior medullary velum of adult rat by immunostaining and in situ hybridization of thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin was poorly expressed on astrocytes in normal tissue, increased up to 2 <b>d</b> after <b>injury,</b> and was still highly expressed at 6 d. To check that thrombin had a direct effect on thrombomodulin expression by astrocytes, we used brain cortical astrocyt...|$|R
40|$|Demyelination {{contributes}} to {{loss of function}} after spinal cord injury, and thus a potential therapeutic strategy involves replacing myelin- forming cells. Here, we show that transplantation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) - derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into adult rat spinal cord injuries enhances remyelination and promotes improvement of motor function. OPCs were injected 7 d or 10 months after injury. In both cases, transplanted cells survived, redistributed over short distances, and differentiated into oligodendrocytes. Animals that received OPCs 7 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> exhibited enhanced remyelination and substantially improved locomotor ability. In contrast, when OPCs were transplanted 10 months after injury, there was no enhanced remyelination or locomotor recovery. These studies document the feasibility of predifferentiating hESCs into functional OPCs and demonstrate their therapeutic potential at early time points after spinal cord injury...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{investigated}} whether reactive astrocytes produce neuregulins (glial growth factor 2 /heregulin/acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity or neu differentiation factor) and its putative receptors, ErbB 2 and ErbB 3 tyrosine kinases, in the injured CNS in vivo. Significant immunoreactivities with antineuregulin, anti-ErbB 2, and anti-ErbB 3 antibodies were detected on astrocytes at the injured site 4 <b>d</b> after <b>injury</b> to the adult rat cerebral cortex. To elucidate the mechanisms for the upregulation of neuregulin expression in astrocytes, primary cultured astrocytes {{were treated with}} certain reagents, including forskolin, that are known to elevate the intracellular level of cAMP and induce marked morphological changes in astrocytes. Western blot analysis showed that {{the expression of a}} 52 kDa membrane-spanning form of a neuregulin protein was enhanced in cultured astrocytes after administration of forskolin...|$|R
