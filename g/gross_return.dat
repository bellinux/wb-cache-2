To save themselves the administrative burden of collecting all the rents within the manor, they farmed the manor to Gilbert Denys, {{that is to say}} gave him the right to keep all the rents he could collect in exchange for an annual one-off payment. This sum was set at £40, which must be assumed to represent about 70% of the total rents due, therefore estimated at £57. [...] Thus the See saved itself [...] more than £17 per annum in its admin. expenses by farming it to Denys, who for his outlay of £40 may have collected £51 in rents, i.e. 90%, depending on how forceful he was inclined to be. [...] That would represent a <b>gross</b> <b>return</b> to him of 28%.

50|$|There {{are three}} broad {{investment}} categories for mutual funds (equity, bond, and money market - in declining order of historical returns).

In a money market fund where the historical <b>gross</b> <b>return</b> might be 5%, a 1% expense ratio will consume approximately 20% of the investor's historical total return.

50|$|Another {{distinction}} is between net and <b>gross</b> <b>return.</b> The 'pure' net {{return to the}} investor is the return net of all fees, expenses, and taxes, whereas the 'pure' <b>gross</b> <b>return</b> is the return before all fees, expenses, and taxes. Various variations between these two extremes exist. Which return one looks at depends on what one is trying to measure. For example, if one wishes to measure the ability of an investment manager to add value, then the return net of transaction expenses, but gross of all other fees, expenses, and taxes is an appropriate measure to look at since fees, expenses, and taxes other than transaction expenses are often outside {{the control of the}} investment manager.|$|E

40|$|A study among 26 Dutch {{chrysanthemum}} firms {{was performed}} between November 1993 and November 1994 to (a) assess the relative economic performance of each firm and (b) compare three strategies used by growers in getting high economic results. These strategies, {{related to the}} theory of Porter (1985), are (1) a cost advantage strategy, (2) a quality strategy, and (3) a market strategy. Although cost information was incomplete, a firm-specific measure could be defined and calculated for the economic performance of each firm. This economic performance was defined as the quotient of actual and normative <b>gross</b> <b>returns.</b> Normative <b>gross</b> <b>returns</b> are estimated by means of loglinear regression with firm structural variables as independents. Positive deviations from the normative level mean that these growers have followed a successful strategy towards quantity, quality, and/or market. Variations between <b>gross</b> <b>returns</b> per m 2 are very large. The total range is from 26 percent below average to 39 percent above average. Part of this variation can be attributed to differences in the firm's technology. However, the resulting range in economic performance remains considerable: minus 16 percent to plus 17 percent.
