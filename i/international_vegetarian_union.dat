In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the 20th century {{as a result of}} nutritional, ethical, and more recently, environmental and economic concerns. Henry Stephens Salt (1851-1939) and George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) were famous vegetarian activists.|$|E

Although {{this is not}} totally true, British journalist J.W. Robertson Scott reported in the 1920s that the society was 90% vegetarian. 50–60% of the population ate fish only on festive occasions, probably more because of poverty than for any other reason.|$|E

2500|$|Members of the English Vegetarian Society who {{avoided the}} use of eggs and animal milk in the 19th and early 20th century were known as strict vegetarians. The <b>International</b> <b>Vegetarian</b> <b>Union</b> cites an article informing readers of {{alternatives}} to shoe leather in the Vegetarian Society's magazine in 1851 {{as evidence of the}} existence of a group that sought to avoid animal products entirely. There was increasing unease within the Society {{from the start of the}} 20th century onwards with regards to egg and milk consumption, and in 1923 its magazine wrote that the [...] "ideal position for vegetarians is [...] abstinence from animal products." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire in late antiquity, vegetarianism {{practically}} {{disappeared from}} Europe, {{as it did}} on other continents, except India. Several orders of monks in medieval Europe restricted or banned the consumption of meat for ascetic reasons, {{but none of them}} eschewed fish. (The medieval definition of [...] "fish" [...] included such animals as seals, porpoises, dolphins, barnacle geese, puffins, and beavers.) It re-emerged during the Renaissance, becoming more widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1847, the first Vegetarian Society was founded in the United Kingdom; Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed. In 1886, the vegetarian colony Nueva Germania was founded in Paraguay, though its vegetarian aspect would prove short-lived. The <b>International</b> <b>Vegetarian</b> <b>Union,</b> an association of the national societies, was founded in 1908. In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the twentieth century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and more recently, environmental and economic concerns.|$|E
2500|$|Organizations that {{advocate}} vegan or vegetarian diets {{for people}} have split opinions regarding vegetarian or vegan cat food. The <b>International</b> <b>Vegetarian</b> <b>Union,</b> the Vegan Society and PETA {{are some of}} the organizations that support a vegan or vegetarian diet for cats. On the other hand, the Vegetarian Society suggests people [...] "consider carefully" [...] and that many cats will not adjust to a vegetarian diet. [...] They provide a list of necessary nutrients that will need to be supplemented with a recommendation to consult a veterinarian or animal nutritionist {{for those who want to}} try. [...] The Animal Protection Institute also does not recommend a vegetarian diet for cats and cautions that dietary deficiencies may take months or years to develop and may be untreatable. [...] They do not recommend relying on supplements because they may not contain necessary co-factors and enzymes and have not been studied for long term implications. The animal welfare organization American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, although suggesting a supplemented vegetarian diet for dogs, recommends against a vegetarian and vegan diets for cats. The Association of Veterinarians for Animal Rights (now Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association) accepts that it is possible for a plant-based diet to be nutritionally adequate but stated in August 2006 that such diets [...] "cannot at this time be reliably assured". This position was based on a 2004 study demonstrating that of two commercially available vegetarian cat diets tested against the AAFCO standard, both were nutritionally deficient. [...] The formulation error in one of these diets was promptly identified and corrected. Nevertheless, it remains likely that formulation errors will result in nutritional deficiencies in a wide range of commercially available diets from time to time, whether meat-based, vegetarian or vegan. Hence, regular (at least, annual) veterinary checkups of all companion animals is recommended, and brands may be occasionally varied.|$|E
