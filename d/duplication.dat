5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by <b>duplication</b> and fission and fusion. Permutation by <b>duplication</b> occurs when a gene undergoes <b>duplication</b> to form a tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} model {{proposed for}} the evolution of circular permutations is the permutation by <b>duplication</b> mechanism. In this model, a precursor gene first undergoes a <b>duplication</b> and fusion to form a large tandem repeat. Next, start and stop codons are introduced at corresponding locations in the duplicated gene, removing redundant sections of the protein.|$|E

The simplest means to identify <b>duplications</b> in genomic resequencing data is through the use of paired-end sequencing reads.

5|$|The {{most common}} source of new genes in {{eukaryotic}} lineages is gene <b>duplication,</b> which creates copy number variation {{of an existing}} gene in the genome. The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family. Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent {{a major source of}} evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, gene <b>duplication</b> may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene, or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes.|$|E

US 202 passes through the Wilmington area in northern New Castle County, with DE 202 heading south from an interchange with I-95 and US 202 along Concord Avenue into the city of Wilmington.

Ten are X-chromosome <b>duplications,</b> of which six are half-translocations on three autosomomal linkage groups and four are free fragments. Five of the half-translocations are homozygous fertile and two are recognizable cytologically as chromosome satellites, both of which show some mitotic instability. The free-X <b>duplications</b> show varying tendencies for loss. Three appear not to overlap in extent previously identified free-X <b>duplications.</b> The fourth carries genes from linkage group V, as well as X.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{to detect and}} measure the frequency of spontaneous tandem genetic <b>duplications</b> located throughout the Salmonella genome. The method {{is based on the}} ability of duplication-containing strains to inherit two selectable alleles of a single gene during generalized transductional crosses. One allele of the gene carries an insertion of the translocatable tetracycline-resistance element Tn 10; the other allele is a wild-type copy of that gene. Using this technique, we have measured the frequency of tandem <b>duplications</b> at 38 chromosomal sites and the amount of material included in 199 independent <b>duplications.</b> These results suggest that, in one region of the chromosome, tandem <b>duplications</b> are particularly frequent events. Such <b>duplications</b> have end points within rRNA (rrn) cistrons and probably arise by unequal cross-over between these dispersed repeated sequences. Spontaneously <b>duplications</b> of this type are harbored by as much as 3 % of the bacterial population. Preliminary evidence suggests that such <b>duplications</b> may play a significant regulatory role under conditions of rapid growth.

30|$|Interestingly, the {{detection}} rate of 16 p 13.11 <b>duplications</b> was relatively high {{in this study}} comparing to other CNV studies of ASD. Although CNV data in population-matched controls was not available in the study, the CNV map {{of the human genome}} showed that 16 p 13.11 <b>duplications</b> were not particularly prevalent in Asian comparing to the other ethnic group [23]. Furthermore, the high proportion of <b>duplications</b> detected might be related the clinical characteristics of the adult cohort which they had severe impairment related to autistic symptoms but normal intelligence. It has been reported that <b>duplications</b> correlated to autism severity while deletions had impact on nonverbal IQ [46]. This might explain why of <b>duplications</b> were dominated in the adult cohort of this study. In addition, due to the uncertainty of the effect of 16 p 13.11 <b>duplications,</b> the possibility of underreporting of this CNV in other autism studies could not be excluded.|$|R

5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a <b>duplication</b> event within the genome. For gene <b>duplication</b> events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E
40|$|About 5 % of {{the human}} genome {{consists}} of segmental <b>duplications</b> or low-copy repeats, which are large, highly homologous (> 95 %) fragments of sequence. It has been estimated that these segmental <b>duplications</b> emerged during the past ∼ 35 million years (Myr) of human evolution and that they correlate with chromosomal rearrangements. Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a segmental aneusomy syndrome that {{is the result of a}} frequent de novo deletion at 7 q 11. 23, mediated by large (∼ 400 -kb) region-specific complex segmental <b>duplications</b> composed of different blocks. We have precisely defined the structure of the segmental <b>duplications</b> on human 7 q 11. 23 and characterized the copy number and structure of the orthologous regions in other primates (macaque, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee). Our data indicate a recent origin and rapid evolution of the 7 q 11. 23 segmental <b>duplications,</b> starting before the diversification of hominoids (∼ 12 - 16 million years ago [Mya]), with species-specific <b>duplications</b> and intrachromosomal rearrangements that lead to significant differences among those genomes. Alu sequences are located at most edges of the large hominoid-specific segmental <b>duplications,</b> suggesting that they might have facilitated evolutionary rearrangements. We propose a mechanistic model based on Alu-mediated duplicated transposition along with nonallelic homologous recombination for the generation and local expansion of the segmental <b>duplications.</b> The extraordinary rate of evolutionary turnover of this region, rich in segmental <b>duplications,</b> results in important genomic variation among hominoid species, which could be of functional relevance and predispose to disease...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} constructions that correct <b>duplications</b> of {{multiple}} consecutive symbols. These errors {{are known as}} tandem <b>duplications,</b> where a sequence of symbols is repeated; respectively as palindromic <b>duplications,</b> where a sequence is repeated in reversed order. We compare the redundancies of these constructions with code size upper bounds that are obtained from sphere packing arguments. Proving that an upper bound on the code cardinality for tandem deletions is also an upper bound for inserting tandem <b>duplications,</b> we derive the bounds based on this special tandem deletion error as this results in tighter bounds. Our upper bounds on the cardinality directly imply lower bounds on the redundancy which we compare with the redundancy {{of the best known}} construction correcting arbitrary burst insertions. Our results indicate that the correction of palindromic <b>duplications</b> requires more redundancy than the correction of tandem <b>duplications</b> and both significantly less than arbitrary burst insertions.

5|$|The primary {{mechanism}} for the diversification of venom {{is thought to be}} the <b>duplication</b> of gene coding for other tissues, followed by their expression in the venom glands. The proteins then evolved into various venom proteins through natural selection. This process, known as the birth-and-death model, is responsible for several of the protein recruitment events in snake venom. These duplications occurred in a variety of tissue types with a number of ancestral functions. Notable examples include 3FTx, ancestrally a neurotransmitter found in the brain, which has adapted into a neurotoxin that binds and blocks acetylcholine receptors. Another example is phospholipase A2 (PLA2) type IIA, ancestrally involved with inflammatory processes in normal tissue, which has evolved into venom capable of triggering lipase activity and tissue destruction. The change in function of PLA2, in particular, has been well documented; there is evidence of several separate gene <b>duplication</b> events, often associated with the origin of new snake species. Non-allelic homologous recombination (or recombination between DNA sequences that are similar, but not alleles) has been proposed as the mechanism of <b>duplication</b> of PLA2 genes in rattlesnakes, as an explanation for its rapid evolution. These venom proteins have also occasionally been recruited back into tissue genes. Protein recruitment events have occurred at different points in the evolutionary history of snakes. For example, the 3FTX protein family is absent in the viperid lineage, suggesting that it was recruited into snake venom after the viperid snakes branched off from the remaining colubroidae.|$|E

We investigated large size variation in mtDNA of the brook stickleback fish, Culaea inconstans, and characterized four large (2. 7 - 5. 8 kb) tandem <b>duplications.</b> <b>Duplications</b> differ in size, frequency of occurrence, and degree of associated heteroplasmy, but each includes the control region and one or more adjacent genes. <b>Duplications</b> are correlated with two mtDNA lineages sampled from 31 populations. L(1) <b>duplications</b> (3. 2 - 4. 8 kb) were present in all lineage I individuals (n = 121, 19 populations); 53 fish were heteroplasmic due to variation in the copy number of a tandemly repeated 270 -bp sequence within the duplicated region. In contrast, <b>duplications</b> L(2), L(3), and L(4) (2. 7 - 5. 8 kb) occurred in only 117 of 174 lineage II fish, in eight of 14 populations. Nine fish with L(3) or L(4) <b>duplications</b> were heteroplasmic, possessing some mtDNAs that lacked <b>duplications</b> (normal-length mtDNAs). Heteroplasmy in L(2) was associated with a small variable region near the ND 5 gene.

40|$|Gene <b>duplications</b> play a {{key role}} in the {{emergence}} of novel traits and in adaptation. But despite their centrality to evolutionary processes, it is still largely unknown how new gene duplicates are initially fixed within populations and later maintained in genomes. Long-standing debates on the evolution of gene <b>duplications</b> could be settled by determining the relative importance of genetic drift vs. positive selection in the fixation of new gene duplicates. Using the Drosophila Global Diversity Lines (GDL), we have combined genome-wide SNP polymorphism data with a novel set of copy number variant calls and gene expression profiles to characterize the polymorphic phase of new genes. We found that approximately half of the roughly 500 new complete gene <b>duplications</b> segregating in the GDL lead to significant increases in the expression levels of the duplicated genes and that these <b>duplications</b> are more likely to be found at lower frequencies, suggesting a negative impact on fitness. However, we also found that six of the nine gene <b>duplications</b> that are fixed or close to fixation in at least one of the five populations in our study show signs of being under positive selection, and that these <b>duplications</b> are likely beneficial because of dosage effects, with a possible role for additional mutations in two <b>duplications.</b> Our work suggests that in Drosophila, theoretical models that posit that gene <b>duplications</b> are immediately beneficial and fixed by positive selection are most relevant to explain the long-term evolution of gene <b>duplications</b> in this species.

40|$|Tandem direct <b>duplications</b> are {{a common}} feature of the genomes of eukaryotes ranging from yeast to human, where they {{comprise}} a significant fraction of copy number variations. The prevailing model {{for the formation of}} tandem direct <b>duplications</b> is non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Here we report the isolation of a series of <b>duplications</b> and reciprocal deletions isolated de novo from a maize allele containing two Class II Ac/Ds transposons. The duplication/deletion structures suggest that they were generated by alternative transposition reactions involving the termini of two nearby transposable elements. The deletion/duplication breakpoint junctions contain 8 bp target site <b>duplications</b> characteristic of Ac/Ds transposition events, confirming their formation directly by an alternative transposition mechanism. Tandem direct <b>duplications</b> and reciprocal deletions were generated at a relatively high frequency (, 0. 5 to 1 %) in the materials examined here in which transposons are positioned nearby each other in appropriate orientation; frequencies would likely be much lower in other genotypes. To test whether this mechanism may have contributed to maize genome evolution, we analyzed sequences flanking Ac/Ds and other hAT family transposons and identified three small tandem direct <b>duplications</b> with the structural features predicted by the alternative transposition mechanism.
