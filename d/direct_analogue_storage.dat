Molecular docking was performed using Glide {{to study the}} binding mode of these <b>direct</b> <b>analogues</b> of flurbriprofen. The docking analysis of highest active molecule 3 g (Glide XP score- 8. 39) shows significant interaction with active site amino acid residues.

A series of <b>direct</b> <b>analogues</b> of flurbriprofen [4 ’-methylbiphenyl- 2 -(substituted phenyl) carboxamide derivatives] have been reported as novel anti-inflammatory agent. In order to gain further insights into the structural requirements of novel this series of <b>direct</b> <b>analogues</b> of flurbriprofen, a three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3 D-QSAR) was performed using Genetic Function Approximation (GFA). The QSAR models revealed the importance of thermodynamic, structural and electronic parameters. The internal predictivity (r 2) and external predictivity (r 2 pred) of final QSAR model was 0. 66 and 0. 60 respectively. Analysis of results from the present QSAR study indicates that thermodynamic, structural and electronic parameters strongly govern the antiinflammatory which can give further guidance for design of potent anti-inflammatory agents...|$|R
