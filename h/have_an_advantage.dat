5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.|$|E

After defeating both foxes, Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal, and tells Sasha that he came to thank her for the pigeon, and that she is unlike any housecat he has ever known.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{generally}} accepted {{rule of thumb}} about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others.

25|$|One of Petrosian's {{most famous}} {{examples}} of the positional exchange sacrifice is from his game against Samuel Reshevsky in Zurich 1953. Reshevsky, playing white, appears to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> due to his strong pawn center, which may become mobile after Bf3 and d4–d5. Petrosian realized {{he was in a}} difficult position because of the passive placement of his pieces, relegated to defensive roles. He further understood that White might also advance on the kingside with h2–h4–h5, provoking weaknesses that would {{make it more difficult to}} defend later on. Faced with these threats, Petrosian devised a plan to maneuver his knight to the square d5, where it would be prominently placed in the center, and blockade the advance of White's pawns.|$|E

If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E
