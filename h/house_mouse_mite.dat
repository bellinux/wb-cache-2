50|$|After a 1946 {{outbreak}} of a rickettsial-type disease at {{an apartment complex}} in Kew Gardens, Queens, an investigation was performed to identify {{the source of the}} infections. The incinerators in the buildings were not operated on a daily basis, leading to a buildup in food waste and attracting mice that were rampant throughout the building. The Mus musculus mice were found to be carrying mites, identified as the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>mite,</b> Allodermanyssus sanguineus. Self-trained entomologist Charles Pomerantz asked permission to search the site and found the mites at various sites throughout the building, with blood-engorged mites found near chutes leading to the incinerator. The mites were collected and brought to a laboratory of the United States Public Health Service, which found in the mites an organism that had also been isolated from the mice, and from the blood of individuals infected with the disease.|$|E
40|$|Scientific note. A {{survey of}} ectoparasites {{occurring}} on rats {{was carried out}} from August 2006 through February 2007 on two properties {{on the island of}} Oahu, Hawaii. From the property in Liliha, a total of 167 Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, were examined. Two species of fleas and four species of mites were collected: oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, tropical rat mite, Ornithonyssus bacoti, domestic rat mite, Laelaps nuttalli, spiny rat mite, Laelaps echidninus, and <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>mite,</b> Allodermanyssus sanguineus. From the property in Aiea, a total of 80 black rats, Rattus rattus, were examined. One species of flea, one species of louse, and two species of mites were collected: cat flea, C. felis, sucking louse, Polyplax spinulosa, tropical rat mite, O. bacoti, and <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>mite,</b> A. sanguineus. This is the first record of the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>mite,</b> A. sanguineus, from Hawaii. Ornithonyssus bacoti and A. sanguineus were the predominant species of mites that infested both rodent species. The occurrence of other ectoparasites on the rats caught from the two sites may be affected by different rodent host and other environmental factors...|$|E
40|$|Subject matter experts {{systematically}} reviewed evidenceon {{the effectiveness}} of housing interventions thataffect health outcomes, primarily asthma, associated with exposure to moisture, mold, and allergens. Three of the 11 interventions reviewed had sufficient evidence for implementation: multifaceted, in-home, tailored interventions for reducing asthma morbidity; integrated pest management to reduce cockroach allergen; and combined elimination of moisture intrusion and leaks and removal of moldy items to reduce mold and respiratory symptoms. Four interventions needed more field evaluation, 1 needed formative research, and 3 either had no evidence of effectiveness or were ineffective. The 3 interventions with sufficient evidence all applied multiple, integrated strategies. This evidence review shows that selected interventions that improve housing conditions will reduce morbidity from asthma and respiratory allergies.

40|$|Stowaway {{transport}} {{rates were}} obtained from behavioral observations of 14 <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> (Mus domesticus) and 14 deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus) during commercial transport. One <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> escaped during unloading and flaking of 2, 500 kg 2 -year old oat hay. Three <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> and two deermice were hand-caught on trucks during unloading of 51, 110 kg transported barley straw and grass hay. One <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> was hand-caught after being buried alive in grain. Two <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> escaped during unloading of a semitruck holding dog food. <b>House</b> <b>mice</b> (one live, six recently-dead) and deermice (two recently-dead) were taken from a feedmill screen over which had passed 940, 313 kg grain.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>House</b> <b>mice</b> (Mus musculus) are commensals {{of humans}} and {{therefore}} their phylogeography can reflect human colonization and settlement patterns. Previous studies have linked the distribution of <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> mitochondrial (mt) DNA clades to areas formerly occupied by the Norwegian Vikings in Norway and the British Isles. Norwegian Viking activity also extended further westwards in the North Atlantic with the settlement of Iceland, short-lived colonies in Greenland and a fleeting colony in Newfoundland in 1000 AD. Here we investigate whether <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> mtDNA sequences reflect human history in these other regions as well. Results <b>House</b> <b>mice</b> samples from Iceland, whether from archaeological Viking Age material or from modern-day specimens, had an identical mtDNA haplotype to the clade previously linked with Norwegian Vikings. From mtDNA and microsatellite data, the modern-day Icelandic mice also share the low genetic diversity shown by their human hosts on Iceland. Viking Age mice from Greenland had an mtDNA haplotype deriving from the Icelandic haplotype, but the modern-day Greenlandic mice belong to an entirely different mtDNA clade. We found no genetic association between modern Newfoundland mice and the Icelandic/ancient Greenlandic mice (no ancient Newfoundland mice were available). The modern day Icelandic and Newfoundland mice belong to the subspecies M. m. domesticus, the Greenlandic mice to M. m. musculus. Conclusions In the North Atlantic region, human settlement history over a thousand years is reflected remarkably by the mtDNA phylogeny of <b>house</b> <b>mice.</b> In Iceland, the mtDNA data show the arrival and continuity of the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> population to the present day, while in Greenland the data suggest the arrival, subsequent extinction and recolonization of <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> - in both places mirroring {{the history of the}} European human host populations. If <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> arrived in Newfoundland with the Viking settlers at all, then, like the humans, their presence was also fleeting and left no genetic trace. The continuity of mtDNA haplotype in Iceland over 1000 years illustrates that mtDNA can retain the signature of the ancestral <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> founders. We also show that, in terms of genetic variability, <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> populations may also track their host human populations. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>House</b> <b>mice</b> (Mus musculus) were {{introduced}} into 20, 4 -inch thick insulated panels and provided unlimited {{food and water}} for six months.

40|$|Allergic asthma {{is common}} airway disease that is {{characterized}} {{in part by}} enhanced airway constriction in response to nonspecific stimuli. Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci associated with asthma risk in humans, but these studies have not accounted for gene–environment interactions, which {{are thought to be}} important factors in asthma. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate responses to a common human allergen, we applied a <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> <b>mouse</b> (HDM) model of allergic airway disease (AAD) to 146 incipient lines of the Collaborative Cross (CC) and the CC founder strains. We employed a longitudinal study design in which mice were phenotyped for response to the bronchoconstrictor methacholine both before and after HDM sensitization and challenge using whole body plethysmography (WBP). There was significant variation in methacholine responsiveness due to both strain and HDM treatment, as reflected by changes in the WBP parameter enhanced pause. We also found that distinct QTL regulate baseline [chromosome (Chr) 18] and post-HDM (Chr 19) methacholine responsiveness and that post-HDM airway responsiveness was correlated with other features of AAD. Finally, using invasive measurements of airway mechanics, we tested whether the Chr 19 QTL affects lung resistance per se using C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and a consomic strain but found that QTL haplotype did not affect lung resistance. We conclude that aspects of baseline and allergen-induced methacholine responsiveness are associated with genetic variation, and that robust detection of airway resistance QTL in genetically diverse mice will be facilitated by direct measurement of airway mechanics...|$|R
