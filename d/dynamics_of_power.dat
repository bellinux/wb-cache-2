[...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bourdieu's {{work was}} {{primarily}} concerned with the <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in society, and especially the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and social order maintained within and across generations. [...] In conscious opposition to the idealist tradition of much of Western philosophy, his work often emphasized the corporeal nature of social life and stressed the role of practice and embodiment in social dynamics. [...] Building upon the theories of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Edmund Husserl, Georges Canguilhem, Karl Marx, Gaston Bachelard, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Erwin Panofsky, and Marcel Mauss (among others), his research pioneered novel investigative frameworks and methods, and introduced such influential concepts as cultural, social, and symbolic forms of capital (as opposed to traditional economic forms of capital), the cultural reproduction, the habitus, the field or location, and symbolic violence. [...] Another notable influence on Bourdieu was Blaise Pascal, after whom Bourdieu titled his Pascalian Meditations. [...] Bourdieu's major contributions to the sociology of education, the theory of sociology, and sociology of aesthetics have achieved wide influence in several related academic fields (e.g. anthropology, media and cultural studies, education), popular culture, and the arts.|$|E

40|$|This {{chapter is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} and control <b>of</b> steering <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>powered</b> two-wheelers (PTWs). Steering instabilities can be controlled via semi-active steering dampers. An analytical model is derived in the first section of the chapter in which the model is validated against both simulation and experimental data. The model reveals a parallelism between vertical and steering dynamics. Based on this, in the second section, the concept of rotational sky-hook (RSH) and rotational ground-hook (RGH) are adapted to the steering dynamics domain. Two control laws are proposed: the RGH, aimed at minimizing the absolute vibration of the steering axis, and the RSH, focused on the chassis oscillations. In the next section, the proposed strategies are validated on challenging manoeuvres performed in simulation. The last section presents experimental results obtained on an instrumented bik...|$|R

The primary source for reserves is the Federal Columbia River Power System, and the aging dams of this system are believed to be near their limit for providing this service. This paper will explore the <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> system as a whole, and investigate the relationships that wind power has to the rest <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> system. Several types of studies have been used to examine these relationships including Maximal Information Coefficient analysis, Correlation analysis, and Regression analysis. The results of these analyses demonstrate that the <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> system changed as wind power was added to the system. The results will also show that the power system is increasingly reliant on resources other than hydropower, including thermal power and interties to California and Canada, to provide balancing reserves for wind power...|$|R
