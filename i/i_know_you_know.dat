It is also backed by doo-wop beats, finger snaps and cooing backup vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman's breaking point and Hilson [...] "voices the frustration" [...] {{of women who are}} being neglected and exploited by men. In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Every woman has a breaking point, y'all/ Hey, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> some women can be lied to, cheated on and beat on/ Somebody know, hey, every woman has a breaking point, y'all." [...] According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, Hilson vocally incorporates an [...] "improvisational gospel style. MTV Buzzworthy writer Chris Ryan compared Hilson's vocals with Mary J. Blige's, particularly in Blige's cover of [...] "I'm Going Down" [...] (1995). Halfway through [...] "Breaking Point", Hilson talks about [...] "the need for each woman to reclaim her life" [...] in a spoken-word interlude, during which she mimics Blige, according to Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe. Hilson phrases: [...] "Now ladies, we really should be mad at ourselves, cause see, some women just tolerate too damn much. Huh!" ...|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN, - You {{know how}} much {{and for how long}} I have loved, respected, and admired him; I am only able to feel a little with you. But I know how he would have wished us to feel. I never knew a better man, nor one to me more lovable; we shall all feel the loss more greatly as time goes on. It scarce seems life to me; what must it be to you? Yet one of the last things that he said to me was, that from all these sad bereavements of yours he had learned only more than ever to feel the {{goodness}} and what we, in our feebleness, call the support of God; he had been ripening so much - to other eyes than ours, we must suppose he was ripe, and try to feel it. I feel it is better not to say much more. It will be to me a great pride to write a notice of him: the last I can now do. What more in any way I can do for you, please to think and let me know. For his sake and for your own, I would not be a useless friend: <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> me a most warm one; please command me or my wife, in any way. Do not trouble to write to me; Austin, I have no doubt, will do so, if you are, as I fear you will be, unfit.|$|E
