5|$|<b>G.</b> <b>minor</b> {{is unusual}} because it {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest {{they would be}} able to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|The Fugue in <b>G</b> <b>minor,</b> BWV 131a is a {{transcription}} for {{organ of}} the fugue from the closing movement of the cantata. Although the work has an BWV number, it is not certain that the arranger was Bach.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's opera {{based on}} the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first {{performed}} in 1913, after which the composer published {{a version of the}} prelude transcribed for piano. The piece, in <b>G</b> <b>minor,</b> contrasts a gravely noble andante moderato theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} three years, besides {{teaching}} piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the <b>G</b> <b>minor</b> Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his <b>G</b> <b>minor</b> sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then {{set out on a}} tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a concert pianist.|$|E
5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs are}} small and smooth-shelled. They are asymmetrically shaped, similar to many modern bird eggs, with one end pointier than the other. The two oospecies are {{distinguished}} mainly by their size: G. major ranges from 50 to 53.5mm long and 25 to 32mm across, with an eggshell thickness of 0.2-0.4mm, whereas <b>G.</b> <b>minor</b> is only 30-46mm by 20-24mm and 0.1-0.2mm thick.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1920s Vaughan Williams {{continued}} to compose, conduct and teach. Kennedy lists forty works premiered during the decade, including the Mass in <b>G</b> <b>minor</b> (1922), the ballet Old King Cole (1923), the operas Hugh the Drover and Sir John in Love (1924 and 1928), the suite Flos Campi (1925) and the oratorio Sancta Civitas (1925).|$|E

5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of <b>G</b> <b>minor</b> (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time left-hand beat is noticeably absent.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the film}} {{featured}} {{a number of}} pieces of classical music, as the main Bond girl, Kara Milovy, is a cellist. Mozart's 40th Symphony in <b>G</b> <b>minor</b> (1st movement) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees. As Moneypenny tells Bond, Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin's String Quartet in D major, and the finale to Act II of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (in Vienna) also features. Before Bond is drugged by Kara, she is practising the Cello solo from the first movement of Dvořák's cello concerto in B minor. At {{the end of the}} film, Kara and an orchestra (conducted onscreen by John Barry) perform Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations to rapturous applause.|$|E
5|$|The last opus {{number that}} Chopin himself used was 65, {{allocated}} to the Cello Sonata in <b>G</b> <b>minor.</b> He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At {{the request of the}} composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855. In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.|$|E

5|$|The second {{version of}} this cantata for a {{performance}} in Leipzig adds two recorders, which double viola I and II an octave higher. John Eliot Gardiner compares the effect to a four-foot stop on a pipe organ. The cantata begins in <b>G</b> <b>minor</b> in the Weimar version, in A minor in the Leipzig version. In the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the Leipzig version. The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.|$|E

The result of applying these operations to C is a minor of C that covers <b>G.</b> Since every <b>minor</b> of a planar graph is itself planar, this gives a planar cover of the <b>minor</b> <b>G.</b>|$|R
