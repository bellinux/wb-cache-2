Now the curse is on the whole country; the dollar is the measure of every value, the stamp of every success. What does not sell is a failure; and what sells succeeds." ...|$|R
60|$|Soon the Arabs {{began to}} open fire on us {{from behind the}} huts, and a very {{accurate}} fire it was, as our casualties quickly showed, notwithstanding the stone schanzes we had constructed.

30|$|Compared to the {{pervious}} meta-analysis (Chahal et al. 2012) on this topic, several differences {{should be}} noted in ours. First, the present meta-analysis showed inconsistent result of pooled ASES score, <b>even</b> <b>if,</b> of note, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not substantiate the finding with further applied TSA. Next, the previous meta-analysis totaling 373 patients included three published RCTs (Gartsman and O’connor 2004; Milano et al. 2007; MacDonald et al. 2011) and one preliminary result reported in abstract form only, whereas our present meta-analysis included five published RCTs (Gartsman and O’connor 2004; Milano et al. 2007; MacDonald et al. 2011; Shin et al. 2012; Abrams et al. 2014) and 523 individuals, which to some extent reinforced earlier results of previous meta-analysis in pooled Constant score {{and the rate of}} re-tear. Furthermore, we took additional evidence, UCLA score and VAS and even subgroup analysis, into our meta-analysis. Last but not least, as mentioned above, we assessed the evidence for pooled ASES score using TSA to facilitate the implementation of corresponding clinical decisions of healthcare professionals.|$|R

Numa had hunted here the night just gone, and Horta, the boar, had walked slowly along the trail within an hour; but what held Tarzan's attention was the spoor tale of the Gomangani. It told him that the day before an old man had gone toward the north in company with a little boy, and that with them had been two hyenas.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Topic: Disease Oroented: no. OP- 276 INTRODUCTION: Astrocytoma is the commonest type {{of brain}} tumors in {{childhood}} and low grade (WHO Gr I & II) accounted {{for almost half}} of them. Despite having good prognosis, the management approach remains quite variable {{in different parts of}} the world. AIM: We reviewed our experience on this group of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of a population based cohort from Jan- 1999 to Dec- 2014. The patients underwent treatment in 5 local hospitals which captured almost all children with cancers locally. The patients’ data were recorded prospectively by 2 full time data managers. The data was verified annually with the respective centers and HK Cancer registry. RESULTS: Within this 16 yrs period, there were 157 children with astrocytoma diagnosed. They were distributed as following: Cerebral & Cerebellar: n = 107 (Gr I n = 44, Gr II n = 21, Gr III n = 14, Gr IV n = 28); Brainstem: n = 50; Spinal: n = 9 (Gr I n = 4, Gr II n = 1, Gr III n = 1, Gr IV n = 4); Other types of glioma: n = 20 (Oligodendroglioma n = 10, PXA n = 2, Ganglioglioma n = 7, SEGA n = 1). Excluding the spinal astrocytoma and other types of glioma, we identifi ed 65 patients with cerebral or cerebellar low grade astrocytoma as mentioned above. Their median age was 7. 95 yrs (range 0. 15 to 17. 81 yrs) and M:F = 35 : 30. Cerebellum is the most common location (n = 28) followed by suprasellar region (n = 10). Surgery was the main form of treatment (n = 57) and 18 received additional low intensity chemotherapy. The choice of diff erent regimens depended on diff erent era, including carboplatin + vincristine, temozolomide alone, vinblastine alone, TPGV, PCV, etc. Patients often received more than one course of chemotherapy. Two patients underwent RT in the early 2000 era. Only 3 patients died of disease progression (all WHO Gr I). The 5 -year event free survival was 93. 3 % and 100 % for Gr I & Gr II patients respectively. ONCLUSION: Childhood low grade astrocytoma has relatively good prognosis <b>even</b> <b>if</b> unresectable. Low intensive chemotherapy could suppress the progression of a significant proportion of these low grade tumors and achieve long term survival. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> it recurred, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> utilize chemotherapy again and avoid using RT on this group of patients...|$|R
6000|$|One of our English summers looks, in the retrospect, {{as if it}} {{had been}} patched with more {{frequent}} sunshine than the sky of England ordinarily affords; but I believe that it may be only a moral effect,--a [...] "light that never was on sea nor land," [...] caused by our having found a particularly delightful abode in the neighborhood of London. In order to enjoy it, however, I was compelled to solve the problem of living in two places at once,--an impossibility which I so far accomplished as to vanish, at frequent intervals, out of men's sight and knowledge on one side of England, and take my place in a circle of familiar faces on the other, so quietly that I seemed to have been there all along. It was the easier to get accustomed to our new residence, because it was not only rich in all the material properties of a home, but had also the home-like atmosphere, the household element, which is of too intangible a character to be let even with the most thoroughly furnished lodging-house. A friend had given us his suburban residence, with all its conveniences, elegances, and snuggeries,--its drawing-rooms and library, still warm and bright with the recollection of the genial presences that we had known there,-- its closets, chambers, kitchen, and <b>even</b> its wine-cellar, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have availed ourselves of so dear and delicate a trust,--its lawn and cosey garden-nooks, and whatever else makes up the multitudinous idea of an English home,--he had transferred it all to us, pilgrims and dusty wayfarers, that we might rest and take our ease during his summer's absence on the Continent. We had long been dwelling in tents, as it were, and morally shivering by hearths which, heap the bituminous coal upon them as we might, no blaze could render cheerful. I remember, to this day, the dreary feeling with which I sat by our first English fireside, and watched the chill and rainy twilight of an autumn day darkening down upon the garden; while the portrait of the preceding occupant of the house (evidently a most unamiable personage in his lifetime) scowled inhospitably from above the mantel-piece, as if indignant that an American should try to make himself at home there. Possibly it may appease his sulky shade to know that I quitted his abode as much a stranger as I entered it. But mow, at last, we were in a genuine British home, where refined and warm-hearted people had just been living their daily life, and had left us a summer's inheritance of slowly ripened days, such as a stranger's hasty opportunities so seldom permit him to enjoy.|$|R
