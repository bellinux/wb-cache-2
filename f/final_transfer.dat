5|$|The Aouzou dispute was {{concluded}} for good on 3 February 1994, when the judges of the ICJ {{by a majority}} of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing an agreement as early as 4 April concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on 15 April and was completed by 10 May. The formal and <b>final</b> <b>transfer</b> of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on 30 May, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.|$|E

25|$|Earnhardt Jr. {{opened the}} Challenger Round with a 12th-place finish at Chicagoland. At New Hampshire, he ran up front {{for most of}} the day, but an {{emergency}} fuel stop with two laps to go led him to finish 25th, two laps down, and {{at the bottom of the}} Chase cutline. At Dover, despite falling back at a few points, Earnhardt Jr. was locked in a battle with Jamie McMurray for control of the <b>final</b> <b>transfer</b> spot into the Contender Round. He almost did not make it into the next round, with his chances being saved thanks to a caution for Brett Moffitt's crash on lap 357 keeping him from having to make a green flag pit stop to replace a loose wheel. On the last restart, Earnhardt Jr. overtook McMurray on the outside, and finished third, clinching the <b>final</b> <b>transfer</b> spot and bumping McMurray out of the Chase.|$|E

When the offensive was launched, 60th Rifle Corps was assigned to defend along a broad front to the north of Goldap while the remainder of 2nd Guards Army followed 28th Army's breakthrough of the German lines; the 334th and its Corps followed in second echelon. In the second half of March, in the lead-up to the assault on Königsberg, 60th Corps advanced along a route from Preussisch Eylau to Domnau, Tapiau, and Granz. During the assault, on April 7, the division assisted in forcing the Tierenberger River and reached the area north of Norgau. Once the city fell, the 334th took part in the clearing of the Samland Peninsula beginning on April 13. In the course of these East Prussian operations it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, II Class, in March.|$|E
500|$|The Compromise of 1850, {{which created}} the Utah Territory and the New Mexico Territory, would {{facilitate}} a southern {{route to the}} West Coast since all territory for the railroad was now organized and would allow for federal land grants as a financing measure. [...] Competing northern or central routes championed, respectively, by U.S. Senators Stephen Douglas of Illinois and Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, would still need to go through unorganized territories. [...] Millard Fillmore established a precedent for using federal land grants when he signed a bill promoted by Douglas that allowed a south to north, Mobile to Chicago railroad to be financed by [...] "federal land grants for the specific purpose of railroad construction".

Piloted by Michael Bloomfield, it then made an hour-long, tail-first circle of the station. The undocking took place 235 statute miles above the border of Kazakhstan and China. The final separation burn took place near the northeast coast of South America.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the interaction between}} the roles of a bank as a facilitator of payments in the economy and as a lender. In our model, banks make loans by issuing digital claims to an entrepreneur, who then uses them to pay for inputs. Issuing digital claims has two effects on a bank’s liquidity. First, some of these claims used as payment are cashed in before the project is over, necessitating transfers in the inter-bank market to meet these intermediate liquidity needs. Second, the lending bank must transfer reserves to the other banks when the project is done to settle its claims. Each of these transfers has a cost; the endogenous interest rate in the inter-bank market and a settlement cost for <b>final</b> <b>transfers.</b> These costs, in turn, are frictions that affect bank lending. Banks in our model are strategic. If productivity is similar, a high cost of <b>final</b> <b>transfers</b> leads to a coordination friction and multiple equilibria, with each bank trying to match the average number of digital claims issued by other banks. We {{consider the}} effects of financial innovations (i. e., FinTech) on the payments system and show that a reduction in the need for intermediate liquidity can lead to an increase in the inter-bank interest rate, because it also induces each bank to increase its lending. We also show that innovations may shift investments from more productive to less productive regions...|$|R

500|$|Bellerophon {{appears in}} a number of artworks, {{including}} several depicting the ship's role in Napoleon's surrender. Sir William Quiller Orchardson painted Napoleon on the Bellerophon, depicting the former emperor standing on the poop deck, watching the French coastline recede as his retinue look on. Sir Charles Lock Eastlake painted a portrait of Napoleon in uniform, standing on Bellerophons deck, while John James Chalon produced Scene in Plymouth Sound in August 1815, a seascape, with Bellerophon surrounded by crowds of people in small boats. Thomas Luny painted a similar scene, showing Bellerophon putting into Torbay to rendezvous with HMS Northumberland. Numerous popular prints and engravings were also produced, depicting moments from Napoleon's arrival on Bellerophon to surrender, to his <b>final</b> <b>transfer</b> to Northumberland for his voyage into exile. [...] The ship also appears in prints and paintings of the battles she had fought in.

500|$|The heat races {{began at}} 7:00 P.M., with each heat race {{occurring}} after 15 {{minutes of the}} previous heat's start. The last chance qualifier was held at 8:45 P.M. Schrader eventually won his heat race after leading all 8 laps. In Heat 2, the first caution flag {{of the day was}} flown for Darrell Wallace Jr.'s spin with three laps remaining, and Jared Landers prevented a comeback by Matt Crafton to win. The next heat was dominated by Timothy Peters, who led all eight laps; Heats 4 and 5 were won by Kenny Wallace and Jeb Burton, respectively, the two drivers leading every lap. In the last chance qualifier, J. R. Heffner, who started first in the race, failed to finish the race after completing one lap. Ultimately, Brennan Newberry led all fifteen laps to win, followed by Jeff Babcock, Jason Bowles and Justin Jennings. Norm Benning clinched the fifth and <b>final</b> <b>transfer</b> spot after holding off Clay Greenfield, who nearly wrecked him three times; in response, Benning gave Greenfield the finger after the race concluded. Because they did not finish in the top five, Greenfield, Jimmy Weller, Bryan Silas, Joe Cobb and Heffner did not qualify for the event. When asked about the duel with Greenfield, Benning stated Tony Stewart told him that he [...] "singlehandedly made the show a success".|$|E
500|$|Like Phase 1, the {{sections}} between stations will largely be constructed {{through the use}} of TBMs, while stations will be constructed through cut-and-cover and mining, allowing for the construction of station caverns, shafts, and entrances. Five transfers are planned to connect stations on the Second Avenue Line and nearby stations on adjacent lines, increasing travel options for passengers. The transfer at Grand Street will require the construction of a mezzanine below the existing station, allowing for a vertical transfer to be constructed. The existing station will have to be rebuilt to accommodate the increased volume of passengers using the station. The Houston Street station's transfer to the Second Avenue station of the IND Sixth Avenue Line would require some construction within the existing station. The remaining three transfers are being proposed, and will be constructed, baring the increased cost of their construction. The transfer to the BMT Canarsie Line's Third Avenue station would consist of a passageway that will be [...] long. The most complicated of the transfers will be the connection between the 42nd Street station and the Grand Central station on the IRT Flushing Line. To allow for the connection to be built, a 900-foot long tunnel would be built under 42nd Street from the west side of Third Avenue to Second Avenue. The Flushing Line station might have to be significantly reconstructed in anticipation of the increased volume of passengers and due to Americans with Disabilities Access requirements for the transfer. To allow for necessary vents and emergency exits to be built, cut-and-cover would be used. The <b>final</b> <b>transfer</b> would be between the 55th Street station and the Lexington Avenue–53rd Street station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Either shielded mining or cut-and-cover would be used to complete the connection. The existing station would have to be modified to allow for the transfer passageway to be built.|$|E
