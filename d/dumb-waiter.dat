6000|$|... "Here we are. Now, stand {{away while}} I pitch 'em down," [...] said Snap, {{stopping}} at last before {{a hole in}} the ground where a <b>dumb-waiter</b> hung ready, with a name over it.|$|E
60|$|Near {{the back}} of the flat was a <b>dumb-waiter,</b> with bells and speaking-tubes. When the butcher, the baker, or the kerosene-lamp maker, came each morning, he rang the bell, and called up the tube to know what was wanted. The order was called down, and he brought the things in the afternoon.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{the chalk}} was then reached, I do not know. It {{must have been}} close below. But these mottled clays and sands abound in water (being indeed the layer which {{supplies}} the great breweries in London, and those soda-water bottles on <b>dumb-waiters</b> which squirt in Trafalgar Square); and (I suppose) the water being reached, the boring ceased.|$|R
6000|$|It {{would seem}} as if the very {{language}} of our parlors would lose all its nerve and degenerate into palaver wholly, our lives pass at such remoteness from its symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched, through slides and <b>dumb-waiters,</b> as it were; in other words, the parlor is {{so far from the}} kitchen and workshop. The dinner even is only the parable of a dinner, commonly. As if only the savage dwelt near enough to Nature and Truth to borrow a trope from them. How can the scholar, who dwells away in the North West Territory or the Isle of Man, tell what is parliamentary in the kitchen? ...|$|R
50|$|One of Remus' {{fortified}} distilleries was the Death Valley Farm, {{which he}} purchased from George Gehrum. The outside world {{thought it was}} only accessible by dirt road. The actual distillery was located at 2656 Queen City Ave. The alcohol was distilled in the attic of the home then <b>dumb-waitered</b> below. The basement was where a trap door was located and a tunnel approximately fifty to 100 feet long and six feet under the earth. The bootleggers would push the products along the tunnel out to a waiting car, usually making it safely away. It {{is believed to be}} one of the only locations never busted in the Cincinnati area. In 1920, a raid by hijackers took place, but Remus' armed guards, led by John Gehrum, fired heavy volleys at the hijackers and, after a short fight, the wounded attackers left.|$|R
6000|$|... "No use," [...] {{continued}} the Inspector. [...] "For {{the matter of}} that, look at this huge old-fashioned fireplace. A man of extraordinary precocity could climb up the chimney. Or this <b>dumb-waiter</b> on a pulley, for serving drinks, leading down into the maids' quarters. A man of extreme indelicacy might ride {{up and down in}} it." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently he espied a small {{opening in}} the wall {{at the head of}} his cot. He rose and {{examined}} it. The voices appeared to be coming from it. In fact, they were. The opening {{was at the top of}} a narrow shaft that seemed to lead to the basement of the structure--apparently once the shaft of a <b>dumb-waiter</b> or a chute for refuse or soiled clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "So here's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, {{taking a}} {{decanter}} of choicer wine from his <b>dumb-waiter,</b> and filling {{for each of}} us and for himself, [...] "and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady's satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are to-day!" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{dwelling}} {{also shows}} how the sexes lived apart under one roof. Wide hallways separate the brethren's rooms from the sisters' rooms; separate doors and stairways {{for men and women}} meant that a sister never had to pass a brother going through those openings. Men and women ate at opposite ends of the dining room. The dwelling also has features unusual in habitations of their era; interior windows for borrowed light to illuminate an otherwise-dark stairwell, built-in cabinets and cases of drawers, <b>dumb-waiters</b> for moving food and dishes between the downstairs kitchen and the dining room on the floor above, an abundance of windows for light and ventilation. All of the windows in the building, rather than having a 90 degree angle with the wall, form a 45 (approx.) degree angle in the wall, which allows approximately 30 percent more light into the building—something that significantly keep the electrical bills low while experiencing more natural light.|$|R
60|$|The most {{striking}} {{point about the}} room was the furniture. This was a repetition upon inanimate objects of the old principle introduced by Noah, consisting {{for the most part}} of two articles of every sort. The duplicate system of furnishing owed its existence to the forethought of Fancy's mother, exercised from the date of Fancy's birthday onwards. The arrangement spoke for itself: nobody who knew the tone of the household could look at the goods without being aware that the second set was a provision for Fancy, when she should marry and have a house of her own. The most noticeable instance was a pair of green-faced eight-day clocks, ticking alternately, which were severally two and half minutes and three minutes striking the hour of twelve, one proclaiming, in Italian flourishes, Thomas Wood as the name of its maker, and the other--arched at the top, and altogether of more cynical appearance--that of Ezekiel Saunders. They were two departed clockmakers of Casterbridge, whose desperate rivalry throughout their lives was nowhere more emphatically perpetuated than here at Geoffrey's. These chief specimens of the marriage provision were supported on the right by a couple of kitchen dressers, each fitted complete with their cups, dishes, and plates, in their turn followed by two <b>dumb-waiters,</b> two family Bibles, two warming- pans, and two intermixed sets of chairs.|$|R
60|$|To lock her up, {{and hand}} over the key to Reynard when he should appear in the hall, was a plan charming in its simplicity, till her mother found, on trying {{the door of the}} girl's chamber softly, that Betty had already locked and bolted it on the inside, and had given {{directions}} to have her meals served where she was, by leaving them on a <b>dumb-waiter</b> outside the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{got along}} fine with the olives and celery and the bluepoints. They was easy. And then the consommé {{came up the}} <b>dumb-waiter</b> all in one big silver tureen. Instead of serving it from the side-table {{he picks it up}} between his hands and starts to the dining-table with it. When nearly there he drops the tureen smash on the floor, and the soup soaks all the lower part of that girl's swell silk dress.|$|E
60|$|Dinner {{was laid}} {{in the best of}} these rooms; the second was his dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably laid--no silver in the service, of course--and at the side of his chair was a capacious <b>dumb-waiter,</b> with a variety of bottles and {{decanters}} on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hopkins {{was like}} a {{thousand}} others. The auriferous tooth, the sedentary disposition, the Sunday afternoon wanderlust, the draught upon the delicatessen store for home-made comforts, the furor for department store marked-down sales, the feeling of superiority to {{the lady in the}} third-floor front who wore genuine ostrich tips and had two names over her bell, the mucilaginous hours during which she remained glued to the window sill, the vigilant avoidance of the instalment man, the tireless patronage of the acoustics of the <b>dumb-waiter</b> shaft--all the attributes of the Gotham flat-dweller were hers.|$|E
60|$|I {{bought a}} {{second-hand}} <b>dumb-waiter</b> for this dinner-party, in preference to re-engaging the handy young man; against whom I had conceived a prejudice, in consequence of meeting {{him in the}} Strand, one Sunday morning, in a waistcoat remarkably like one of mine, which had been missing since the former occasion. The 'young gal' was re-engaged; but on the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes, and then withdraw to the landing-place, beyond the outer door; where a habit of sniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests, and where her retiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility.|$|E
6000|$|When a purring, baby-talking {{acquaintance}} gurgled: [...] "How did the Ruthie bride {{spend her}} morning? Did she cook some little dainty for her husband? Nothing bourgeois, I'm sure!" [...] in reply Ruth pleasantly observed: [...] "Not a chance. The Ruthie bride cussed out the janitor for not shooting up a dainty cabbage on the <b>dumb-waiter,</b> and then counted up her husband's cigarette coupons and skipped {{right down to}} the premium parlors with 'em and got him a pair of pale-blue Boston garters and a cunning granite-ware stew-pan, and then sponged lunch off Olive Dunleavy. But nothing bourgeois!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I remember, gentlemen,' said Mr. Pell, 'dining {{with him}} on one occasion; there was only us two, but {{everything}} as splendid as if twenty people had been expected--the great seal on a <b>dumb-waiter</b> at his right hand, and {{a man in a}} bag-wig and suit of armour guarding the mace with a drawn sword and silk stockings--which is perpetually done, gentlemen, night and day; when he said, [...] "Pell," [...] he said, [...] "no false delicacy, Pell. You're a man of talent; you can get anybody through the Insolvent Court, Pell; and your country should be proud of you." [...] Those were his very words. [...] "My Lord," [...] I said, [...] "you flatter me."--"Pell," [...] he said, [...] "if I do, I'm damned."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now there,' said Mr Meagles softly, as {{he gave a}} turn to the <b>dumb-waiter</b> on {{his right}} hand to twirl the sugar towards himself. 'There's a girl who might be lost and ruined, if she wasn't among {{practical}} people. Mother and I know, solely from being practical, that {{there are times when}} that girl's whole nature seems to roughen itself against seeing us so bound up in Pet. No father and mother were bound up in her, poor soul. I don't like to think {{of the way in which}} that unfortunate child, with all that passion and protest in her, feels when she hears the Fifth Commandment on a Sunday. I am always inclined to call out, Church, Count five-and-twenty, Tattycoram.' ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile he {{took the}} mutton off the gridiron, and gravely handed it round. We all took some, but our {{appreciation}} of it was gone, and we merely {{made a show of}} eating it. As we severally pushed away our plates, he noiselessly removed them, and set on the cheese. He took that off, too, when it was done with; cleared the table; piled everything on the dumb-waiter; gave us our wine-glasses; and, of his own accord, wheeled the <b>dumb-waiter</b> into the pantry. All this was done in a perfect manner, and he never raised his eyes from what he was about. Yet his very elbows, when he had his back towards me, seemed to teem with the expression of his fixed opinion that I was extremely young.|$|E
6000|$|Kappelman, the painter, was the cut-up. As a {{piece of}} {{delicate}} Athenian wit he got {{up from his chair}} and waltzed down the room with a waiter. That dependent, no doubt an honest, pachydermatous, worthy, tax-paying, art-despising biped, released himself from the unequal encounter, carried his professional smile back to the <b>dumb-waiter</b> and dropped it down the shaft to eternal oblivion. Reeves began to make Keats turn in his grave. Mrs. Pothunter told the story of the man who met the widow on the train. Miss Adrian hummed what is still called a chanson in the cafés of Bridgeport. Grainger edited each individual effort with his assistant editor's smile, which meant: [...] "Great! but you'll have to send them in through the regular channels. If I were the chief now--but you know how it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a little}} inn where Mr. Micawber put up, and he {{occupied}} a little room in it, partitioned off from the commercial room, and strongly flavoured with tobacco-smoke. I think it was over the kitchen, because a warm greasy smell appeared to come up through the chinks in the floor, {{and there was a}} flabby perspiration on the walls. I know it was near the bar, on account of the smell of spirits and jingling of glasses. Here, recumbent on a small sofa, underneath a picture of a race-horse, with her head close to the fire, and her feet pushing the mustard off the <b>dumb-waiter</b> {{at the other end of}} the room, was Mrs. Micawber, to whom Mr. Micawber entered first, saying, 'My dear, allow me to introduce to you a pupil of Doctor Strong's.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But, while John was not impudent either, {{he had a}} footman's feeling {{toward those}} whom he fancied no better than himself. He had set the table with his {{customary}} neatness and method, and he served the soup with as much regularity {{as he would have}} done had we sat there in our proper characters, but then he withdrew. He probably remembered that the landlord, or upper servant of an English hotel, is apt to make his appearance with the soup, and to disappear as that disappears. So it was with John; after removing the soup, he put a <b>dumb-waiter</b> near my uncle, touched a carving-knife or two, as much as to say [...] "help yourselves," [...] and quitted the room. As a matter of course, our dinner was not a very elaborate one, it wanting two or three hours to the regular time of dining, though my grandmother had ordered, in my hearing, one or two delicacies to be placed on the table that had surprised Patt. Among the extraordinary things for such guests was wine. The singularity, however, was a little explained by the quality commanded, which was Rhenish.|$|E
6000|$|... "About that matter," [...] exclaimed the {{impulsive}} bachelor, {{going off}} at the hint like a rocket, [...] "all thinking minds are, now-a-days, coming to the conclusion--one derived from an immense hereditary experience--see what Horace and others of the ancients say of servants--coming to the conclusion, I say, that boy or man, the human animal is, for most work-purposes, a losing animal. Can't be trusted; less trustworthy than oxen; for conscientiousness a turn-spit dog excels him. Hence these thousand new inventions--carding machines, horseshoe machines, tunnel-boring machines, reaping machines, apple-paring machines, boot-blacking machines, sewing machines, shaving machines, run-of-errand machines, <b>dumb-waiter</b> machines, and the Lord-only-knows-what machines; all of which announce the era when that refractory animal, the working or serving man, shall be a buried by-gone, a superseded fossil. Shortly prior to which glorious time, I doubt not that a price will be put upon their peltries as upon the knavish 'possums,' especially the boys. Yes, sir (ringing his rifle down on the deck), I rejoice {{to think that the}} day is at hand, when, prompted to it by law, I shall shoulder this gun and go out a boy-shooting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so very," [...] {{said the}} boy, with his queer promptness. He stood resting {{himself on his}} {{crutches}} at the door, and he now wheeled about, {{and led the way}} out to the living-room, swinging himself actively forward. It seemed that his haste was to get to the <b>dumb-waiter</b> in the little china closet opening off the dining-room, which was like the papered inside of a square box. He called to the girl below, and helped pull it up, as Annie could tell by the creaking of the rope, and the light jar of the finally arriving crockery. A half-grown girl then appeared, and put the dishes on at the places indicated with nods and looks by Mrs. Putney, who had taken her place at the table. There was a platter of stewed fowl, and a plate of high-piled waffles, sweltering in successive courses of butter and sugar. In cut-glass dishes, one {{at each end of the}} table, there were canned cherries and pine-apple. There was a square of old-fashioned soda biscuit, not broken apart, which sent up a pleasant smell; in the centre of the table was a shallow vase of strawberries.|$|E
60|$|Besides his <b>dumb-waiter,</b> Mr Meagles had {{two other}} not dumb waiters in the persons of two parlour-maids with rosy faces and bright eyes, who were a highly {{ornamental}} {{part of the}} table decoration. 'And why not, you see?' said Mr Meagles on this head. 'As I always say to Mother, why not have something pretty to look at, if you have anything at all?' A certain Mrs Tickit, who was Cook and Housekeeper when the family were at home, and Housekeeper only when the family were away, completed the establishment. Mr Meagles regretted {{that the nature of}} the duties in which she was engaged, rendered Mrs Tickit unpresentable at present, but hoped to introduce her to the new visitor to-morrow. She was {{an important part of the}} Cottage, he said, and all his friends knew her. That was her picture up in the corner. When they went away, she always put on the silk-gown and the jet-black row of curls represented in that portrait (her hair was reddish-grey in the kitchen), established herself in the breakfast-room, put her spectacles between two particular leaves of Doctor Buchan's Domestic Medicine, and sat looking over the blind all day until they came back again. It was supposed that no persuasion could be invented which would induce Mrs Tickit to abandon her post at the blind, however long their absence, or to dispense with the attendance of Dr Buchan; the lucubrations of which learned practitioner, Mr Meagles implicitly believed she had never yet consulted to the extent of one word in her life.|$|E
60|$|I shut my eyes, {{and there}} {{comes to me}} unbidden that dining-room in Marlborough Street of a gray winter's afternoon, when I was but a lad. I see my dear {{grandfather}} in his wig and silver-laced waistcoat and his blue velvet coat, seated {{at the head of}} the table, and the precise Scipio has put down the <b>dumb-waiter</b> filled with shining cut-glass at his left hand, and his wine chest at his right, and with solemn pomp driven his black assistants from the room. Scipio was Mr. Carvel's butler. He was forbid to light the candles after dinner. As dark grew on, Mr. Carvel liked the blazing logs for light, and presently sets the decanter on the corner of the table and draws nearer the fire, his guests following. I recall well how jolly Governor Sharpe, who was a frequent visitor with us, was wont to display a comely calf in silk stocking; and how Captain Daniel Clapsaddle would spread his feet with his toes out, and settle his long pipe between his teeth. And there were besides a host of others who sat at that fire whose names have passed into Maryland's history,--Whig and Tory alike. And I remember a tall slip of a lad who sat listening by the deep-recessed windows on the street, which somehow are always covered in these pictures with a fine rain. Then a coach passes,--a mahogany coach emblazoned with the Manners's coat of arms, and Mistress Dorothy and her mother within. And my young lady gives me one of those demure bows which ever set my heart agoing like a smith's hammer of a Monday.|$|E
6000|$|The cook said, [...] "Oh yes, ma'am," [...] and {{she gave}} me a good stare, while Mrs. Makely went to the kitchen window and made me observe that it let in the outside air, though the court that it opened into was so dark that one had to keep the {{electrics}} going in the kitchen night and day. [...] "Of course, it's an expense," [...] she said, as she closed the kitchen door after us. She added, in a low, rapid tone, [...] "You must excuse my introducing the cook. She has read all about you in the papers--you didn't know, I suppose, that there were reporters that day of your delightful talk in the mountains, but I had them--and she was wild, when she heard you were coming, and made me promise to let her have a sight of you somehow. She says she wants to go and live in Altruria, and {{if you would like to}} take home a cook, or a servant of any kind, you wouldn't have much trouble. Now here," [...] she ran on, without a moment's pause, while she flung open another door, [...] "is what you won't find in every apartment-house, even very good ones, and that's a back elevator. Sometimes there are only stairs, and they make the poor things climb the whole way up from the basement, when they come in, and all your marketing has to be brought up that way, too; sometimes they send it up on a kind of <b>dumb-waiter,</b> in the cheap places, and you give your orders to the market-men down below through a speaking-tube. But here we have none of that bother, and this elevator is for the kitchen and housekeeping part of the flat. The grocer's and the butcher's man, and anybody who has packages for you, or trunks, or that sort of thing, use it, and, of course, it's for the servants, and they appreciate not having to walk up as much as anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|Mannering, with Sampson for his companion, lost {{no time in}} {{his journey}} to Edinburgh. They {{travelled}} in the Colonel's post-chariot, who, knowing his companion's habits of abstraction, did not choose to lose {{him out of his}} own sight, far less to trust him on horseback, where, in all probability, a knavish stable-boy might with little address have contrived to mount him with his face to the tail. Accordingly, with the aid of his valet, who attended on horseback, he contrived to bring Mr. Sampson safe to an inn in Edinburgh--for hotels in those days there were none--without any other accident than arose from his straying twice upon the road. On one occasion he was recovered by Barnes, who understood his humour, when, after engaging in close colloquy with the schoolmaster of Moffat respecting a disputed quantity in Horace's 7th Ode, Book II, the dispute led on to another controversy concerning the exact meaning of the word malobathro in that lyric effusion. His second escapade was made for the purpose of visiting the field of Rullion Green, which was dear to his Presbyterian predilections. Having got out of the carriage for an instant, he saw the sepulchral monument of the slain at the distance of about a mile, and was arrested by Barnes in his progress up the Pentland Hills, having on both occasions forgot his friend, patron, and fellow-traveller as completely {{as if he had been}} in the East Indies. On being reminded that Colonel Mannering was waiting for him, he uttered his usual ejaculation of 'Prodigious! I was oblivious,' and then strode back to his post. Barnes was surprised at his master's patience on both occasions, knowing by experience how little he brooked neglect or delay; but the Dominie was in every respect a privileged person. His patron and he were never for a moment in each other's way, and it seemed obvious that they were formed to be companions through life. If Mannering wanted a particular book, the Dominie could bring it; if he wished to have accounts summed up or checked, his assistance was equally ready; if he desired to recall a particular passage in the classics, he could have recourse to the Dominie as to a dictionary; and all the while this walking statue was neither presuming when noticed nor sulky when left to himself. To a proud, shy, reserved man, and such in many respects was Mannering, this sort of living catalogue and animated automaton had all the advantages of a literary <b>dumb-waiter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A legal {{complaint}} about a Manhattan restaurant's dumbwaiter in 1915, which also mentions that food orders are shouted {{up and down}} the shaft, describes its operation and limitations as follows:is ... great play between the cart of the <b>dumb-waiter</b> and the guides on which it runs, with the result that the running of the cart is accompanied by a loud noise. The rope which operates the cart of the <b>dumb-waiter</b> runs in a wheel with a very shallow groove, so that the rope is liable to and does at times slip off. ... The cart has no shock absorbers at the top, so that when it strikes the top of the shaft or wheel there is a loud report. ... The ropes of the <b>dumb-waiter</b> strike such wall at frequent intervals with a loud report. ... The <b>dumb-waiter</b> is often negligently operated, by running it faster than necessary, and by letting it go down with a sudden fall.|$|E

This condition held firm until in 1886 {{the house was}} transferred to the Reverend Oswald Reichel, a brother of one of the former occupants. Reichel, the sole male owner in over two hundred years, was responsible for substantial structural changes. These included the construction of a water tower and laundry room, the installation of a bathroom and central heating, the construction of upstairs bedrooms with dormer windows, the fitting of first-floor windows, a heavy pulley <b>dumb-waiter</b> and speaking tubes, the replacement of the original thatch with roof tiles and the addition of an external catwalk.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has rendered masonry structural walls and timber partition walls, with cedar architraves, skirtings and cornices, however several of the internal doors have been removed. The ground floor contains three offices on the southern side, a large central room, and stair and strongroom on the northern side. The central room has a large carved timber reception counter at the front, and the name FITZROY SHIRE COUNCIL is inset in the vinyl tiled floor to the entrance. This room has a central cast iron column and timber boarded ceiling, and a <b>dumb-waiter</b> has been installed adjacent to the strongroom. Exposed air conditioning ducts have been installed, with ducts penetrating window and fanlight openings. The stair {{to the first floor}} has a cedar newel post and handrail, with turned cedar balusters to the first floor.|$|E
5000|$|This room {{is located}} {{to the east}} and is flanked by the pink and blue cabinets. The pink cabinet, unlike the other cabinets, had a real function. The king used it as a robing room. The dining room is famous for its disappearing <b>dumb-waiter</b> called [...] "Tischlein deck dich". This table was {{installed}} so that Ludwig could dine alone here. Yet the staff had to lay the table for at least four persons because it is said that the king used to talk to imaginary people like Louis XV, Mme de Pompadour or Marie Antoinette while he was eating. For Ludwig II enjoyed the company of those people and admired them. You can find portraits of them in the cabinets, and scenes of their lives everywhere in the palace's rooms.|$|E
