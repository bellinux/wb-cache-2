6000|$|Where have <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>read</b> of a {{game played}} at a country house? The party assembles round a table with pens, ink, and paper. Some one narrates a tale {{containing}} more or less incidents and personages. Each person of the company then writes down, {{to the best of}} his memory and ability, the anecdote just narrated, and finally the papers are to be read out. I do not say I should like to play often at this game, which might possibly be a tedious and lengthy pastime, not by any means so amusing as smoking a cigar in the conservatory; or even listening to the young ladies playing their piano-pieces; or to Hobbs and Nobbs lingering round the bottle and talking over the morning's run with the hounds but surely it is a moral and ingenious sport. They say the variety of narratives is often very odd and amusing. The original story becomes so changed and distorted {{that at the end of}} all the statements you are puzzled to know where the truth is at all. As time is of small importance to the cheerful persons engaged in this sport, perhaps a good way of playing it would be to spread it over a couple of years. Let the people who played the game in '60 all meet and play it once more in '61, and each write his story over again. Then bring out your original and compare notes. Not only will the stories differ from each other, but the writers will probably differ from themselves. In the course of the year the incidents will grow or will dwindle strangely. The least authentic of the statements will be so lively or so malicious, or so neatly put, that it will appear most like the truth. I like these tales and sportive exercises. I had begun a little print collection once. I had Addison in his nightgown in bed at Holland House, requesting young Lord Warwick to remark how a Christian should die. I had Cambronne clutching his cocked hat and uttering the immortal la Garde meurt et ne se rend pas. I had the [...] "Vengeur" [...] going down, and all the crew hurraying like madmen. I had Alfred toasting the muffin; Curtius (Haydon) jumping into the gulf; with extracts from Napoleon's bulletins, and a fine authentic portrait of Baron Munchausen.|$|E
60|$|I {{had your}} N.32 at Windsor: <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>read</b> it, and {{immediately}} sealed it up again, and shall read {{it no more}} this twelvemonth at least. The reason of my resentment at it is, because you talk as glibly of a thing {{as if it were}} done, which, for aught I know, is farther from being done than ever, since I hear not a word of it, though the town is full of it, and the Court always giving me joy and vexation. You might be sure I would have let you know {{as soon as it was}} done; but I believe you fancied I would affect not to tell it you, but let you learn it from newspapers and reports. I remember only there was something in your letter about ME's money, and that shall be taken care of on the other side. I left Windsor on Monday last, upon Lord Bolingbroke's being gone to France, and somebody's being here that I ought often to consult with in an affair I am upon: but that person talks of returning to Windsor again, and I believe I shall follow him. I am now in a hedge-lodging very busy, as I am every day till noon: so that this letter is like to be short, and you are not to blame me these two months; for I protest, if I study ever so hard, I cannot in that time compass what I am upon. We have a fever both here and at Windsor, which hardly anybody misses; but it lasts not above three or four days, and kills nobody.(2) The Queen has forty servants down of it at once. I dined yesterday with Treasurer, but could do no business, though he sent for me, I thought, on purpose; but he desires I will dine with him again to-day. Windsor is a most delightful place, and at this time abounds in dinners. My lodgings there look upon Eton and the Thames. I wish I was owner of them; they belong to a prebend. God knows what was in your letter; and if it be not answered, whose fault is it, sauci dallars?--Do you know that Grub Street is dead and gone last week? No more ghosts or murders now for love or money. I plied it pretty close the last fortnight, and published at least seven penny papers of my own, besides some of other people's: but now every single half-sheet pays a halfpenny to the Queen.(3) The Observator is fallen; the Medleys are jumbled together with the Flying Post; the Examiner is deadly sick; the Spectator keeps up, and doubles its price; I know not how long it will hold. Have you seen the red stamp the papers are marked with? Methinks it is worth a halfpenny, the stamping it. Lord Bolingbroke and Prior set out for France last Saturday. My lord's business is to hasten the peace before the Dutch are too much mauled, and hinder France from carrying the jest of beating them too far. Have you seen the Fourth Part of John Bull?(4) It is equal to the rest, and extremely good. The Bishop of Clogher's son has been ill of St. Anthony's fire, but is now quite well. I was afraid his face would be spoiled, but it is not. Dilly is just as he used to be, and puns as plentifully and as bad. The two brothers see one another; but I think not the two sisters. Raymond writ to me that he intended to invite you to Trim. Are you, have you, will you be there? Won't oo see pool Laratol?(5) Parvisol says I shall have no fruit. Blasts have taken away all. Pray observe the cherry-trees on the river-walk; but oo are too lazy to take such a journey. If you have not your letters in due time for two months hence, impute it to my being tosticated between this and Windsor. And pray send me again the state of ME's money; for I will not look into your letter for it. Poor Lord Winchelsea(6) is dead, to my great grief. He was a worthy honest gentleman, and particular friend of mine: and, what is yet worse, my old acquaintance, Mrs. Finch,(7) is now Countess of Winchelsea, the title being fallen to her husband, but without much estate. I have been poring my eyes all this morning, and it is now past two afternoon, so I shall take a little walk in the Park. Do you play at ombre still? Or is that off by Mr. Stoyte's absence, and Mrs. Manley's grief? Somebody was telling me of a strange sister that Mrs. Manley has got in Ireland, who disappointed you all about her being handsome.

5000|$|At this time, all {{television}} programs were introduced by an in-vision host or hostess and broadcasts were normally live. Malcolm received no training and became {{known for her}} spoonerisms: [...] "By {{the end of the}} day I was tired, and when I came to the weather forecast <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>read</b> it out without really trying. My biggest fear was 'drain and rizzle', which I said more than once." [...] With the advent of commercial rival ITV in 1955, the BBC’s reliance on announcers diminished. Commercial breaks quickly became popular and the BBC decided audiences no longer needed a hostess to soothe them. Malcolm left the BBC in 1956 although she continued to appear as a guest on various programs including an episode of the comedy series The Goodies. Her autobiography, Me, was published in 1956.|$|E
50|$|While {{the novels}} {{are at the}} centre of Leitch's achievement, his work in {{broadcasting}} was significant, and contributed to his MBE. Among the dramas he produced were plays by James Follett and a dramatisation of Seán O'Casey's great autobiography, I Knock at the Door. A breadth of interest saw writers such as Vladimir Nabokov and B. Traven, Edna O'Brien, Carson McCullers, V. S. Naipaul, Katherine Mansfield and F. Scott Fitzgerald figure in the Book at Bedtime under his editorship, and he introduce new writers such as Timothy Mo - although after leaving the BBC he was to say: 'Most writers do all their serious reading {{before the age of}} thirty-five. After that <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>read</b> for purposes of research. Writing is hard enough as it is anyway, and enough to be going on with.' Despite this he went on to produce over 30 readings of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, abridged for Corgi Audio with Tony Robinson as the reader.|$|E
5000|$|In his Journal (2 May 1896) Tolstoy wrote: [...] "Still another {{important}} event the work Thought and Reality of African Spir. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>read</b> through what I {{wrote in the}} beginning of this notebook. At bottom, it is nothing else than a short summary of all of Spir's philosophy which I not only had not read at that time, but about which I had not the slightest idea. This work clarified my ideas on the meaning of life remarkably, and in some ways strengthened them. The essence of his doctrine is that things do not exist, but only our impressions which appear to us in our conception as objects. Conception (Vorstellung) has the quality of believing in the existence of objects. This {{comes from the fact that}} the quality of thinking consists in attributing an objectivity to impressions, a substance, and a projecting of them into space". The next day (3 May 1896) he added, [...] "I am reading Spir all the time, and the reading provokes a mass of thoughts".|$|E

30|$|Twenty {{participants}} reported reading the textbook in some capacity, either in full or in part, either assigned or unassigned, or they consulted the book {{when confronted with}} unfamiliar material. Often, the participants did not specify if they were re-reading, reading {{it for the first}} time, or if they were skimming. Importantly, the depth with which students read textbooks appeared to vary based on their intentions. In one case, a student explained, “Sometimes I just go through the chapter we’re going to go through in class and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>read</b> all the captions for the images (to prepare for the lecture) so I know what we’re going to talk about and then afterwards I’ll read through the chapter.” In most cases, however, students spoke more ambiguously about reading.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} how youths adopt {{a critical}} literacy approach towards the important, multimodal texts that they identify in their lives. Qualitative data are presented, which demonstrate how critically minded these youths are when engaging with texts. The author suggests approaches teachers {{can take to}} enhance the relationship between literacy curriculum and teenagers ’ text-based interests. A tool for evaluating youths ’ approach to texts is presented to assist teachers so they can move their students beyond evaluative thinking into a transformative position. This article concludes with suggestions for how teachers can develop their own critical literacy approach to texts and curriculum.

40|$|The {{system we}} {{envision}} is a proactive software agent that uses context and human-to-human communication {{to help find}} and deliver the right information at the right time. The system constantly searches for information related to the current situation, {{in order to make}} it easier to find relevant related information. We call such a system a Context / Communication Information Agent (CIA). By context, we mean knowing the answers to the “W ” questions, such as who is speaking, who else is here, where am I, what calendar event is current, and so on. As an example of how context could be used, suppose that earlier in the day, Francis scribbled down a grocery list. Later, when passing by the grocery store he usually goes to, his PDA beeps, reminding him to buy some food. As he enters, his PDA fetches his handwritten notes for him. As another example, suppose that a person has a weekly meeting to go to, stored as a recurring weekly event on his calendar. When the time for the next meeting takes place, the system could begin retrieving notes, minutes, and action items from last week's meeting, so that he doesn’t have to remember where he saved them. By human-to-human communication, we mean using microphones, cameras, and other sensors to capture communication between people, such as text, ink, speech, and so on. As an example of how communication could be used to prefetch information, suppose that two people are talking to each other. One person says something along the lines, “There's this interesting paper <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>read</b> by some people at Berkeley about user interfaces”, and goes on t...|$|E
