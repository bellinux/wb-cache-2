5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances {{that led him to}} Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, does not provide a definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The <b>generic</b> <b>reference,</b> in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E
500|$|The {{assignment}} statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including {{the nature of}} Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to [...] "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to [...] "(generic) name x receives {{a reference to a}} separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2." [...] This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a <b>generic</b> <b>reference</b> holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.|$|E
2500|$|Presently in Portugal, {{the term}} colégio (college) is {{normally}} {{used as a}} <b>generic</b> <b>reference</b> to a private (non-government) school that provides from basic to secondary education. Many of the private schools include the term colégio in their name. Some special public schools - usually of the boarding school type - also include the term in their name, with a notable example being the Colégio Militar (Military College). The term colégio interno (literally [...] "internal college") is used specifically as a <b>generic</b> <b>reference</b> to a boarding school.|$|E

2500|$|Prior legal {{disputes}} between some manufacturers of sheepskin boots arose as to distinguish whether [...] "ugg" [...] is a protected trademark, or a generic term and thus ineligible for trademark protection. There {{are more than}} 70 registered trademarks that include the term [...] "ugg" [...] in various logos and designs in Australia and New Zealand, as the term is considered a <b>generic</b> <b>reference</b> to a type of shoe. Outside Australia and New Zealand, UGG is a brand manufactured by the California-based Deckers Outdoor Corporation, with most of its manufacturing based in China and with registered trademarks in over 130 countries worldwide including the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada, all European Union members, and China.|$|E
2500|$|The other officiants {{associated}} with the oracle are less well known. These are the hosioi ("ὅσιοι", [...] "holy ones") and the prophētai ("προφῆται", singular prophētēs). Prophētēs is {{the origin of the}} English word [...] "prophet", but a better translation of the Greek word might be [...] "one who speaks on behalf of another person." [...] The prophetai are referred to in literary sources, but their function is unclear; {{it has been suggested that}} they interpreted the Pythia's prophecies, or even reformatted her utterances into verse, but it has also been argued that the term prophētēs is a <b>generic</b> <b>reference</b> to any cult officials of the sanctuary, including the Pythia. There were five hosioi, whose responsibilities are unknown, but may have been involved in some manner with the operation of the oracle.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a framework {{suitable for the}} definition of a <b>Generic</b> Enterprise <b>Reference</b> Architecture and Methodology to readers interested in architectures- and methodology development. The <b>Generic</b> Enterprise <b>Reference</b> Architecture and Methodology is about those methods, models and tools which are needed to build the integrated enterprise. The architecture is generic because it applies to most, potentially all types of enterprise. The coverage of the framework spans Products, Enterprises, Enterprise Integration and Strategic Enterprise Management, with the emphasis being on the middle two. The proposal for the architecture follows the architecture itself improving the quality of the presentation and of the outcome. Definitions of <b>Generic</b> Enterprise <b>Reference</b> Architecture, Enterprise Engineering/ Integration Methodology, Enterprise Modelling Languages, Enterprise Models, and Enterprise Modules are given. It is proposed how the above could be developed on the basis of previously an [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Various navigational functions, {{involving}} active safety, {{driver assistance}} and location-based services require data {{that is not}} considered {{to be part of a}} map database and is likely supplied by a vendor other than that of the map provider. Such data needs to be cross-referenced with the entities and attributes of the main database. However, since the auxiliary data is not necessarily compiled with the main database some other means is needed to establish cross-referencing, which is referred to as attaching the auxiliary data. Two common approaches are function-specific <b>referencing</b> tables and <b>generic</b> <b>referencing.</b>|$|R

The game-court concept was popularized by Sport Court in the 1970s, and some <b>generic</b> <b>references</b> are made to game courts as 'sport courts', although that is a trademark of Connor Sport Court International, LLC. Game courts are often found in residential backyards, giving families and children opportunities for healthy recreation close to home.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Role-based programming, {{as in the}} Object Teams/Java (OT/J) language, aims {{to improve}} {{object-oriented}} programming with regard to separation of cross-cutting or context-related concerns. Therefore, OT/J introduces class-like modules for roles and context, which connect common classes to build collaborations. How-ever, since role and base objects are directly linked, it implies strong coupling and limited possibilities of reuse. This research aims to create a generic way of expressing connections between a collaboration and its base {{in order to further}} decouple modules and enhance their reusability. We introduce a quantification mechanism based on logic meta-programming in Prolog that allows using <b>generic</b> <b>references</b> to declaratively de-fined program elements, which are transformed to build valid OT/J code. We propose that the use of logic meta-variables improves the expressiveness and genericity of role-based programming. ...|$|R
