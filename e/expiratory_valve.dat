40|$|Avian lungs {{are remarkably}} {{different}} from mammalian lungs in that air flows unidirectionally through rigid tubes in which gas exchange occurs. Experimental observations {{have been able}} to determine the pattern of gas flow in the respiratory system, but understanding how the flow pattern is generated and determining the factors contributing to the observed dynamics remains elusive. It has been hypothesized that the unidirectional flow is due to aerodynamic valving during inspiration and expiration, resulting from the anatomical structure and the fluid dynamics involved, however, theoretical studies to back up this hypothesis are lacking. We have constructed a novel mathematical model of the airflow in the avian respiratory system that can produce unidirectional flow which is robust to changes in model parameters, breathing frequency and breathing amplitude. The model consists of two piecewise linear ordinary differential equations with lumped parameters and discontinuous, flow-dependent resistances that mimic the experimental observations. Using dynamical systems techniques and numerical analysis, we show that unidirectional flow can be produced by either effective inspiratory or effective <b>expiratory</b> <b>valving,</b> but that both inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> <b>valving</b> are required to produce the high efficiencies of flows observed in avian lungs. We further show that the efficacy of the inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> <b>valving</b> depends on airsac compliances and airflow resistances that may not be located in the immediate area of the valving. Our model provides additional novel insights; for example, we show that physiologically realistic resistance values lead to efficiencies that are close to maximum, and that when the relative lumped compliances of the caudal and cranial airsacs vary, it affects the timing of the airflow across the gas exchange area. These and other insights obtained by our study significantly enhance our understanding of the operation of the avian respiratory system...|$|R

This study aimed to compare the MIP values assessed by standard method (MIPsta) and by unidirectional <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> method (MIPuni) in subjects with spontaneous breathing without artificial airway. MIPuni reproducibility was also evaluated. This was a crossover design study, and 31 subjects performed MIPsta and MIPuni in a random order. MIPsta measured MIP maintaining negative pressure for at least one second after forceful expiration. MIPuni evaluated MIP using a unidirectional <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> attached to a face mask and was conducted by two evaluators (A and B) at two moments (Tests 1 and 2) to determine interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of MIP values. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC[2, 1]) was used to determine intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility.

40|$|SINCE the T-piece {{technique}} was first described {{nearly twenty years}} ago (Ayre, 1937) various criticisms and modifications have been suggested from time to time, and the present moment may be opportune for a brief appraisal of the situation before the essential simplicity of the original technique becomes irretrievably lost in a tangled web of <b>expiratory</b> <b>valves</b> and corrugated tubing. Primarily intended for endotracheal anaesthesia of infants and young children undergoing operation for the repair of hare-lip and cleft palate, the T-piece (fig. 1) consists of a light metal tube 1 cm in diameter, into which nitrous oxide-oxygen supplemented by minimal ether is "injected " through a small inlet tube {{at right angles to}} the main limb. One end of the T-piece is connected to the endo-tracheal tube, while the other end is left open to the air: a length of rubber tubing attached to the open end constitutes a small reservoir for the anaesthetic gases, most of which would otherwise escape into the outside air. The internal diameter of the reservoir tube should be 1 cm (area of cross-section 0. 78 sq. cm), so that each inch in length will have a capacity of approximately 2 ml. For adults, a slightly larger tube may be used with an internal diameter of li cm and a capacity of 3 ml per inch (2. 5 cm) in length. There is no practical advantage in exceeding 520 these measurements, and corrugated rubber tubing should not be used as a reservoir tube because of the greatly increased "dead space " present...|$|R

RESULTS: All the studied ventilators with a single-limb circuit with intentional leak (n =  5) were able to maintain the minimal preset VT during unintentional leaks.

ObjectiveTo investigate the effects of expiratory training on lung function, exercise tolerance, symptoms and health-related quality of life in severe COPD patients. MethodsSixteen patients (FEV 1, 28 ± 8 % pred.) were randomised to either expiratory muscle or sham training groups, both completing a 5 -week programme (30 min sessions breathing through an <b>expiratory</b> threshold <b>valve</b> 3 times per week) (50 % of their maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) vs. placebo, respectively).

ResultsAlthough lung function remained roughly unchanged after training, exercise capacity, symptoms and quality of life significantly improved. The improvement in both walking distance and the SGRQ score significantly correlated with changes in MEP. ConclusionOur results confirm that a short outpatient programme of expiratory training can improve symptoms and quality of life in severe COPD patients.

40|$|Background. Respiratory failure {{associated}} with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE) characterizes an important subgroup {{of patients with}} treatment difficulties. These patients when receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) via helmet, experienced more effective output {{with respect to the}} single therapy. Objectives. To evaluate the clinical application of NPPV in ACPE complicated by respiratory effort (RE) hospitalized in ICCU. Population. From January to June 2010, 28 ACPE complicated by RE have been treated with medical therapy and NPPV via helmet. RE is defined by a D-pCO 2 > 2 mmHg value at the entry. D-pCO 2 is the difference between pCO 2 measured and awaited (pCO 2 awaited = 1. 5 *HCO 3 + 8). Intervention. The helmet is made of transparent latex-free PVC. The helmet is secured by two armpit breces at two hooks on the metallic ring that joins the helmet with a soft collar. The pressure increase during ventilation makes the soft collar seal comfortably to the neck and the shoulders, avoiding air leakage. The two ports of the helmet act as inlet and outlet of the gas flow. the inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> <b>valves</b> are those of mechanical ventilator. Patients with cardiogenic shock, chronic respiratory failure (CRF), anaemia, and other not cardiac causes of dyspnea have been excluded. Initial ventilatory settings were continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode, 5 cm H 2 O, with pressure support ventilation of 10 to 20 cm H 2 O titrated to achieve a respiratory rate less than 25 breaths/min and an exhaled tidal volume of 7 mL/kg or more. Ventilator settings were adjusted following arterial blood gases (ABG) results. Results. Failure to improve ABG values was the reason for ETI in 2 patients (7 %). One patient has died during treatment (3. 5 %). two patients did not tolerate the helmet (7 %). No complications developed {{for the use of the}} helmet. The average duration of NPPV was 27 ± 12 h. After 12 hours of the NINV in these patients has determined an improvement of the cardiac frequency from 109 ± 16 to 81 ± 12 (p= 0. 002), respiratory frequency from 38 ± 6 to 19 ± 3 (p= 0. 002). Arterial blood saturation increased from 74 %± 14 to 96 %± 5 (p< 0. 0001), pH from 7. 21 ± 0. 10 to 7. 40 ± 0. 09 (p= 0. 001), pO 2 from 52 ± 16 to 100 ± 31 (p< 0. 001) as well, while pCO 2 decreased from 66 ± 17 to 41 ± 10 (p= 0. 02). Significant variations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure where not reported. Conclusions. In patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, noninvasive ventilation induces a more rapid improvement in respiratory distress and metabolic disturbance than does standard oxygen therapy, has no effect on short-term mortality. The application of NPPV in clinical practice in ICCU is a cardiologist’s effective and safe alternative to ETI for a patients affected by respiratory failure {{associated with}} ACPE. 158 S...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{positive}} end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for {{the mechanical}} ventilation of small animals is frequently obtained with water seals or by using ventilators developed for human use.

Methods: The proposed PEEP controller is a discrete integrator monitoring the error between the target PEEP and the airways opening pressure prior to the onset of an inspiratory cycle. In vitro as well as in vivo experiments with rats were carried out and the PEEP accuracy, settling time and under/overshoot were considered as a measure of performance.

40|$|The lungs {{of birds}} {{have long been}} known to move air in only one {{direction}} during both inspiration and expiration {{through most of the}} tubular gas-exchanging bronchi (parabronchi). Recently a similar pattern of airflow has been observed in American alligators, a sister taxon to birds. The pattern of flow appears to be due to the arrangement of the primary and secondary bronchi, which, via their branching angles, generate inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> aerodynamic <b>valves.</b> Both the anatomical similarity of the avian and alligator lung and the similarity in the patterns of airflow raise the possibility that these features are plesiomorphic for Archosauria and therefore did not evolve in response to selection for flapping flight or an endothermic metabolism, as has been generally assumed. To further test the hypothesis that unidirectional airflow is ancestral for Archosauria, we measured airflow in the lungs of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). As in birds and alligators, air flows cranially to caudally in the cervical ventral bronchus, and caudally to cranially in the dorsobronchi in the lungs of Nile crocodiles. We also visualized the gross anatomy of the primary, secondary and tertiary pulmonary bronchi of C. niloticus using computed tomography (CT) and microCT. The cervical ventral bronchus, cranial dorsobronchi and cranial medial bronchi display similar characteristics to their proposed homologues in the alligator, while there is considerable variation in the tertiary and caudal group bronchi.

40|$|A {{breathing}} system {{is defined as}} an assembly of components, which delivers gases from the anesthesia machine to the patients′ airways. When the components are arranged as a circle, it is termed a circle system. The flow of exhaled gases is unidirectional in the system. The system contains a component (absorber), which absorbs exhaled carbon dioxide {{and it is not}} necessary to give high fresh gas flows as in Mapleson systems. When the adjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve is closed and all the exhaled gases without carbon dioxide are returned to the patient, the system becomes a totally closed one. Such a circle system can be used with flows as low as 250 to 500 mL and clinically can be termed as low-flow systems. The components of the circle system can be arranged in different ways with adherence to basic rules: (1) Unidirectional valve must be present between the reservoir bag and the patient on both inspiratory and expiratory sides; (2) fresh gas must not enter the system between the <b>expiratory</b> unidirectional <b>valve</b> and the patient; and (3) the APL valve must not be placed between the patient and the inspiratory unidirectional valve. The functional analysis is explained in detail. During the function, the arrangement of components is significant only at higher fresh gas flows. With the introduction of low resistance valves, improved soda lime canisters and low dead space connectors, the use of less complicated pediatric circle systems is gaining popularity to anesthetize children. There are bidirectional flow systems with carbon dioxide absorption.

Crisis-oriented events such as natural disasters, acts of bioterroism, and industrial accidents, have been reported to impact memory. Patient safety is a primary focus in anesthesia education, appropriate crisis management is imperative to quality anesthesia care. Due to the critical nature of anesthesia delivery, there is a strong, constant need to develop methods that will enhance, support, and improve current anesthesia practices that impact patient safety. Educational methodologies used by both clinical and didactic instructors that will improve teaching effectiveness need to be investigated to ensure that patient safety content is being delivered to nurse anesthesia students {{in a manner consistent with}} the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANAs) Council on Accreditation 2 ̆ 7 s COAs) standards of care. Utilizing a simulated anesthesia crisis situation, this study compared the differences in cognitive imprinting and application to practice between two content delivery methods, the written case study and patient safety vignettes, in nurse anesthesia students. The control group was given a written case study which is considered a traditional method of content delivery. The treatment groups studied vignettes, which are short, realistic, simulated audio-visual videos that demonstrate content to be relayed. The research hypothesis studied the use of anesthesia crisis oriented vignettes as an educational tool to impact memory recall, thus potentially improving application to clinical practice. Hypotheses for the study were: Hypothesis 1 (Hl) : Student anesthetists exposed to audio-visual vignettes will exhibit superior clinical performance during simulated apparatus-related crisis events, evidenced by higher group mean demonstration scores, when compared to a matched group exposed to written case studies. Hypothesis 2 (H 2) : Student anesthetists exposed to audio-visual vignettes will exhibit superior recall of apparatus related material, evidenced by higher group mean post-test scores, when compared to a matched group exposed to written case studies. Using the paired samples t-test and analysis of variance procedure (ANOVA), statistical findings were evaluated for significance. The different teaching methodologies were represented in the abbreviation of the variables studied. Two different crisis oriented events were presented in vignette format, a malfunctioning unidirectional <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> and a malfunctioning suctioning apparatus. Variables that were studied include: clinical performance during the anesthesia machine checkout process by recreating the stuck <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> and malfunctioning suction apparatus scenarios. Statistically, mixed results were obtained. The impact that the stuck <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> vignette had on student recall and clinical performance was found to be insignificant. The impact resulting from exposure to the non-functioning suction apparatus vignette was found to be significant for both student recall and clinical performance. Other recall and clinical performance measures related to the non- functioning suction apparatus were also found to be significant. Conclusions: In this research study, memory and clinical performance were impacted when the anesthesia provider incorporated the correct anesthesia apparatus checkout process and crisis management skills into their practice. This research demonstrated that under the conditions of this study, teaching methodology impacted some areas of clinical performance. Due to the small sample size and because the clinical performance measurements tools were newly designed for this particular study, findings from this study cannot be generalized to any other group or population. However, the findings from this study merit further investigation into the potential use of vignettes as an educational methodology to impact clinical practice and improve patient safety...|$|E

We investigated if the sensitivity of the positive end <b>expiratory</b> pressure (PEEP) <b>valve</b> varies at different flow rates within this range. METHODS: Five Neopuffs were set up to provide a PEEP of 5 cm H(2) O. The number of clockwise revolutions to complete occlusion of the PEEP valve and the mean and range of pressures at each quarter clockwise revolution were recorded at gas flow rates between 5 and 15 L/min. Results: At 5, 10 and 15 L/min, 0. 5, 1. 7 and 3. 4 full clockwise rotations were required to completely occlude the PEEP valve, and pressures rose from 5 to 11. 4, 18. 4 and 21. 5 cm H(2) O, respectively. At a flow rate of 5 L/min, half a rotation of the PEEP dial resulted in a rise in PEEP from 5 to 11. 4 cm H(2) O. At 10 L/min, half a rotation resulted in a rise from 5 to 7. 7 cm H(2) O, and at 15 L/min PEEP rose from 5 to 6. 8 cm H(2) O.

Analysis of these fluctuations might be useful clinically if they represent physiologic perturbations resulting from airway obstruction. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} severity of airway obstruction could be estimated using plethysmograph waveform data. Methods Using a closed airway circuit with adjustable inspiratory and <b>expiratory</b> pressure relief <b>valves,</b> airway obstruction was induced in a prospective convenience sample of 31 healthy adult subjects. Maximal change in airway pressure at the mouthpiece was used as a surrogate measure of the degree of obstruction applied. Plethysmograph waveform data and mouthpiece airway pressure were acquired for 60 seconds at increasing levels of inspiratory and expiratory obstruction. At each level of applied obstruction, mean values for maximal change in waveform area under the curve and height as well as maximal change in mouth pressure were calculated for sequential 7. 5 second intervals. Correlations of these waveform variables with mouth pressure values were then performed to determine if the magnitude of changes in these variables indicates the severity of airway obstruction. Results There were significant relationships between maximal change in area under the curve (P Conclusion The findings suggest that mathematic interpretation of plethysmograph waveform data may estimate the severity of airway obstruction and be of clinical utility in objective assessment of patients with obstructive airway diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{effectiveness}} of Provent, an <b>expiratory</b> nasal resistance <b>valve,</b> to prevent the recurrence of OSA following CPAP withdrawal. DESIGN: Randomised, partially blinded, parallel, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient sleep clinics in the UK (Oxford) and Switzerland (Zurich). PARTICIPANTS: 67 patients with OSA receiving CPAP were randomised to one of three groups for 2 weeks: continuing CPAP, Provent or placebo Provent. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included for Provent versus placebo Provent, OSA severity (oxygen desaturation index (ODI), apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score. Secondary outcomes for Provent versus placebo Provent included ODI from ambulatory pulse oximetry and blood pressure (BP). For CPAP versus Provent, or CPAP versus placebo Provent, secondary outcomes included ODI/AHI, ESS and BP. RESULTS: 63 patients were included in the per protocol analysis. OSA recurred in the Provent (ODI 35. 8, SD 17. 4) and placebo Provent (ODI 28. 2, SD 18. 3) groups, and there was no significant difference in ODI, AHI and ESS between Provent and placebo Provent at 2 weeks (mean difference ODI - 1. 0, 95 % CI - 10. 0 to + 12. 0, p= 0. 85; AHI + 3. 2, 95 % CI - 7. 7 to + 14. 1, p= 0. 52; and ESS - 1. 4, 95 % CI - 4. 1 to + 1. 4, p= 0. 33). ODI from ambulatory pulse-oximetry and BP at 2 weeks were not different in the Provent versus placebo Provent groups. ODI, AHI and BP, but not ESS, were significantly higher in the Provent and placebo Provent groups compared with CPAP. CONCLUSIONS: Provent cannot be recommended as an alternative short-term therapy for patients with moderate to severe OSA already on CPAP. TRIALREGNO: NCT 01332175...|$|R
30|$|When PEEP is {{stepwise}} increased, {{the ventilator}} <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> is closing at the selected, new PEEP level {{during the first}} expiration after increasing PEEP, and a volume corresponding to total respiratory system compliance times the change in PEEP is retained in the lung (Fig.  3). As long as this first expiration lung volume increase does not cause the end-expiratory lung volume to exceed the chest wall resting volume at 70 – 80  % of TLC, the end-expiratory pleural pressure will be negative when the <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> closes (Figs.  3 and 7), indicating that the rib cage spring-out force is active. During the ensuing breaths, the end-expiratory lung volume increases breath by breath and the end-expiratory pleural pressure subsides back to or close to the baseline negative pleural pressure level and a new P/V equilibrium is reached. PEEP inflation of the lung is a pressure control inflation of the lung with constant airway pressure, and end-expiratory airway pressure {{is the sum of}} end-expiratory transpulmonary and end-expiratory pleural pressure. As end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure increases breath by breath, when the end-expiratory lung volume increases breath by breath, end-expiratory pleural pressure must decrease after the initial first expiration increase, as much as the transpulmonary pressure increases (Fig.  3). If the chest wall behaved as an elastic entity recoiling to a lower volume like the lung, end-expiratory chest wall elastance, ΔPPLEE/ΔEELV, would be equal to tidal chest wall elastance, ΔPPL/VT, like end-expiratory lung elastance, ΔPTPEE/ΔEELV, is equal to tidal lung elastance ΔPTP/VT. Consequently, total end-expiratory elastance would be the sum of tidal chest wall and tidal lung elastance, total respiratory system elastance (ETOT)[*]=[*]ΔPPL/VT[*]+[*]ΔPTP/VT and the change in end-expiratory lung volume change following a PEEP increase could not exceed the change in PEEP (=ΔPAWEE) divided by the total respiratory system elastance, ΔPEEP/ETOT. However, such a low change in end-expiratory lung volume is only present in isolated lung, where total respiratory system elastance is the same as lung elastance, as seen when ventilating isolated test lungs in the model (Fig.  2). In patients, the change in end-expiratory lung volume is always larger than ΔPEEP/ETOT, except in isolated lung, as reported in multiple studies [20, 21, 22, 27] and determined {{by the size of the}} PEEP step and lung elastance, ΔEELV[*]=[*]P ΔPEEP/EL, as seen in the model and in accordance with findings in previous studies in pigs and acute lung injury (ALI) patients [8, 9].|$|E
40|$|Development of {{dry powder}} {{inhalation}} (DPI) for horses requires {{the use of}} an adapted face mask. In experiment I, 4 masks (A, B, C and D) were tested and factors influencing the delivery of the dry powder were determined. Mask A was one which is commercially available for metered-dose inhalation. Mask B had the same shape as Mask A but an airtight rubber seal was added for the connection between the mask and horse's head. Mask C was a prototype adapted for DPI with connection for the DPI device between the nostrils, airtight expiratory valves in front of each nostril and airtight rubber seal to attach the mask on the horse's head. Mask D was the same as Mask C but the airtight <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> was situated in front of one nostril and the connection for the DPI device was placed {{in front of the other}} nostril. Inhalet emptying and peak inspiratory pressure were measured on 5 healthy horses with each face mask. Both Masks A and B gave a low rate of inhalet emptying. Inspiratory pressures created in Masks C and D were negative enough to ensure inhalet emptying rates of mean +/- s. d. 98. 28 +/- 1. 79 % and 100 % respectively. In experiment 2, the face masks giving the greatest inhalet emptying were used to test the therapeutic efficacy of ipratropium bromide DPI. This was tested on 6 horses suffering from acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At a dose of 200 micrograms/ 100 kg bwt, ipratropium administered with Mask D improved significantly pulmonary function measurements compared to baseline values and placebo inhalation. With Mask C, a double dose of ipratropium (400 micrograms/ 100 kg bwt) was necessary to improve these parameters compared to baseline values. This indicated the importance of locating the DPI device in front of one nostril. It was concluded that inhalet emptying is correlated to inspiratory pressures measured in the face masks. Secondly, these pressures are in turn dependent on the air-tightness of the mask, i. e. air-tightness of the <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> and close connection between the horse's head and the mask. Thirdly, position of the DPI device in front of a nostril allows bronchodilation at a dose half that required when the device is placed between the nostrils. Finally DPI using Mask D (EquiPoudre) is a rapid, effective and well tolerated inhalation treatment for COPD horses. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{compact and}} {{lightweight}} device for coupling active scavenging systems to shrouded breathing system valves is described. Provided a scavenging minute flow rate greater than the expired gas volume is available, the unit can handle automatically changes in both variables. Optimal function is achieved with scavenging flows from about twice the discharged gas flow to about 50 litre mm" 1 At these flows the valve can accommodate the outflow of gas-dnven ventilators where driving gas and circuit gas are discharged through the same port There is no interference with <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> function {{in the event of}} scavenging failure The valve described appears to be the most compact, simplest and easiest to use of those currently available for coupling active scavenging systems to shrouded expiratory valves. The model tested is manufactured as a lightweight poly-carbonate moulding and needs no adjustment. This flow meter was found to be accurate at the subatmospheric pressures used. The design is based on a circular body in which two lightly loaded disc valves A and B are held against knife-edge seats by a common spring (fig. 1). The two seats are of differing diameter...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ventilator exhalation-valve {{performance}} during the expiratory phase has been stud-ied in depth. An active exhalation valve uses servo-control technology that allows gas {{to be released}} from the exhalation valve during the inspiratory phase if the patient makes an expiratory effort. We con-ducted a bench study of active exhalation <b>valve</b> response to <b>expiratory</b> effort during the inspiratory phase. METHODS: We studied 4 ventilators that have active exhalation valves (Maquet Servo-i, New-port e 500, Puritan Bennett 840, and Evita XL) and one that does not (Puritan Bennett 7200 ae). With an active test lung we simulated various magnitudes of expiratory effort {{during the middle of the}} inspira-tory phase. We measured the exhalation resistance and pressure over-shoot during the expiratory effort, and we measured the pressure under-shoot after the expiratory effort. The exhalation resistance of the 7200 ae could not be determined because this ventilator did not allow any gas-release through the exhalation <b>valve</b> during the <b>expiratory</b> effort. RESULTS: The exhalation resistance of the Evita XL (6. 61. 8 cm H 2 O/L/s) was higher than that of the Servo-i (3. 01. 3 cm H 2 O/L/s), e 500 (2. 60. 8 cm H 2 O/ L/s), and 840 (3. 5 0. 8 cm H 2 O/L/s) (all P <. 001). The magnitude of pressure over-shoot during the expiratory efforts was not significantly different among the 4 ventilators with active exhalation valves. Pressure over-shoot was significantly higher with the 7200 ae than with any of other ventilators (all P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in exhalation resistance between the Evita XL and the other 3 ventilators with active exhalation valves. All 4 ventilators with active exha-lation valves had lower exhalation resistance than the 7200 ae.

40|$|Background:The {{positive}} end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for {{the mechanical}} ventilation of small animals is frequently obtained with water seals or by using ventilators developed for human use. An alternative mechanism {{is the use}} of an on-off <b>expiratory</b> <b>valve</b> closing at the moment when the alveolar pressure is equal to the target PEEP. In this paper, a novel PEEP controller (PEEP-new) and the PEEP system of a commercial small-animal ventilator, both based on switching an on-off valve, are evaluated. Methods:The proposed PEEP controller is a discrete integrator monitoring the error between the target PEEP and the airways opening pressure prior to the onset of an inspiratory cycle. In vitro as well as in vivo experiments with rats were carried out and the PEEP accuracy, settling time and under/overshoot were considered as a measure of performance. Results:The commercial PEEP controller did not pass the tests since it ignores the airways resistive pressure drop, resulting in a PEEP 5 cmH 2 O greater than the target in most conditions. The PEEP-new presented steady-state errors smaller than 0. 5 cmH 2 O, with settling times below 10 s and under/overshoot smaller than 2 cmH 2 O. Conclusion:The PEEP-new presented acceptable performance, considering accuracy and temporal response.
