5|$|Every time Lennon's assassin Mark David Chapman has {{a parole}} hearing – which is {{mandated}} by law {{every two years}} – Ono has come out strongly against his release from prison. She is the widow of the victim, and <b>her</b> <b>opinion</b> has a strong influence on the parole board's decision to keep Chapman behind bars.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, she {{returned}} to her work on the report. She controversially published findings that held that the time period between two occupational levels, Level II (preceding Babylonian conquest by Nebuchadnezzar) and Level III (preceding Assyrian conquest by Sennacherib) was likely to be in the range of 100 years, rather than a decade, as Starkey had suggested. Although the majority held that Starkey's interpretation was more likely, in 1973 subsequent excavations vindicated <b>her</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

5000|$|To sum up, voter [...] faces a {{strategic}} voting dilemma: {{depending on the}} ballots that the other voters will cast, [...] or [...] can be a ballot that best defends <b>her</b> <b>opinions.</b> We then say that approval voting is not straightforward : once the voter has identified her own preferences, {{she does not have}} a ballot at her disposal that best defends <b>her</b> <b>opinions</b> in all situations.|$|R

5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{it is more likely that}} the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although Stowe {{describes}} Minnah and Judy {{with some}} tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave {{owned by the}} captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues {{to work for him}} following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river as well as the houses and sites along the banks, and their histories. Her knowledge of the ship and its guests is unparalleled, and all the crew and guests revere <b>her</b> <b>opinion</b> in all matters.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E

5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes <b>her</b> <b>opinion</b> known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E
5|$|Intrigued by the article, Valiente wrote {{a letter}} to Williamson in 1952, who in turn put her in contact with Gardner. Valiente and Gardner wrote several letters back-and-forth, with the latter {{eventually}} suggesting that she meet him at the home of his friend and fellow Wiccan Edith Woodford-Grimes ("Dafo"), who lived not far from Bournemouth, in the Christchurch area. Before she left the meeting, Gardner gave her a copy of his 1949 novel, High Magic's Aid, in which he describes a fictionalised account of Wiccan initiates in the Middle Ages; he allegedly did so in order to gauge <b>her</b> <b>opinion</b> on ritual nudity and scourging, both of which were present in his tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the same}} time during the kidney crisis, United States President Barack Obama has decided to visit Quahog, and Chris' entire English class is {{assigned}} to write an essay about hope. He consults his sister Meg for <b>her</b> <b>opinion</b> and she lists her personal opinion on the subject, which Chris plagiarizes. Meg is angered that he has decided to take her words and call them his own, but she is eventually given credit for co-writing the speech, and she and Chris introduce Obama to the school. President Obama then enters the school's auditorium, and begins singing and playing the guitar as students swoon over his performance.|$|E

5|$|Barbara Bell, another scholar, {{believes}} that an economic catastrophe {{such as a}} famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better {{address the problem of}} feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in <b>her</b> <b>opinion,</b> the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and <b>her</b> <b>opinion</b> of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E
