Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites.

5|$|Aerobatic {{competitions}} {{take place}} for both powered aircraft and gliders, {{with up to}} 30 events {{each year in the}} UK and Ireland. Starting at the Beginner level, pilots can move up to Standard (powered aircraft) or Sports (glider) levels, and then on to Intermediate, Advanced, and finally Unlimited classes. Each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic <b>figures</b> <b>and</b> progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (powered aircraft only), and Unlimited levels, and pilots who have reached Advanced and Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.|$|E
5|$|After {{the novel}} was published, it caused {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried the novel for not explaining their ideologies in more detail, but literary <b>figures</b> <b>and</b> {{many in the}} general public praised it; this positive reception may {{have been influenced by}} the nascent government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. The novel, which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, is one of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E

Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E
