5|$|Micro Machines is a {{top-down}} racing game: players observe races from above. Players race in environments such as {{breakfast and}} pool tables, work desks, and treehouses, driving toy vehicles such as powerboats, helicopters, formula one cars, and tanks that can shoot other racers. Courses have a predefined path that racers must follow: {{if a player}} leaves the <b>defined</b> <b>route</b> for too long they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and pencil sharpeners on desks.|$|E
5|$|The California State Legislature <b>defined</b> <b>Route</b> 26 as a {{route from}} Lucerne Valley to Morongo Valley in 1959. SR 247 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering as a route from SR 62 in Yucca Valley to SR 18 near Lucerne Valley, {{and then from}} there to I-15 in Barstow. That year, the Lucerne Valley Chamber of Commerce began an effort to have a state highway designated from Lucerne Valley to Yucca Valley along Old Woman Springs Road. By 1969, county roads had been constructed from Barstow to Lucerne Valley, {{and from there to}} Yucca Valley. Barstow Road and Old Woman Springs Road were given to the state by San Bernardino County in 1972, although the county had agreed to perform some improvements on the two roads after the state began to maintain them.|$|E

The nullah mentioned above, had steep banks and passed within 60 yards of the fort; the aqueduct from Bhingar passed under it.

In some caves, changes of depth of the cave along the dive route will constrain decompression depths, and gas mixtures and decompression schedules can be tailored to take this into account.|$|E

50|$|RNAV {{systems may}} provide the {{capability}} for the flight crew to specify a lateral offset from a <b>defined</b> <b>route.</b> Generally, lateral offsets can be specified in increments of 1 NM up to 20 NM. When a lateral offset is activated in the RNAV system, the RNAV aircraft will depart the <b>defined</b> <b>route</b> and typically intercept the offset at a 45° or less angle. When the offset is cancelled, the aircraft returns to the <b>defined</b> <b>route</b> in a similar manner. Such offsets can be used both strategically i.e. fixed offset {{for the length of}} the route, or tactically i.e. temporarily. Most RNAV systems discontinue offsets in the terminal area or at the beginning of an approach procedure, at an RNAV hold, or during course changes of 90° or greater.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{route that}} leads to the cirque which is very busy with {{tourists}} and mountaineers, particularly in the summer.

From here, the path descends south until reaching the Laguna Grande (or great lake) de Gredos, and the refuge Elola.|$|E

40|$|A {{point in}} a {{transport}} network plays many roles. The Point pattern provides a flexible structure that decouples a point's role from the point itself and supports multiple concurrent roles. Points (or the links between points) are used to <b>define</b> <b>routes.</b> A route is a path through an ordered sequence of points (or links) in a transport network. A route may build upon different layers of components. The Route pattern provides a consistent tree structure for layering and ordering the route components. Route can cope with many variations in <b>defining</b> <b>routes</b> and allows clients to treat all objects used for route definition uniformly. Point and Route are patterns in PLOTS, a pattern language for building transport systems. This paper shows how Point and Route provide a design solution for describing the spatial structure of a transport network, and how they interact with other patterns in PLOTS. 1. Introduction PLOTS is a pattern language for building transport systems. The PLOTS language is a [...] ...|$|R
50|$|As legislatively <b>defined,</b> <b>Route</b> 61 extends as {{far north}} as Albany and as far south as the Dumbarton Bridge's east approach. Only the portion between Routes 260 and 112 is constructed; the unbuilt {{remainder}} of the route exists today either as open San Francisco Bay or wetlands. This route would likely have sat atop landfill; as public opinion shifted against filling in the bay, completing the remaining portions of Route 61 also fell out of favor. Route 87 is another highway once proposed to traverse present-day wetlands and open water.|$|E

There peaks are open for climbing, where climbers {{are not required to}} book permits with or pay royalties to the Indian Mountaineering Foundation. Although some peaks are located in inner line, meaning close to border thus due to security reason, permissions and permits may be required from local civil or army authorities. Also, some peaks may be out of reach from foreign climbers.|$|E

When a target is seen the diver will disconnect the board and send up a marker buoy, which will indicate the position of the target and the diver, allowing the boat to approach with caution while the diver ascends. The search pattern is controlled by the skipper of the boat, and may follow a GPS <b>defined</b> <b>route.</b> If the visibility is good enough or the water shallow, the divers can search while towed at the surface.|$|E
