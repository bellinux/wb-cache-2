The legislation makes <b>eligible</b> <b>projects</b> over $300,000 in production costs to receive up to 25% reimbursement up to $5 million and 35% for locally employing. The legislation resulted in 9 movies filmed or planned in northeast Ohio alone in 2010, resulting $9.46 million in wages for 3700 local employees, with an economic impact of $24.3 million for local businesses. In 2010 expenditures on film in the state were estimated to total over $31 million, filming in locations that include Akron and Cincinnati also.

[...] Detailed measures were introduced to deal with market complexities, windfall profits, and the incentives for innovation and cost reduction. [...] <b>Eligible</b> <b>projects</b> may no longer degrade ecologically sensitive areas. [...] Exemptions for industry from the EEG surcharge under the special equalization scheme were extended considerably. [...] The minimum electricity consumption requirement was reduced to 10GWh/a, the share of electricity costs relative to gross value added was reduced to 15%, and the impairment of competitiveness criteria was removed altogether.

40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised among the {{scientific}} communities about the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Carbon sequestration rates can be maintained or increased by afforestation, reforestation, avoided deforestation, forest preservation and particular tending and cultural operations on existing forests. Of these, afforestation and reforestation are the only <b>eligible</b> <b>project</b> activities under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Of the three market-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol (KP), CDM {{is the only one}} designed for developing countries where, coincidently, community based forest management systems (CBFMS) are becoming the main form of forest management. Under these systems, enhanced natural regeneration, forest preservation and wise utilization through different sets of cultural and tending operations are widely practiced in Africa, Asia and Latin America. These systems are often more compatible with the essence of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) than are alternative management systems. Using Nepal as a case study, this paper highlights the importance of community forests in developing countries and then explains why many of them may not be <b>eligible</b> for CDM <b>project</b> activities.

40|$|This report {{describes}} Pacific Northwest Laboratory`s (PNL`s) {{evaluation of}} the impact of an energy conservation project completed in the fall of 1992. The project (a mill tailings thickener) was installed at J. R. Simplot Company`s (Simplot`s) Smoky Canyon Mine in Caribou County, Idaho near Afton, Wyoming. The project at Simplot is one in a continuing series of industrial energy conservation projects to have its impact evaluated by PNL. All of the projects have received or will receive acquisition payments from the Bonneville Power Administration (Bonneville) under the Energy $avings Plan (E$P) Program. The E$P is being offered to reduce electricity consumption in the industrial sector of Bonneville`s service territory. For the Simplot project, the acquisition payment offered under the program was equal to the lesser of 10 {cents}/kilowatt-hour (kWh) saved in the first year or 80 % of <b>eligible</b> <b>project</b> costs, up to a limit of $ 250, 000.
