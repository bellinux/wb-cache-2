5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E

5|$|In January 1942, the Germans {{estimated}} at the Wannsee Conference that Albania was inhabited by 200 Jews. That same month, Jews were interned by the Italians at a camp in Pristina. Though they feared {{they would be}} {{handed over to the}} Germans, the Italian commander of the camp promised them that this would never <b>happen.</b> <b>On</b> 14 March 1942, the Italians blockaded the camp and arrested the Jews that had been detained there. Some were handed over to the Germans and transported to the Sajmište concentration camp, near Belgrade, where they were killed. Others, together with Serbs, were taken to the camp in Berat, where they were detained until Italy's capitulation. It is estimated that as many as 500 Jews were interned in the camps in Berat, Krujë and Kavajë during the Italian occupation.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E

5|$|With {{almost four}} years gone in his government's five-year term, in mid-1939 Mackenzie King {{considered}} an election and asked British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in early August if he thought anything was likely to <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> the international scene.

5|$|Title reigns are {{determined}} either by professional wrestling matches between wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines, or by scripted circumstances. Wrestlers {{are portrayed as}} either villains or heroes as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches for the championship. Title changes that <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> episodes of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, air on television two to nine days from the date the match was taped. Changes that happened on weekly PPV events aired either during a live broadcast or aired on taped delay up to seven days apart. The inaugural champion was A.J. Styles, who defeated Low Ki, Jerry Lynn, and Psicosis in a Four Way Double Elimination match on June 19, 2002 at the taping of TNA's second weekly PPV event, which aired on June 26, 2002. Chris Sabin currently holds {{the record for the}} most reigns, with eight. At 301 days, Austin Aries' first reign is the longest in the title's history.
