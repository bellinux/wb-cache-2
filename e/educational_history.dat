40|$|This paper investigates {{how well}} imputed <b>educational</b> <b>histories</b> {{perform in the}} {{analysis}} of first birth rates in the West German context. The focus here is on the quality of estimates when only rudimentary information on the timing of education is available. In many surveys, information on respondents’ <b>educational</b> <b>histories</b> is restricted to the highest level of educational attained by the time of interview and the date at which this highest degree was attained. Skeleton <b>educational</b> <b>histories</b> can be imputed simply from such rudimentary information. The German Life History Study has complete <b>educational</b> <b>histories.</b> We use these to compare estimates based on the complete histories with estimates based on corresponding imputed histories. We find that the imputed histories produce relatively reliable estimates of the effect on first-birth rates of having a university degree vs. having a vocational certificate. Estimating corresponding rates for women who have no such education proved to cause greater difficulties. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{institution}} itself left {{a mark on}} Romanian <b>educational</b> <b>history,</b> {{being seen}} as a model school {{in the field of}} private enterprise. It remains primarily noted for its contribution in Humanities, which were assigned to Maiorescu. Constantin Meissner, the dedicated student and future Junimist pedagogue, recalled: [...] "we [...] found ourselves speaking, gesticulating, moving our heads just like our precious model [...]" [...] Another former student, and later teacher at the Institute, was scholar A. D. Xenopol. He describes his alma mater as [...] "an eminent private school", and Melik as one of the [...] "leading professorial forces" [...] in Moldavia; he also credits Melik's [...] "complete and measured exactitude" [...] as influential for his own work ethic. According to Xenopol, Melik's refusal to tolerate staff truancy earned him a reputation as a strict colleague. Referencing an Armenian stereotype, the other Junimists began calling Melik a mindirigiu ("quilter") of their absences.|$|E

60|$|But, on {{the other}} hand, the schools of the modern period have {{developed}} masses of instruction that {{were not to be}} found in the schools of the past. The school has reached downward and taken over, systematized, and on the whole, I think, improved that preliminary training of the senses and the observation that was once left to the spontaneous activity of the child among its playmates and at home. The kindergarten department of a school is a thing added to the old conception of schooling, a conversion of the all too ample school hours to complete and rectify the work of the home, to make sure of the foundation of sense impressions and elementary capabilities upon which the edifice of schooling is to rise. In America it has grown, as a wild flower transferred to the unaccustomed richness of garden soil will sometimes do, rankly and in relation to the more essential schooling, aggressively, and become a highly vigorous and picturesque weed. One must bear in mind that Froebel's original thought was rather of the mother than of the schoolmistress, a fact the kindergarten invaders of the school find it convenient to forget. I believe we shall be carrying out his intentions as well as the manifest dictates of common sense if we do all in our power by means of simply and clearly written books for nurses and mothers to shift very much of the kindergarten back to home and playroom and out of the school altogether. Correlated with this development, there has been a very great growth in our schools of what is called manual training and of the teaching of drawing. Neither of these subjects entered into the school idea of any former period, so far as my not very extensive knowledge of <b>educational</b> <b>history</b> goes.|$|E
