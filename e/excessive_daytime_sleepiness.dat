40|$|First online: 26 November 2015 Background: Managing pain in {{residents}} of residential aged care facilities (RACFs) is challenging, especially {{for people with}} dementia. Clinicians must weigh the benefits of analgesic use against the potential for adverse events, particularly <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> Objectives: The aim {{was to investigate the}} association between analgesic use and <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> in residents with and without dementia in RACFs. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 383 permanent residents from six low-level and high-level RACFs in South Australia. Main measures included analgesic use in the previous 24 h, analgesic load and self-reported <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> Covariates included relevant comorbidities (insomnia, depression, painful conditions), Charlson’s Comorbidity Index, sedative load, self-reported and clinician-observed pain and dementia severity. Logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between analgesic use and <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> Results: Analgesics were used by 288 residents (75. 2 %) in the previous 24 h. These included paracetamol (n = 264, 68. 9 %), opioids (n = 110, 28. 7 %) and oral NSAIDs (n = 14, 3. 7 %). Overall, 116 (30. 3 %) residents were categorized as having <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> Of those with dementia, 77 (45. 6 %) were categorized as having <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> Opioid use in the previous 24 h was not associated with <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Paracetamol use was positively associated with <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> (OR 2. 31; 95 % CI 1. 20 – 4. 42). Conclusion: Although <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> occurred in a large number of residents, especially those with dementia, this sleepiness was not necessarily associated with use of opioids. The risk of opioid-induced sedation may have been managed by strategies including preferential prescribing of paracetamol to residents at risk of sleepiness, opioid discontinuation in residents who experienced sleepiness, and use of low doses of opioids.

25|$|Narcolepsy has its typical onset in {{adolescence}} and young adulthood.

Cognitive, educational, occupational, and psychosocial problems associated with the <b>excessive</b> <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> of narcolepsy have been documented. For these to occur in the crucial teen years when education, development of self-image, and development of occupational choice are taking place is especially devastating. While cognitive impairment does occur, it may only be a reflection of the excessive daytime somnolence.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} {{narcolepsy}} is unknown with potentially several causes. In up to 10% of cases {{there is a}} family history of the disorder. Often those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide orexin which may be due to an autoimmune disorder. Trauma, infections, toxins, or psychological stress may also play a role. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies, after ruling out other potential causes. <b>Excessive</b> <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, major depressive disorder, anemia, heart failure, drinking alcohol, and not getting enough sleep. Cataplexy may be mistaken for seizures.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of {{narcolepsy}} to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness.

Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The <b>excessive</b> <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not.

40|$|Objective: This {{study has}} {{performed}} {{for determining the}} frequency of <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> and association between anxiety and depression among shift workers in two different factories. Methods: It is a cross-sectional study. The study population consisted of 307 workers {{who had been working}} in shifts in two factories in Tekirdağ. The Personal Information Form, The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) were applied to 289 workers who agreed to participate to the study.   246 of the workers who thoroughly completed the forms have been included to the study. After excluding confounding factors, statistical analyses have performed with 201 workers data. Results: The frequency of <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> was 10. 4 % in the study population. Due to HAD Scale it was determined that 13. 4 % of workers had anxiety risk and 49. 8 % had depression risk. The frequency of <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness,</b> depression risk and anxiety risk was found high but no statistically significant difference in all three variables was found. In the logistic regression analysis, a statistically significant association was found between <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> and anxiety (OR= 3. 20; 95 % CI: 1. 12 - 9. 29) and no association with depression. Conclusion: Anxiety frequency was found to be higher among workers who had <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> Referring problematic workers to a hospital for differential diagnosis has been suggested.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between pain severity, hyperarousal, insomnia, <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness,</b> and depression were explored {{in a sample}} of 41 adults with chronic pain and sleep disruption. Participants were recruited from medical clinics and non-medical establishments using flyers posted in designated areas, as well as through Craigslist advertisements, emails sent to listservs and snowball sampling. A correlational analysis was conducted and significant, positive relationships were found between chronic pain and insomnia (r[39] =. 458, p =. 003), insomnia and <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> (r[39] =. 496, p =. 001), insomnia and depression (r[39] =. 314, p 3 ̆c. 046) and hyperarousal and depression (r[39] =. 447, p =. 003). These correlations support the literature that describes chronic pain and insomnia and depression and insomnia as comorbid conditions. However, the significant, positive relationship found between insomnia and <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> was counter to what was hypothesized that a significant, negative relationship would exist between insomnia and <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> Insomnia and chronic pain are associated with hyperarousal (or prolonged activation of the central and sympathetic nervous systems), causing some people with these conditions to not feel abnormally sleepy during the day despite sleep deprivation. This significant correlation may be explained by the findings that some people with insomnia subjectively rate their <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> more intense than what is actually found on objective tests of sleep latency, such as the MSLT. These findings suggest that future investigators should include an objective test of sleep latency when measuring <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> and treat pain, insomnia, hyperarousal, <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness,</b> and depression collectively...|$|R
40|$|The 24 -h rhythms {{in sleep}} and {{temperature}} both change in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Characteristic changes {{consist of a}} more fragmented diurnal sleep profile with frequent nocturnal awakenings and <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness,</b> {{as well as a}} reduction in the amplitude of the 24 -h rhythm in core body temperature (CBT). Although the 24 -h rhythm in CBT is to a large extent the result of a 24 -h rhythm in heat loss from the skin caused by pronounced changes in skin blood flow and consequently skin temperature (Ts), changes in the diurnal skin temperature profile in AD as compared to normal aging have remained unexplored. Because recent work indicates a causal contribution of fluctuations in skin temperature to <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> and nocturnal sleep depth, the present study aimed to investigate the skin temperature rhythm in AD and its association with <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> and nocturnal sleep. Ambulatory recorders were used to estimate sleep and 24 -h rhythms in skin temperature in 55 AD patients and 26 matched non-demented elderly controls. Subjective sleep and <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> were obtained using questionnaires. The results indicate that AD patients had a significantly higher daytime proximal skin temperature (PST) than elderly controls. In both AD patients and elderly controls, an elevated daytime PST was associated with more <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> The findings suggest a deficient downregulation of daytime proximal skin blood flow that might contribute to <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness.</b> Because <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> contributes to cognitive dysfunction in AD, further research into the underlying mechanisms and possible reversibility is warranted. © Springer-Verlag 2012...|$|R
25|$|Narcolepsy is a {{long-term}} neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Symptoms include periods of <b>excessive</b> <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> that usually last from seconds to minutes and may occur at any time. About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy. These spells can be brought on by strong emotions. Less commonly there may be inability to move or vivid hallucinations while falling asleep or waking up. People with narcolepsy tend to sleep {{about the same number}} of hours per day as people without, but the quality of sleep tends to be worse.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} {{narcolepsy}} also suffer from insomnia {{for extended periods}} of time. The <b>excessive</b> <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After {{about an hour and}} a half of NREM sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present called REM atonia.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of narcolepsy is about 1 per 2,000 persons. It {{is a reason}} for patient visits to sleep disorder centers, and with its onset in adolescence, {{it is also a}} major cause of learning difficulty and absenteeism from school. Normal teenagers often already experience <b>excessive</b> <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> because of a maturational increase in physiological sleep tendency accentuated by multiple educational and social pressures; this may be disabling with the addition of narcolepsy symptoms in susceptible teenagers. In clinical practice, the differentiation between narcolepsy and other conditions characterized by excessive somnolence may be difficult. Treatment options are currently limited. There is a paucity in the literature of controlled double-blind studies of possible effective drugs or other forms of therapy. Mechanisms of action of some few available therapeutic agents have been explored but detailed studies of mechanisms of action are needed before new classes of therapeutic agents can be developed. Narcolepsy is an underdiagnosed condition in the general population. This is partly because its severity varies, so it can be mistaken for other illnesses very easily. Some people with narcolepsy do not suffer from loss of muscle control.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{analysis}} {{was to investigate the}} relationship of <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> with alcohol consumption and sleep duration using a population sample of adult Americans.

A heavy drinking episode was defined as the consumption of ≥ 5 standard alcoholic beverages in a day. Logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic variables and insomnia covariates were used to evaluate the relationship between <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> and an interaction of alcohol consumption variables with sleep duration. The results showed that <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> was reported by 15. 07 % of the subjects.

Due to its {{close relationship with}} dento-facial morphologies, orthodontists are increasingly involved in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} SDB. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess SDB problems among adolescents employing the Pediatric <b>Daytime</b> <b>Sleepiness</b> Scale(PDSS) questionnaire and to identify association between PDSS and dento-facial characteristics. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 265 teenagers (99 boys and 166 girls; age: 13. 74 ± 2. 01 years, range, 11 - 17 years old) who sought orthodontic treatment at a University teaching hospital. Approval has been obtained from local ethic committee in advance. Participants self-completed the PDSS questionnaires (an eight-item scale). Dento-facial morphologies including extra- and intra-oral characteristics were recorded. Associations between PDSS variables (at item level) and dentofacial characteristics were analysed using the Pearson chi-square test or T test. Result: Most (59. 2 %, 157) experienced a <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> event ‘always or frequently’. Experience of one or more aspects of <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> ‘always or frequently’ was associated with brachy face (short face) (P< 0. 01); and deep-bite (P< 0. 05). In addition, Class II molar relationship, a large tongue (P< 0. 01) and increased overjet (P< 0. 05) were associated with several experiences of <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> aspects (items rated as occurring ‘always or frequently’). Conclusion: <b>Daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> was commonly reported among adolescents seeking orthodontics. Frequency of <b>daytime</b> <b>sleepiness</b> was associated with several dento-facial characteristics (shorter face, deep-bite, molar- relationship, tongue size and overjet) ...|$|R
