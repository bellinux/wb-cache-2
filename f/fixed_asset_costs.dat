But, unlike companies in developed countries, the Ukrainian practice faces significant problems connected with recording of data and results of their use. Having examined the standards of domestic and foreign regulatory accounting of individual objects of nature, we can state that natural resources have the characteristics of property, but at the same time, there are significant differences. The author suggests three options for managing accounting of natural resources and appropriate rent from them, to create a special standard; improve existing standards of accounting for <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>costs</b> and revenues; make a link to a special standard, which reveals the methodology of natural resources accounting. Natural rent is the income derived from ownership or use of certain natural resources (land, water, forests, minerals and mining area). The study shows that the natural rent includes land, mining, water and forest rents, which are divided into types. To reflect the accounting natural rent the author has developed a number of analytical accounts to account 79 «Financial results».

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to present a best-fit {{scenario}} for a craft brewery in northwest British Columbia (BC) and evaluate its potential profitability. A business plan template {{was used to evaluate}} the factors that may impact the potential success of such a venture. The research for this project collected information from a number of sources. Sales and production data was gathered from the provincially regulated Liquor Distribution Branch. <b>Fixed</b> <b>asset</b> equipment <b>costs</b> were gathered from leading industry suppliers and financial data on breweries operating in British Columbia was gathered from Industry Canada's Small and Medium Enterprise Benchmarking tool. Interviews with industry experts were also conducted to gain insight and validate this report with real life experiences. This project determined that it is possible for a small craft brewery to be profitable in northern BC. This is based on the tax returns of the majority of breweries operating in the province which were calibrated to market conditions in northwestern BC, forecasted revenues and known <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> investment <b>costs.</b> The outcomes of this project reveal that the market for craft beer in northern BC is small and is overshadowed by markets in southern BC and Vancouver Island where the majority of craft beer is made and sold. The northern portion of the province has only one mature brewery, which leaves room for new firms to enter the industry. While this may seem attractive, regulatory policies of the provincial government combined with high capital investment and significant brewing know-how are key barriers for starting a craft brewery. This may be partially attributable to why at least a third of all breweries in BC are not profitable. Overcoming these challenges is possible, but it is crucial that sufficient financial planning is undertaken. Investigation conducted as part of this project revealed that the majority of breweries in the province have financed their operations through significant levels of debt and posses negative equityThe original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R
