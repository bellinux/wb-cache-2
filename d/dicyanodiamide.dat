40|$|SERS {{has been}} used for {{detection}} of TNT and DNT vapors adsorbed as thin films in gold substrates. SERS has not been used as a quantitative analytical tool for detection of ultra-low levels of explosives such as <b>dicyanodiamide,</b> methylnitroguanidine, and picric acid. We are using gold nanoparticles of different shapes as colloidal SERS substrates for detection of ultra-low levels of <b>dicyanodiamide,</b> methylnitroguanidine, and picric acid in solution. The overall goal of our research is to synthesize gold nanoparticles of different shapes as colloidal SERS substrates for detection of ultralow levels of different explosives. We hope to achieve low nM and pM detection of the explosives. Also, our method is a rapid and direct readout quantitative method for detection of the explosives. Our research can be transitioned to the customer or en...|$|E
30|$|Fire-retardant {{treatments}} of wood products {{are designed to}} reduce their flammability. The common method of introducing fire retardants in wood or plywood is through soaking or pressure impregnation [1, 2]. The surface coating of resins with fire retardants {{was found to be}} an effective and economical method of improving fire endurance [3, 4]. Such a surface treatment method can remove infusion and re-drying process, reduce the cost of the process and is applicable to any species because of no permeability limit. Based on their fire preventive effect, bond strength and formaldehyde emission, Kawarasaki et al. [3] selected some fire retardants mixed with melamine formaldehyde resin (MF) or urea–formaldehyde resin (UF) to examine their influence on fire preventive of plywood. The results showed that intumescent fire retardant (IFR) using ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as the catalyst, pentaerythritol as the carbonific material, and <b>dicyanodiamide</b> or azodicarbonamids as the blowing agent mixed with MF adhesive was a suitable surface treatment.|$|E
40|$|The tanning {{industry}} generates a high quantity of solid wastes. Therefore, {{there is a}} need to create valorization [added value] options for these wastes. The main objective of the present work was to study the effect of protein hydrolysates (HP) prepared from fleshings on leather dyeing. During previous studies it was found that the application of HP products, obtained from fleshings, in leather retannage intensified the colour of crust leather. In this work the CIELAB colour system was used to evaluate the effect of HP on retannage processes. The main conclusions of this study were: (i) HP can be used instead of a <b>dicyanodiamide</b> resin (Fortan DC) if the colour parameters of the standard procedure are to be maintained, and (ii) the replacement of an acrylic resin (Fortan A 40) by glutaraldehyde-modified HP (GHP) results in a darker skin, and can therefore be interesting for the reduction of the quantity of dye used...|$|E
40|$|The {{weed killer}} calcium {{cyanamide}} {{was also a}} slowly acting N fertilizer. It released N as urea, which was subsequently converted to ammonium carbonate and nitrate. The first phase was mainly physico-chemical involving hydrolysis to calcium hydroxide and cyanamide, which was then hydrolysed to urea. It was promoted by free H + in the soil and exceeded any possible microbiological action, as application initially caused {{a decrease in the}} soil microflora. The second phase was microbiological; first urea was released. The herbicidal effect was due to the formation of <b>dicyanodiamide</b> and its decomposition products, which were toxic also to most micro-organisms. It formed at high pH (8 - 10) if the topdressing became moist. Nitrification was depressed in concentrations higher than 10 % of total N. But the initial effect perhaps limited the proliferation of pathogens. Apart from killing weeds, it might injure both crop and microflora, if not incorporated into the soil. A method was developed of estimating the rate of ammonification and nitrification of calcium cyanamide for different soil samples and, thus, the amount of fertilizer needed for optimum effect. <p/...|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} {{anthropogenic}} emissions of CO 2 with increased atmospheric CO 2 levels and, in turn, with increased global temperature {{has been well}} established and accepted. Using aqueous ammonia to capture CO 2 and produce an inexpensive nitrogen fertilizer, ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) has been thought as a feasible approach to CO 2 sequestration. Due to the different concentrations of reactants and reaction conditions, different carbon-ammonium composites can be produced. In view of achieving a maximum of NH 3 utilization in the capture of CO 2, the product of ABC will be ideal. Hence the ABC in the products needs to be identified. Various analytical techniques were used to distinguish the ABC. FTIR, DSC, TGA and XRD techniques were used to qualitatively distinguish the ammonium bicarbonate from the ammonium salts. The carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen element analysis and Near Infrared (NIR) techniques were used as quantitative analysis of ABC. The AOTF-NIR Free Space spectrometer is an ideal tool for real-time, on-line measurements of ABC. Sample 01050401 and Sample 01060401 from the CO 2 Scrubbing experiment by aqueous ammonia at WKU were determined by these techniques as ammonium bicarbonate and have very good quality as fertilizer in accordance with GB - 3559 - 92 Agriculture Ammonium Bicarbonate National Standard of China. During fertilizer storage and application, an amount of ABC will decompose into NH 3, H 2 O and CO 2. Long-effect ABC (LEABC) {{is a product of}} co-crystallized <b>dicyanodiamide</b> (DCD) and ABC. In order to evaluate ABC fertilizer efficiency and its contribution to permanent carbon fixation, tests with Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) were conducted. The experiments by TGA indicated that the temperature and air flow rate have much less effect on the evaporation of the LEABC than on the ABC. Kinetic studies of ABC and LEABC gave their Activation Energy. At the 7. 5 % conversion rate, LEABC’s Activation Energy is 111. 9 kJ/mole, which is greater than ABC’s Activation Energy 93. 6 kJ/mole. The difference in Activation Energy explains the reason of different stability of ABC and LEABC...|$|E
