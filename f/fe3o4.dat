5|$|Several oxides of cobalt are known. Green cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) has rocksalt structure. It {{is readily}} {{oxidized}} {{with water and}} oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)3). At temperatures of 600–700°C, CoO oxidizes to the blue cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4), which has a spinel structure. Black cobalt(III) oxide (Co2O3) is also known. Cobalt oxides are antiferromagnetic at low temperature: CoO (Néel temperature 291K) and Co3O4 (Néel temperature: 40K), which is analogous to magnetite (<b>Fe3O4),</b> {{with a mixture of}} +2 and +3 oxidation states.|$|E
5|$|The hot carbon {{monoxide}} is the reducing {{agent for the}} iron ore and reacts with the iron oxide to produce molten iron and carbon dioxide. Depending on {{the temperature in the}} different parts of the furnace (warmest at the bottom) the iron is reduced in several steps. At the top, where the temperature usually is in the range between 200°C and 700°C, the iron oxide is partially reduced to iron(II,III) oxide, <b>Fe3O4.</b>|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (<b>Fe3O4),</b> and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E

25|$|Bluing is a {{passivation}} {{process that}} produces a layer of <b>Fe3O4</b> {{on the surface of}} steel to protect it from rust.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fe3O4</b> is an {{electrical}} conductor with a conductivity significantly higher (X 106) than Fe2O3, {{and this is}} ascribed to electron exchange between the FeII and FeIII centres.|$|E
25|$|Production of nano-particles can be {{performed}} chemically by taking for example mixtures of FeII and FeIII salts and mixing them with alkali to precipitate colloidal <b>Fe3O4.</b> The reaction conditions are critical to the process and determine the particle size.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fe3O4</b> has a cubic inverse spinel {{structure}} {{which consists}} of a cubic close packed array of oxide ions where all of the Fe2+ ions occupy half of the octahedral sites and the Fe3+ are split evenly across the remaining octahedral sites and the tetrahedral sites.|$|E
25|$|Both FeO and γ-Fe2O3 have {{a similar}} cubic close packed array of oxide ions and this {{accounts}} for the ready interchangeability between the three compounds on oxidation and reduction as these reactions entail a relatively small change to the overall structure. <b>Fe3O4</b> samples can be non-stoichiometric.|$|E
25|$|The {{ferrimagnetism}} of <b>Fe3O4</b> arises {{because the}} electron spins of the FeII and FeIII ions in the octahedral sites are coupled and the spins of the FeIII ions in the tetrahedral sites are coupled but anti-parallel to the former. The net effect {{is that the}} magnetic contributions of both sets are not balanced {{and there is a}} permanent magnetism.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} step can {{be added}} to the nitrocarburizing process called Postoxidation. When properly performed, Postoxidation creates a layer of Black Oxide (<b>Fe3O4),</b> that greatly increases the corrosion resistance of the treated substrate while leaving an aesthetically attractive black color. Since the introduction of the Glock pistol in 1982, this type of nitrocarburizing with postoxidation finish has become popular as a factory finish for military style handguns.|$|E
25|$|In another application, Mössbauer {{spectroscopy}} is used {{to characterize}} phase transformations in iron catalysts, e.g., those used for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. While initially consisting of hematite (Fe2O3), these catalysts transform into a mixture of magnetite (<b>Fe3O4)</b> and several iron carbides. The formation of carbides appears to improve catalytic activity, however it {{can also lead to}} the mechanical break-up and attrition of the catalyst particles, which can cause difficulties in the final separation of catalyst from reaction products.|$|E
25|$|Iron(II,III) oxide is the {{chemical}} compound with formula <b>Fe3O4.</b> It occurs in nature as the mineral magnetite. It {{is one of}} a number of iron oxides, the others being iron(II) oxide (FeO), which is rare, and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) also known as hematite. It contains both Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions and is sometimes formulated as FeO ∙ Fe2O3. This iron oxide is encountered in the laboratory as a black powder. It exhibits permanent magnetism and is ferrimagnetic, but is sometimes incorrectly described as ferromagnetic. Its most extensive use is as a black pigment which is synthesised rather than being extracted from the naturally occurring mineral as the particle size and shape can be varied by the method of production.|$|E
25|$|In {{industrial}} practice, {{the iron}} catalyst is obtained from finely ground iron powder, {{which is usually}} obtained by reduction of high purity magnetite (<b>Fe3O4).</b> The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite of a defined particle size. The magnetite particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the oxygen in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of wüstite (FeO), {{which in turn is}} surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high surface area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst. Other minor components of the catalyst include calcium and aluminium oxides, which support the iron catalyst and help it maintain its surface area. These oxides of Ca, Al, K, and Si are unreactive to reduction by the hydrogen.|$|E
500|$|Industrial iron {{production}} {{starts with}} iron ores, principally hematite, {{which has a}} nominal formula Fe2O3, and magnetite, with the formula <b>Fe3O4.</b> [...] These ores are reduced to the metal in a carbothermic reaction, i.e. by treatment with carbon. [...] The conversion is typically conducted in a blast furnace at temperatures of about 2000°C. Carbon is provided {{in the form of}} coke. [...] The process also contains a flux such as limestone, which is used to remove silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the furnace. [...] The coke and limestone are fed into the top of the furnace, while a massive blast of air heated to 900°C, about 4 tons per ton of iron, is forced into the furnace at the bottom.|$|E
500|$|Iron {{reacts with}} {{oxygen in the}} air to form various oxide and {{hydroxide}} compounds; the most common are iron(II,III) oxide (<b>Fe3O4),</b> and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). Iron(II) oxide also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they are actually all non-stoichiometric compounds whose compositions may vary. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see bloomery and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of ferrites, useful magnetic storage media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is iron pyrite (FeS2), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster. It is not an iron(IV) compound, but is actually an iron(II) polysulfide containing Fe2+ and [...] ions in a distorted sodium chloride structure.|$|E

In some cases, a compound may have more than one possible position for the Mössbauer active atom. For example, the crystal structure of magnetite (<b>Fe3O4)</b> supports two different sites for the iron atoms. Its spectrum has 12 peaks, a sextet for each potential atomic site, corresponding to two sets of Mössbauer parameters.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetism is a {{class of}} {{physical}} phenomena that are mediated by magnetic fields. [...] Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles {{give rise to a}} magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. [...] The most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. [...] Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys. [...] The prefix [...] refers to iron, because permanent magnetism was first observed in lodestone, a form of natural iron ore called magnetite, <b>Fe3O4.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At {{about the}} same time, {{chromium}} dioxide (CrO2) tape, later designated Type II, was introduced by DuPont, {{the inventor of the}} particle, and BASF, the inventor and longtime manufacturer of magnetic recording tape. Next, coatings using magnetite (<b>Fe3O4)</b> such as TDK's Audua were produced in an attempt to approach or exceed the sound quality of vinyl records.

The tape coating on most cassettes sold today as either [...] "normal" [...] or [...] "chrome" [...] consists of ferric oxide and cobalt mixed in varying ratios (and using various processes); there are very few cassettes on the market that use a pure (CrO2) coating.|$|E
2500|$|Biomineralization is {{the process}} by which living organisms produce minerals, often to harden or stiffen {{existing}} tissues. Such tissues are called mineralized tissues. It is an extremely widespread phenomenon; all six taxonomic kingdoms contain members that are able to form minerals, and over 60 different minerals have been identified in organisms. [...] Examples include silicates in algae and diatoms, carbonates in invertebrates, and calcium phosphates and carbonates in vertebrates. These minerals often form structural features such as sea shells and the bone in mammals and birds. Organisms have been producing mineralised skeletons for the past 550 million years. Other examples include copper, iron and gold deposits involving bacteria. Biologically-formed minerals often have special uses such as magnetic sensors in magnetotactic bacteria (<b>Fe3O4),</b> gravity sensing devices (CaCO3, CaSO4, BaSO4) and iron storage and mobilization (Fe2O3•H2O in the protein ferritin).|$|E
2500|$|The {{action of}} {{micro-organisms}} can fix uranium; Thermoanaerobacter can use chromium(VI), iron(III), cobalt(III), manganese(IV) and uranium(VI) as electron acceptors while acetate, glucose, hydrogen, lactate, pyruvate, succinate, and xylose {{can act as}} electron donors for the metabolism of the bacteria. In this way the metals {{can be reduced to}} form magnetite (<b>Fe3O4),</b> siderite (FeCO3), rhodochrosite (MnCO3), and uraninite (UO2). Other researchers have also worked on the fixing of uranium using bacteria , Francis R. Livens et al. (Working at Manchester) have suggested that the reason why Geobacter sulfurreducens can reduce [...] cations to uranium dioxide is that the bacteria reduce the uranyl cations to [...] which then undergoes disproportionation to form [...] and UO2. This reasoning was based (at least in part) on the observation that [...] is not converted to an insoluble neptunium oxide by the bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|Oxide {{minerals}} {{are divided}} into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O2− as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The periclase group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include cuprite (Cu2O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as corundum (Al2O3), and hematite (Fe2O3). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO2) is the chief ore of titanium; other examples include cassiterite (SnO2; ore of tin), and pyrolusite (MnO2; ore of manganese). [...] In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH−. Bauxites are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals diaspore, gibbsite, and bohmite; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions). [...] Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the spinels, with a general formula of X2+Y3+2O4. Examples of species include spinel (MgAl2O4), chromite (FeCr2O4), and magnetite (<b>Fe3O4).</b> The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two oxidation states (Fe2+Fe3+2O4), {{which makes it a}} multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.|$|E
