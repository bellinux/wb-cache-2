40|$|SAW {{devices are}} {{routinely}} frequency trimmed at the wafer level {{prior to the}} dicing process so to improve yield at the assembly level. The trimming {{can be achieved by}} using wet etching, reactive ion etching, ion beam milling, and other methods. It is also possible to trim the frequency of patterned SAW wafer by depositing dielectric thin films on the wafer but this method is usually done for the purpose of finger shorting protection from metallic particles. Reactive ion etching can be used to <b>trim</b> assembled <b>SAW</b> devices prior to encapsulation. This is seldom employed since it is considered costly, inefficient, and difficult to perform in-situ. In this paper we propose <b>trimming</b> assembled <b>SAW</b> resonator (SAWR) by using the conventional crystal resonator fine-tuning process with gold thin film addition. Nowadays, the fine-tuning process is a necessary step in crystal resonator production. We show that this is a simple and well-controlled method to <b>trim</b> assembled <b>SAW</b> resonator also. This method provides a wide trimming range and the gold film is thin enough not to short out the SAW transducers so that the SAWR’s integrity can be maintained...|$|R

30|$|Hemicellulose is {{comprised}} of a linear main chain β- 1, 4 linked D-xylose backbone with short lateral side chains of different lower molecular weight sugar residues (Dyk and Pletschke [2012]). Enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicellulose commences with the removal of side chains that block the sites where xylanases cleave the xylan backbone. Endo- 1, 4 -β-xylanase enzymes cleave the glycosidic bonds in a selective manner depending on the chain length, degree of branching of substrate molecules {{and the presence of}} alternative carbohydrate moieties (Polizeli et al. [2005]). Cleavage of the xylan backbone yields xylooligosaccharides and the <b>final</b> <b>trimming</b> is carried out by β-xylosidase, whereby short chain oligosaccharides and xylobiose are hydrolysed from the non-reducing termini to release xylose monomers (Polizeli et al.

Low frequency acceleration noise introduced by the electrostatic force needed to counter static mass distribution imbalance {{is expected to be}} a significant contributor to the acceleration noise budget. For this reason, the self-gravity (due to mass imbalance) is minimized by adding trim mass to bring the total differential acceleration between the two test masses due to self-gravity below 5 x 10 - 10 m/s 2 in any axis and the DC acceleration gradient due to self-gravity below 4 x 10 - 8 m/s 2 /m in any axis of either test mass. A plan has been established to develop the distribution and placement of the compensation masses. Compensation for the self-gravity effects on the two test masses is handled in a two step process. A nominal compensation mass is defined and incorporated early and is located very near the test masses. The <b>final</b> <b>trimming</b> for self-gravity occurs after the integration on the spacecraft with small mass added externally to the test mass vacuum enclosures. The plan identifies three preliminary points in the hardware maturity where the trimming to the as-built configuration can take place: (1) during build-up of the sensor vacuum enclosure, (2) prior to delivery of the integrated ST- 7 to Europe, and (3) prior to environmental testing of the integrated LPF system.

We perform the two-phase keypoint filtering iteratively and give selected keypoints different weights for their importance.

40|$|We {{introduce}} and characterize a {{new class}} of polygons that models wood, stone, glass, and ceramic shapes that can be cut with a table <b>saw,</b> lapidary <b>trim</b> <b>saw,</b> or other circular saw. In this model, a circular saw is a line segment (in projection) that can move freely in empty space, but can only cut straight into a portion of material.

A polygon is called cuttable by a circular saw if it can be cut out of a convex shape of material by a sufficiently small circular saw. We prove that a polygon has this property precisely if it does not have two adjacent reflex vertices. 1 Introduction There are many saw tools 1 for cutting a desired shape out of material ranging from soft wood to brittle ceramic, glass, and stone.

40|$|Eri 1 is a 32 ̆ 7 -to- 52 ̆ 7 exoribonuclease conserved from fission yeast to humans. Here we {{show that}} Eri 1 {{associates}} with ribosomes and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

In human and murine cells, Eri 1 localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus, with enrichment in the nucleolus, the site of preribosome biogenesis.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{device for}} the {{controlled}} trimming of plastic specimen blocks for light and electron microscopy is described. Many advantages of previously reported instruments together with 1) a {{rack and pinion}} control of knife movement, and 2) a control of rotation of the specimen block at 90 0, 1800, 2700, or 3600 are incorporated. In conjunction with an ocular micrometer, the device allows accurate removal of thin slices during trimming. Several devices and techniques have been described which aid in the trimming of plastic embedded specimen blocks to form "pyramids " (= truncated pyramids) before they are mounted into the microtome (Boyde 1960, Butler 1974, Danon 1961, Guglielmotti 1976, Schneider and Sasaki 1976, Sjostrand 1967). Gorycki (1978) described a "rectangular trimming block " which, {{in conjunction with a}} small mirror mounted on the knife holder of the ultramicrotome, squarely re-trimmed the block face of a preformed truncated pyramid. Similarly, Sjostrand's device (Sjostrand 1967) is a trimming aid intended only for the <b>final</b> <b>trimming</b> and retrimming of tissue blocks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{study was to examine the}} joint {{influences}} of experiential avoidance and social problem solving on the link between childhood emotional abuse (CEA) and intimate partner violence (IPV). Experiential avoidance following CEA may interfere with a person’s ability to effectively problem solve in social situations, increasing risk for conflict and interpersonal violence. As part of a larger study, 232 women recruited from the community completed measures assessing childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, experiential avoidance, maladaptive social problem solving, and IPV perpetration and victimization. <b>Final</b> <b>trimmed</b> models indicated that CEA was indirectly associated with IPV victimization and perpetration via experiential avoidance and Negative Problem Orientation (NPO) and Impulsivity/Carelessness Style (ICS) social problem solving strategies. Though CEA was related to an Avoidance Style (AS) social problem solving strategy, this strategy was not significantly associated with IPV victimization or perpetration. Experiential avoidance had both a direct and indirect effect, via NPO and ICS social problem solving, on IPV victimization and perpetration. Findings suggest that CEA may lead some women to avoid unwanted internal experiences, which may adversely impact their ability to effectively problem solve in social situations and increase IPV risk...|$|R
