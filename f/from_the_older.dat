5|$|Ancient Egyptian was a {{synthetic}} language, {{but it became}} more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E
5|$|Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian) tells Veronica {{that she}} has {{successfully}} applied {{for the first part}} of an FBI internship {{with the help of a}} recommendation from the Dean. Keith questions Mrs. O'Dell heavily, and she subsequently fires him from the case, although he says that he will not stop investigating. Veronica visits Josh in jail, who suspects Mason. Dick returns, getting a divorce <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> sister, and Logan and Heather remain friends. In Veronica's criminology class, she is arrested for aiding Josh to escape from prison.|$|E
50|$|As part of {{redistricting}} {{after the}} 2010 census, Hayworth's district was renumbered as the 18th District. The new district {{is composed of}} the following percentages of voters of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> congressional districts: 1% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> 18th District; 76% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> 19th; 2% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> 20th; and 21% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> 22nd. She lost the election to Maloney 52%-48%.|$|R
2500|$|The verb [...] "geld" [...] comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Norse gelda, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{adjective}} geldr ("barren"). The noun [...] "gelding" [...] is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Norse geldingr.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the place-name is not clear. One {{explanation}} is that it comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Norse words flagth and vath meaning ford of the female troll or witch. Alternatively it might come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Norse flatha meaning flat meadow or <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English fleathe meaning water-lily. The place-name appears as Flathwayth in c. 1190.|$|R
5|$|Standard Swedish, {{spoken by}} most Swedes, is the {{national}} language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established {{by the beginning of}} the 20th century. While distinct regional varieties descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the basic}} {{plan of the}} Western Chalukya style {{originated}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> dravida style, many of its features were unique and peculiar to it. One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an articulation that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only exceptions to this motif {{can be found in}} the area around Kalyani, where the temples exhibit a nagara (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character.|$|E
5|$|Twyfelfontein valley {{has been}} {{inhabited}} by Stone-age hunter-gatherers of the Wilton stone age culture group since approximately 6,000 years ago. They made {{most of the}} engravings and probably all the paintings. 2,000 to 2,500 years ago the Khoikhoi, an ethnic group related to the San (Bushmen), occupied the valley, then known under its Damara/Nama name ǀUi-ǁAis (jumping waterhole). The Khoikhoi also produced rock art which can clearly be distinguished <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> engravings.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{name comes}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Hafslo farm (Old Norse: Hafrsló), since Hafslo Church is located there. The first element of <b>the</b> name comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> male name Hafr or <b>from</b> <b>the</b> word for [...] "goat" [...] (also hafr). The second element of <b>the</b> name comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> word ló meaning [...] "meadow, {{probably}} due to the excellent farming areas nearby.|$|R
5000|$|The name Hoscar {{is derived}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Norse 'hross' or Old English 'hors' and 'kjarr' (marshland), again <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Norse. An early {{recorded}} form is Horsecarr (1347) ...|$|R
50|$|It draws about 60% of its {{population}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Moncton East and about 40% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> district of Moncton North. Moncton East incumbent Chris Collins won the 2014 election.|$|R
5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were well away from the building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, India {{signed a}} {{contract}} to purchase several Mk42B Sea Kings, an upgraded variant to perform dual-purpose: anti-shipping and anti-submarine missions, following a competition for the order against the Aérospatiale Super Puma. These helicopters would operate from the Godavari-class frigates as well as replace the existing Sea Kings. A team of Indian engineers was sent to Britain to help develop the Mk42B's avionics, especially the onboard software. Changes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Sea Kings included a brand new avionics suite, the use of composite materials throughout the fuselage and in the rotor blades, {{as well as the}} integration of the Sea Eagle missile, which had been procured from Britain in 1983. Between 1988 and 1992, a total of 20 Mk42B Sea Kings were delivered to the Indian Navy.|$|E
50|$|Newton means <b>the</b> new {{enclosure}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English ‘niwe’ and ‘tun’. The medieval {{hamlet of}} Newton, which lay between Bower Hinton and Hurst, was first {{referred to in}} 1327. Stapleton was first recorded in 1195. It means <b>the</b> steep enclosure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English ‘steap’ and ‘tun’. Alternatively it may be <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English ‘stapel’ and ‘tun’, meaning ‘settlement by a post’.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problematic}} {{element is}} -ey, as in Romsey. This commonly means 'island', <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English -eg. However, -ey {{can also be}} derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English hæg, meaning 'enclosure', as in Hornsey.|$|R
50|$|The unusual name is {{probably}} derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English motes funta, meaning 'spring near the confluence' or 'spring of the moot' or possibly 'spring of <b>the</b> stone' (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English motere: sonte).|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} Anglo-Saxon period, the {{internal}} street layout of Canterbury was remodelled, but {{the line of}} the outer walls remained the same. A cattle market was created outside the city to the south-east, and Newingate, later renamed St George's Gate, was inserted into the walls to allow easy access to it. During this the period the main axis of the city shifted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> line of streets running from London Gate and Riding Gate, to the new route between West Gate and Newingate. A lane was built running around the inside of the walls, in a similar way to the intramural streets built around the same time at Exeter and Winchester. Churches and chapels were built over the gates, including St Mary's above the North Gate; the Holy Cross over West Gate; St Michael's over Bargate; St Edmund's within Riding Gate; and, potentially, St George's Chapel over Newingate. Canterbury's walls were mentioned by the early chronicler, Bede, in his history of England.|$|E
5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after {{a decade or more}} in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{with their}} {{previous}} albums, the group produced Sons of Soul entirely themselves. They utilized both vintage and contemporary recording gear in the album's production, including a Hammond B-3, Clavinet, ARP String Ensemble, and Korg and Roland synthesizers. Riley viewed that hearing music played <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> instruments affected their songwriting. For his vocals, Raphael recorded with Neumann U87 and AKG C12A condensor microphones, {{as well as}} a vintage RCA Type77-DX microphone. He used a custom five-string bass from a guitar and bass repair shop in San Francisco, {{as well as a}} Minimoog analog synthesizer for other bass lines on the album. D'wayne used a Microtech Gefell UM70 for his lead vocals and an AKG 414 for his background vocals. He played a vintage Gibson L6-S and a Fender Coronado guitar, modified with Gibson burst bucker pickups. Aside from his drumming, Riley played both Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{is related}} to ship and has a {{complicated}} etymology: [...] "skiff" [...] comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Middle English skif, which derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> French esquif, which in turn derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Italian schifo, which is itself of Germanic origin (German Schiff). [...] "Ship" [...] comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English [...] "scip", which has the same Germanic predecessor. An even older root {{may be found in}} the Greek [...] "σκάφος" [...] (vessel).|$|R
50|$|They are {{distinct}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Order German Baptist Brethren, another group with similar traditions that split off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> German Baptist Brethren in 1921. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> Brethren German Baptists farm with horses, while <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Order German Baptists use tractors and other motorized equipment in their farming.|$|R
50|$|Although {{during the}} first half of the 19th century the city {{population}} stagnated due to low natural increase, the city started to spread <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> center; citizens <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> city created <b>the</b> new suburb of Stanovi in the north.|$|R
5|$|Many castles still {{retained}} a defensive role. Castles in England, such as Chepstow and York Castle, were repaired and garrisoned by the king. As military technologies progressed {{the costs of}} upgrading older castles could be prohibitive – the estimated £30,000 required for the potential conversion of York in 1682, approximately £4,050,000 in 2009 terms, gives a scale of the potential costs. Castles played a minimal role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, although some fortifications such as Dover Castle were attacked by mobs unhappy with the religious beliefs of their Catholic governors, and the sieges of King John's Castle in Limerick formed part of the endgame {{to the war in}} Ireland. In the north of Britain security problems persisted in Scotland. Cromwellian forces had built a number of new modern forts and barracks, but the royal castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton and Stirling, along with Dunstaffnage, Dunollie and Ruthven Castle, also continued in use as practical fortifications. Tower houses were being built up until the 1640s; after the Restoration the fortified tower house fell out of fashion, but the weak state of the Scottish economy was such that while many larger properties were simply abandoned, the more modest castles continued to be used and adapted as houses, rather than rebuilt. In Ireland tower houses and castles remained in use until after the Glorious Revolution, when events led to a dramatic shift in land ownership and a boom in the building of Palladian country houses; in many cases using timbers stripped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older,</b> abandoned generation of castles and tower houses.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} schools in Middlewich in the mid-19th century: the British School in Newton Bank; the National School in Cow Lane (Brooks Lane); and the Grammar School, {{close to the}} site of the largest tesco store. A Church of England school was erected in Lewin Street in 1854 and {{extended}} in 1871. It soon became known as the National School, with the result that the earlier school was demolished. The later National School was itself demolished in the 1980s and is the site of the Salinae Day Care Centre, opened in 1995. At the turn of the 20th century two new schools were built: St Mary's Catholic school, whose keystone was laid in 1899 by Col. France-Hayhurst, and the secondary school, opened by France-Hayhurst in 1906. At the start of the 21st century there were seven schools in Middlewich: one infant, one junior, four primary schools and one secondary school. Cledford Primary School tends to accept students from the South of the town. It has now amalgamated With Cledford Infant And Nursery School. Middlewich Primary School caters for children <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older,</b> northern, part of the town, whilst St Mary's Catholic Primary School receives Catholic children from the town. Work began on the original buildings for the secondary school, Middlewich High School, in 1906, with later additions improving the teaching areas and providing a sports hall which could also be used by the wider community. The school opened on 1 November 1906. In 2007 it was ranked 34 out of 50 by GCSE results for schools in Cheshire in the 2007 league tables. Byley Primary School and Wimboldsley Community Primary School serve children from outside the immediate bounds of the town.|$|E

50|$|Fulwood was {{originally}} an Anglo-Saxon settlement, with <b>the</b> name originating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English language “Ful Wuda” meaning a “wet, marshy woodland“. However other {{interpretations of the}} name are “foul, dirty wood” and “folks wood” <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English “folc”.|$|R
50|$|It is {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book as Cocheham. The name may be <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English cōc + hām, meaning 'cook village', i.e. 'village noted for its cooks', although the first element may be derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English cōc(e) meaning 'hill'.|$|R
50|$|Witcombe means <b>the</b> white valley <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English ‘hwit’ and ‘cumb’. It {{occurs as}} ‘Whythicumbe’ in 1243, {{in which case}} cf Withycombe (near Carhampton), <b>the</b> willow valley <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English ‘wippe’ and ‘cumb’. It may also be ‘wide valley’ from Old English.|$|R
25|$|The modern {{classification}} system {{is known as}} the Morgan–Keenan (MK) classification. Each star is assigned a spectral class <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Harvard spectral classification and a luminosity class using Roman numerals as explained below, forming the star's spectral type.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the poems}} are {{written on the}} same subject, with the newer one drawing {{directly}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older,</b> Fujiwara no Teika’s interpretation both modernizes the poem and provides it with greater subtlety.

25|$|Woodlands Avenue 2 is {{a shorter}} route <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> estates {{of the town}} to the Seletar Expressway. To connect the Woodlands Avenue 2 into the Seletar Expressway, part of the road was being built since 1998. SBS Services 161 and 168 plies along the shorter route of Woodlands Avenue 2.|$|E

40|$|Preaching Christ <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament. A new {{approach}} to an old problem? This review article deals with Sidney Greidanus’ book {{on the problem of}} preaching Christ <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament (cf. footnote 1). It discusses his previous contributions on preaching, looking at preaching especially <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament. An extensive discussion and evaluation of this book then follow. In conclusion, a number of observations are made about the present relevance of this work. Greidanus’ work contains an extensive survey {{of the history of the}} problem, followed by guidelines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New Testament. The New Testament’s treatment of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament is then taken as norm for developing different approaches to preaching Christ <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Testament. This publication of Greidanus does not really break new ground, but provides a comprehensive survey of the problem and different approaches to solving the problem. [URL]...|$|R
