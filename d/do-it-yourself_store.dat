5000|$|The company entered Switzerland in 2000 {{with the}} EUR 425 million {{purchase}} of Jura Group, adding cement, concrete and aggregates operations, {{as well as}} a regional distribution network. In the following year, CRH took an interest in Nesher Israel Cement Works, the only cement producer in that country, by taking a 25% stake in its holding company Mashav. In July 2003 it agreed to pay EUR 693 million to acquire Cementbouw - a market-leading <b>do-it-yourself</b> <b>store</b> chain and building materials producer in the Netherlands. In 2004 CRH paid €429m to purchase a 49 percent stake in Portuguese cement producer Secil. It sold that stake again in 2012 for €574m following a ruling on a shareholder dispute by an arbitration tribunal at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce [...] In the United States, CRH also acquired Ohio's Shelly Group in 2000, and CRH acquired Mount Hope Rock Products, based in New Jersey in 2002 and Ashland Paving And Construction (APAC) of Atlanta in 2006. APAC was the company's largest ever deal. In 2007 CRH purchased four companies, worth a total of $350 million (€251 million) to add to its US materials division: these companies are Conrad Yelvington Distributors Inc.

40|$|Mixed {{findings}} have been obtained in prior research {{with respect to the}} presence and severity of memory and metamemory deficits in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We tested the hypothesis that experimentally induced increments of subjective responsibility would lead to a disproportionately strong decline of memory confidence and enhanced response latencies in OCD while leaving memory accuracy unaffected. Twenty-eight OCD patients and 28 healthy controls were presented a computerized memory test framed with two different scenarios. In the neutral scenario, the participant was requested to imagine purchasing 15 items from a <b>do-it-yourself</b> <b>store.</b> In the recognition phase, the 15 needed items were presented along with 15 distractor items. The participant was asked to decide whether items were on his or her shopping list or not, graded by subjective confidence. In the responsibility scenario, the general experimental setup was analogous except that the participant now had to envision that he or she was a helper in a region recently struck by an earthquake, dispatched to provide 15 urgently needed goods from a nearby town. In line with prior work by our group, samples did not differ in either condition on memory accuracy in a subsequent recognition task. As hypothesized, OCD participants were less certain in their responses for the high responsibility condition than controls. Whereas patients and controls did not differ in their subjective estimates for memorized items, patients expressed stronger doubt that their earthquake mission was successful. The findings indicate that low memory confidence in OCD may only be elicited in situations where perceived responsibility is high and that patients may share higher performance standards ("good is not good enough") than controls when perceived responsibility is inflated...|$|E

40|$|Statistics Netherlands is {{planning}} to use scanner data {{on a large scale}} for the compilation of the CPI, covering supermarkets, department <b>stores,</b> <b>do-it-yourself</b> <b>stores,</b> etc. Ideally, to make the production process as efficient as possible, a limited number of fully or semi-automated methods would be used. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a framework supporting these plans. Our basic aggregation formula is what we refer to as a “quality-adjusted unit value index”, which is equal to the value index divided by a quantity index that is defined as the ratio of quality-adjusted or standardized quantities. Time dummy regression models play an important role in the estimation of the quality-adjustment (standardization) factors. There are two extreme cases. If information on all relevant item characteristics is available, then the use of time dummy hedonic models is preferred. When characteristics information is lacking, the use of time-product dummy (fixed effects) models is proposed. We also discuss a number of issues that need to be resolved before our ideas can be implemented in CPI production, such as the definition of homogeneity, treatment of revisions and choice of estimation window.

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are complex mixtures of organic compounds {{that are often}} found as environmental pollutants. In 2005, the German Stiftung Warentest (a product testing NGO) had detected high levels of PAHs in some tool handles and cable sheaths [1]. To reduce the health risks, guidance values for technically unavoidable PAH levels were proposed for manufacturers to comply on a voluntary basis. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was asked to assess these guidance values and the occurrence of PAHs in consumer products. In the spring of 2009 TÜV Rheinland examined the PAH concentrations in various products like tool handles, beach sandals and ball horns from <b>do-it-yourself</b> <b>stores</b> and low budget stores. The result: {{in some cases the}} guidance values are still considerably exceeded in the consumer products examined for PAHs. According to the knowledge currently available, the BfR must assume that defective products are still being marketed. Such products do not comply with good manufacturing practice and constitute a risk for human health. In general, manufacturers should reduce PAH concentrations in their products as much as possible since no threshold values can be given for some PAHs below which health risks can be excluded. In order to protect consumers from health risks, BfR proposes the setting of statutory limit values for PAHs and BaP. Compliance should be a precondition for the marketability of consumer products that come into contact with the skin...|$|R

30|$|Swedish and Norwegian {{potential}} {{consumers of}} eco-labeled wood products in <b>do-it-yourself</b> (DIY) retail <b>stores</b> were investigated {{in a study}} {{that focused on the}} end customers of two flooring applications and wood for outdoor decks. Data were collected from different populations yielding a multiproduct, multipopulation study. Consumers with preferences for eco-labeled wood products generally focused less on the product type than consumers that reported a low preference for eco-labeled wood properties. The green consumers presented a low price sensitivity and they were more often women. Other characteristics of green consumers observed in the substudies included a higher share of married couples/cohabiters, a secondary education, less advanced plans concerning purchase, and preferences for product warranty. The results can assist producers in making approximate descriptions of green consumers; however, socioeconomic and demographic variables should be complemented by other information that reflects attitudes and intentions to get a more comprehensive idea of green consumers of wood products.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} days of {{programming}} the concept of subroutines, and through this software reuse, was invented to spare limited hardware resources. Since then software systems have become increasingly complex and developing them {{would not have been possible}} without reusable software elements such as standard libraries and frameworks. Furthermore, other approaches commonly subsumed under the umbrella of software reuse such as product lines and design patterns have become very successful in recent years. However, there are still no software component markets available that would make buying software components as simple as buying parts in a <b>do-it-yourself</b> hardware <b>store</b> and millions of software fragments are still lying un(re) used in configuration management repositories all over the world. The literature primarily blames this on the immense effort required so far to set up and maintain searchable component repositories and the weak mechanisms available for retrieving components from them, resulting in a severe usability problem. In order to address these issues within this thesis, we developed a proactive component reuse recommendation system, naturally integrated into test-first development approaches, which is able to propose semantically appropriate, reusable components according to the specification a developer is just working on. We have implemented an appropriate system as a plugin for the well-known Eclipse IDE and demonstrated its usefulness by carrying out a case study from a popular agile development book. Furthermore, we present a precision analysis for our approach and examples of how components can be retrieved based on a simplified semantics description in terms of standard test cases...|$|R
