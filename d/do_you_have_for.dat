50|$|Rida {{was born}} in Kirkuk. As a child he would spontaneously break into song in the classroom, {{and he was so}} good that the teacher {{actually}} stopped to listen, even beginning the day by asking, “Rida, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> us today?” Rida shone in school plays and concerts, and began writing his own songs by the age of ten. His parents encouraged him, buying him instruments, in particular an oud, the principle instrument of Arabic composers. Rida adored classical Iraqi singers Nathem Al Ghazali and Mohammed Al Kubanji. Such elevated, beautiful music afforded the young man refuge from the chaos and oppression of the early Hussein years. At a time when singers were being pressured to sing for the regime, or not at all, Rida kept a low profile, singing, composing and practicing at home.|$|E

Using a grounded theory approach, common themes (such as being united) were developed and lead to a substantive theory of their transformative reintegration process. The collective voice of these ex‐ combatants challenges conventional reintegration programs by (a) challenging the demobilization prerogative showcasing how their unity was integral to their reintegration experience and (b) challenging the development model in which ex‐combatants are viewed as lacking capacity and in need of outside experts to deliver solutions. By highlighting how reliance on their own capacity resulted in their successful reintegration, these ex‐combatants believe their experience can assist other ex‐combatants around the world...|$|E
