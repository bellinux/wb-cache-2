5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not having <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with him on this issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Liverpool, {{he was put}} in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and was made a director of NEMS in 1955. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for only one day, was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. He did not want his parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a train ticket back to Liverpool. Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition of becoming an actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.|$|E
5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E

50|$|After {{returning}} to the stage, however, he accumulated <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> property in Georges Mills. This consisted first of considerable area on Prospect Hill, today 360 Prospect Hill, including both a large stone house and barns with a silo. Here Van had a large herd of registered Guernsey cows. Van was wearing his Van de Grift agricultural hat here, as explained below. The barns have seen later use as a summer stock theatre, stable and for many years an antique furniture barn.|$|R

He hopes <b>to</b> win <b>enough</b> prize <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a bungalow for him and his darling Bess. The Kid is fighting while battling a fever and although he knocks out Tiger Wilson, the song says [...] "Twas the fever that won the fight".|$|R
5|$|Lenny invites {{his friends}} in Springfield to a party at his apartment, where he tells them that he has adopted a new faith {{in the form of}} a brand new plasma screen television. Homer {{immediately}} falls in love with its high-definition picture, and begins to spend all his time at Lenny's home watching television. Marge sends over Bart and Lisa to convince him to come back but they too become enthralled. After a few days, Homer is kicked out by Lenny, and when he returns home he no longer enjoys watching his regular CRT television. Marge tells him that she has entered the family in a contest where first prize is a plasma screen television. Later, they get a call and discover that instead of first prize, they won the third prize: a trip to the studios of Fox Broadcasting Company. There, Homer learns of a reality show called Mother Flippers in which the mothers of two families switch places, and the grand prize happens to be <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a new plasma screen television.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{won in a}} card game by a {{plantation}} owner based in Santiago, and Lenormand de Mezy dies in abject poverty shortly afterwards. Ti Noel saves <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> his passage, and as a free man, he discovers a free Haiti. Now much older, he realizes that he {{has returned to the}} former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy. Haiti has undergone great development, and the land has come {{under the control of the}} black man. Ti Noel is abruptly thrown into prison and once again made to work as a slave among children, pregnant girls, women, and old men. Henri Christophe, formerly a cook and now king due to the black uprising, is using slaves to construct lavish statues, figures, and a magnificent fortress. Ti Noel considers slavery under a fellow black man worse than that endured at the hands of Lenormand de Mezy. In times past, the loss of a slave would be a financial loss, but as long as there are black women to continue supplying slaves, their deaths are insignificant. Ti Noel escapes and returns to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy, where he remains for some time, and later returns to the city to find it gripped by fear of Henri Christophe's regime. King Christophe is tormented by thunder strikes and ghosts of formerly tortured subjects, and eventually he and Sans-Souci Palace are overrun by the blacks and by voodoo. Left alone, he commits suicide and his body is taken by the remaining African pages to the magnificent fortress where they bury him in a pile of mortar. The entire mountain becomes the mausoleum of the first King of Haiti.|$|E

25|$|The {{heart of}} Turkey Run {{was owned by}} the Lusk family until 1915. The State Park Commission, run by Richard Lieber, had {{acquired}} $20,000 {{for the purchase of}} the area, but the Hoosier Veneer lumber company acquired it for $30,000. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway gave the commission <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the land from the lumber company for over $40,000.|$|E

25|$|In 1862, {{he began}} {{studying}} art under Charles Gleyre in Paris. There he met Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, and Claude Monet. At times, during the 1860s, {{he did not}} have <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> paint. Renoir had his first success at the Salon of 1868 with his painting Lise with a Parasol (1867), which depicted Lise Tréhot, his lover at the time. Although Renoir first started exhibiting paintings at the Paris Salon in 1864, recognition was slow in coming, {{partly as a result of}} the turmoil of the Franco-Prussian War.|$|E
25|$|Debogorski, Rowland, Jessee, Hall, and Kelly {{continue}} {{driving the}} Dalton Highway for Carlile this season. Debogorski {{had a good}} season, stopping to help drivers in trouble on multiple occasions. Rowland spent the season {{trying to avoid the}} Department of Transport (DOT) Weigh station. Jessee was assigned some of the toughest loads, to be taken over some of the roughest roads. Kelly started out the season with goals to achieve: she wanted to try hauling heavier, bigger loads and have a go at push-truck driving; she also aimed to save <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> back her horse. Both goals she eventually achieved.|$|E
25|$|As {{recounted in}} Barney Ross: The Life of a Jewish Fighter, by Ross biographer Douglas Century, {{in the wake}} of the tragedy, Dov became vindictive towards {{everything}} and turned his back on the orthodox religion of his father. He began running around with local toughs (including another wayward Jewish ghetto kid, the future Jack Ruby), developing into a street brawler, thief and money runner; he was even employed by Al Capone. Dov's goal was to earn <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a home so that he could reunite his family. He saw boxing as that vehicle and began training with his friend Ruby.|$|E

25|$|Farnham Maltings, Bridge Square {{was once}} a tannery; the site {{expanded}} {{to become part of}} the Farnham United Breweries, which included its own maltings. Taken over by a major brewer (Courage) brewing ceased but malting continued into the 1960s, when Courage planned to sell off the site for redevelopment. The people of Farnham raised <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the building so that it could be converted into a community centre for the town. Other buildings in Farnham once linked to the Farnham Maltings include The Oasthouse (now offices) in Mead Lane and The Hop Kiln (now private residences) on Weydon Lane.|$|E
25|$|Clyde Chestnut Barrow {{was born}} into a poor farming family in Ellis County, Texas, near Telico, a town just {{southeast}} of Dallas. He was the fifth of seven children of Henry Basil Barrow (1874 – 1957) and Cumie Talitha Walker (1874 – 1942). The family migrated, piecemeal, to Dallas in the early 1920s as part of a wave of resettlement from the impoverished nearby farms to the urban slum known as West Dallas. The Barrows spent their first months in West Dallas living under their wagon. When father Henry had put together <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a tent, it was a significant improvement for the family.|$|E
25|$|His {{first years}} were unsuccessful; the team's {{performance}} was poor, players frequently complained about salaries and bonuses, and Macri changed coaches three times. The only initial improvement was a partial {{reconstruction of the}} stadium. He arranged that Boca Juniors worked in the stock exchange, to earn <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new players. Macri's first coach was Carlos Salvador Bilardo, who brought 14 new players to the team and finished the tournament in 10th place. His second coach, Héctor Veira, also performed poorly. New coach Carlos Bianchi helped Juan Román Riquelme improve his performance, and had Martín Palermo and Guillermo Barros Schelotto as effective forwards. They won the first two tournaments, beginning a record 40-match unbeaten run.|$|E

25|$|When {{there was}} not <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> food for the yeshiva students, Rabbi Wasserman {{traveled}} to America {{to raise money for}} the yeshiva. Rabbi Wasserman made an impression on many young Jews that he met while in the United States. Rabbi Wasserman returned to Poland although he knew his life was in danger by returning. This was partly because he did not want to abandon his students, and partly because he took a dim view of American Jewry. In 1939, just before the Nazi invasion, he even forbade his students from accepting visas to the United States to study at Yeshiva University and what is now the Hebrew Theological College due to what he perceived as a spiritually dangerous atmosphere in these two institutions.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with David Letterman, Lewis talked about hitchhiking across the country back to New York City and how he learned to play the harmonica while waiting for rides. He talked about {{hanging out at the}} airport for three days until he stowed away on a plane to Europe. In later interviews, Lewis would reveal other encounters he had traveling around Europe. While visiting Aberdeen, Scotland, with no money and nowhere to sleep, he claimed that the locals were very hospitable by offering him somewhere to stay. In Madrid, Spain, he became an accomplished blues player as he hitchhiked and supported himself by busking with his harmonica. He gave his first concerts in Madrid, earning <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a plane ticket back to the USA.|$|E
25|$|The White Hart Lane {{ground was}} {{originally}} a disused nursery {{owned by the}} brewery Charringtons and located behind a public house named White Hart on Tottenham High Road (the actual White Hart Lane road lies {{a few hundred yards}} north of the main entrance). The ground was initially leased from Charringtons, and the stands they used at Northumberland Park were moved here, giving shelter for 2,5000 spectators. Notts County were the first visitors to 'the Lane' in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and provided in £115 in receipts; Spurs won 4–1. QPR became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1–0 to Tottenham. In 1905, Tottenham raised <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the freehold to the land as well as land at the northern (Paxton Road) end.|$|E
