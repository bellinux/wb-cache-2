5|$|Back {{to life in}} empty <b>Famagusta.</b>|$|E
5|$|The war, the {{pre-eminent}} {{episode of}} Sultan Selim II's reign, {{began with the}} Ottoman invasion of the Venetian-held island of Cyprus. The capital Nicosia and several other towns fell quickly to the considerably superior Ottoman army, leaving only <b>Famagusta</b> in Venetian hands. Christian reinforcements were delayed, and <b>Famagusta</b> eventually fell in August 1571 after a siege of 11 months. Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, {{but was unable to}} take advantage of this victory. The Ottomans quickly rebuilt their naval forces, and Venice was forced to negotiate a separate peace, ceding Cyprus to the Ottomans and paying a tribute of 300,000 ducats.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Nicosia, the {{fortress}} of Kyrenia in the north surrendered without resistance, and on 15 September, the Turkish cavalry appeared before the last Venetian stronghold, <b>Famagusta.</b> At this point already, overall Venetian losses (including the local population) were estimated by contemporaries at 56,000 killed or taken prisoner. The Venetian defenders of <b>Famagusta</b> numbered about 8,500 men with 90 artillery pieces and were commanded by Marco Antonio Bragadin. They would hold out for 11 months against a force that would come to number 200,000 men, with 145 guns, providing the time needed by the Pope to cobble together an anti-Ottoman league from the reluctant Christian European states. The Ottomans set up their guns on 1 September. Over the following months, they proceeded to dig a huge network of criss-crossing trenches for a depth of three miles around the fortress, which provided shelter for the Ottoman troops. As the siege trenches neared the fortress and came within artillery range of the walls, ten forts of timber and packed earth and bales of cotton were erected. The Ottomans however lacked the naval strength to completely blockade the city from sea as well, and the Venetians were able to resupply it and bring in reinforcements. After news of such a resupply in January reached the Sultan, he recalled Piyale Pasha and left Lala Mustafa alone {{in charge of the}} siege. At the same time, an initiative by Sokollu Mehmed Pasha to achieve a separate peace with Venice, foundered. The Grand Vizier offered to concede a trading station at <b>Famagusta</b> if the Republic would cede the island, but the Venetians, encouraged by their recent capture of Durazzo in Albania and the ongoing negotiations for the formation of a Christian league (see below), refused. Thus on 12 May 1571, the intensive bombardment of Famagusta's fortifications began, and on 1 August, with ammunition and supplies exhausted, the garrison surrendered the city. The Siege of <b>Famagusta</b> cost the Ottomans some 50,000 casualties. The Ottomans allowed the Christian residents and surviving Venetian soldiers to leave <b>Famagusta</b> peacefully but when Lala Mustafa learned that some Muslim prisoners had been killed during the siege he had Bragadin mutilated and flayed alive, while his companions were executed. Bragadin's skin was then paraded around the island, before being sent to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{after the}} {{unification}} of football federations, Nea Salamina used GSE Stadium. The city's Municipal Stadium {{was used by the}} team for training. This period lasted until 1974, when <b>Famagusta</b> was occupied by the Turkish Army after the Turkish invasion in Cyprus and the club was forced to move its headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In early 1949, {{volunteer}} {{construction work}} began on a municipal stadium in Saint John <b>Famagusta</b> parish. The stadium—the first in Cyprus with {{a roof over}} the stands—was built by supporters of the club and footballers and completed in 1952. It served as Nea Salamina's headquarters from 1952 to 1953.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} left-wing {{political}} beliefs, {{members of the}} new clubs were not accepted into the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) and they established a new football federation (the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation, or CAFF) in December 1948. The new federation organized leagues and cups, which attracted thousands of fans. The CAFF matches became more popular than those of the CFA. Six teams belonged to the CAFF: Nea Salamina in <b>Famagusta,</b> Omonia and Orfeas in Nicosia, Alki at Larnaca, AMOL at Limassol (renamed Antaeus in 1951) and Neos Asteras in Morphou.|$|E
5|$|Captain S. H. Carlill assumed command on 24 June and the Illustrious resumed deck-landing training. On 8 and 9 November the Supermarine 510 {{research}} aircraft {{made the}} first ever landings by a swept-wing aircraft aboard a carrier. This aircraft {{was one of the}} ancestors of the Supermarine Swift fighter. A month later the ship began a four-month refit and hosted the first carrier landing of the de Havilland Sea Venom on 9 July 1951. Later in the month she hosted the Sea Furies of 802 and the Fireflies of 814 Squadrons for Exercise Winged Fleet. Captain C. T. Jellicoe relieved Carlill on 27 August and the ship ferried 10 Fireflies of 814 Squadron to Malta beginning on 1 October. She exchanged them for Firebrands for the return voyage. On 3 November she began loading the 39th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom) of the 3rd Infantry Division in response to the riots in Cyprus that broke out when Egypt abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. She set sail two days later and arrived at <b>Famagusta</b> on 11 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 19 November and began loading the 45th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, and the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment two days later. Illustrious set sail on 23 November and reached <b>Famagusta</b> on 29 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 7 December and she did not leave harbour until 30 January 1952 when she resumed her customary role as a training ship.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} two seasons of the 1970s, Nea Salamina {{finished}} {{in the middle of}} the table; the next two seasons threatened relegation, which was avoided. The club's low point was 14 August 1974, when the occupation of <b>Famagusta</b> by Turkish troops led to Nea Salamina becoming a refugee club. Fans and players scattered to unoccupied areas of Cyprus and abroad. In October, board members met at the offices of Aris Limassol, deciding to revive the club. Since most players were in Larnaca, it was decided to make Larnaca the club's temporary home. Its offices were housed temporarily at the offices of Alki Larnaca F.C. and in January 1975 acquired a rented building. Expenses were paid with contributions from members and friends of the club. Two youth academies were founded, in Larnaca and Limassol.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Balotelli {{became the}} {{youngest}} Inter player (at 18 years and 85 days) to score in the Champions League when he scored a goal in a 3–3 draw against Cypriot side Anorthosis <b>Famagusta,</b> beating the previous record set by Obafemi Martins (at 18 years and 145 days). In an April 2009 match with Juventus where he scored Inter's only goal in a 1–1 draw, Balotelli was racially abused by Juventus fans throughout the game. This led Inter owner Massimo Moratti {{to say that he}} would have pulled the team off the pitch had he been present. The racist chants were also condemned by Juventus chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli and Juventus were given a one-game home-fan ban because of the incident. Inter won Serie A for the fourth time in a row.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{founding}} Nea Salamina sought to develop friendly {{relations with the}} Turkish Cypriots in <b>Famagusta,</b> and Turkish Cypriots (including Siekkeris, Nita and Moustafa) played during the early 1950s. When the team joined the CFA, it played against Turkish teams (including Demir Sports, Gençlik Gücü and the Mağusa Türk Gücü) in the second division. When Turkish Cypriot clubs began withdrawing from CFA tournaments of CFA in late 1955, the club tried to convince them to continue and Turkish players remained welcome in Nea Salamina. In 1962 Kallikas {{was transferred to the}} club, and in 1970 Neziak (of Turkish origin) was also transferred. In 2004 Turkish Cypriots Imam and Oulousoi were transferred to Nea Salamina, the first Turkish Cypriot footballers in the CAF in thirty years.|$|E
5|$|The 1955–56 Cypriot First Division saw {{the team}} {{participating}} {{for the first}} time as a newly promoted side. It finished third, four points behind champion AEL Limassol. Third position has been the team's highest finish, a position it has reached four times. Nea Salamina's first first-division game was against rival Anorthosis at their common ground, GSE Stadium. Nea Salamina won 3–2, its first victory against Anorthosis. The team's first years in first division saw victories over traditional league powerhouses APOEL FC, EPA Larnaca FC, Anorthosis <b>Famagusta</b> FC, Pezoporikos Larnaca and AC Omonia, at home and away.|$|E
5|$|With the Bábí {{community}} now irrevocably divided, {{the followers}} of Mirza Yahya tried to discredit Bahá'u'lláh to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government. While an investigation cleared Bahá'u'lláh, it did bring {{to the attention of}} the government that Bahá'u'lláh and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing that this might cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'Bábí' leaders. A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábís to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire— <b>Famagusta,</b> Cyprus for Mirza Yahya and his followers, and Acre, in Ottoman Palestine, for Bahá'u'lláh and his followers.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} of the new alliance, during the late summer, the Christian fleet {{assembled}} at Messina, under the command of Don John of Austria, who arrived on 23 August. By that time, however, <b>Famagusta</b> had fallen, and any effort to save Cyprus was meaningless. Before setting sail for the east, Don John {{had to deal with the}} mutual distrust and hostility among the various contingents, especially between the Venetians and the Genoese. The Spanish admiral tackled the problem by breaking the various contingents up and mingle ships from various states. Doria assumed command of the right wing, Don Juan kept the centre, the Venetian Agostino Barbarigo received the left, and the Spaniard Alvaro de Bazan the reserve. Unaware of Famagusta's fate, the allied fleet left Messina on 16 September, and ten days later arrived at Corfu, where it learned of the Ottoman victory. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Müezzinzade Ali Pasha, had anchored at Lepanto (Nafpaktos), near the entrance of the Corinthian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Bent {{completed}} {{a move to}} Tottenham Hotspur for a club record fee of £16.5million on 29 June 2007, {{which was to be}} payable over three years and is inclusive of add-on payments. Ipswich were entitled to 20% of Charlton's profit on Bent under a sell-on clause, which gave the club an initial £2.58million. He scored his first goal for Tottenham in a friendly match against Stevenage Borough in their first pre-season fixture of the 2007–08 season. Bent scored his first competitive goal for Tottenham in a 4–0 home victory over Derby County in August 2007. This was followed up by scoring in the 6–1 win over Anorthosis <b>Famagusta</b> {{in the first round of}} the UEFA Cup on 20 September 2007. Bent scored his 100th career goal on 9 March 2008 in the added time of a 4–0 league win over West Ham. He also scored the 100th goal to be scored at White Hart Lane during 2007–08 on 22 March in a 2–0 win over Portsmouth. Bent went on to score one more goal that season, against Newcastle United, which he finished with 36 appearances and 8 goals.|$|E
5|$|The 1965–66 {{season was}} one of the best (but painful) periods for Nea Salamina; the team arguably played the best {{football}} in Cyprus. The team contended for the championship until the last game of the season and lose its first cup final. In a game against APOEL at the old GSP stadium, Nea Salamina was leading 3–0. In the 62nd minute, an APOEL player hit a Nea Salamina's player; an APOEL grabbed and hid a linesman's flag. The game was halted, and the CFA ordered a rematch. The dispute lasted more than three weeks; in the meantime Nea Salamina was defeated by the bottommost team, Aris Limassol F.C.. In the penultimate match of the tournament Omonia and Salamina were tied for first place on points, and Olympiacos was one point behind. In the game against Olympiakos Nicosia Nea Salamina was leading 2–1, but Olympiakos tied the game in allegedly excessive extra time. After clashes in the last few seconds, the game was halted and ordered replayed. Omonia was in first place with 50 points; Nea Salamina was second with 47 and Olympiakos third with 46. With a victory over Olympiakos Nea Salamina would win the championship, since it had more goals than Omonia. On 31 May 1966 many buses and cars drove from <b>Famagusta</b> to Nicosia, where Nea Salamina was defeated 6–3. The best defense in the league, which had allowed fifteen goals in nineteen games, allowed six in one game. For a second time, Nea Salamina finished third. This defeat affected team morale in the cup final with rival Apollon Limassol; although it was favored, the team lost 4–2. During this period Salamina had the best defense in the league, with 21 goals in 20 games (a team record).|$|E
25|$|The walled city of <b>Famagusta</b> {{contains}} many unique buildings. <b>Famagusta</b> has a walled city popular with tourists. Every year, the International <b>Famagusta</b> Art and Culture Festival is organized in <b>Famagusta.</b> Concerts, dance shows and theater plays take {{place during the}} festival.|$|E
25|$|<b>Famagusta</b> is {{represented}} by Mağusa Türk Gücü in the Turkish Cypriot First Division. Dr. Fazıl Küçük Stadium is the largest football stadium in <b>Famagusta.</b> Many Turkish Cypriot sport teams that left Southern Cyprus because of the Cypriot intercommunal violence are based in <b>Famagusta.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Famagusta</b> {{was home}} to many Greek Cypriot sport teams that left the city because of the Turkish {{invasion}} and still bear their original names. Most notable football clubs originally from the city are Anorthosis <b>Famagusta</b> FC and Nea Salamis <b>Famagusta</b> FC, both of the Cypriot First Division, which are now based in Larnaca.|$|E

25|$|The mayor-in-exile of <b>Famagusta</b> is Alexis Galanos. İsmail Arter {{heads the}} Turkish Cypriot {{municipal}} administration of <b>Famagusta,</b> which remains legal as a communal-based body under the constitutional {{system of the}} Republic of Cyprus. Since 1974, Greek Cypriots submitted a number of proposals {{within the context of}} bicommunal discussions for the return of Varosha to UN administration, allowing the return of its lawful inhabitants, requesting also the opening of <b>Famagusta</b> harbour for use by both communities.|$|E
25|$|From {{its early}} days Nea Salamis <b>Famagusta</b> has {{supported}} a volleyball program, and since 1954 {{the club has}} organized popular amateur summer leagues and championships. Participants have included Anorthosis <b>Famagusta</b> FC, the Anagennisi Dherynia, Marathon Kato Varosha and ENAD Agios Memnon.|$|E
25|$|The Nea Salamis <b>Famagusta</b> men's volleyball team of {{is one of}} {{the best}} in Cyprus. With nine championships, eight cups and eight super cups, it has the second-largest number of trophies after Anorthosis <b>Famagusta</b> FC. The team's home is the indoor Spyros Kyprianou Athletic Center in Limassol.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the Ottoman rule, Latins lost their privileged status in <b>Famagusta</b> and were {{expelled}} from the city. Greek Cypriots were at first allowed to own and buy property in the city, but were banished from the walled city in 1573-74 and had to settle outside in the area that later developed into Varosha. Turkish families from Anatolia were resettled in the walled city but could not fill the buildings that previously hosted a population of 10,000. This caused a drastic decrease in the population of <b>Famagusta.</b> Merchants from <b>Famagusta,</b> who mostly consisted of Latins that had been expelled, resettled in Larnaca and as Larnaca flourished, <b>Famagusta</b> lost its importance as a trade centre. Over time, Varosha developed into a prosperous agricultural town thanks to its location away from the marshes, whilst the walled city remained dilapidated.|$|E
25|$|In this period, the {{urbanisation}} of <b>Famagusta</b> {{slowed down}} {{and the development of}} the rural areas accelerated. Therefore, economic growth was shared between the city of <b>Famagusta</b> and the district, which had a balanced agricultural economy, with citrus, potatoes, tobacco and wheat as main products. <b>Famagusta</b> maintained good communications with this hinterland. The city's port remained the island's main seaport and in 1961, it was expanded to double its capacity in order to accommodate the growing volume of exports and imports. The port handled 42.7% of Cypriot exports, 48.6% of imports and 49% of passenger traffic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Famagusta</b> has {{a modern}} volleyball stadium called the Mağusa Arena.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{teams in}} the Cyprus League include APOEL FC, Anorthosis <b>Famagusta</b> FC, AC Omonia, AEL Lemesos, Apollon FC, Nea Salamis <b>Famagusta</b> FC and AEK Larnaca FC. Stadiums or sports venues include the GSP Stadium (the largest in the Republic of Cyprus-controlled areas), Tsirion Stadium (second largest), Neo GSZ Stadium, Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium, Ammochostos Stadium and Makario Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Geographically, Ayia Napa lies near Cape Greco at {{the eastern}} part of Cyprus, just south of <b>Famagusta</b> and forms part of a larger area known as Kokkinochoria ("Red Villages", a name derived from the red colour of their soil). It is a town of <b>Famagusta</b> District, in the {{remaining}} southern part of the district occupied by Turkish forces in 1974.|$|E
25|$|From {{independence}} in 1960 to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus of 1974, <b>Famagusta</b> developed toward the south west of Varosha {{as a tourist}} centre. In the late 1960s <b>Famagusta</b> {{became one of the}} world's best-known entertainment and tourist centres. The contribution of <b>Famagusta</b> to the country's economic activity by 1974 far exceeded its proportional dimensions within the country. It possessed over 50% of the total hotel accommodation of Cyprus. Whilst its population was only about 7% of the total of the country, <b>Famagusta</b> by 1974 accounted for over 10% of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus, concentrating mainly on light industry compatible with its activity as a tourist resort and turning out high-quality products ranging from food, beverages and tobacco to clothing, footwear, plastics, light machinery and transport equipment. It contributed 19.3% of the business units and employed 21.3% {{of the total number of}} persons engaged in commerce on the island.|$|E
25|$|With the British takeover, <b>Famagusta</b> regained its {{significance}} as a port and an economic centre and its development was specifically targeted in British plans. As {{soon as the}} British took over the island, a <b>Famagusta</b> Development Act was passed that aimed at the reconstruction and redevelopment of the city's streets and dilapidated buildings as well as better hygiene. The port was developed and expanded between 1903 and 1906 and Cyprus Government Railway, with its terminus in <b>Famagusta,</b> started construction in 1904. Whilst Larnaca continued {{to be used as}} the main port of the island for some time, after Famagusta's use as a military base in World War I trade significantly shifted to <b>Famagusta.</b> The city outside the walls grew at an accelerated rate, with development being centred around Varosha. Varosha became the administrative centre as the British moved their headquarters and residences there and tourism grew significantly {{in the last years of}} the British rule. Pottery and production of citrus and potatoes also significantly grew in the city outside the walls, whilst agriculture within the walled city declined to non-existence. New residential areas were built to accommodate the increasing population towards the end of the British rule, and by 1960, <b>Famagusta</b> was a modern colonial port city extending far beyond Varosha and the walled city.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of Cyprus {{is divided}} into six districts: Nicosia, <b>Famagusta,</b> Kyrenia, Larnaca, Limassol and Paphos.|$|E
25|$|Other {{significant}} Turkish-Cypriot enclaves {{were that}} of <b>Famagusta,</b> of Lefka, of Tziaos (Serdarli), of Limasol, of Larnaka, of Pafos, of Limnitis, of Kokkina and of Louroutzina.|$|E
25|$|Anorthosis <b>Famagusta</b> {{defeated}} Alki Larnaca away 3–1 on October 2.

Okkas scored his goal after a good personal effort with powerful Left-footed shot. reduced the score {{at the end of}} the second half with the goal of Arnal Llibert after a pass of Dragoş Firţulescu.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the port}} {{was the primary}} source of income and {{employment}} for the city, especially right after 1974. However, it gradually lost some of its importance is the economy as the share of its employees in the population of <b>Famagusta</b> diminished due to various reasons. However, it still is the primary port for commerce in Northern Cyprus, with more than half of ships that came to Northern Cyprus in 2013 coming to <b>Famagusta.</b> It is the second most popular seaport for passengers, after Kyrenia, with around 20,000 passengers using the port in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The first Turkish units, {{including}} 4 M47 {{tanks and}} 11 M113 APCs, entered <b>Famagusta</b> at 17:30. They united with the Turkish-Cypriot units, {{but did not}} enter the undefended Greek-Cypriot district.|$|E
25|$|New York Salamina S.C., a Greek Cypriot {{football}} club founded in 1999 in New York City by New York Cypriot supporters of Nea Salamis <b>Famagusta,</b> plays in local amateur leagues.|$|E
25|$|The {{turning point}} for <b>Famagusta</b> was 1192 {{with the onset of}} Lusignan rule. It was during this period that <b>Famagusta</b> {{developed}} as a fully-fledged town. It increased in importance to the Eastern Mediterranean due to its natural harbour and the walls that protected its inner town. Its population began to increase. This development accelerated in the 13th century as the town became a centre of commerce for both the East and West. An influx of Christian refugees fleeing the downfall of Acre (1291) in Palestine transformed it from a tiny village into one of the richest cities in Christendom.|$|E
