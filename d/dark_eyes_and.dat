Like all gray horses, they have black skin, <b>dark</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> as adult horses, a white hair coat. Gray horses, {{including}} Lipizzans, are born darkusually bay or blackand become lighter each {{year as the}} graying process takes place, with the process being complete at between 6 and 10 years of age. Lipizzans are not actually true white horses, {{but this is a}} common misconception. A white horse is born white and has unpigmented skin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E

500|$|Raskolnikov (Rodion) is the protagonist, and {{the novel}} focuses {{primarily}} on his perspective. A 23-year-old man and former student, now destitute, Raskolnikov {{is described in}} the novel as [...] "exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well built, with beautiful <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> dark brown hair." [...] Perhaps the most striking feature of Raskolnikov, however, is his dual personality. On the one hand, he is cold, apathetic, and antisocial; on the other, he can be surprisingly warm and compassionate. He commits murder as well as acts of compulsive charity. His chaotic interaction with the external world and his nihilistic worldview {{might be seen as}} causes of his social alienation or consequences of it.|$|E

[...] Jourdain noted [...] "The man slowly turned his face, which was marked by smallpox; his complexion was very dark. The expression was evil and yet unseeing, and though I did not feel that he was looking particularly at us, I felt a repugnance to going past him. A man later described as [...] "tall... with large <b>dark</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat" [...] came up to them, and showed them the way to the Petit Trianon.|$|E

When {{she arrived in}} Rio de Janeiro on 5 November, she {{immediately}} {{fell in love with}} Pedro, who was far more charming and attractive than she had been led to expect. After [...] "years under a tropical sun, his complexion was still light, his cheeks rosy." [...] The 19-year-old prince was handsome and a little above average in height, with bright <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> dark brown hair. [...] "His good appearance", said historian Neill Macaulay, [...] "owed much to his bearing, proud and erect even at an awkward age, and his grooming, which was impeccable. Habitually neat and clean, he had taken to the Brazilian custom of bathing often." [...] The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy, occurred the following day. Seven children resulted from this marriage: Maria (later Queen Dona MariaII of Portugal), Miguel, João, Januária, Paula, Francisca and Pedro (later Emperor Dom PedroII of Brazil).|$|E
500|$|Ernest had {{suffered}} from a venereal disease in his late teens and early twenties, most likely as the consequence of living a wild, promiscuous lifestyle. These qualities he had inherited {{under the tutelage of}} his father, who took his sons to [...] "sample the pleasures" [...] of Paris and Berlin, to Albert's [...] "horror and shame". Ernest had been so visibly deteriorating in appearance as a result that Sarah Lyttelton, a lady-in-waiting of Queen Victoria, observed at Windsor in 1839 that he was [...] "very thin and hollow-cheeked and pale, and no likeness to his brother, nor much beauty. But he has fine <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> black hair, and light figure, and a great look of spirit and eagerness". Later that year, Albert counseled his brother against finding a wife until his 'condition' was fully recovered. He further warned that continued promiscuity could leave Ernest incapable of fathering children. Some historians believe that while he himself was able to father other children, the disease rendered his young wife infertile.|$|E

Joan Crawford {{has been described as}} the [...] "ultimate gay icon—the martyr who suffered for her art and, therefore, enabled herself to bond with this all-important faction of her fanbase." [...] In Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography, author Lawrence J. Quirk explains that Crawford appealed to gay men because they sympathized with her struggle for success, in both the entertainment industry and in her personal life. Though Crawford had been a notable film star during the 1930s and 1940s, according to David Bret, author of Joan Crawford: Hollywood Martyr, it was not until her 1953 film Torch Song that she was seen as a [...] "complete gay icon, primarily because it was shot in color." [...] Bret explains that seeing the actress' red hair, <b>dark</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> [...] "Victory Red" [...] lips linked her to [...] "gaydom's other sirens: Dietrich, Garland, Bankhead, Piaf, and new recruits Marilyn Monroe and Maria Callas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon after 2:35a.m., {{a man who}} {{was later}} given the {{pseudonym}} Alan Masters was driving through an intersection {{a few blocks from the}} park. Masters was nearly struck by what he described as a yellow Volkswagen Beetle that sped through the intersection without its headlights activated as the driver ignored a red light. Angered and alarmed, Masters followed the Volkswagen at high speed for several minutes before losing sight of the vehicle. Masters described the driver as a white male in his late 20s or early 30s, with a narrow face, dark, long, stringy hair, several days' growth of dark whiskers on his face, and wearing a blue jacket. Masters was upset and he neglected to note the Volkswagen's license plate number, but he thought that it might have been a New Jersey rather than a New York plate. Violante encountered a very similar man, because he and Moskowitz were in the park shortly before they were shot.
