Furthermore, to have better accuracy on the measurement of film thickness, direct monitoring is a must. Direct monitoring implies acquiring spectrum data from the optical component undergoing the film deposition itself, in real time. In making film depositions on surfaces of optical components, the high vacuum <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber</b> {{is the most popular}} equipment. Inside the evaporator, {{at the top of the}} chamber, there is a metallic support with several holes where the optical components are assembled. This metallic support has rotary motion to promote film homogenization. To acquire a measurement of the spectrum of the film in deposition, it is necessary to pass a light beam through a glass witness undergoing the film deposition process, and collect a sample of the light beam using a spectrometer. As both the light beam and the light collector are stationary, a synchronization system is required to identify the moment at which the optical component passes through the light beam...|$|E
5000|$|Naturally {{occurring}} underground brine {{from the}} Wincham brinefield was pumped {{to the surface}} via a borehole. Such natural or wild brine pumping differs from controlled brine pumping, where water is pumped underground into rock to dissolve rock salt deposits. The process has historically been associated with subsidence, {{which has been a}} major problem in the Northwich area. The brine was purified by treatment with sodium carbonate and lime, and the salt extracted using a closed-pan partial vacuum evaporation method. The technique was adapted from the sugar industry, and had first been applied to salt extraction in 1887 in Silver Springs, New York. First tried commercially in the UK as early as 1901, several British manufacturers started up vacuum evaporator plants using a small Mirlees-type evaporator in parallel with their open-pan operations after the First World War. James Stubbs had learned about the method of vacuum evaporation in Michigan in 1905, and the New Cheshire Works was one of the early companies to adopt the vacuum evaporation method, importing an evaporator in the 1930s. Described as [...] "magnificent" [...] by journalist Mark Kurlansky, the company's first evaporator had three chambers; it had an Art Deco design, and was decorated with stripes in dark and pale wood, with brass fittings. The company updated the evaporator in the 1950s and the 1990s. In the 2000s, the works was using a small Svenson system with three <b>evaporator</b> <b>chambers</b> (termed [...] "effects").|$|R

The dimensions of the <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber</b> were 200 × 200 × 55, 200 × 200 × 65 and 200 × 200 × 75 mm (W × L × H). The adiabatic and condenser section had an 8 -loops thermosyphon.

The reactor containment {{at the time of}} accident is presently mimicked by administering steam in the <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber</b> ~ 1 bar / 100 oC (high pressure tests will be reported later). The condenser chamber is modeled as heat sink containing a stagnant pool of water. The latent heat of condensation of the steam is transferred to the stagnant pool of water through the thermosyphon or the PHP, as per the case. The axial cross-sectional area and the radial surface area for heat transfer are kept identical for both the thermosyphon and the PHP. In this way a direct comparison of the thermal performance of these two devices was possible. We find that while both the devices transferred approximately the same amount of heat (~ 500 W), the average Nusselt number for PHP was higher than the thermosyphon, indicating that it operated at a lesser temperature difference between the wall and the coolant fluid, i. e., PHP had a higher effective thermal conductivity than the thermosyphon...|$|E
40|$|Following an {{extensive}} program to develop, qualify and certify small scale loop heat pipes (LHPs) for future space applications, several design issues and applicability must be considered. The optimization {{and integration of}} LHPs have somehow faced certain complications regarding the compensation chamber characteristics. It has been noticed that depending on the geometry of the compensation chamber, integrating the LHP to the space device (electronics, batteries, etc) could be relatively complicated. As an effort in developing LHPs for future space missions, a LHP was designed and tested, where two different configurations of the compensation chamber were experimentally investigated, for a system operating with acetone as the working fluid. The experimental results present the difference on the thermal performance of the LHP that directly affects the loop’s operation temperature. Besides the different thermal behavior verified during the tests, the geometric characteristics of each configuration must be carefully evaluated during the LHP design and when integrating it to the device where the thermal control is required, as well as analyzing which configuration is more indicated for microgravity applications.

40|$|Silicon is {{the most}} {{important}} semiconductor material used in microelectronic devices. As the number of transistors keep doubling every 24 months (Moore’s law), transistors continue scaling down in size, electrical interconnect is reaching its limits {{to keep up with the}} scaling down rate in integrated circuits. These limitations are related to interconnect density and power consumption. Hence, replacing electrical interconnect with optical interconnect on the chip or between chips has the ability to overcome these limitations. However, silicon has poor light emitting efficiency, and other substitutes such as III-V materials are not suitable due to high cost, lattice mismatch, and thermal mismatch with Si. Recently researchers have been developing novel group IV alloys from silicon, germanium, and tin to overcome these problems. In this research a less developed group IV alloy, GePb, as well as GeSn, have been studied for the development of optoelectronic devices.

In this model, both surface finish and optical view factors are taken into consideration in the computation of solar radiation that effectively reaches the surface of saline water in the distillation system. The model was applied to a conventional solar still and an advanced solar still with. separate condenser. The conventional solar still was tested at New Delhi (28 o 35 ¢ N, 77 o 12 ¢ E) in previous work while the advanced distillation system was developed in this investigation and it comprised three basins with saline water. Basin 1 was fitted horizontally in the <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber,</b> with the condenser chamber housing basins 2 and 3.

Before growths, Au thin films with different thicknesses (namely, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 nm, respectively) were deposited onto three batches of GaAs (111)B substrates using an electron beam evaporator under high vacuum (< 4 × 10 − 6 Torr). The thickness of the Au film is measured by a carefully calibrated single-crystal sensor in the <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber.</b> For each batch, substrates with different thicknesses of Au films were then loaded into a MOCVD reactor simultaneously to ensure the identical growth conditions {{for the purpose of}} direct comparison. Firstly, two annealing experiments were carried out at 600 °C and 650 °C for 10 min in AsH 3 ambient for two batches of Au-coated (111)B substrates, respectively. For the third batch, the growth of GaAs nanowires was carried out under a pressure of 100 mbar and a total input gas flow rate of 15 slm. Prior to the nanowire growth, the substrates of the third batch were annealed in the growth chamber at 600 °C for 10 min under AsH 3 ambient. The annealing temperature of 600 °C was chosen based on the results from the first two annealing batches. The growth temperature of the nanowires was set at 450 °C. The flow rates of TMGa and AsH 3 were set at 1.16 × 10 − 5 mol/min and 5.36 × 10 − 4 mol/min, respectively, resulting in an overall V/III ratio of 46.

5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{applications}} for vapor chambers. First, they are used when high powers and heat fluxes are applied to a relatively small evaporator. [...] Heat input to the evaporator vaporizes liquid, which flows in two dimensions to the condenser surfaces. After the vapor condenses on the condenser surfaces, capillary forces in the wick return the condensate to the evaporator. Note that most vapor chambers are insensitive to gravity, and will still operate when inverted, with the evaporator above the condenser. In this application, the vapor chamber acts as a heat flux transformer, cooling a high heat flux from an electronic chip or laser diode, and transforming it to a lower heat flux that can be removed by natural or forced convection. With special <b>evaporator</b> wicks, vapor <b>chambers</b> can remove 2000 W over 4 cm2, or 700 W over 1 cm2.|$|R

40|$|Recently, vapour {{compression}} using ejectors {{has received}} more interest from researchers in the air conditioning and refrigeration eld. Ejectors {{have the advantage of}} being extremely reliable with stable operation and no moving parts leading to essentially maintenance free operation. However, ejectors have very low eciencies and this {{can be attributed to the}} low entrained mass flow rate of the secondary stream relative to the primary stream mass ow rate. The entrainment and mixing between primary and secondary streams is therefore a dominant feature which requires investigation. This thesis introduces and demonstrates new methods to characterise the mixing process in a vapour compression ejector operated with steam as the working fluid. A new steam ejector refrigeration apparatus was built to visualise the mixing flow inside the ejector. New designs for the steam generator and the <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber</b> were used in this apparatus. The <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber</b> was developed in order to weigh the amount of water induced from the evaporator during the test time. The weighing method was demonstrated to be suciently accurate for this application. The highest percentage dierence between the direct weighing method and a thermal method for deducing the secondary stream mass flow rate was 2. 6 %, corresponding to about 0. 3 % of the entrainment ratio. A CFD simulation tool called Eilmer 3 (developed by the Compressible Flow CFD group of the University of Queensland) was used to simulate the flow within the axisymmetric geometry of the steam ejector. The Eilmer 3 computational simulations adopted an ideal gas model for the steam throughout the ejector. The distribution of static pressure within the ejector was accurately simulated for different primary and secondary stream conditions and different condenser pressures. The difference between experimental data and the Eilmer 3 simulations of static wall pressure was typically less than 2 %. The difference between experimental data and the Eilmer 3 simulation of entrainment ratio was 2. 9 % at 130 � primary stream temperature and 2. 6 % at 120 � primary stream temperature for choked ejector operation. For ejector operation at unckoked conditions, differences between experimental results and the simulations were substantial with the critical condenser pressure typically underestimated in the simulation by around 8. 8 % at 270 kPa primary stream pressure and 15. 4 % at 200 kPa primary stream pressure. To enable visualisation of the ejector flow, a transparent acrylic duct was optically designed using a ray tracing method. The machined and polished optical duct performed as expected in that it provided a field of view over the entire height of the duct. However, the planned schileren visualisation could not proceed with the optical duct because of shadowing effects attributed to birefringence in the duct material. Nevertheless the optical duct was successfully used to gain photographic evidence of liquid water and ice building up within the ejector. The presence of liquid and solid forms of water within the ejector suggests the ideal gas model cannot generally be applied to the steam ejector flows even though a good degree of success was achieved in modelling the static pressure distribution and entrainment ratio under choked flow conditions. A new technique for exploring the mixing region generated by the steam ejector nozzle was introduced. The new approach used a pilot tube to measure the pressure profile at different positions downstream of the nozzle exit within a mixing chamber with a relatively large rectangular cross section. A special pilot probe and traversing mechanism was designed and fabricated for this purpose. The experimental results demonstrate a shock train was established downstream of the nozzle exit. The experimental measurements indicate that pressure wave effects within the mixing jet have largely dissipated by the 70 mm downstream location. Eilmer 3 simulations were also used to investigate the flow at the nozzle exit. Eilmer 3 simulations duplicate experimental pilot pressure data at the first station downstream of the nozzle exit (1 mm) but are not consistent with the pilot pressure measurements at the other positions (25, 50, and 70 mm). A momentum integral analysis of a control volume in the mixing chamber was attempted. Using the Eilmer 3 simulation at the nozzle exit, the momentum transport into the control volume was calculated. The momentum transport out of the control volume was the estimated using experimental data at the 70 mm station based on an ideal gas analysis and an assumed constant static pressure across the jet. To reflect possible condensation effects, values for the ratio of specific heat lower than = 1. 326 were trialled in the analysis in an attempt to achieve the required momentum transport out of the control volume. However, even with = 1. 001 the momentum transport out the control volume was too high, indicating that an in flow momentum transport contribution due to recirculation across the downstream station may be significant although it was not included in the analysis. The schlieren method was used to visualize the steam flow at the exit from the nozzle inside the rectangular mixing chamber which was also used in the pilot pressure surveys. The schlieren arrangement followed Toepler's method with one lens. An edge feature of the steam jet downstream of the nozzle was detected using an image analysis process applied to the video record from the schlieren visualisation. The stagnation conditions of the steam were 380 kPa and 144 � in this case, and the background pressure in the mixing chamber was 3 kPa. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a dynamic model to simulate a whole household refrigeration unit {{taking into account}} both the refrigeration cycle itself and the refrigerated compartments network. The methodology implemented to achieve the transient simulation of the whole system combines a steady-state approach for the refrigerating cycle loop with a transient approach for the refrigerated compartments loop. Both loops are solved at each time step (the linking boundary conditions for the refrigerating cycle and the compartments network are the air temperature of the <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber</b> and the heat generated by the evaporator, respectively). The numerical infrastructure implemented to simulate the whole system and its elements is described in [1]. On one hand, the refrigerating cycle loop includes appropriate numerical models for the main components, namely, hermetic compressor, wire-and-tube condenser, non-adiabatic capillary tube [2], and finned-tube evaporator. In addition, the receiver located at the outlet position of the evaporator, is also considered and modeled according to [3]. On the other, the refrigerated compartments loop {{is made up of}} connected chambers and a damper to regulate the cold air flow going to the refrigerator and freezer. The transient solution of the system includes two important features: i) a numerical model for the refrigerating cycle when the compressor is turned off, and ii) a control system to regulate the compartments temperatures by means of the damper position and the compressor working condition. In {{the first part of this}} work the main details of the resolution procedure and the numerical model of both the whole system and all its components are given. In the second part a set of parametric studies to analyse the influence of specific aspects of the main elements on the refrigerating cycle is carried out, namely, arrangements of fins and tubes in the evaporator, non-adiabatic capillary tube geometrical configurations, and gap between wire-and-tube condenser and rear wall. The trends of the numerical results are compared against experimental data at similar conditions. In the last section, an illustrative numerical case including most of the model features is shown in order to see the model potential. REFERENCES [1] N. Ablanque, C. Oliet, J. Rigola, O. Lehmkuhl, C.

Weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs), in particular the lightest neutralino, {{are the most popular}} DM candidates within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Many groups in the world are focussing their attention on the direct detection of DM in the laboratory. The detectors should have large target masses and excellent noise rejection capabilities because of the small cross section between DM and ordinary matter (σWIMP−nucleon < 4 · 10 − 8 pb). Noble liquids are today considered {{to be one of the}} best options for large-size DM experiments, as they have a relatively low ionization energy, good scintillation properties and long electron lifetime. Moreover noble liquid detectors are easily scalable to large masses. This thesis deals with the development of a large (1 ton) LAr WIMP detector (ArDM) which could measure simultaneously light and charge from the scintillation and the ion- ization of liquid argon. Argon vacuum ultra violet (VUV) scintillation light has to be converted with wavelength shifter (WLS) materials such as TetraPhenyl Butadiene (TPB) in order to be detected by photomultipliers with bialkali photocathodes. This thesis de- scribes the research and developments performed to detect the 128 nm VUV light with high efficiency and low threshold. The scintillation light from α particles in gaseous (GAr) and liquid argon (LAr) was used for the development of an optimal WLS coated reflector. Different coating techniques were investigated and optimized. The best results were achieved using the evaporation technique, a teflon membrane (Tetratex) as reflector material, and a WLS surface density of 1 mg/cm 2 (TPB). The LAr scintillation light was studied for different projectiles. The relative intensities of the scintillation components were measured for α−particles, electrons and muons. Neutron induced argon nuclear recoils were also measured. An <b>evaporator</b> <b>chamber</b> was constructed for the evaporation of the WLS on large surfaces. This research and development was preparatory for the construction of the ArDM light readout which is composed mainly of two parts: the side reflector and the light detector. The side reflector was segmented in panels which were coated using the large evaporator. The light detector is composed of an array of 14 × 8 ” cryogenic photomultipliers (PMTs). Different cryogenic PMTs were tested in the laboratory. A light readout system with the side reflector and 8 PMT modules with different coatings on the photocathodes, was assembled at CERN at the end of 2007. The data acquisition (DAQ) system was developed and tested. The performances of the light readout were measured in GAr and LAr using a movable internal Am α−source and external radioactive sources in different configurations.

[4] {{analyzed}} the flow-induced vibration of heat transfer tube in <b>evaporator</b> heating <b>chamber.</b> The shedding frequency of vortex street, natural frequency and critical flow velocity were all calculated. Results {{show that the}} Karman vortex and turbulence buffeting occur at the entrance with high velocity of water vapor. While, the resonance of heat transfer tube occur because the shedding frequency {{is similar to the}} natural frequency of tube. The coupling effect of vibration and temperature difference stress lead to the fatigue damage of tube. In ocean engineering, fatigue failure of marine risers due to flow-induced vibration {{is one of the most}} significant failure modes. Xue et al. [5] proposed a new prediction model of FIV fatigue damage for riser considering both cross-flow and in-line vibrations based on the energy equilibrium theory. The effect of top velocity of sheared current, top tension, fluid density and the material of structure on the fatigue damage were discussed. Results reveal that the displacement of in-line vibration is much less than the value of cross-flow. However, there is a same important level for both fluid flows because high vibration frequency occurs in in-line vibration. The top velocity of sheared current plays a great role on the fatigue damage. The fatigue damage may be reduced 50 % owing to the 10 % reduction in top velocity of sheared current. Sun et al. [6] investigated the fatigue damage of riser undergoing in-line and cross-flow flow-induced vibration using pseudo-excitation method. Results show that the position near the top of the riser Z/LR[*]=[*] 0.9 is the dangerous point. The fatigue damage is mainly subjected to the cross-flow vibration. Wang et al. [7] experimentally studied the fatigue damage caused by vortex-induced vibration based on rain-flow counting and a standard S–N curve in an ocean basin. Results show that amplitude modulation and mode transition dominate the fatigue of flexible cylinder. Ei et al. [8] studied the effect of tube support clearance on the flow-induced vibration of steam generators. Special emphasis was placed on crack propagation and leakage rates. The developed model was established based on the stress-time history due to the flow-induced vibration. Results show that clearances below 0.3  mm are crucial to restricting crack growth rates to acceptable levels.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{management}} of laptops is an increasingly challenging task {{because of the}} high-heat flux associated with the microprocessors and the limited space available for the thermal control system inside the cabinet. In this paper, results are discussed from an investigation of two different designs of miniature loop heat pipes (mLHPs) for thermal control of compact electronic devices including notebooks. Two prototypes of mLHP, one with a disk-shaped evaporator, 30 mm diameter and 10 mm thick, {{and the other with}} a rectangular-shaped evaporator, 47 Ã¿Â¿ 37 mm 2 plan area and 5 mm thick, were designed to handle heat fluxes up to 50 W/cm 2. In the disk-shaped <b>evaporator,</b> the compensation <b>chamber</b> was incorporated into the overall thickness of the evaporator, whereas for the rectangular-shaped evaporator a new design approach was used in which the compensation chamber was positioned {{on the sides of the}} wick structure such that it was coplanar with the evaporator section. The new design approach helped to decrease the thickness of the rectangular evaporator by 50 % and therefore improved the ability to integrate miniature loop heat pipe technology into compact electronics enclosures. All of the thermal tests on mLHP prototypes were conducted in horizontal configurations. Total thermal resistance of the designed mLHPs was between 1 and 5 Ã¿Âº C/W. A comparative study of the mLHPs with conventional heat pipe and microchannel-based active liquid cooling systems has shown the superior heat transfer capability of the passively operating loop scheme for high-heat flux applications, and helped to classify mLHPs as candidates for laptop thermal management...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a steady three-dimensional numerical simulation of a flat <b>evaporator</b> and compensation <b>chamber</b> (CC) of a loop heat pipe (LHP) and describes a procedure of the thermal state calculation of the evaporator and the compensation chamber. The LHP is an efficient heat transfer device operating {{on the principle of}} evaporation-condensation cycle. It is successfully used in space technology and also to cool the heat-stressed components of electronic devices and computer equipment.  The authors carried out a numerical study of the influence of the condensate pipeline length, immersed in water, on the thermal state of the evaporator and the compensation chamber.  The paper shows the influence of the mass forces field on the calculation results. Presents all the numerical studies carried out by the authors for a brass flat evaporator with a thermal load of 80 W. Water is used as a LHP heat-transfer fluid. Fields of temperature, pressure and velocity are presented for each design option. Based on the calculation results, the authors came to the following conclusions: Influence of the mass forces field for the LHP of this type is significant and leads to arising water vortex flow in the condensate pipeline and CC, thereby mixing and equalizing the water temperature in the CC and in the porous element, reducing the maximum temperature of the porous element; The increasing section length of the condensate pipeline in the CC leads to increasing velocity of the heat-transfer fluid in the CC and in the porous element, decreasing mixing zone of the condensate in the CC, and increasing temperature non-uniformity of the porous element. </ol...|$|R
40|$|Two phase heat {{transfer}} devices {{based on the}} miniature version of loop heat pipe (LHP) can provide very promising cooling solutions for the compact electronic devices due to their high heat flux management capability and long distance {{heat transfer}} with minimal temperature losses. This paper discusses {{the effect of the}} wick properties on the heat transfer characteristics of the miniature LHP. The miniature model of the LHP with disk-shaped evaporator, 10 mm thick and 30 mm disk diameter, was designed using copper containment vessel and water as the working fluid, which is the most acceptable combination in electronic cooling applications. In the investigation, wick structures with different physical properties including thermal conductivity, pore radius, porosity, and permeability and with different structural topology including monoporous or biporous evaporating face were used. It was experimentally observed that copper wicks are able to provide superior thermal performance than nickel wicks, particularly for low to moderate heat loads due to their low heat conducting resistance. With monoporous copper wick, maximum evaporator heat transfer coefficient (hev) of 26, 270 W/m 2 K and evaporator thermal resistance (Rev) of 0. 06 – 0. 10 °C/W were achieved. For monoporous nickel wick, the corresponding values were 20, 700 W/m 2 K for hev and 0. 08 – 0. 21 °C/W for Rev. Capillary structure with smaller pore size, high porosity, and high permeability showed better heat transfer characteristics due to sufficient capillary pumping capability, low heat leaks from <b>evaporator</b> to compensation <b>chamber</b> and larger surface area to volume ratio for heat exchange. In addition to this, biporous copper wick structure showed much higher heat transfer coefficient of 83, 787 W/m 2 K than monoporous copper wick due to improved evaporative heat transfer at wick wall interface and separated liquid and vapor flow pores. The present work was able to classify the importance of the wick properties in the improvement of the thermal characteristics for miniature loop heat pipes...|$|R
