50|$|<b>Dantron</b> has {{the notable}} side-effect of causing red-colored urine.|$|E
50|$|In the USA, <b>dantron</b> is {{not used}} because it is {{considered}} to be a carcinogen.|$|E
50|$|Co-danthrusate is a {{combination}} of <b>dantron</b> and docusate. <b>Dantron</b> is a mild peristaltic stimulant which acts on the lower bowel to encourage normal bowel movement without causing irritation. It belongs to the group of medicines under the term stimulant laxative. It stimulates the nerves in the stomach wall which causes the stomach muscles to contract. This medicine is used for analgesic-induced constipation. It takes six to twelve hours to work. This can cause discoloration of urine and bowel and liver tumors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dantron</b> (INN), {{also known}} as chrysazin or 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, is an organic substance, {{formally}} derived from anthraquinone by the replacement of two hydrogen atoms by hydroxyl groups (-OH). It is used in some countries as a stimulant laxative.|$|E
50|$|Docusate {{should not}} be used in {{addition}} to mineral oil, as the emulsifier will result in mineral oil being absorbed rather than functioning as a lubricant for the bowel walls, possibly resulting in foreign body granulomas. The substance also might increase resorption of other drugs, for example, <b>dantron</b> (1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone).|$|E
50|$|Co-danthramer is <b>dantron</b> plus poloxamer. It is (in the U.K.) {{only to be}} {{prescribed}} to terminally ill patients due to carcinogen reactions in rats. It is often prescribed to people taking long term opioid, because it relaxes the effect of opioid induced constipation. It will not alleviate the symptoms of opioid induced delayed gastric emptying and abdominal cramps.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between opioid dose, <b>dantron</b> dose, bowel function and physical functioning (measured with the modified Barthel Index) was determined {{in a sample}} of 50 inpatients with advanced cancer. Data were collected prospectively from chart review and patient interviews one week after admission to allow for protocol-driven management of constipation to be established. Bowel scores were significantly reduced in 35 patients treated with opioids compared with 15 patients not treated with opioids. Within the opioid group, however, there was no {{relationship between}} opioid dose, bowel score, <b>dantron</b> dose or Barthel Index. Higher doses of <b>dantron</b> were associated with better physical functioning (but not opioid dose) suggesting that for any given dose of opioid, fitter patients were treated with larger doses of laxatives. Factors other than opioid dose and physical functioning may be more important in contributing to constipation in this group of patients. Less potent opioid drugs, such as codeine, are just as likely to cause constipation as more potent opioids...|$|E
40|$|The {{decomposition}} of 10 -substituted anthralin derivatives in dimethyl sulfoxide and ethanol was determined. While 10 -ω-phenylalkylidene derivatives were thoroughly stable, 10 -ω-phenylacyl-substituted compounds were slowly degraded to danthron {{and the corresponding}} carboxylic acids. However, the stability of these derivatives was markedly improved as {{compared to that of}} anthralin. Determination of the pKa values showed that the ω-phenylacyl derivatives were somewhat stronger acids than anthralin, while ω-phenylalkylidene-substitutiong enerally leaves the acidity of the anthralin part unchanged. Die Zersetzung 10 -substituiertex Anthralinderivate in Dimethylsulfoxid und Ethanol wurde bestimmt. Während 1 0 -ω-Phenylalkyliden-Derivate stabil waren, wurden 10 -ω-PhenyIacyl-subsituierte Verbindungen langsam zu <b>Dantron</b> und den entspr. Carbonsiiuren abgebaut. Dennoch war die Stabilitiit dieser Verbindungen im Vergleich zu Anthralin wesentlich höher. Die Bestimmung der pKkWerte zeigte, daB die ω-Phenylacyl-Derivate etwas stärker sauer als Anthralin sind, während ω-Phenylalkyliden-Substitution im allgemeinen die Acidität des Anthralin-Anteils nicht verändert...|$|E
