In 2015 they came the closest to winning a major title, finishing runners up in the Thai League Cup.Bulgarian Popov has been tasked to ensure Sisaket FC, the Thai Premier League relegation battlers,finish out of the last 3 teams {{in the bottom of the}} table-the current position of the team at the moment after 6 matches with only 3 points after one win and five defeats.Popov last coached in Thailand in 2014, with Suphanburi FC before leaving to take up the Maldives national team head coach post in 2015.Popov then joined Kelantan mid-way through the 2016 Malaysia Super League season, overturning the Red Warriors' poor performance and guiding them to a fourth-place finish in the league, and the quarter-final stage of the 2016 Malaysia Cup.However he left the Kota Bharu-based side at the end of the season, after the club could not meet his requirements for a contract extension.Despite the short time and the difficult schedule, Popov's Sisaket FC managed to win 15 points by the end of the first half of the season in the Thai Premier league T1 and after the fundamental wins against the direct rivals Sukhothai and Thai Honda managed to climb the team over the area of the relegation zone by equalizing points but with advantage in the direct duels with Sukhothai and Thai Honda.The cruccial away win against Thai Honda was the first away win for Sisaket FC after more than one year in all domestic competitions.Velizar Popov has officially parted ways with Sisaket FC on good terms after mutual agreement with the management of the club stepped down from the team on August 1, according to the announcement from the Thai Premier League 1 side.His decision was announced on Tuesday,August 1, after the 41-year-old officially had a meeting with the club president and managers and handed in the resignation to withdraw from the coaching responsibility.Popov {{returns to the}} Thai League 1 as Sisaket FC head coach in March 2017, after last coaching in the country in 2014 with Suphanburi FC. After that, he left the country to take up the Maldives national team head coach post in 2015.He then joined Malaysia Super League side Kelantan in 2016, and successfully guided them to a fourth-place finish in the league, even took the Red Warriors to the quarter-final stage of the 2016 Malaysia Cup.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kouprey</b> {{are legally}} {{protected}} in all range states {{and may be}} present in some protected areas. Prince Sihanouk designated it as the national animal of Cambodia in the 1960s, partly due to its mystique. In 1988 an International Workshop on <b>Kouprey</b> Conservation {{was held in the}} University of Hanoi. This workshop worked towards the responsible government agencies and interested donors to agree upon a workable and realistic action plan to save the <b>kouprey.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A <b>kouprey</b> (Bos sauveli, from គោព្រៃ, , [...] "forest ox"; {{also known}} as kouproh, [...] "grey ox"), is a little-known, forest-dwelling, wild bovine species from Southeast Asia. A young male {{was sent to the}} Vincennes Zoo in 1937 where it was {{described}} by the French zoologist Achille Urbain and was declared the holotype. The <b>kouprey</b> has a tall, narrow body, long legs, a humped back and long horns.|$|E
50|$|Research {{published}} by Northwestern University in London's Journal of Zoology indicated {{a comparison of}} mitochondrial sequences showed the <b>kouprey</b> might be a hybrid between a zebu and a banteng. However, {{the authors of this}} study rescinded their conclusion. Because a fossilized skull was found dating from the late Pleistocene or early Holocene epoch, they concluded the <b>kouprey</b> is not a hybrid. More recent genetic analysis has supported this position.|$|E

5000|$|Large mammal surveys {{continue}} {{to take place in}} Cambodia, hoping to rediscover living <b>kouprey.</b> Other surveys have been taking place in the kouprey's historical range as recently as 2011. These surveys were done to determine the regions in their range with the highest probability of the kouprey's persistence. This is based on the habitat type and survey effort to date. During the last decade, several searches for the animal have proven fruitless. No <b>kouprey</b> have been sighted since 1988.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{estimated}} to be fewer than 250 <b>kouprey</b> left in the world. There is some speculation on {{whether or not they are}} already extinct.|$|E
50|$|The <b>kouprey</b> is {{believed}} to be a close relative of the aurochs, gaur, and banteng. A very large ungulate, the <b>kouprey</b> can approach similar sizes to the wild Asian water buffalo. These bovids measure 2.1 to 2.3 m along the head and body, not counting a 1 m tail, and stand 1.7 - 1.9 m high at the shoulder. Their weight is reportedly from 680 to 910 kg. Unverified reports of a body mass up to 1700 kg from Vietnam are considered dubious, since they far exceed other recorded weights for the species.|$|E
50|$|The Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary is {{the largest}} {{protected}} area in Cambodia and was set aside to protect the critically endangered, possibly extinct <b>Kouprey.</b> It {{is located in the}} northern plains of Cambodia, near the border to Thailand.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kouprey</b> form small herds {{led by a}} female, and graze on grasses, feeding in {{the forest}} {{during the day and}} in the open at night. They are {{affected}} by degradation of their habitat and are hunted for their meat, horns and skull.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remaining}} {{forests are}} home to some large mammals including Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), Eld's deer (Cervus eldii) and three species of wild cattle the gaur (Bos gaurus), the banteng (Bos javanicus) and the <b>kouprey</b> (Bos sauveli). Large herds of these grazing animals were once widespread across the region and were preyed upon by tigers (Panthera tigris), clouded leopard (Felis nebulosa), leopards (Panthera pardus) and dhole (wild dogs) (Cuon alpinus). Both loss of habitat and hunting have seriously reduced numbers of all these animals {{many of which are}} endangered with the <b>kouprey</b> very rare and other species such as the Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) and Schomburgk's deer (Cervus duvaucelli schomburgki) now extinct in the region.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kouprey</b> live in low, {{partially}} forested hills, {{where they}} eat mainly grasses. Their preferred habitat is open forest and savannas often near thick monsoon forests. They are diurnal, eating {{in the open}} at night and under the forest cover during the day. They usually travel up to 15 km in a night.|$|E
50|$|There is {{hope that}} one of the world's most {{endangered}} mammals, the <b>kouprey,</b> may still survive in Thap Lan and Pang Sida National Parks. Though one has not been sighted within Thailand for more than 30 years, this primitive cattle species could provide genes valuable in the production of disease-free strains of domestic cattle.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are thought}} to be few, if any, <b>kouprey</b> left in existence. The last {{confirmed}} sighting was in 1988. Since then, surveys have been done to try to locate the species but all have failed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the species as [...] "critically endangered", but it may already be extinct.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kouprey</b> have tall, narrow, bodies, {{long legs}} and humped backs. They can be grey, dark brown or black. The horns {{of the female}} are lyre-shaped with antelope-like upward spirals. The horns of the male are wide and arch forward and upward; they begin to fray at the tips at about three years of age. Both sexes have notched {{nostrils}} and long tails.|$|E
50|$|The park fauna {{included}} the Javan rhinoceros, {{and was one}} of only two populations in the world, until poachers shot and killed the last rhino in Cát Loc in 2010. There are also records of banteng and <b>kouprey,</b> but these may now be globally extinct, and wild Asian water buffalo no longer occur in Cat Tien. Some accounts also list Indochinese tigers, leopards, clouded leopards and dholes; however, a recent series of surveys did not confirm this.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, many {{artiodactyls}} {{have declined}} significantly in numbers, {{and some have}} even gone extinct, largely due to over-hunting, and, more recently, habitat destruction. Extinct species include several gazelles (such as the Arabian gazelle), the Malagasy hippopotamus, the bluebuck, and Schomburgk's deer. Two species, the Scimitar-horned oryx and Pere David's deer, are extinct in the wild. Fourteen species are considered critically endangered, including the addax, the <b>kouprey,</b> the Bactrian camel, Przewalski's gazelle, the saiga, and the pygmy hog. Twenty-four species are considered endangered.|$|E
50|$|Cambodia {{is home to}} a {{wide array}} of wildlife. There are 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 176 reptile species (including 89 subspecies), 850 {{freshwater}} fish species (Tonlé Sap Lake area), and 435 marine fish species.Many of the country's species are recognized by the IUCN or World Conservation Union as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered due to deforestation and habitat destruction, poaching, illegal wildlife trade, farming, fishing, and unauthorized forestry concessions. Intensive poaching may have already driven Cambodia's national animal, the <b>Kouprey,</b> to extinction. Wild tigers, Eld's deer, wild water buffaloes and hog deer are at critically low numbers.|$|E
50|$|Ungulates {{include the}} pot-bellied pig (Sus scrofa domestica), Javan {{rhinoceros}} (Rhinoceros sondaicus), banteng (Bos javanicus), <b>kouprey</b> (Bos sauveli), saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak), giant muntjac (Muntiacus vuquangensis) and Truong Son muntjac (Muntiacus truongsonensis). There are many rodents, including the ricefield rat (Rattus argentiventer) and the recently discovered Pauline's limestone rat (Saxatilomys paulinae), Laotian giant flying squirrel (Biswamoyopterus laoensis) and Laotian rock rat (Laonastes aenigmamus), {{the latter being}} a Lazarus taxon. The lesser false vampire bat (Megaderma spasma) is found in Laos, and endemic species of bat include the Phou Khao Khouay leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros khaokhouayensis). The long-eared gymnure (Hylomys megalotis) is another mammal endemic to Laos.|$|E
50|$|The Chao Praya River Valley of Thailand {{was once}} {{primarily}} tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer, the now-extinct Schomburgk's deer, Eld's deer, Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Both the hog deer and Eld's deer are rare, whereas Indian sambar and Indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks, such as Khao Yai. Many of these South Asian and Southeast Asian deer species also share their habitat with other herbivores, such as Asian elephants, the various Asian rhinoceros species, various antelope species (such as nilgai, four-horned antelope, blackbuck, and Indian gazelle in India), and wild oxen (such as wild Asian water buffalo, gaur, banteng, and <b>kouprey).</b> One way that different herbivores can survive {{together in a}} given area is for each species to have different food preferences, although {{there may be some}} overlap.|$|E
50|$|Indochinese tigers prey {{mainly on}} medium- and large-sized wild ungulates. Sambar deer, wild pigs, serow, and large bovids such as banteng and {{juvenile}} gaur comprise {{the majority of}} Indochinese tiger’s diet. However, in most of Southeast Asia large animal populations have been seriously depleted because of illegal hunting, resulting in the so-called “empty forest syndrome” - i.e. a forest that looks intact, but where most wildlife has been eliminated. Some prey species, such as the <b>kouprey</b> and Schomburgk's Deer, are extinct, and Eld's Deer, hog deer, and wild water buffalo are present only in a few relict populations. In such habitats, tigers are forced to subsist on smaller prey, such as muntjac deer, porcupines, macaques and hog badgers. Small prey by itself is barely sufficient to meet the energy requirements of a large carnivore such as the tiger, and is insufficient for tiger reproduction. This factor, in combination with direct tiger poaching for traditional Chinese medicine, is the main contributor {{in the collapse of}} the Indochinese tiger throughout its range.|$|E
50|$|Cambodia {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of wildlife. There have been {{registered}} 212 mammal species, 536 bird species, 176 reptile species (including 89 subspecies), 850 freshwater fish species (Tonlé Sap Lake area), and 435 marine fish species. An unknown amount of species remains to be described by science, especially butterflies and moths (lepidopterans). Many of the species in the country, including several endemic ones, are recognized by the IUCN or World Conservation Union as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered due to deforestation and habitat destruction, poaching, the illegal wildlife trade, and farming, fishing, and forestry concessions. Intensive poaching may have already driven Cambodia's national animal, the <b>kouprey,</b> to extinction, and wild tigers, Eld's deer, wild water buffaloes and hog deer are at critically low numbers. Wildlife in Cambodia includes dholes, elephants, deer (sambar, Eld's deer, hog deer and muntjac), wild oxen (banteng and gaur), panthers, bears, and tigers. Cormorants, cranes, ibises, parrots, green peafowl, pheasants, and wild ducks are also found, and species of venomous snakes and constrictors are numerous. Deforestation, mining activities, and unregulated hunting, have diminished the country’s wildlife diversity rapidly.|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Galbreath, Mordacq & Weiler (2006) {{concluded}} that the <b>kouprey</b> Bos sauveli was not a natural species, but rather a feral animal derived from hybridization between banteng Bos javanicus and zebu Bos taurus indicus. Here, we analyze two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and subunit II of the cytochrome c oxidase) for all the seven species of the subtribe Bovina, including new sequences for several specimens of banteng, zebu and gaur of Cambodia. Our analyses indicate that mitochondrial sequences of Cambodian banteng are divergent from those of Javan banteng (mean difference = 4. 27 %), but {{similar to those of}} <b>kouprey</b> (1. 25 %). We propose two conflicting hypotheses to interpret these results: (1) the Cambodian and Indonesian banteng belong to two distinct species, and the <b>kouprey</b> derived from Cambodian banteng; (2) all subspecies of banteng belong to Bo. javanicus, but the mitochondrial genome of <b>kouprey</b> was transferred by natural hybridization into the ancestor of Cambodian banteng. Morphological, ecological and ethological characteristics of banteng and <b>kouprey</b> rather support the second hypothesis. However, we need to sequence nuclear markers, and to analyze banteng from Lao, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, to give a definitive conclusion on the taxonomic status of banteng and <b>kouprey...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>kouprey</b> is a {{rare and}} enigmatic forest ox {{discovered}} by scientists in Cambodia only in 1937. Numerous morphological hypotheses have been proposed for {{the origin of the}} kouprey: that it is a species closely related to banteng and gaur, two other wild oxen of southeast Asia; a morphologically divergent species placed in a separate genus, named Novibos; a wild species linked to aurochs and domestic cattle; a vicariant population of banteng; a feral cattle; or a hybrid of banteng with either zebu cattle, gaur or water buffalo. In a recent paper, which gained a lot of media coverage, Galbreath et al. analysed mitochondrial DNA sequences and concluded that the <b>kouprey</b> never existed as a wild, natural species, and that it was a feral hybrid between banteng and zebu cattle. Here we analyse eight DNA markers - three mitochondrial regions and five nuclear fragments - representing an alignment of 4582 nucleotides for the holotype of the <b>kouprey</b> and all related species. Our results demonstrate that the <b>kouprey</b> is a real and naturally occurring species, and show that Cambodian populations of banteng acquired a mitochondrial genome of <b>kouprey</b> by natural introgressive hybridization during the Pleistocene epoch. © 2007 The Royal Society.

40|$|The genetic {{relation}} between the different Bos javanicus (banteng) in Southeast Asia {{is in some ways}} uncertain. Bos javanicus is divided into three different groups: banteng from java, banteng from Borneo and banteng from the mainland of Southeast Asia. Some authors don’t agree with this division though. In this research I investigated if the Thai banteng contains mtDNA of the extinct <b>kouprey,</b> which was already shown in the Cambodian banteng 21. In this research I also compared the genetic variation of seventeen different D-loop sequences of Bos javanicus, and I arranged them into different haplotypes. Because no haplotype classification has yet been published for Bos javanicus, I made my own denomination for the haplotypes. Eleven of the seventeen sequences were collected from dung in Huai Kha Khaeng national park in Thailand. The other six sequences were published data, and contained both mainland banteng and banteng from Java. After comparing the data, it was shown the sequences were divided into two well defined branches, one branch for the mainland banteng and one for the Javan banteng. Within the mainland banteng I found five different haplotypes (A, A 2, A 3, B, B 2) and within the Javanese banteng one haplotype (C). So in total I found six different haplotypes between the seventeen sequences of Bos javanicus. Because the Thai banteng belongs to the same haplotype as the Cambodian banteng, it is certain the Thai banteng contains mtDNA of the <b>kouprey</b> as well...|$|E
