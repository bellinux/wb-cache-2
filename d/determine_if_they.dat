5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%. Cranberry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication. As of 2015, probiotics require further study to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions {{about the nature of}} the altered universe, trying to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.|$|E
5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were {{too far to the}} left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} many other small {{pharmaceutical}} companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and Company distinguished itself from the others by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and its strong focus on quality. At first, Lilly was the company's only researcher, but as the business grew, he established a research laboratory and employed others who were dedicated to creating new drugs. Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's. He insisted on quality assurance and instituted mechanisms {{to ensure that the}} drugs being produced would be effective and perform as advertised, had the correct combination of ingredients, and had the correct dosages of medicines in each pill. He was aware of the addictive and dangerous nature of some of his drugs, and pioneered the concept of giving such drugs only to people who had first seen a physician to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> needed the medicine.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{results were}} {{surprising}} as the material excavated {{by the impact}} contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a snow bank. Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced {{at the time of}} the Solar System's formation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{sought to}} <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> there is any overlap between the two major non-rapid eye {{movement}} and rapid eye movement parasomnias, i. e. sleepwalking/sleep terrors and {{rapid eye movement sleep}} behaviour disorder. We assessed adult patients with sleepwalking/sleep terrors using rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder screening questionnaires and <b>determined</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had enhanced muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep. Conversely, we assessed rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder patients using the Paris Arousal Disorders Severity Scale and <b>determined</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had more N 3 awakenings. The 251 participants included 64 patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (29 with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 35 with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder associated with Parkinson's disease), 62 patients with sleepwalking/sleep terrors, 66 old healthy controls (age-matched with the rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder group) and 59 young healthy controls (age-matched with the sleepwalking/sleep terrors group).

25|$|Forty {{examples}} of the LOCAT rocket were ordered by the United States Army during 1969, for operational evalulation to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were suitable in the target-drone role. The contract included an option for ordering production quantities if the rocket was considered acceptable for service. Although LOCAT proved to be reasonably satisfactory in the Army's testing, and it was estimated that, even when compared to reusable drones, LOCAT offered a 50% savings in cost over other methods of target training, no production contract was placed, the MTR-15 BATS being judged superior for the Army's purposes.|$|E
