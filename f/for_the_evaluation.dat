Some subject areas in the classification were regarded as inappropriately arranged and there was considerable pressure for more detail and for adaptation of the classification to make it more relevant <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> of medical care, by classifying conditions to the chapters concerned with the part of the body affected rather than to those dealing with the underlying generalized disease.|$|E

25|$|On 6 December 1978, Embraer {{was officially}} awarded a {{contract}} to produce two prototypes and two airframes for fatigue tests. The specifications were concluded in February 1979, and the main differences from the EMB-311 were the more powerful PT6A-25C engine, raised rear cockpit, {{and the addition of}} ejection seats. Eventually, the original specifications underwent a major modification, including a smaller fuselage with an upright cruciform tail instead of a swept-back tail; a more domed canopy; extended elevators; greater distance between the nosewheel and back wheel; reduction of the wing root; and an increased wingspan, tailplane, and landing gear. By late 1979, a full-scale mock-up was built with a cockpit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> of flight instruments, and a subscale, radio-controlled research model was designed to evaluate the free-flight characteristics before building a full-scale prototype.|$|E

500|$|Later in 1978, Johnston {{joined the}} United States Geological Survey (USGS), where he {{monitored}} volcanic emission {{levels in the}} Cascades and Aleutian Arc. There he helped to strengthen the theory that eruptions can be predicted, to some degree, by changes in the makeup of volcanic gases. Fellow volcanologist Wes Hildreth said of Johnston, [...] "I think Dave's dearest hope was that systematic monitoring of fumarolic emissions might permit detection of changes characteristically precursory to eruptions... Dave wanted to formulate a general model for the behavior of magmatic volatiles prior to explosive outbursts {{and to develop a}} corollary rationale <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>evaluation</b> of hazards." [...] During this time, Johnston continued to visit Mount Augustine every summer and also assessed the geothermal energy potential of the Azores and Portugal. In {{the last year of his}} life, Johnston developed an interest in the health, agricultural, and environmental effects of both volcanic and anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere.|$|E
