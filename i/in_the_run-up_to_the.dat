To give himself greater control over the Cabinet, in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (with the members appointed by himself, not the caucus) and took full control of the Cabinet agenda.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>run-up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2016 U.S. presidential election, Warren's {{name was}} {{put forward by}} liberal Democrats as a {{possible}} presidential candidate.

In October 2013, she joined with the other fifteen Senate Democratic women in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person shortlist to be Clinton's vice-presidential running mate. However, Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.|$|E
