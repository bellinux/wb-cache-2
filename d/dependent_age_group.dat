40|$|In {{this paper}} we test the {{robustness}} of correlations between age structure {{and economic growth}} in the old EU countries. The model is based on a modified Solow model in transition to steady state. We control for the catch-up effect not only by the conventional initial income but also introduce a technological convergence or absorption factor. In practice this is achieved by weighting the regression with the gap between GDP per capita in USA and each country included. Data are organised as a panel with 5 year periods and estimated controlling for fixed effects. A hump-shaped relation is found with the age structure where increases in the <b>dependent</b> <b>age</b> <b>group</b> shares are associated with decreasing GDP growth rates. This is in accordance with findings in most other work. In addition we confirm previous findings that the peak of the hump is in {{the upper part of the}} working age population implying that early retirement practices may be extremely harmful to growth. We find that models estimated on data up to 1990 agree quite well when data for 15 more years are added. Sensitivity tests, instrumented regressions and addition of control variables does not change this conclusion. The model parameters that we estimate are country- and time-specific (due to the weighting...|$|E

Three income groups are defined, referred to as income terciles. This paper examines the financing of consumption by income group. One source of financing is own labor income. But for age groups whose labor income {{is not sufficient to}} cover their consumption, mainly the young and elderly, the difference or the lifecycle deficit is financed by resources reallocated between age groups. The income groups differ in the manner the lifecycle deficits are financed.

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} extends a new framework, {{developed}} by Razin, Sadka, and Swagel, for capturing {{the effect of}} population ageing on public support for government social expenditures. Razin et al construct up an overlapping generations, median voter model, and investigate the empirical applicability of the model using panel data from 13 OECD countries. Their results suggest that population ageing will put downward pressure on per capita expenditures. These results rest, however, on an assumption {{that there is only}} one dependant age group: the old. This paper investigates the consequences of allowing for two such age groups: the young and the old. A replication of Razin et al’s empirical analysis, using two <b>dependent</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> rather than one, suggests that population ageing will instead put upward pressure on per capita expenditures. Although these results are tentative, they illustrate the usefulness of including both youth dependency and old-age dependency in Razin et al’s framework.

Methodology: It is a community based cross-sectional study done in rural area of Seloo block of Wardha district, Maharashtra. Multistage sampling technique was adopted to select study villages. Among the study villages 25 % households were selected by systematic sampling method. Sample size was 300 household (unit of study) to study the out-of-pocket household expenditure on curative medical care, in contrast 1319 members (unit of study) of total household were interviewed to know the pattern of health care seeking behavior. Data on socio-demographic profile, morbidity profile, health care seeking behaviors and curative medical care expenditure were collected. Study period was from July 2008 to June 2009. Results: About half (50. 13 %) of the patients during their illness gave first preference to private practioners. Significant difference between variables (age distribution & education) and health care seeking behavior was noted. More of productive <b>age</b> <b>group</b> participants prefer to go to Private Practitioners 210 (58. 33 %), Chemist shops 110 (82. 71 %), Tertiary hospitals 40 (83. 33 %) and Rural hospitals 11 (84. 62 %) than <b>dependents</b> <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> More of secondary schooled personal preferred to go to Chemist shops 81 (60. 90 %), primary health center 38 (74. 51 %) and tertiary hospitals 30 (62. 50 %) than others.

This vertical reference can be estimated using multisensory information, amongst others visual cues play a role. In the past it was already shown that visual deprivation and/or perturbation of visual information largely affect gait kinematics. The goal {{of this study is to}} investigate the impact of visual deprivation on intra-limb movement coordination. Children aged between 3 and 11 years and young adults are included in this study to investigate age-related differences in the visual control of locomotion. Intersegmental coordination was tested under two different conditions: full vision (FV) and no vision (NV). Heading direction and walking speed were taken into account. A significant interaction effect was observed between visual condition and age for walking speed. Between <b>age</b> <b>groups,</b> no differences are observed in the FV condition but in the NV condition children walk significantly slower than adults. This shows that the relative importance of visual information is <b>age</b> <b>dependent.</b> Between <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> significant differences were found in heading direction. Coordination was characterized using the planar covariation technique, by constructing thigh versus shank and shank versus foot angle-angle plots and by cross-correlation function analysis. Regardless of the presence or absence of visual information, the planarity index remains high, indicating that {{the laws of}} planar covariation hold in the absence of visual afferent information. On the other hand, the shape of the gait loop does show significant differences between FV and NV conditions. Changes in the shape of the gait loop are primarily determined by changes in the coupling between the thigh and shank elevation angles. The coupling between the shank and foot elevation angles is dependent upon walking speed and does not differ between FV and NV conditions.

40|$|Introduction The {{incidence}} of thyroid cancer has increased worldwide, whether a real or apparent increase is debated. Literature from the USA suggests greater diagnostic scrutiny, environmental and genetic factors may all play a part. This increase {{will result in}} a greater number of referrals for surgical assessment. This study examined the trend in {{incidence of}} thyroid cancer in England and Wales. Materials and Methods A retrospective study, using the HES database over the period 2000 - 2010. Data were extracted of all newly diagnosed thyroid cancers in England and Wales and the age at diagnosis. Data were examined for the change in incidence of thyroid cancer diagnosis <b>dependent</b> on the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of the patient using the linear regression model. Results 45411 patients were identified. In England the incidence of thyroid cancer rose from 5. 7 / 100, 000 of the population in 2000 to 9. 9 / 100, 000 in 2010 and in Wales it rose from 3. 5 / 100, 000 in 2000 to 7. 5 / 100, 000.

For both species, the highest PCB concentrations were observed in adult males {{as the result of}} accumulation for years and years, while the highest PBDE concentrations were measured in juveniles probably due to better developed metabolic capacities for these congeners with age in adults. Results for PCBs were higher than observations in harbour seals and porpoises from other areas, while results for PBDEs were comparable indicating that the North Sea is a highly contaminated area. Relative PCB and PBDE profiles were constructed to compare metabolic capacities between harbour seals and porpoises. A higher contribution of lower chlorinated and nonpersistent congeners, such as CB 52, CB 95, CB 101, CB 118 and CB 149 indicated that harbour porpoises are unable to metabolize these compounds. Similar to PCBs, higher contributions of other PBDEs than BDE 47 were observed in harbour porpoises, suggesting that this species has difficulties to metabolize these congeners.

We analyzed the California Cancer Registry (CCR) to describe epidemiologic characteristics and outcomes in this patient subset {{and to identify}} factors prognostic for cause-specific survival (CSS). Methods: Patients diagnosed with NSCLC between 1 / 1 / 98 through 12 / 31 / 09 and reported to the (CCR) as of October 2011 were included. The primary outcome measure was CSS. Cox regression models were used to evaluate predictors of CSS in young patients with NSCLC, adjusted for potential confounders. Interaction analysis was performed between <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> (< 50 vs. ≥ 50) and specific demographic and tumor covariates. Results: We identified 132, 671 lung cancer cases, of which 114, 451 (86. 3 %) had NSCLC. Of these, 6389 (5. 6 %) were < 50 years of age (median, 46 years). The most common histology was adenocarcinoma (3697, 57. 9 %). Most patients had stage III (1522, 23. 8 %) or IV (3655, 57. 2 %) disease. Fewer young patients were diagnosed in recent years (n, % of total NSCLC population of that era) : 1998 - 2001 (2355, 6. 0), 2002 - 2005 (2182, 5. 7), and 2006 - 2009 (1852, 5. 0), P < 0. 001. Multivariate analysis showed that age < 50 years was an independent predictor of improved CSS (HR 0. 827, P < 0. 001). Significant predictors of better CSS in patients < 50 years included female sex, Asian or Hispanic ethnicity, lower stage, later year of diagnosis, and higher socioeconomic status, among others. Adenocarcinoma histology {{was not associated with}} improved CSS in this patient subset (HR 0. 987, P= 0. 78). Interaction analysis revealed that Hispanic race and bronchioloalveolar histology had differential CSS outcomes <b>dependent</b> on <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusions: This large registry study found that age < 50 years is an independent predictor of improved CSS.

40|$|Background. We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} predictive accuracy of {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI) for Alzheimer-type dementia (AD) in a clinical setting is <b>dependent</b> on <b>age</b> and the definition of MCI used. Method. Non-demented subjects older than 40 (n= 320) who attended a memory clinic of a university hospital were reassessed 5 years later {{for the presence of}} AD. MCI was diagnosed according to the criteria of amnestic MCI, mild functional impairment (MFI), ageing-associated cognitive decline (AACD), and age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). The main outcome measure was the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Analyses were conducted on the entire sample and on subgroups of subjects aged 40 - 54, 55 - 69 and 70 - 85 years. Results. A diagnosis of AD at follow-up was made in 58 subjects. Four of them were in the 40 - 54 <b>age</b> <b>group,</b> 29 in the 55 - 69 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> and 25 in the 70 - 85 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> The diagnostic accuracy in the entire sample was low to moderately high with AUCs ranging from 0. 56 (AACD) to 0. 75 (amnestic MCI). A good predictive accuracy with an AUC > 0. 80 was only observed in subjects aged 70 - 85 using the criteria of amnestic MCI (AUC= 0. 84). Conclusions. The predictive accuracy of MCI for AD is <b>dependent</b> on <b>age</b> and the definition of MCI used. The predictive accuracy is good only for amnestic MCI in subjects 70 - 85 years. As subjects with prodromal AD are often younger than 70, the usefulness of MCI as predictor of AD in clinical practice is limited. © 2007 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} unaccompanied minors has {{increased}} {{over the past ten}} years in Sweden, the European country that receives the most children from this group. Some of them emigrate after a period of time in Sweden, but the vast majority stay. Most of the arriving children are teenage boys who have not yet turned 18. However, the largest increase over the latest years is observed for the younger <b>age</b> <b>groups.</b> Furthermore, gender composition is also <b>age</b> <b>dependent,</b> where it is quite balanced for the younger <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> unlike the oldest <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> In the years following their arrival, most of them are enrolled in schools. When it comes to those aged 20 or over, the proportion undergoing education is higher among women but a higher proportion of men are employed. The group that neither works nor studies is much larger among women than among men...|$|R

40|$|Lions rarely prey on {{elephants}}. Botswana’s Savuti lions, however, {{switch to}} preying on elephants {{during the late}} dry season (August–November), {{and the frequency of}} this has increased {{in the last two decades}} (1985 – 2005). An opportunity to document this phenomenon was made possible with infrared viewing and filming equipment. A pride of 30 lions killed one elephant every three days. Seven of eight elephants killed were between four and 11 years old, as deduced from molar teeth ageing, and this <b>age</b> <b>group</b> represented over half the kills recorded by Joubert (2006). It is suggested that this weaned, maternally less <b>dependent</b> <b>age</b> class, may be more vulnerable to lion predation. Lions prey on elephants since the density of conventional ungulate prey is reduced as a result of an annual migration, and artificial water provisioning has prompted an increasingly sedentary population of elephants. Notes are presented on the lion’s behaviour in hunting elephants and the evolutionary significance of this. </strong...|$|R

50|$|Epidemiology {{is divided}} into five <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> which are newborns {{less than one year}} old, the next <b>age</b> <b>group</b> is people from the ages of 1-17, the third <b>age</b> <b>group</b> is 18-44 years old, the fourth <b>age</b> <b>group</b> is 45-64, and the final <b>age</b> <b>group</b> is 65-88 years old. The <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of <1 has 2,233 cases which {{accounts}} for 60.07% of all known cases. The <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of 1-17 has 686 cases which accounts for 18.44% of all cases of congenital hip dislocation. The next <b>age</b> <b>group</b> which is 18-44 has 249 cases which accounts for 6.70% of all cases and the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of 45-64 has 332 cases which is about 8.93% of all cases. Finally, the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of 65-84 has 158 cases which accounts for 4.25% of all cases of congenital hip dislocation. The epidemiology also shows that females are more prevalent to get congenital hip dislocation compared to their male counterparts. Females had 2,571 cases which is 69.15% of all cases while for men there are 1,136 cases which makes up 30.56% of all cases of congenital hip dislocation. The costs vary from <b>age</b> <b>groups.</b> The mean costs for the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> <1 is $7,803 while the median cost is $7,045. The costs for the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of 1-17 are $13,573 for a mean and the median cost is $12,513. The mean cost for the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of 18-44 is $16,656 and the median cost is $14,082. Finally, the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of 45-64 has a mean cost of $14,388 and a median cost of $12,321. The amount of days of the hospital stay varies as well. In the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> 1-17 the length of stay is about 2.7 days, for the people ages 18-44 the average stay is 4.4 days, and the people ages 45-64 stay for about 3.4 days in the hospital setting.|$|R

40|$|Performance {{trends in}} elite triathletes {{competing}} in <b>age</b> <b>group</b> classes {{have been investigated}} for Ironman triathlon in ‘Ironman Hawaii’ but not for short distance triathletes competing at international level in {{events such as the}} Olympic distance triathlon at the World Championships. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate participation and performance trends of <b>age</b> <b>group</b> triathletes competing in the Olympic distance triathlon at the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Championships 2009 - 2014. During this period, the number of participants remained constant. Swimming performance improved in athletes in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 25 - 29 years to 55 - 59 years, but not in younger (18 - 24 years) and older (> 60 - 64 years) <b>age</b> <b>groups.</b> Cycling performance improved in athletes in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 18 - 24 years to 70 - 74 years, but not in <b>age</b> <b>group</b> 75 - 79 years. In running, athletes in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 18 - 24 years, 30 - 34 years, 35 - 39 years and 65 - 69 years improved, but not in the other <b>age</b> <b>groups.</b> Overall race time was improved by athletes in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 18 - 24 to 65 - 69 years, but not in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 70 - 74 years and 75 - 79 years. Transition times were improved by all <b>age</b> <b>group</b> athletes. Women were slower than men in swimming, cycling, running and overall race time in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 18 - 24 years to 70 - 74 years, but not in the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> 75 - 79 years. For transition times, women were slower than men in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 18 - 24 years to 65 - 69 years, but not in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 70 - 74 years to 75 - 79 years. In summary, women and men improved performance in most <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> across all years, men were faster than women except in the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> 75 - 79 years and the sex difference between women and men remained constant. This knowledge should be considered when future <b>age</b> <b>group</b> triathletes train for and compete in Olympic distance triathlons at international level...|$|R
