5|$|The band is {{organized}} quite simply with Paul and Joe playing their songs {{in a simple}} basic guitar-synth-and-drums indie pop style and they sing in the semi-deadpan way; a review found the vocal delivery {{similar to that of}} They Might Be Giants. The raison d’être of the band <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> enough energy and spirit into their songs to make them fun.|$|E
5|$|The two layout forms {{originate}} from two graphic forms of {{presentation of the}} same periodic table. Historically, when the f-block was identified it was drawn below the existing table, with markings for its in-table location (this page uses dots or asterisks). Also, a common presentation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all 15 lanthanide and actinide columns below, while the f-block only has 14 columns. The fifteenth (rightmost) lanthanide and actinide are d-block elements, belonging to group 3, with scandium and yttrium.|$|E
5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When {{the right amount of}} ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that parents <b>were</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for children, nor <b>were</b> children <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for parents; a person <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death only for the person’s own crime. A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|R

60|$|To {{say that}} Arnold Baxter was {{astonished}} would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it altogether too mildly. He was completely dumfounded.|$|R
5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers {{are taught to}} create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} method found in old manuscripts and still found on modern-day tombstones <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a dot above each {{letter of the}} number.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial ejaculation {{control technique}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{pressure on the}} perineum, about halfway between the scrotum and the anus, just before ejaculating. This can, however, redirect semen into the bladder (referred to as retrograde ejaculation).|$|E

25|$|Yet another {{tradition}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{a wreath}} of daisies {{at the foot}} of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the Alumni of the University.|$|E
25|$|The most {{primitive}} {{method of}} representing a natural number <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down a mark for each object. Later, {{a set of}} objects could be tested for equality, excess or shortage, by striking out a mark and removing an object from the set.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the course is simple: {{one of the best}} ways to {{understand}} someone <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> yourself in their shoes. So, a group of middleweight marketers take on the role of an advertising agency creative department. While agency Creative Directors take on the role of the clients.|$|E

50|$|Dissenting justices Samuel A. Alito, Jr. and Antonin Scalia {{noted that}} they would have denied the {{application}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> off the execution which was scheduled for 6 pm. The Court's delay order came about 15 minutes before Berry <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death by lethal injection.|$|R
25|$|Children {{can present}} {{particular}} challenges in treatment. Some departments have dedicated pediatrics areas, and some departments employ a play therapist whose job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> children at ease {{to reduce the}} anxiety caused by visiting the emergency department, {{as well as provide}} distraction therapy for simple procedures.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the pilot}} region the {{projects}} in progress include demonstration buildings constructed to MINERGIE or Passivhaus standards, electricity generation from renewable energy sources, and vehicles using natural gas, hydrogen and biogas. The aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> research into practice, seek continuous improvements, and to communicate progress to all interested parties, including the public.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, Go-Ahead {{completed}} {{the purchase of}} East Thames Buses from Transport for London and incorporated it into London General. Although Transport for London's normal practice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> routes out for tender, London General began a new five-year contract for all East Thames Buses routes without going through the tendering process.|$|E

60|$|To {{say that}} Senator Whitredge was startled and uncomfortable would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his case mildly. He {{had never before}} seen Mr. Vane in this mood.|$|R
25|$|A {{variation}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the V {{sign with}} the fingers {{on either side of}} the mouth (usually with the knuckles facing the observer) and to stick the tongue out. Most of the time the tongue is wriggled around. This is used to signify cunnilingus and the gesture is often off-colour.|$|E
25|$|The Carol Tambor Best of Edinburgh Award {{for best}} drama was {{introduced}} in 2004. To be eligible for this award a show must have received a four or five star rating in The Scotsman and must not have previously played in New York, as the prize <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the show on in New York.|$|E
25|$|Because of this, {{cooking oil}} {{should never be}} dumped in the kitchen sink or in the toilet bowl. The proper way to dispose of oil <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it in a sealed {{non-recyclable}} container and discard it with regular garbage. Placing the container {{of oil in the}} refrigerator to harden also makes disposal easier and less messy.|$|E

25|$|An {{indispensable}} part of Christmas {{dinner is}} the česnica, a round loaf of bread. The {{preparation of this}} bread may be accompanied by various rules and rituals. The dough for it is sometimes prepared with the strong water. A widespread custom <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a coin into the dough; regionally, little objects made of cornel wood may be inserted, representing chickens, oxen, cows, swine, bees, etc.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{argues that}} this is only true for an {{observer}} outside of the room. The {{whole point of the}} thought experiment <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> someone inside the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.|$|E
25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but {{the quickest way}} to tell the two apart <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.|$|E
