50|$|In 2004 the US Department of Defense {{decided to}} finance {{development}} of a composite <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> for a main rotor helicopter planetary gear box. Boeing and Sikorsky currently conduct the development of helicopter composite <b>gear</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{planetary}} <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> features external <b>gear</b> {{teeth and}} can be rotated by a motor and worm gear. Alteration of the housing position allows rotation of the output sun gear independently of the input sun gear position. I.e. if the driver were to hold the steering wheel (and therefore the input sun gear) stationary, driving the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> {{will result in the}} rotation of the steering pinion (and therefore a steering action at the front wheels). By manipulating the position of the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>housing,</b> the active steering ECU can synthesize a variable steering ratio or generate steering actions independently of the driver.|$|R

The analysis was conducted for the housing without the rotating components (gears, shafts, and bearings). Both rigid and flexible mounting conditions for the <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> are considered in this analysis. The flexible support simulates the realistic mounting condition on a rotorcraft, and the rigid one is analyzed for comparison purposes. The effect of <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> stiffeners is also evaluated. The {{results indicate that the}} first six natural modes of the flexibly mounted <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> in the 0 to 200 Hz range correspond to the translational and rotational rigid body vibration modes of the housing. Above this range, the housing plate elastic modes begin to occur. In the case of the rigid mount, only the housing plate elastic modes are observed which are verified by modal analysis experiments. Parametric studies show that the housing plate stiffeners and rigid mounts tend to increase most of the natural frequencies, the lower ones being affected the most...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a thesis work in mechanichal {{engineering}} performed at Volvo GroupTrucks Operations, Powertrain productions in Köping by the student Christoffer Jansson. Thework of 15 ECTS credits is conducted over a 20 week period at half speed equivalent to 400 working hours. The background to the work is the desire to improve a workstation where the transmissions tothe IPS 2 / 3 and IPS 15 are assembled. The problem on the workstation is that the workers areperforming non value-added activities (NVAA) and it is of interest that one would examine thepossibility of how to squeeze two bearing rings in the same sequence. The aim is thus todevelop a suggestion of improvement for the bearing pressing method on the assembly line. The issue the thesis work is based on is: How does one manage to press together two bearingrings in the same sequence into a particular component? & How can one improve theergonomic circumstances on the workstation?To be able to perform this work, a case study based on the product development processaccording to Ulrich and Eppinger (2012) has been made. Product development tools are used tofacilitate the work of the student. Including Gantt chart, Pugh's analysis and functional analysis. The result of the work is a modification of the existing working table where the bearing ringsare pressed into the middle <b>gear</b> <b>housing.</b> The solution consists of a steel plate that rests on fivesprings which dampen the weight of the middle <b>gear</b> <b>housing.</b> The middle <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> is thecomponent in which the bearing rings are pressed in. There are 5 guiding rods that are mountedon the steel plate, one for each spring, which has the function to keep the steel plate stablewhen the middle <b>gear</b> <b>housing</b> is set on top. These guiding rods are in turn controlled bybushings which serve to reduce friction. The bushings are standard components that aremounted into a component called the bushing holder, which is a component that is screwed intothe table. The new working process the solution provides eliminates the previous NVAA that has been onthe station before and allows the worker to press two bearing rings into the middle gearinghouse in the same sequence. The ergonomic circumstances have also been improved due to theelimination of the worker having to rotate the heavy middle <b>gearing</b> <b>house</b> 180 degrees. Thesolution thus meets the demands made in the report and solves the problems identified...|$|R
