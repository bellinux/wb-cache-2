50|$|This is a {{narrowing}} of the mitral valve orifice when the valve is open. Mitral stenosis impairs LV filling {{so that there}} is a decrease in end-diastolic volume (preload).

The two groups had similar baseline hemodynamic, coronary angiographic, echocardiographic and radionuclide angiographic variables. Among the 40 patients (20 in each group) who were followed up for 1 year, echocardiographic end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes</b> were unmodified in Group A and global wall motion index was improved (p < 0. 01); in Group B, end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes</b> increased (p < 0. 001 for both) and global wall motion index was unchanged. Rest radionuclide ejection fraction increased significantly in both groups (p < 0. 001, Group A; p < 0. 005, Group B). A comparison of the changes in the considered variables between the two groups after 1 year of treatment showed a difference in end-diastolic (p < 0. 005) <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes</b> (p < 0. 001) and global wall motion index (p < 0. 005) without differences in radionuclide ejection fraction, which improved to a similar degree in both groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent cardiac MRI. In each patient a standard multislice cine steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence was performed with complete ventricular coverage during multiple breathholds. Additionally, a kt-BLAST-accelerated 4 D sequence with complete ventricular coverage was acquired during one single breathhold. For comparison of SSFP and kt-BLAST, the following LV parameters were determined: end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes,</b> ejection fraction, end-diastolic diameter and mass.

Methods: Unidimensional indexes and global measurements of right ventricular volume and contractile performance were compared in 6 conscious dogs. Vena caval occlusions were performed before (control) and during pulmonary arterial or aortic constriction. Results: Moderately strong relationships were demonstrated between right ventricular septal–free wall indexes and global measurements of right ventricular end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes,</b> stroke volume, stroke work, and the slope of the preload recruitable stroke work relationship, respectively, under control conditions (mean r 2 range 0. 69 - 0. 94). These relationships were shifted significantly, however, by increased right ventricular afterload. Increased left ventricular afterload significantly shifted the relationships between right ventricular septal–free wall dimensions and end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes.</b> Relationships between the corresponding regional right ventricular free wall segmental indexes and global measurements under control conditions were weaker (mean r 2 range 0. 12 - 0. 65) and were significantly more sensitive to distortion by both increased right and left ventricular afterload, the effects of which were generally in opposite directions. These observations are consistent with significant ventricular interactive effects on the relationship between single right ventricular dimensions and right ventricular volume.

5000|$|Premature {{ventricular}} contraction causes early emptying of {{the left}} ventricle (LV) into the aorta. Since the next ventricular contraction occurs at its regular time, the filling time for the LV increases, causing an increased LV end-diastolic volume.

50|$|In {{cardiovascular}} physiology, {{stroke volume}} (SV) is {{the volume of}} blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat.

The term stroke volume can apply to each of the two ventricles of the heart, although it usually refers to the left ventricle.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with complex {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD) abnormal ventricular stress responses have been reported with dobutamine stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DCMR). These abnormal stress responses are potential indicators of long-term outcome. However, safety and reproducibility of this technique has not been reported in a larger study. The {{aim of this study}} was to report our experiences regarding safety and intra-observer and inter-observer variability of low-dose DCMR in complex CHD. METHODS: In 91 patients, 110 low-dose DCMR studies were performed with acquisition of a short axis set at rest, and during dobutamine administration (7. 5 mug/kg/min maximum). We assessed biventricular end-diastolic <b>volumes,</b> <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes,</b> stroke volumes, ejection fraction and ventricular mass. Intra- and inter-observer variability for all variables was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation (%), i. e. the standard deviation of the difference divided by the mean of 2 measurements multiplied by 100 %. RESULTS: In 3 patients minor side effects occurred (vertigo, headache, and bigeminy). Ten patients experienced an increase in heart rate of > 150 % from baseline, although well tolerated. For all variables, intra-observer variability was < 10 % at rest and during stress. At rest, inter-observer variability was 10. 5 % maximal. With stress-testing, only the variability of biventricular <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes</b> (ESV) exceeded 10 %. CONCLUSIONS: In {{patients with}} complex CHD low-dose DCMR is feasible, and safe. Intra-observer variability is low for rest and stress measurements. Inter-observer variability of biventricular ESV is high with stress-testing.

40|$|Background—Data on reverse {{remodeling}} of {{the left}} atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) after restrictive annuloplasty in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy are scarce, and follow-up studies are performed with echocardiography. Methods and Results—Twenty patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe mitral regurgitation selected for restrictive mitral annuloplasty underwent serial MRI studies (within 1 week before surgery, and 2 months [n 18] and 1 year [n 13] after surgery). Early mortality was 10 %; all patients were free from endocarditis and thromboembolism. New York Heart Association class improved from 3. 20. 4 to 1. 20. 9. Only 1 patient developed recurrent severe mitral regurgitation during follow-up and it was re-repaired. LA <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes</b> decreased significantly over time (from 16548 mL to 10923 mL to 11128 mL; P 0. 01), as did LA end-diastolic volumes (from 9232 mL to 7122 mL to 7517 mL; P 0. 01). LV end-diastolic volumes decreased significantly (from 24456 mL to 18454 mL to 19567 mL; P 0. 01), whereas <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes</b> did not change significantly.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the relation between the severity of the residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery and changes in left ventricular volume and function after a first anterior myocardial infarction. Background. Although thrombolytic therapy improves clinical outcome after acute myocardial infarction, the relations between the severity of the residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery and postinfarction left ventricular remodeling and function are unclear. Methods. Fifty-eight patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction and significant disease only in the left anterior descending coronary artery on arteriography performed after 7 to 10 days were evaluated. All patients received thrombolytic therapy. Residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery was measured with quantitative coronary arteriography. Left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction were measured by echocardiography and radionuclide angiography, respectively, 7 to 10 days, 6 months and 1 year after infarction. End-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> left ventricular <b>volumes</b> were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography and normalized to body surface area. Patients were classified into three groups according to baseline residual stenosis severity: total occlusion (Group I), minimal lesion diameter < 15 mm (Group II) and minimal diameter ≥ 1. 5 mm (Group III). Results. Group I patients had significantly greater left ventricular end-diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes</b> at 6 months and 1 year than did the other groups. Group II patients had greater end diastolic and <b>end-systolic</b> <b>volumes</b> than did Group III patients at 1 year. In addition, Group 1 patients had a lower ejection fraction at 1 year than that of the other groups. The minimal lesion diameter was significantly correlated with percent change in end-diastolic volume at 1 year. Conclusions. The severity of the baseline residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery is an important predictor of change in left ventricular volumes in the 1 st year after infarction.
