40|$|Abstract- When we dial land {{number or}} Mobile number on our phones, {{it gives a}} ring to the person we need to contact, this is {{possible}} by the concept of DUAL TONE â€“ <b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>FREQUENCY</b> (<b>DTMF).</b> The DTMF is a popular signalling method between telephone and switching centres. It is also used for signalling between the telephone network and computer network. DTMF signals are the superposition of two sine waves with different frequencies. In this the key stroke we give is converted to frequency and this sine wave is decode by the decoder and switching centre connects our line to the desired destination. In recent days when we call to customer care, instead of person of person computer is able to solve our query,this is possible by programming the sound card of computer with the frequencies generated by phone.

40|$|Extremely long {{distance}} control, hardly reachable actuator/target and costly network development are some concerns within a distance control system. Such control is computer control for advertisements placed in tricky areas as locations over the bridge, at a junction, etc. The provider usually performs system inactivation {{in order to}} save energy. But until now, it is still difficult to find a system that can be turned on and off in remote manner. That is why the distant control using telephone can be the best alternative solution. Not only can the telephone be used in wide range of area, but also easily operated. The developed circuit in this research uses dual tone <b>multiple</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>DTMF).</b> It is operated by pressing telephone button as control input for microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the input and controls the computer via relay and serial port. The result of experiment shows that the developed application is able to shut down and turn on computer as well as to apply software remotely...|$|R
40|$|Missed calls have a {{potential}} for low-cost control and monitoring of a remote instrumentation system as compared to SMS (Short-Message Service) and <b>DTMF</b> (<b>Dual-Tone</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Frequencies).</b> The design of an instrumentation system model in which a set of lamps can, remotely, be turned on/off just by issuing a set of unanswered calls and the programming of the AT 90 S 2313 microcontroller to serve the purpose of controlling and status monitoring {{of a set of}} six lamps (AC bulbs) are presented in this paper. Two cellular phones are used: one as the calling phone, and the other as the receiving end (the transceiver). The transceiver is attached to the microcontroller circuitry. The calling phone issues two sets of RINGs and the transceiver is programmed to disregard any RING. The first set of RINGs is interpreted as a command to select one of the six lamps, then the second set of RINGs constitutes a command to turn the selected lamp on/off. This is possible because the cellular system records the number of RINGs before a call qualifies as a missed call. The system has successfully been built, tested, and proven to work well. The limitation is, apart from the GSM signal availability, the inability of the current system to verify/authenticate the calling phone number...|$|R
40|$|Frequency {{recognition}} {{is an important}} task in many engineering fields, such as audio signal processing and telecommunications engineering. There are numerous applications where frequency {{recognition is}} absolutely necessary like in Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) detection or {{the recognition of the}} carrier frequency of a Global Positioning System (GPS) signal. Furthermore, frequency recognition has entered many other engineering disciplines such as sonar and radar technology, spectral analysis of astronomic data, seismography, acoustics and consumer electronics. Listening to electronic music and playing electronic musical instruments {{is becoming more and more}} popular, not only among young musicians. This dissertation details back groundinformation and a preliminary analysis of a musical system, the Generic Musical Instrument System (GMIS), which allows composers to experiment with electronic instruments without actually, learning how to play them. This dissertation gives background information about frequency recognition algorithms implemented in real time. It analyses state-of-the-art techniques, such as Dual- Tone <b>Multiple</b> <b>Frequency</b> (<b>DTMF)</b> implementations and MIDI-based musical systems, in order to work out their similarities. The key idea is to adapt well-proven frequency recognition algorithms of DTMF systems, which are successfully and widely used in telephony. The investigations will show to what extent these principles and algorithms can be applied to a musical system like the GMIS. This dissertation presents results of investigations into frequency recognition algorithms implemented on a Texas Instruments (TI) TMS 320 C 6713 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) core, in order to estimate the frequency of an audio signal in real time. The algorithms are evaluated using selected criteria in terms of speed and accuracy with accomplishing over 9600 single measurements. The evaluations are made with simple sinusoids and musical notes played by instruments as input signals which allows a solid decision, which of these frequency recognition algorithms is appropriate for audio signal processing and for the constraints of the GMIS in real time...|$|R
