5|$|Laurer had a {{strained}} {{relationship with her}} family. She last saw her mother {{at the age of}} 16, and she claimed that her father was never able to get over her decision not to pursue a career in law enforcement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. She also alleged that her father took out several student loans in her name without her knowledge, leaving her with $40,000 in debt. On an episode of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew in 2008, Laurer claimed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> relationship with all of her family members, including her siblings. In September 2010, Laurer was hospitalized after overdosing on sleeping medication. As of February 2015, Laurer had re-established a good relationship with her mother; her father died in May 2014.|$|E

25|$|While {{a lot of}} {{high school}} players just accept {{that this is just}} how it is, some object to this rule. They say that it puts excess stress on them because they start being {{recruited}} in their junior year of high school. If they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> season it could ruin their chances to get into college and therefore into the NBA. It can also be stressful picking a college to play at, which can be unneeded stress if a player decides to leave after only one year.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Hillsboro, {{like so many}} other small, rural towns in North Dakota, is heavily {{dependent}} on agriculture. When local farmers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> harvest, the Hillsboro economy can also suffer. In turn, when the harvest is good, Hillsboro usually prospers. One of the more obvious effects the agricultural community has had on Hillsboro is found at the American Crystal Sugar sugar beet plant directly north of town. The large plant, located on U.S. Highway 81, has been responsible for both an increase in population and a steady stream of available jobs during the last few decades that it has been open.|$|E

25|$|Ovarian cancer {{survival}} varies {{significantly with}} subtype. Dysgerminomas {{have a very}} favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%. Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I. Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more. Low malignant potential tumors usually only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Khanna {{fell in love}} with the then fashion {{designer}} and actress Anju Mahendru. They were in a relationship for seven years. Mahendru states that the couple did not speak to each other for 17 years after the break-up. Later Khanna married the budding actress Dimple Kapadia in March 1973, before Kapadia's debut film Bobby released in November of that year. They have two daughters from the marriage; Twinkle and Rinke. Khanna and Kapadia separated in 1984, but did not complete the divorce proceedings. In the 1980s Tina Munim was romantically involved with Khanna while working with Khanna in 11 movies from 1980 to 1987. Munim had been a fan of Rajesh since her school days. According to website Bollywood Mantra reporter, the relationship with Tina ended in 1987, when Khanna refused to marry her as their marriage would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> impact on his daughters. Khanna and Kapadia however maintained an amicable relationship where they both were seen together at parties and family functions. Kapadia also campaigned for Khanna's election and worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar (1990).|$|E

500|$|There {{was just}} enough time before nightfall to storm the {{position}} on its north side (mainly up the steepest part of the slope immediately north of Gustavus's fort), but {{not enough time to}} develop simultaneous attacks from other sides. The attack went in around 18:00, led by the advanced guard of the 'forlorn hope'. This force of 80 English grenadiers from the 1st English Foot Guards, led by Viscount Mordaunt and Colonel Richard Munden, was designed to draw the enemy fire and thus enable the Allied commanders to discern the defensive strong points. The main force followed closely behind. [...] "The rapidity of their movements, together with their loud yells, were truly alarming", recalled la Colonie, who, in order to drown out the shouts and hurrahs, ordered his drummer to beat charge [...] "so as to drown them with their noise, lest they should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> effect upon our people." ...|$|E

[...] However, he restated his opinion that it [...] "would be much better not to have a movie at all, than to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> movie."

500|$|Multiple {{references}} {{are made to}} the Star Wars saga throughout the episode. Chuck directly compares their attempting to sneak in to Vivian's base to the same method used by Luke Skywalker and Han Solo to rescue Princess Leia in the original film, by referring to the bound Casey as [...] "Chewie." [...] During the same scene Casey mutters [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> feeling about this," [...] a catch-phrase used by characters throughout the film series. The series is twice referenced directly, by Chuck when Sarah fails to understand his [...] "Chewie" [...] reference, and by Casey, who says, [...] "This {{is what happens when}} you draw your plans from Star Wars." [...] Chuck and Morgan also make use of [...] "The Imperial March" [...] as a means to prepare Morgan for his mission to pose as a villain while infiltrating a meeting with Vivian.|$|E
500|$|Most NPCs {{are aligned}} {{with a certain}} faction, such as the police, pirates, a company, or government. [...] Each faction has its own agenda, and the {{relationships}} among them are interlinked {{in a web of}} alliances and hostilities. [...] Player characters anger a faction and its allies by destroying its ships. [...] Likewise, they gain the favor of a factionand, to a smaller extent, its alliesby attacking its enemies. [...] Player characters who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> relationship with a faction are attacked on sight by its forces and denied from docking with its stations. [...] Paying bribes to a faction improves its attitude to the player character. [...] Several NPCs with major roles are voiced by professional voice actors, such as Ian Ziering (Beverly Hills, 90210), Jennifer Hale (Metroid games), George Takei (Star Trek), and John Rhys-Davies (Indiana Jones films and Sliders). [...] These NPCs are excluded from the multiplayer mode because of its lack of a campaign story (scripted missions).|$|E
500|$|Urban cookshops that {{catered to}} workers or the {{destitute}} {{were regarded as}} unsavory and disreputable places by the well-to-do and professional cooks tended to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> reputation. Geoffrey Chaucer's Hodge of Ware, the London cook from the Canterbury Tales, {{is described as a}} sleazy purveyor of unpalatable food. French cardinal Jacques de Vitry's sermons from the early 13th century describe sellers of cooked meat as an outright health hazard. While the necessity of the cook's services was occasionally recognized and appreciated, they were often disparaged since they catered to the baser of bodily human needs rather than spiritual betterment. The stereotypical cook in art and literature was male, hot-tempered, prone to drunkenness, and often depicted guarding his stewpot from being pilfered by both humans and animals. In the early 15th century, the English monk John Lydgate articulated the beliefs of many of his contemporaries by proclaiming that [...] "Hoot ffir [...] and smoke makith many an angry cook." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Grossberg's {{design was}} changed for Trials and Tribulations, with his brown suit {{changed to a}} red one: this was because the Game Boy Advance system's screen made his previous design blend in too much with the brown courtroom. Iwamoto based the design of Godot on Rutger Hauer's role in Blade Runner. He was originally going to be depicted as drinking bourbon whiskey and smoking, {{as part of his}} [...] "hard-boiled" [...] image; when the development team realized that this could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> influence on children, they made him drink coffee instead. As Takumi and Hideki Kamiya had joined Capcom around the same time and had desks near each other, Kamiya had asked Takumi for a voice role ever since the development of Justice for All; eventually, Takumi gave him the role of Godot. Takumi explained the role as a hard-boiled guy, so Kamiya decided to adapt the dialogue and shout [...] "Objection, baby!". Takumi said {{that it was a good}} take, but that the in-game graphics just say [...] "Objection!", so it could not be used.|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone {{had trouble}} {{deciding}} how to resolve the episode and bring the zombie characters back to life. Although they ultimately settled on having Kyle kill the [...] "main zombie" [...] {{to bring back the}} others, Parker did not feel the resolution made sense and described it as a deus ex machina. Parker said of the ending, [...] "This was another big one of those episodes where we were sort of (like), 'How do we get out of this one?'" [...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. Parker said, [...] "We were pretty bummed out, and we kind of thought, well, we're going to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> episode go on the air, and hopefully it won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving.

500|$|New York Daily News writer David Hinckley said Lowe and Scott {{were strong}} {{additions}} to the show, and that Scott's character in Parks was better than his character in Party Down. Hinckley said the humor [...] "remains happily rooted in the show's eccentric characters", although he {{said some of the}} jokes, like Andy's [...] "November" [...] song [...] "sometimes feels like a series of short sketches instead of a show". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell described Lowe as entertaining but [...] "one-note", but said Adam Scott was [...] "much more promising and nuanced", with better potential for a romantic interest for Leslie than previous guest stars like Will Arnett and Justin Theroux. Kandell felt Schneider's imminent departure from the series seemed unceremonious, and praised Nick Offerman's reactions of [...] "unbridled ecstasy" [...] at the idea of cutbacks and the government shutdown. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic expressed doubt about the long-term effectiveness of Lowe's character, and said the April and Andy subplot felt [...] "dragged out for yet another week". However, he praised the script, the addition of Scott, and the performance of the entire cast, especially Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari. Hochberger said, [...] "I'm not convinced Parks and Recreation could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> episode {{at this point in the}} season." [...] TV Squad writer Kona Gallagher felt [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was an especially important episode due to the addition of the Lowe and Scott characters, the beginning of Mark's exit from the series and the economic problems for Pawnee. However, Gallagher also said the episode felt mostly like a preparation for the third season.|$|E
