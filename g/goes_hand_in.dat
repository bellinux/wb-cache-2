5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E

Ecotourism is now an important industry, and this <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with the conservation efforts.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the {{dominant}} process of layering is fractional crystallisation, layering can also {{result in a}} magma body through assimilation of the wall rocks. This will tend to increase the silica content of the melt, which will eventually prompt a mineral to reach the liquidus for that magma composition. Note also that assimilation of wall rocks takes considerable thermal energy, so this process <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with the natural cooling of the magma body. Often, assimilation can only be proven by detailed geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Case-marking {{is one of}} {{the formal}} guises of DSM, along with agreement, inverse systems and voice alterations, which <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with DSM. The use of case marking on subject is to {{differentiate}} prominence in arguments. It can be used on subjects of transitive verbs and intransitive verbs. The definiteness and animacy scale of Differential Subject Marking has the same hierarchical structure exhibited in the section on Differential Object Marking. The functional motivation for the implementation of DSM and DOM is to avoid ambiguity as to what is subject and object in transitive clauses. The most natural hierarchy of animacy and definiteness places transitive subjects higher than transitive object.|$|E
25|$|In the Letter, Rousseau {{rejected}} the traditional notion of male politicians {{being responsible for}} moral reform, {{and thought it was}} women's responsibility. He considered women, by virtue of their nature, to be the primary agents of moral reform, and that the success of the state depends on the harmony within private, domestic life. Rousseau opposed marriage without love (i.e. marriage for financial reasons, order, lust, convenience). In Rousseau's opinion, true love for the nurturing, feminine mother, instead of lustful love for a mistress, <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with patriotism and civic harmony. The legislator's task is to make sure a society's women are in order.|$|E

25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E
25|$|Southern yellowjackets have a {{polygynous}} mating system: {{a colony}} {{has more than}} one queen. In other Vespula species, polygyny tends to be found in mild climates where the colony can last more than a year. Given that many of this species live in temperate or subtropical environments, perennial nests have been observed. Polygynous perennial colonies occur when reproductive females (queens) reproduce in the colony instead of leaving it. As a result of the multiple queens and additional seasons and workers in perennial nests, these colonies tend to be much larger than their annual counterparts. While scientists have argued that a polygynous mating system would breed disease and reduce fitness, many examples of the polygynous nests are seen. The parasitic nature of the species <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with their polygynous mating system. In a parasitic system, females lay eggs in a different species’ nests, and in a polygynous system a female of the same species lays eggs in the nest in the hopes of overtaking the current queen. Dead queens of the same species have been found in V. squamosa nests, supporting the idea of competition between queens as a result of polygyny. This polygyny may be tolerated in large multiple-season nests because the size of the nest reduces interactions between the competing queens. This process of seizing the nest within the species could provide the basis for parasitic nature of this species, as the takeover of a nest either within species or between species is a fairly similar process.|$|E
500|$|A {{sense of}} foreboding and {{paranoia}} pervades {{the world of}} the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored—especially regarding replicants' implanted memories. Control over the environment is exercised on a vast scale, and <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with the absence of any natural life; for example, artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to [...] "off-world" [...] (extraterrestrial) colonies. The dystopian themes explored in Blade Runner are an early example of the expansion of cyberpunk concepts into cinema. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question the nature of reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.|$|E

500|$|The episode drew {{criticism}} from the lesbian community, however. Kate Murray of lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com regarded Emily's willingness {{to have sex with}} JJ as the use of a [...] "classic and highly offensive stereotype" [...] and felt that this [...] "undermine {{what it means to be}} a lesbian".

500|$|In {{addition}} to exploring {{the trials and}} tribulations of achieving the great American dream during the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme, exemplifying in Daisy Buchanan's character the marginalization {{of women in the}} East Egg social class that Fitzgerald depicts. As an upper-class, white woman living in East Egg during this time period in America, Daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations, including but certainly not limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife, mother, keeper of the house, and charming socialite. As the reader finds in the novel, many of Daisy's choices, ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved, can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a [...] "beautiful little fool" [...] who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. For instance, one could argue that Daisy's ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby {{can be attributed to the}} status, security, and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides. Additionally, the theme of the female familial role within The Great Gatsby <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with that of the ideal family unit associated with the great American dream- a dream that goes unrealized for Gatsby and Daisy in Fitzgerald's prose.|$|E

On January 8, 2012, the Spider-Man logo {{appeared}} {{on some of the}} world's most iconic buildings, such as the Sydney Opera House, the Colosseum of Rome, the Kremlin in Moscow and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The screening revealed a second trailer in 3D, which thereafter appeared online. Glen Levy of Time magazine felt that the trailer's [...] "dialogue <b>goes</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with the action, rather than be dominated by it" [...] and that the action scenes from the film looked [...] "polished and slick". The special screening included an eight and a half minute extended trailer. Scott Mantz of Access Hollywood felt that the extended footage seemed is edgier and more character-driven and that [...] "the Lizard looks like a great villain". Peter Sciretta of /Film said that the trailers had left him [...] "impressed" [...] and had captured a feeling of dark naturalism alongside Spider-Man's trademark wisecracking. With the second official trailer and the sizzle reel, Webb felt {{that it was important to}} provide a more specific idea of the film, such as showcasing Peter and Gwen's relationship and the visual effects, just to display the attitude of the film that he and the crew were trying to create. On February 7, 2012 it was reported that the latest official trailer revealed a link to the viral marketing internet site for the film.|$|E
