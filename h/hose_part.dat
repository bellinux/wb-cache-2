50|$|The fleet refuelled {{again on}} 26-27 January. In practice, this was {{unsatisfactory}} as, {{with a mixture}} of poor weather and inexperience, the tankers suffered damage as ships failed to keep station and <b>hoses</b> <b>parted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|USS Spence - rudder jammed hard to starboard, capsized and sunk with 317 men drowned (23 survivors) after <b>hoses</b> <b>parted</b> {{attempting}} to refuel from New Jersey {{because they had}} also disobeyed orders to ballast down directly from Admiral Halsey ...|$|R
50|$|Santoprene TPV enjoyed early {{application}} successes in the automotive sector, including {{rack and pinion}} boots, due to its flex life, fluid resistance and sealability. In the appliance sector, a dishwasher sump boot made with Santoprene TPV provided good sealing and resistance to heat and fluids. Due to its sealing properties, Santoprene TPV was also successful in the domestic and high-rise construction sectors in applications such as window seals, caster wheels, tubing and small <b>hose</b> <b>parts,</b> electrical connectors and coatings for wire and cables. It was also used in the medical industry as a gasket on syringe plungers.|$|R
50|$|Thatcher {{then joined}} TG 38.3 for {{operations}} in the Philippine Islands. On 14, 15, and 16 December, the carriers launched strikes against Luzon to support the landings on Mindoro. The group retired to refuel, but the rapidly falling barometer indicated a typhoon approaching. Thatcher was fueled to 50% capacity before the <b>hoses</b> <b>parted</b> due to rough seas. The task force attempted to steam out of the danger area but was {{near the center of}} the storm on the 17th and 18th. Three United States destroyers were lost. When the weather cleared and the fleet reassembled, Thatcher joined TG 30.8, a supply group, and served with it until 7 January 1945.|$|R

5000|$|Passing a line at 1008, within 10 {{minutes of}} the explosions, Auk drew {{alongside}} Pelican. After seeing one <b>hose</b> line <b>part,</b> Auk passed another to aid Pelican in pumping out the rapidly rising water below decks. However, the rough seas repeatedly slammed the ships together, damaging lines and hoses, and forcing their replacement. At 1054, [...] passed a towline and began moving ahead with the crippled Pelican, in turn tethered to Auk, astern.|$|R
5000|$|The fire {{on board}} Dickerson grew rapidly as Bunch maneuvered to help but was [...] "fairly well under control" [...] by 1930. Seeing {{that she was}} [...] "receiving {{considerable}} structural damage" [...] alongside the stricken ship, Bunch pulled away but sent a fire and rescue party over {{in one of her}} LCPRs. In the meantime, UDT-21 swimmers used their rubber boats to rescue many of the Dickerson survivors forced over the side by the flames. Back on board Dickersion where the fire had burst forth again, Bunchs fire and rescue party — aided by a contingent from Crosley — succeeded in getting gasoline-driven handy-billies in operation to battle them. Bunch passed a towline and three fire hoses across to Dickerson and began to tow her, while men cut away Dickersons port-side boats to lessen the list. Soon, however, the towline and <b>hoses</b> <b>parted,</b> and the salvagers lost their hard-won gains when the fires broke out with renewed vigor as a result. To make matters worse, a freshening wind made getting another hawser across to her even more difficult. Eventually, [...] arrived, took Dickerson in tow, put out her fires, and brought her into Kerama Retto. After screening Arikara and Dickerson to Kerama Retto and transferring 61 survivors to PCE-852, Bunch returned to station A-20 where {{the rest of the day}} passed mercifully quietly.|$|R
50|$|During launch {{preparations}} at Kennedy, technicians {{noticed a}} small {{section of the}} aft radiator retract hose that was bent in a shape similar to the Greek letter Omega. The <b>hose</b> is <b>part</b> of the shuttle's cooling system that carries Freon, and is designed to flex when the payload bay doors are opened and closed. Making sure they were not overlooking potential problems, NASA engineers designed a tool to guide the hose back into the storage box, and performed the procedure on 3 February 2008. Engineers would monitor the hose during STS-122, and {{in the unlikely event}} that it were to begin leaking Freon, the shuttle's computers would turn off the redundant radiator system before any Freon had a chance to leak out.|$|R
5000|$|As {{soon as the}} car {{comes to}} a halt, the first step, taken while the fourth tire changer assumes his position, is for a {{mechanic}} to activate the car's built-in pneumatic jacks. A pressurized air hose is inserted into a receiving nozzle {{at the rear of}} the car, under the rear wing. Previously, this device was inserted on the side of the car, but for safety reasons, the location was moved in the 2000s. At the same instant, another crew member begins the refueling process. A fueling hose is inserted into a socket (called the [...] "buckeye"), allowing a gravity-fed hose to refill the car's fuel tank. The fuel hose has a built-in vent/overflow <b>hose</b> as <b>part</b> of the mechanism, an invention of the mid-2000s. Previously, a second [...] "vent hose" [...] was utilized, but it was phased out to improve safety.|$|R
5000|$|Kilt hose {{are long}} {{stockings}} normally worn knee-high with the upper <b>part</b> of the <b>hose</b> folded {{back down to}} create a thicker cuff just below the knee. They are made of wool or Acrylic or some combination thereof and are available {{in a variety of}} solid colors so as to match any tartan colour. They can also be found in diced patterns, which are required wear for Highland dancers. The most common colour of hose however, is the cream, or 'off-white' hose, the colour of unbleached wool. Pipers often wear brilliant white 'pipers hose' made of entirely synthetic fibre. Piper hose differs also in that the top of the hose has a 'built-in' cuff with a raised texture. The [...] "Lassie" [...] and [...] "Laddie" [...] characters from WeeSing's Grandpa's Magical Toys wear white <b>hose</b> as <b>part</b> of their fictionalized Scottish costumes.|$|R
50|$|The racal suit {{is similar}} to other {{positive}} pressure personnel suits such as Chemturion, in {{that there is an}} air supply to provide positive pressure to reduce the chance of airborne agents entering the suit. However, several components are different. The positive pressure section for the racal suit is only available at the hood. The air supply for racal suits comes from a battery-operated blower that makes the suit portable, whereas other suits must be connected to an air <b>hose</b> that is <b>part</b> of the building, such as in biosafety level 4 laboratories. The main body part of the racal suit is also more lightweight and can be disposed of by burning after use.|$|R

40|$|This video {{shows the}} {{activities}} of the STS- 107 crew on flight day 13 of the Columbia orbiter's final mission. The crew members include: Rick Husband, Commander; William McCool, Pilot; Kalpana Chawla, David Brown, Michael Anderson, Laurel Clark, Mission Specialists; Ilan Ramon, Payload Specialist. The primary activities of flight day 13 are spaceborne experiments, including troubleshooting undertaken by Mission Specialist Chawla on the Water Mist Fire Suppression (MIST) experiment. Chawla performs troubleshooting tasks relayed to her by Mission Control. She shows Mission Control the location of air and water in a transparent <b>hose</b> that is <b>part</b> of the atomizer on the exterior of the combustion module. She also changes the atomizer head. All six Space Technology and Research Students (STARS) experiments are profiled in the video. These experiments are on ants, crystal growth in a chemical garden, fish embryos, carpenter bees, spiders, and silkworms. The video also includes a view of the southeast Texas coast near Houston, and a view of Portugal, Spain, Gibraltar, Morocco, and the Sahara Desert. The video ends with an explanation of roses at Mission Control which commemorate astronauts who have died on missions...|$|R
50|$|Hydro-Man {{is able to}} bodily {{transform}} {{himself into}} a watery liquid substance; he can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease; when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man's cells remain fully under his control when {{he is in his}} liquid state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form. He can increase his mass and cause tidal waves and tsunamis. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. Through great mental exertion, Hydro-Man can also turn into steam. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire <b>hose,</b> shaping <b>parts</b> of his body into 'solid-water', constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. However, this last example to defeat Hydro-Man can be using other compounds against him, since certain substances can either harden him (like cement or concrete), or make him feel sick (such as fire-extinguishers and chlorine). The Wizard enhanced his powers, through the use of sophisticated equipment. These artificial enhancements granted him increased and more precise control over bodies of water and moisture near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in the Trapster's body. However, Spider-Man teamed up with Iceman and used Iceman's powers to solidify him into ice. Hydro-Man claims that he has not aged since he gained his powers. Hydro-Man possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, and {{has been shown to be}} an exceptionally skilled fighter, and adept at using his powers for that purpose. In some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his forearms into weapons such as Sandman does, except that Bench's weapons are made of water. Bench has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques due to his experience as a criminal before his transformation. Though cunning, he has been consistently depicted by writers as a low tier henchman with little formal education and is often tricked into using his powers in ways that incapacitate him (as explained above). His normal attire consists of a black shirt and blue/or green pants, as well as a costume invented by the Wizard.|$|R
40|$|We present herein a {{new class}} of resin {{formulations}} for stereolithography, named FlexSL, with a broad bandwidth of tunable mechanical properties. The novel polyether(meth) acrylate based material class has outstanding material characteristics in combination with the advantages of being a biocompatible (meth) acrylate based processing material. FlexSL shows very promising results in several initial biocompatibility tests. This emphasizes its non-toxic behavior in a biomedical environment, caused mainly by the (meth) acrylate based core components. A short overview of mechanical and processing properties will be given in the end. The herein presented novel FlexSL materials show a significant lower cytotoxicity in contrast to commercial applied acrylic stereolithography resins. Further biocompatibility tests according to ISO 10993 protocols are planned. On the one hand, there are technical applications for this material (e. g. flaps, tubes, <b>hoses,</b> cables, sealing <b>parts,</b> connectors and other technical rubber-like applications), and on the other hand, broad fields of potential biomedical applications in which the FlexSL materials can be beneficial are obvious. Especially these could be small series production of medical products with special flexible material requirements. In addition, the usage for individual soft hearing aid shells, intra-operative planning services and tools like intra-op cutting templates and sawing guides is very attractive. The possibility to modify the FlexSL resins also for high-resolution applications makes it possible to manufacture now very flexible micro-prototypes with outstanding material characteristics and very fine structures with a minimum resolution of 20 mym and a layer thickness of minimal 5 myrn. These resin formulations are applicable and adjustable to other stereolithographic equipment available on the market...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{analytic}} {{linear model}} of hydraulic cylinder usually comes from assumptions of identical action piston areas {{on both sides}} of hydraulic cylinder (double piston rod) and suitable operation point, which is usually chosen in the middle of piston. By reason of that volumes inside of cylinder are than same. Moreover for control of that arrangement of hydraulic cylinder, usually controlled by 4 / 3 servovalve, the same mount of flows comes in and comes out to each of chambers of hydraulic cylinder. Presented paper deal with development of extended form of analytic linear model of single piston rod hydraulic cylinder which respects different action piston areas and volumes inside of chambers of hydraulic cylinder and also two different input flows of hydraulic cylinder. In extended model are also considered possibilities of different dead volumes in <b>hoses</b> and intake <b>parts</b> of hydraulic cylinder. Dead volume has impact on damping of hydraulic cylinder. Because the system of hydraulic cylinder is generally presented as a integrative system with inertia of second order: eq, we can than obtain time constants and damping of hydraulic cylinder for each of analytic form model. The model has arisen for needs of model fractionation on two parts. Part of behaviour of chamber A and part of behaviour of chamber B of cylinder. It was created for the reason of analysis and synthesis of control parameters of regulation circuit of multivalve control concept of hydraulic drive with separately controlled chamber A and B which could be then used for...|$|R
5000|$|The 02:40 Cliffe to Uddingston cement {{train was}} {{travelling}} on the Down Slow line at about [...] - {{the maximum speed}} permitted at the time for trains conveying loaded wagons of this type, when the rear axle of the 12th wagon became derailed towards the cess (the space between tracks - and the lineside) on plain track. As the train proceeded, the derailed wheels moved further towards the cess smashing the timber sleepers in the track until, after travelling some the coupling between the 11th and 12th wagons fractured and the vacuum <b>hose</b> pipe <b>parted,</b> causing the brakes to become fully applied on both portions of the train. The front portion proceeded along the line for [...] and then stopped. The 13th to 20th wagons in the rear portion became derailed and went down the embankment, and came to rest mostly on their sides. The 23rd wagon, however, was slewed round more or less {{at right angles to}} the line and stopped with its leading end some [...] foul of the Down Fast line.The passenger train was the 12:00 express from King's Cross to Edinburgh, and it comprised 13 coaches drawn by a Type 4 diesel-electric locomotive. It was running under clear signals on the Down Fast line at about 80 m.p.h. (128 km/h) close behind the freight train. The driver saw at a distance of about [...] what seemed to him to be a cloud of dust and then he saw the cement wagon foul of the line on which his train wastravelling. He applied the brakes fully but he could not prevent a collision, and the left-hand side of the locomotive struck the wagon at a speed of about [...] The locomotive and the leading seven coaches were derailed towards the Up Fast line but they remained upright and inline; the rear six coaches remained on the track. The left-hand side of the locomotive was extensively damaged and the driver and second man were fortunate to escape injury. The derailed coaches were all severely damaged but the most serious damage was to the leading coach which had its left-hand side ripped away, and to the next two coaches which were severely torn, all by contact with the wagon.The train was well filled and I regret to report that seven passengers were killed and 45 were injured and removed to hospital where they were detained; the injuries to 15 passengers were serious. The collision was witnessed by a farm-hand working nearby who immediately went to a telephone and summoned assistance. The driver of the freight train also rang the signalman at Thirsk from the telephone on a signal near which his locomotive had stopped, and asked for the emergency services to be sent urgently. These services responded with commendable promptitude and, despite the difficult access to the site, the first ambulance arrived at 15:40; the last of the injured had been removed by 16:30.|$|R
