6000|$|... "I don't know why," [...] he continued, to Harry, [...] "the first {{flash of}} {{lightning}} {{at the beginning of}} a storm is always the most dangerous. I can't account for it, in any way, but there is no question as to the fact. I always feel relieved when the first clap of thunder is over; for <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>that</b> we are comparatively safe from danger, in that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>know,</b> White, <b>I</b> {{ought to}} have sent that money, but how was <b>I</b> to <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> it was so {{imperative}} to send that money?...|$|R
60|$|But I was young--too young, by far-- Or I {{had been}} more wary, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> not <b>then</b> <b>that</b> winkles are The stock-in-trade of MARY.|$|R
60|$|Ah! I {{should think}} it was! Grown such a woman, so pretty, so intelligent, so expressive! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> {{she must be}} really like my child, or I could never have known her, {{standing}} quiet by the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} as it is. I {{know now that}} I was not fit for it. When your sister came to me, I never thought of remonstrating. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> I had seen it for the last time." ...|$|E
60|$|The Celebrity turned around: an {{expression}} of extraordinary intelligence shot across his face, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> {{the hole in the}} well-nigh invulnerable armor of his conceit had been found at last. And Miss Thorn, of all people, had discovered it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{can wait}} till supper. <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have never seen}} you before. I forbid you to unmask till supper! Will you obey?" [...] she cried anxiously.|$|R
60|$|After this nothing {{happened}} {{to me for a}} long while. Indeed I had the best time of my life and grew very strong and big, yes, the strongest and biggest hare of any that I ever saw, also the swiftest of foot. Twice I was chased by dogs; once by Giles's black beast, Nigger, and once by that of a shepherd. Finding that I could run right away from them without exerting myself at all, I grew to despise dogs. Ah! little did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> there are many different breeds of these animals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Lady Montfort, {{with half}} a sigh, [...] "it is no use talking about it. He will not come. Our society bores him, and he must be amused. I write to him every day, and {{sometimes}} twice a day, and pass my life in collecting things to interest him. I would never leave him for a moment, only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> he would get wearied of me; and he thinks now--at least, he once said so--that he {{has never had a}} dull moment in my company." ...|$|R
60|$|Monsieur de St. Gre {{glanced at}} me, and an enigmatical smile spread over his face. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the ice was cracked between us. Yet {{he was too}} much {{a man of the}} world not to make one more {{tentative}} remark.|$|E
6000|$|I held {{my breath}} {{for a moment in}} amazement. Since when had {{thoughts}} like this come to her? <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the days of her childhood were numbered indeed, that, underneath the fresh joyous grace of her delightful youth, the woman's instincts were stirring. And I was afraid! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> my {{identity}} had been guessed. With {{a show of}} excitement that I had never before seen evinced {{by a member of}} the dominant race of Pellucidar, the Mahar hustled me away, heavily guarded, through the main avenue of the city to one of the principal buildings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I would I had; <b>I</b> should <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> {{everything}} {{was open to}} me. Now I have everything to do for myself. I do not despair, however. As for you, the ball is at your foot." ...|$|R
60|$|For Johnny {{had stuck}} {{his hands in}} his pockets and turned his back {{squarely}} on me. I thought it so unkind of him. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> it was because he was afraid he was going to cry right there before everybody, and I felt deserted by all the world.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Divorce, I expect,' the lad went on, as Captain Hampton {{took a seat}} on {{the only}} chair in the dark little office. 'I allus notice that the first time they comes they usually goes on like that. After a time or two they takes it more business-like. They comes in brisk, and says, [...] "Is Mr. Slippen in?" [...] just the same as if they was asking for a cup of tea. When they goes out {{sometimes}} they look sour, and <b>I</b> <b>knows</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> he,' and he jerked his thumb towards the inner office, 'hasn't any news to tell 'em; sometimes they goes out looking red in the face and in a regular paddy, and you can see by the way they grips their umbrellas they would like to give it to some one.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her sorrow {{left her}} more womanly than ever. And {{after the first}} sharp sting of it was deadened, I noticed a marked reserve in her {{intercourse}} with me. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> she must have strong suspicions of her father's request. Speak I could not soon after the sad event, but I strove hard that she should see no change in my conduct.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{a little}} blue mark upon his temple," [...] he continued, {{in the same}} hard, emotionless voice. [...] "We stood and looked at it, you and I. It was close upon morning then, you know--it seemed to grow light as we stood there, didn't it? You tried to bring him to. I {{knew that it was}} no use. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> he was dead." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{walked to}} the other end of the room, and stood facing the {{carefully}} drawn curtains of the windows; fantastically, they seemed to represent the impasse to which my mind had come. Did she intend, ultimately, to get a divorce? I dared not ask her. The word rang horribly in my ears, though unpronounced; and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> I lacked her courage, and the knowledge was part of my agony.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> little <b>knew,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>that</b> {{the custom}} was to hunt out the richest piece {{of rock and}} get it assayed! Very often, that piece, {{the size of a}} filbert, was the only {{fragment}} in a ton that had a particle of metal in it--and yet the assay made it pretend to represent the average value of the ton of rubbish it came from! ...|$|R
6000|$|CURTIS--[With {{a gesture}} of aversion.] I loathe this book-writing. It isn't my part, I realize now. But when I made the plans you speak of, how could <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>then?</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, Phil Thomas Katt {{gave his}} first live {{performance}} {{before an audience}} of nine fellow neighborhood children. The set included his own rendition of the [...] "Gilligan's Island" [...] theme song. According to Katt, [...] "The first time I performed, I sang the 'Gilligan's Island' song for the neighborhood kids. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> right <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to be a}} musician." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I forbade Dr. Barry {{to take it}} off, Richard, {{when you}} lay so white and still. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> you had been true to me, despite what I had heard. And {{if you were to}} die--" [...] her voice broke a little as she passed her hand over my brow, [...] "if you were to die, my single comfort would have been that you wore it then." ...|$|E
60|$|There, by the high-altar, I saw a {{form that}} seemed at first {{luminous}} and ghostly, but in which presently I recognised Madonna Paola, the dim rays of the distant tapers finding out the white robe with which her limbs were hung. She was alone, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> it was but the very natural fear consequent upon awakening {{in such a place}} that had provoked the cry I had heard.|$|E
60|$|That was {{too much}} for the rickety loft floor. It was only a bit of brush laid on a netting of slender poles. It creaked, rasped, and went down with a crash. I alighted upon somebody, and knocked him to the floor. Whoever it was, seized me with iron hands. I was buried, almost smothered, in the dusty mass. My captor began to curse cheerfully, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Herky-Jerky had made me a prisoner.|$|E
40|$|Two {{major themes}} of my {{research}} have been finite model theory and the automata theoretic approach. Boaz Trakhtenbrot laid the foundations in both areas. In 1950, he proved the undecidability of the satisfiability in the finite problem for first-order logic. His contributions to the automata-theoretic approach are described in this paper. I met Boaz in a seminar in 1981, when I was a doctoral student. Little did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> his work would have such {{a profound impact on}} my future research. Abstract. One of the surprising developments in the area of program verification is how ideas introduced originally by logicians in the 1950 s ended up yielding by 2003 an industrial-standard property-specification language called PSL. This development was enabled by the equally unlikely transformation of the mathematical machinery of automata on infinite words, introduced in the early 1960 s for second-order arithmetics, into effective algorithms for model-checking tools. This paper attempts to trace the tangled threads of this development...|$|R
60|$|I sat {{myself down}} upon {{a seat in}} the shade. Presently, as I had expected, Nicephorus, the priest-Cæsar, and his four brethren came into the garden. Two of them led the blind man by the hand, and the other two clung close to him, for all these unfortunates loved each other dearly. The four with the split tongues gabbled in his ears. Now and again, when he could catch or guess at the meaning of a word, he {{answered}} the speaker gently; or the others, seeing that he had not understood them aright, painfully tried to explain the error. Oh! it was a piteous thing to see and hear. My gorge rose against the young brute of an Emperor and his councillors who, for ambition's sake, had wrought this horrible crime. Little did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> ere long their fate would be his own, and that a mother's hand would deal it out to him.|$|R
60|$|The man laughed, and I {{saw it was}} Thorn, though <b>I</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> {{after doing}} my work and his own during the day he had watched {{the greater part of}} every night beside me.|$|R
60|$|One day, on a dull, drowsy afternoon, the dream-child called. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> {{the end was}} near; the end {{had been}} near in the old grandmother's case sixty years before when the dream-child called in the day. The doctor looked graver than ever when I told him, {{and said that the}} time had come when I must have help in my task. I could not watch by day and night. Unless I had {{assistance}} I would break down.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} stand there with her, but sat indoors {{watching}} her, with my heart hardly beating, and my hands grasping tightly {{the arms of the}} chair, as if to keep down the wild impulse which prompted me to rush madly down to the station to see the paper. At last Polly moved, and then went up the road, out of my sight, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> she saw Harry coming back again, and that the news was in.|$|E
60|$|Then I saw red again. All my wrongs and humiliations flashed upon {{me with a}} {{dazzling}} brightness, all that I had suffered and others had suffered at his hands, all {{the enormity of the}} man’s very existence. I sprang upon him, blindly, insanely, and drove the knife into his shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>that</b> it {{was no more than a}} flesh wound,—I had felt the steel grate on his shoulder-blade,—and I raised the knife to strike at a more vital part.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, Head Sahib. We know," [...] said Crandall, as the Head {{slipped off}} his gown {{with a grunt}} in his smoking-room. [...] "I found out just now from our substitute. He was gettin' my opinion of your {{performance}} {{last night in the}} dormitory. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>then</b> <b>that</b> it was you he was talkin' about. Crafty young animal. Freckled chap with eyes---Corkran, I think his name is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Honor'!" [...] she mimicked in {{tones of}} scorn. [...] "I please thee, do <b>I?</b> <b>Then</b> <b>know,</b> swine, <b>that</b> thou pleaseth me not--that the {{daughter}} of John Carter is not for such as thou!" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>then,</b> <b>that</b> from {{indulging in}} that simple habit of smoking, I have gained among the ladies a dreadful reputation. I {{see that they}} look coolly upon me, and darkly at their husbands when they arrive at home in my company. Men, I observe, in consequence, ask me to dine much oftener at the club, or the [...] "Star and Garter" [...] at Richmond, or at [...] "Lovegrove's," [...] than in their own houses; and {{with this sort of}} {{arrangement}} I am fain to acquiesce; for, as I said before, I am of an easy temper, and can at any rate take my cigar-case out after dinner at Blackwall, when my lady or the duchess is not by. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> of course, the best MEN in town; and as for ladies' society, not having it (for I will have none of your pseudo-ladies, such as sometimes honor bachelors' parties,--actresses, couturieres, opera-dancers, and so forth)--as for ladies' society, I say, I cry pish! 'tis not worth the trouble of the complimenting, and the bother of pumps and black silk stockings.|$|R
