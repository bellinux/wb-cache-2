2500|$|The Charga-Plate, {{developed}} in 1928, {{was an early}} predecessor of the credit card and {{was used in the}} U.S. from the 1930s to the late 1950s. It was a 2½" [...] × 1¼" [...] rectangle of sheet metal related to Addressograph and military dog tag systems. It was embossed with the customer's name, city, and state. It held a small paper card on its back for a signature. In recording a purchase, the plate was laid into a recess in the <b>imprinter,</b> with a paper [...] "charge slip" [...] positioned on top of it. The record of the transaction included an impression of the embossed information, made by the <b>imprinter</b> pressing an inked ribbon against the charge slip. Charga-Plate was a trademark of Farrington Manufacturing Co. Charga-Plates were issued by large-scale merchants to their regular customers, much like department store credit cards of today. In some cases, the plates were kept in the issuing store rather than held by customers. When an authorized user made a purchase, a clerk retrieved the plate from the store's files and then processed the purchase. Charga-Plates speeded back-office bookkeeping and reduced copying errors that were done manually in paper ledgers in each store.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of payment terminals, merchants would use Manual <b>Imprinters</b> also known as ZipZap machines to capture the information from the embossed information on a credit card onto a paper slips with carbon paper copies. These paper slips had to be taken to the bank for processing. This was a cumbersome and time consuming process.|$|R
40|$|Hormonal {{imprinting}} is an epigenetic {{process which}} {{is taking place}} perinatally at the first encounter between the developing hormone receptors and their target hormones. The hormonal imprinting influences the binding capacity of receptors, the hormone synthesis of the cells, and other hormonally regulated functions, as sexual behavior, aggressivity, empathy, etc. However, during the critical period, when the window for imprinting is open, molecules similar to the physiological <b>imprinters</b> as synthetic hormone analogs, {{other members of the}} hormone families, environmental pollutants, etc. can cause faulty imprinting with life-long consequences. The developing immune system, the cells of which also have receptors for hormones, is very sensitive to faulty imprinting, which causes alterations in the antibody and cytokine production, in the ratio of immune cells, in the defense against bacterial and viral infections as well as against malginant tumors. Immune cells (lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and mast cells) are also producing hormones which are secreted into the blood circulation as well as are transported locally (packed transport). This process is also disturbed by faulty imprinting. As immune cells are differentiating during the whole life, faulty imprinting could develop any time, however, the most decisive is the perinatal imprinting. The faulty imprinting is inherited to the progenies in general and {{especially in the case of}} immune system. In our modern world the number and amount of arteficial <b>imprinters</b> (e. g. endocrine disruptors and drugs) are enormously increasing. The effects of the faulty <b>imprinters</b> most dangerous to the immune system are shown in the paper. The present and future consequences of the flood of faulty imprintings are unpredictable however, it is discussed...|$|R

While {{that is still}} the case for flatter {{reclaimed}} areas, the likelihood of flat, smooth, clod-free seed beds in drastically disturbed areas is less likely. Rough is now considered better in some situations, especially steep slopes, especially those exposed to wind or water erosion. Therefore, pitters or <b>imprinters</b> can be helpful equipment in those instances, especially if followed with broadcast seeding/chaining to get good seed/soil contact.|$|R

40|$|The yeast Rhodotorula glutinis {{contains}} an enantioselective, membrane-associated epoxide hydrolase (EH). Partially purified EH was immobilized in a two-step procedure. In the first step, the proteins were derivatized with itaconic anhydride. In the second step, the derivatized proteins were co-polymerized with {{ethylene glycol dimethacrylate}} in water-free cyclohexane to form a bioplastic. Before co-polymerization, the derivatized enzyme had been imprinted by substrates or its analogues (called <b>imprinters)</b> in an aqueous phase. After removing the <b>imprinters,</b> an enzyme with rationally modified properties was obtained. This {{is the first time}} that the above-mentioned method was successfully performed with a membrane-associated enzyme of the /-hydrolase fold family to which EH belongs. The enantioselective conversion of (±) - 1, 2 -epoxyoctane was reversed from a preference for (R) - 1, 2 -epoxyoctane to (S) - 1, 2 -epoxyoctane when the enzyme had been imprinted with (S) - 1, 2 -epoxyoctane prior to co-polymerization. The enzymatic reaction was performed in aqueous media. Other benefits of immobilizing EH into a co-polymer were the ease of recycling of the biocatalyst and the separation of biocatalyst and its products. An unexpected benefit was the enhanced enzyme stability. The half-life of the immobilized and imprinted biocatalyst was enhanced at least 7 -fold. Most remarkable was that washing the immobilized EH with HCl, followed by washing it with buffer, resulted in about 50 ␘f the residual activity, while native EH completely lost its activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{fabricate}} membranes with arrays of apertures {{only a few}} nanometers in diameter are important to many fields of research, including ion beam lithography, DNA sequencing, single ion implantations, and single molecule studies. Because even the state-of-the-art lithography tools are limited {{in their ability to}} produce nanoscale features, alternative methods of fabricating single pores of nanometer scale have been developed, using ion-beam sculpting and focused-ion-beam assisted deposition. However, these methods cannot simultaneously produce multiple holes of nanometer dimension. Here we report a means of forming arrays of nanopores simultaneously on a thin, solid-state membrane using plasma-based thin-film deposition. By depositing layers of metallic thin films, the aperture sizes of pores in a pre-fabricated membrane can be reduced from a couple of micrometers down to tens of nanometers and even smaller. The technique offers a way to reduce the sizes of aperture of any shape in a variety of substrate materials, both conducting and insulating. Such arrays of nanopores can serve as membrane channels for DNA sequencing, as masks in ion-beam <b>imprinters,</b> for the fabrication of quantum dots, and in other applications...|$|R

50|$|Under the {{previous}} system, a customer typically had to hand their card to a sales clerk {{to pay for}} a transaction. When credit cards were first introduced, merchants used mechanical (rather than magnetic) portable card <b>imprinters</b> that required carbon paper to make an imprint. They did not communicate electronically with the card issuer, and the card never left the customer's sight. The merchant had to verify transactions over a certain currency limit by telephoning the card issuer. During the 1970s in the United States, many merchants subscribed to a regularly-updated list of stolen or otherwise invalid credit cards numbers. This list was commonly printed in booklet form on newsprint, in numerical order, much like a slender phone book, yet without any data aside from the list of invalid numbers. Checkout cashiers were expected to thumb through this booklet each and every time a credit card was presented for payment of any amount, prior to approving the transaction, which incurred a short delay. This pause generally did not endear the credit card user to those waiting in line behind them.|$|R

As a result, use of the Model 70 hand <b>imprinter</b> by field medics was rapidly abandoned (as were most of the Model 70s themselves), and eventually the specification that tags include the locator notch was removed from production orders.
