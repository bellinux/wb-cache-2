It was not what {{we got out of}} civilization but what we put into it that was our gain. Its luxuries and ostentations were, in themselves, perhaps bad for us. But the pursuit of them was good. It called forth thought and effort, sharpened our wits, strengthened our brains.

5|$|The Nobel Prize medals, minted by Myntverket in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are {{registered}} trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has {{an image of}} Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of Nature, as a Goddess, whose veil is held up by the <b>Genius</b> of <b>Science.</b> These medals and the ones for Physiology/Medicine and Literature were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis attempts {{to answer the}} question, Is War art of science? In doing so it draws heavily upon Thomas Kuhn's humanistic philosophy of science. If War can be separated theoretically into two distinct analytical units, preparation for war, and conduct of war, then {{the answer to the}} question becomes more accessible. The war preparation process is notably similar to the Kuhnian dynamic of scientific process, i. e., the evolution of a paradigm through inter-disciplinary criticism and rearticulation. A case study of post-WWII US nuclear strategy is offered to substantiate the claim that war preparation operates in a way that is remarkably similar to Kuhnian science. So, if war preparation is scientific, then the conduct of war, a fundamentally different activity, may be seen as artistic. This case is made by drawing heavily upon the writings of General Carl von Clausewitz, and the 18 th century German idealist Immanuel Kant. The end result of the work is to posit the existence of two types of men necessary for the execution of War, those who demonstrate ability in the sublime <b>genius</b> of <b>science,</b> and those who are more suited to develop the heroic genius of battle. The question then arises as pertains to the US military educational system's ability to identify these men and intensify their development within each's specific forte. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} women from {{published}} histories of psychology is ad-dressed from a perspective that makes sense of women’s place {{in the history of}} psychology, including their participation, their exclusion, and their invisibility. This approach is based on principles of social construc-tionism and on a contextual approach to history that seeks to understand women’s place in psychology as a product of socially constructed no-tions of gender, psychology, and history. The article suggests that an awareness of the context created by these constructions explains wom-en‘s role in psychology to date and holds promise for their meaningful inclusion in the future. Imagine yourself living in a society where the <b>genius</b> of <b>science</b> implores a receptive publ ic t o understand “truths ” such as these: The chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is shown by man’s attaining to a higher eminence, in whatever he takes up, than can woman. (Darwin, 1871, pp. 326 - 327) Identical education of the sexes is a crime before God and humanity, that physiology protests against and that experience weeps over. (Clarke, 1873, p. 127) All that is distinctly human is man; all that is truly woman is merely repro-ductive.

The monument consists of a pedestal, which includes both sides of bronze shields representing the four major projects promoted by the mayor: Parc de la Ciutadella, Universal Exhibition, Columbus Monument and Gran Via the Catalan Parliament.

60|$|The despair thus {{arising from}} an {{education}} which suggests no pre-eminent mental activity except that of artistic creation is wholly absent from an education {{which gives the}} knowledge of scientific method. The discovery of scientific method, except in pure mathematics, {{is a thing of}} yesterday; speaking broadly, we may say that it dates from Galileo. Yet already it has transformed the world, and its success proceeds with ever-accelerating velocity. In science men have discovered an activity of the very highest value in which they are no longer, as in art, dependent for progress upon the appearance of continually greater <b>genius,</b> for in <b>science</b> the successors stand upon the shoulders of their predecessors; where one man of supreme genius has invented a method, a thousand lesser men can apply it. No transcendent ability is required in order to make useful discoveries in science; the edifice of science needs its masons, bricklayers, and common labourers as well as its foremen, master-builders, and architects. In art nothing worth doing can be done without genius; in science even a very moderate capacity can contribute to a supreme achievement.|$|R
5000|$|.....genius (1) is {{a talent}} for {{producing}} that for which no definite rule can be given, and not an aptitude in a way of cleverness for what can be learned according to some rule; and that consequently originality must be its primary property. (2) Since there may be original nonsense, its products must {{at the same time}} be models, i.e., be exemplary; and consequently, though not themselves derived from imitation, they must serve that purpose for others, i.e., as a standard or rule of estimating. (3) It cannot indicate scientifically how it brings about its product, but rather gives the rule as nature. Hence, where an author owes a product to his genius, he does not himself know how the ideas for it have entered into his head, nor has he the power to invent like at pleasure, or methodologically, and communicate the same to others in such precepts as would put them in a position to produce similar products... (4) Nature prescribes the rule through <b>genius</b> not to <b>science</b> but to art, and this also only in so far as it is to be fine art." ...|$|R

One time when I owed the IRS {{a lot of money and}} couldn't raise it, Heinlein loaned the money to me. I think a great deal of him and his wife; I dedicated a book to them in appreciation. Robert Heinlein is a fine-looking man, very impressive and very military in stance; you can tell he has a military background, even to the haircut. He knows I'm a flipped-out freak and still he helped me and my wife when we were in trouble. That is the best in humanity, there; that is who and what I love.|$|R
