Zanamivir was the first such inhibitor to be approved {{for the treatment of}} influenza in humans. It is <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> to the respiratory tract, which is the site of viral replication, in order to ensure immediate antiviral activity. Early treatment with zanamivir in clinical trials rapidly reduced the severity and duration of influenza symptoms and associated complications. Furthermore, chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir was shown to be effective in the prevention of influenza illness. To date, there is no evidence for the emergence of clinically significant zanamivir-resistant isolates. In conclusion, zanamivir offers a useful complementary strategy to vaccination in the effective management of influenza...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for delivering large molecular weight proteins into the lungs to reach local or systemic sites of action was investigated {{by examining the}} disposition of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin in the isolated rabbit lung. Alpha- 1 -antitrypsin, a model protein, was measured in the periusion medium following intravascular administration and was found to remain constant, indicating limited uptake or metabolism by lung tissue. Intrabronchial instillation of 10 mg of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin in water resulted in no measurable concentration in the recirculating perfusate during the two hours experiment. These data suggest that transport of large proteins may be limited across lung-blood membrane barriers in either direction.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to clarify whether tobacco smoke inhalation would affect dopaminergic projections differently from the reported activation after the systemic administration of nicotine. For this purpose, tobacco smoke from cigarettes containing 1. 0 or 0. 1 mg nicotine was <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> to rats, while recording from antidromically identified nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Smoke inhalation from 1. 0 mg nicotine cigarettes caused a peculiar abrupt increase: of discharge activity of mesolimbic dopamine neurons while nigrostriatal cells were less responsive. This activation was promptly antagonized by mecamylamine (2. 0 mg/kg, i. v.). In contrast, smoke delivered from 0. 1 mg nicotine cigarettes was ineffective. These findings suggest that the boosting activation of mesolimbic dopamine neurons by inhaled nicotine might be relevant for the rewarding properties Of tobacco smoking and also for the effectiveness of new treatments to stop smoking.

40|$|Abstract: From its introduction, the {{antibiotic}} tobramycin {{has been an}} important tool in the management of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. Initially an intravenous rescue treatment for pulmonary exacerbations, tobramycin <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> has become a mainstay of chronic suppressive CF infection management. Platforms for tobramycin aerosol delivery have steadily improved, with increased lung deposi-tion complimented by decreased device complexities, loaded tobramycin doses, delivery times, and treatment burdens. Most recently, a unique tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) formulation with a portable delivery system, the TOBI ® Podhaler ® (Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland) has been developed and approved in Europe, Canada, and Chile. Four capsules, each containing 28 mg of TIP are successively pierced and inhaled via the T- 326 Dry Powder Inhaler Device (Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland). No external power source is required to deliver an efficacious tobramycin dose in minutes. By comparison, tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) (TOBI®; Novartis), is delivered by LC ® Plus (PARI Respiratory Equipment Inc, Midlothian, VA) jet nebulizer powered by an air compressor over 15 – 20 minutes.

40|$|AbstractTypically, inhaled {{drugs are}} rapidly {{absorbed into the}} bloodstream, which results in {{systemic}} side effects and a brief residence time in the lungs. PEGylation was evaluated as a novel strategy for prolonging the retention of small inhaled molecules in the pulmonary tissue. Hydrolysable ester conjugates of PEG 1000, PEG 2000, mPEG 2000, PEG 3400 and prednisolone, a model drug cleared from the lungs within a few minutes, were synthesised and thoroughly characterised. The conjugates were stable in buffers with hydrolysis half-lives ranging from 1 h to 70 h, depending on the pH and level of substitution. With the exception of PEG 3400 -prednisolone, conjugates did not induce a significant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from Calu- 3 cells after a 20 h exposure. Following nebulisation to isolated perfused rat lungs (IPRL), the PEG 2000 and mPEG 2000 conjugates reduced the maximum prednisolone concentration in the perfusate (Cmax) by 3. 0 and 2. 2 fold, respectively. Moreover, while prednisolone was undetectable in the perfusion solution beyond 20 min when the free drug was administered, prednisolone concentrations were still quantifiable after 40 min following delivery of the conjugates.

30|$|NOS- 2 inhibitors {{are highly}} efficacious in the {{development}} of phosgene-induced ALI, especially when <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> the <b>inhalation</b> route [96, 97]. Data from rats (Fig.  6) demonstrated that this non-invasive and readily available biomarker has the potential to deliver important prognostic information that could guide clinicians on countermeasures following accidental exposures to phosgene and other irritants [42, 43, 46, 47]. NO is considered an important mediator of acute lung injury (ALI) and is endogenously produced by NO synthase 2 (NOS- 2), an enzyme upregulated in both ARDS patients and animal ALI models [98 – 100]. Recent studies have demonstrated that NOS- 2 is induced in rat lungs exposed to phosgene [96, 101]. Hence, contemporaneous measurements of NO were thought to be an invaluable adjunct to exhaled CO 2, as they may enable an integrated appreciation of the localized modulation of vascular tonus by NO suggestive of perfusion: ventilation imbalances.|$|R

However, no studies have yet addressed their toxicology and safety pharmacology profiles in detail. Here we describe a detailed toxicological analysis of inhaled hgd 40, a GATA- 3 -specific DNAzyme designed for the treatment of allergic bronchial asthma. Subacute toxicity, immunotoxicity, and respiratory, cardiovascular, and CNS safety pharmacology were analyzed in rodents and non-rodents, and genotoxicity was assessed in human peripheral blood.

40|$|To {{circumvent}} inherent {{problems associated}} with pulmonary administration of aqueous-solution and dry-powder protein drugs, inhalation delivery of proteins from their suspensions in absolute ethanol was explored both in vitro and in vivo. Protein suspensions in ethanol of up to 9 % (wt/vol) were readily aerosolized with a commercial compressor nebulizer. Experiments with enzymic proteins revealed that nebulization caused no detectable loss of catalytic activity; furthermore, enzyme suspensions in anhydrous ethanol retained their full catalytic activity for at least 3 weeks at room temperature. With the use of Zn 2 +-insulin, conditions were elaborated that produced submicron protein particles in ethanol suspensions. The latter (insulin/EtOH) afforded respirable-size aerosol particles after nebulization. A 40 -min exposure of laboratory rats to 10 mg/ml insulin/EtOH aerosols resulted in a 2 -fold drop in the blood glucose level and a marked rise in the serum insulin level. The bioavailability based on estimated deposited lung dose of insulin <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> of ethanol suspension aerosols was 33 % (relative to an equivalent s. c. injection), i. e., comparable to those observed in rats after inhalation administration of dry powder and aqueous solutions of insulin.

Moreover, HA colloidal solutions were designed and they were spray-dried. In order to improve particle aerodynamic characteristics, different types of excipients were investigated. In particular, stearylamine (5 % w/w) allowed to obtain the best performance throughout the experimental set. Finally, in vitro biocompatibility was carried out by MTT assay and High Content Analysis for selected dry powder formulations and starting materials.

30|$|Details of the head-only chamber {{used for}} dog {{inhalation}} {{studies have been}} published elsewhere [17, 20]. This mode of exposure to phosgene differed from those of other authors using larger animals. For reference, the reader is advised to consult more detailed reviews and papers on larger animals used for studies with phosgene [9, 21, 22, 24, 53]. Larger inhalation chambers {{may be useful to}} accommodate larger animals or larger numbers of small animals. For technical reasons and the difficulty of generating homogeneous exposure atmospheres at short exposure durations, a more human-like exposure mode and regimen may jeopardize the outcome of the study due to technical shortcomings. Especially for pharmaceutical countermeasures <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> the <b>inhalation</b> route, particular attention must be paid to maintaining similarities of the dosing regimen used in the bioassay with that used in humans. Otherwise, meaningful interspecies extrapolations and dosimetric adjustments are hampered. The endotracheal administration of phosgene and inhalation drugs may overcome some of these difficulties; however, due to the numerous manipulations required, this may cause additional uncertainties concerning the inhaled dose. Compared to small animals, dogs and pigs offer the advantage that these species have also been used in pre-clinical studies of inhalation pharmaceuticals. Their breathing physiology is closer to that of humans than that of rodents. The size and anatomy of their lungs, including the large tracheobronchial tree and vascular architecture, make it possible to use the same equipment as used in intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, when making judgements as {{to the extent to which}} a small or large animal model delivers the most significant information for human risk assessment, numerous methodological and species-specific factors must be considered. These factors include that the exposure and treatment of larger animals using endotracheal tubes and terminal anesthesia may not only complicate translation dosimetry but may also affect reflex-mediated responses to exposure and injury.|$|R

For example, ephidrine for nasal decongestion, beta- 2 agonists for bronchodilatation, and inhaled steroids to suppress the inflammation seen in asthmatic airways. Since the drug is delivered directly to its required site, only a small quantity is needed for an adequate therapeutic response, and consequently there is a low incidence of systemic side effects compared with oral or intravenous administration. More recently, it has become apparent that {{the lining of the}} respiratory tract, from nasal mucosa to airways and alveoli, may be used for the absorption of a drug for its systemic effect.

Protein and carbonyl group content, lipid peroxidation, reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cooper/zinc and manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase were determined. Results of myeloperoxidase activity and glutathione disulfide lung concentrations showed a relevant decrease for chitosan group compared to control: 4. 67 +/- 2. 27 versus 15. 10 +/- 7. 27 (P = 0. 011) for MPO and 0. 89 +/- 0. 68 versus 2. 02 +/- 0. 22 (P = 0. 014) for GSSG. The other parameters did not vary significantly among groups. Lactose and chitosan administered by inhalation failed to show toxic effects to the pulmonary tissue. A protective effect against oxidative stress might even be attributed to chitosan, since some biomarkers had values significantly lower than those observed in the control group when this product was inhaled.

The assessment of drug formulations delivered by the pressurised metered dose inhaler and used {{in the treatment of}} Asthma are assessed commercially using cascade impactors which are the preferred instruments for the assessment of particle size and respirable mass or fraction <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> devices. The fundamental principle underpinning the design of cascade impactors is particle motion defined by Stokes theory. The analysis of impactor data raises a number of functional issues as calibration curves have long tails, which are not easily explained by a simplistic application of Stokes law. The atomisation process, propellant flashing, evaporation and aerodynamic properties of the residual drug particle detennine the distribution of the drug particles within the lung and resultant therapeutic effect.

The fundamental principle underpinning the design of cascade impactors is particle motion defined by Stokes theory. The analysis of impactor data raises a number of functional issues as calibration curves have long tails, which are not easily explained by a simplistic application of Stokes law. The atomisation process, propellant flashing, evaporation and aerodynamic properties of the residual drug particle detennine the distribution of the drug particles within the lung and resultant therapeutic effect.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{determined}} {{the effects of}} inhaled nitric oxide (NO) on load-independent indexes of normal human left ventricular (LV) function. Background. Inhaled NO is a potent and selective pulmonary vasodilator. However, when it is used in patients with congestive heart failure, the decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) {{is often associated with}} an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. NO has been shown to have a negative inotropic action, but it is not known whether it affects LV chamber function when <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation.</b> Methods. Eleven subjects (51 to 69 years old) with normal LV function (mean ejection fraction 72 % [range 60 % to 80 %]) were studied. Four patients had concomitant coronary artery disease. Pressure-volume loop recordings were used to determine end-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume and preload recruitable stroke work relations. NO was delivered at 20 ppm for 10 min. In an additional group of patients with normal LV function, PVR (n = 5) and NO metabolites (n = 9) were measured. Results. There was no effect of inhaled NO on steady state LV pressures, volumes, contractility, contraction duration, active relaxation (time constant of relaxation, peak negative first derivative of left ventricular pressure), diastolic compliance or PVR. NO metabolites (methemoglobin and nitrate) were present in the LV cavity at the same concentration as right atrial venous blood, suggesting inactivation of free NO before arrival in the LV chamber. This study had a power of 0. 995 to detect a 5 % change in contractility (slope of preload recruitable stroke work relation) for alpha = 0. 05, based on the multiple linear regression model used. Conclusions. These results indicate that 20 ppm of inhaled NO does not have significant effects on normal LV function. This lack of effect may be due in part to rapid inactivation of free NO in transit to the heart. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 30 : 49 – 56...|$|E

Initially an intravenous rescue treatment for pulmonary exacerbations, tobramycin <b>delivered</b> <b>by</b> <b>inhalation</b> has become a mainstay of chronic suppressive CF infection management. Platforms for tobramycin aerosol delivery have steadily improved, with increased lung deposition complimented by decreased device complexities, loaded tobramycin doses, delivery times, and treatment burdens. Most recently, a unique tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) formulation with a portable delivery system, the TOBI&reg; Podhaler&reg; (Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland) has been developed and approved in Europe, Canada, and Chile. Four capsules, each containing 28 mg of TIP are successively pierced and inhaled via the T- 326 Dry Powder Inhaler Device (Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland). No external power source is required to deliver an efficacious tobramycin dose in minutes. By comparison, tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) (TOBI&reg;; Novartis), is delivered by LC&reg; Plus (PARI Respiratory Equipment Inc, Midlothian, VA) jet nebulizer powered by an air compressor over 15 &ndash; 20 minutes. Comparative pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy studies of TIS and TIP in CF subjects with P. aeruginosa &ge; 6 years old demonstrate that: tobramycin lung deposition with 112 mg TIP is comparable to that attained with 300 mg TIS, TIP is more effective than placebo and not inferior to TIS with respect to pulmonary function benefit, and TIP has significantly faster treatment times and achieves higher patient satisfaction than TIS. TIP is associated with an increased frequency of mild to moderate local adverse events (cough, dysphonia, and dysgeusia) compared with TIS, however, these become less frequent as subjects gain TIP experience. These results suggest that the TOBI Podhaler may better meet the needs of many CF patients and families by reducing treatment time and complexity and improving patient satisfaction compared with TIS.
