5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as likely {{in the face of}} evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is logically possible.|$|E

500|$|When [...] "talkies" [...] {{began to}} gain {{momentum}} in the film industry, the Hollywood studios recruited the best talent from Broadway to make musical films. These films included Broadway Melody, which was promoted as the first [...] "all singing, all talking, all dancing" [...] film and had music by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, and Berkley's 42nd Street, his first major success. These films established the backstage musical, a subgenre in which the plot revolves around a stage show and {{the people involved in}} putting on the show. These first musicals set the standard for the genre, placing their musical numbers either {{within the context of a}} stage performance or tacked on and gratuitous, without furthering the story or developing the characters. Donen stated that he disliked them and that his own films were [...] "a reaction against those backstage musicals." [...] Donen credits producer Freed as the driving force behind the transition, adding that Freed [...] "had some sort of instinct to change the musical from a backstage world into something else. He didn't quite know what to change it into, <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had to change." [...] Kelly stated that Donen was the only person he knew that understood how musicals could progress and better suit the film medium.|$|E

In general, however, Dawkins has followed {{the advice of his}} late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because [...] "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would [...] "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public." [...] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that [...] "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." [...] When Moyers questioned him {{on the use of the}} word theory, Dawkins stated that [...] "evolution has been observed.

500|$|Jonathan O'Brien {{recommended}} {{the book in}} a review in The Sunday Business Post, but noted it focuses more on his life than an analysis of his music: [...] "If you want a meticulously researched, mind-bogglingly detailed account of his early years growing up in Belfast, his schooldays in Orangefield, his time as an unpopular member of the Olympics showband and so on, then, once again, No Surrender is heartily recommended. If, however, you're expecting a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of Morrison's music, of its textures, its surfaces – how and why it sounds {{the way it does}} – then you've probably come to the wrong place." [...] O'Brien concluded his review by writing: [...] "For all its flaws, No Surrender is a strong, absorbing biography, and never less than well written. It's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could potentially have been far, far better." [...] John Beck of The Press Democrat observed that the biography [...] "paints him [...] as a mercurial genius at best and a cantankerous lout on a bad day". In their 2008 book Northern Ireland After the Troubles, Colin Coulter and Michael Murray referenced the biography and stated it puts forth [...] "the view that Morrison's persona has been shaped by a specifically Ulster Protestant sensibility". Bernard Perusse of The Gazette described the earlier biography Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now as [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than Rogan's book.|$|E
500|$|Yet another {{interpretation}} is that Dylan is directing the farewell to himself, particularly his acoustic performer self. The opening line [...] "You must leave now" [...] {{can be a}} command, similar to the line [...] "Go away from my window" [...] that opens [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe". But {{it can also be}} an imperative, meaning <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is necessary that you leave. And the song is as much about new beginnings as it is about endings. The song not only notes the requirement that Baby Blue leave, but also includes the hope that Baby Blue will move forward, in lines such as [...] "Strike another match, go start anew". If Dylan is singing the song to himself, then he himself would be the [...] "vagabond who's rapping at your door / standing in the clothes that you once wore". That is, the new, electric, surrealist Dylan would be the vagabond, not yet having removed the [...] "clothes" [...] of the old protest singer. Alternatively, the vagabond and [...] "stepping stones" [...] referenced in the song have been interpreted as Dylan's folk audience whom he needs to leave behind. He would also be telling himself to [...] "Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you." [...] Others to whom he may be saying farewell in the song are any of the women he had known, the political left or to the illusions of his youth.|$|E

[...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?'

Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review, though Noah Robischon from the same magazine complimented the title track, saying that Madonna had [...] "pushed synergy over the borderline." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com said that the songs were not among Madonna's best music. Taraborrelli commented that [...] "the soundtrack was once again the reminder of Madonna's power and status {{as one of the}} most important singers of the 80s, because it was only her songs which gained prominence, albeit not being her best, though 'The Look of Love' is an exotic ballad." [...] Author Mary Cross, in her biography Madonna: A Biography said that [...] "the soundtrack slips up because of the film."

[...] He added that [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was a hidden gem in Madonna's catalogue.

2500|$|Sunderland’s {{relations}} with Paul Barillon, whose long tenure as Ambassador from Louis XIV (from 1677 to 1688) produced many memorable exchanges between the twain, were tenuous and strained. When Louis failed to give James any assistance against the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Sunderland told Barillon sharply [...] "the King your master may have plans I cannot discern, but I hope he will put things right {{by making it}} clear that this has all been a misunderstanding". When Barillon protested that his master's aim was [...] "the Peace of Europe" [...] Sunderland said that it was impossible for everyone in Europe to want peace at the same time: [...] "myself I think it will last until {{one side or the other}} has a good reason for breaking it". To prevent Barillon from gaining too much influence, Sunderland intercepted and leaked an unusually indiscreet dispatch where the Ambassador boasted of having blocked an Anglo-Dutch treaty. Charles II was predictably furious, and Barillon was for a time forbidden the Court. [...] Sunderland remarked that if Barillon would behave himself so, it was “but <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> come home to him".|$|E

[...] When Emperor Taizong asked Li Jing about this, Li Jing responded, [...] "This is proof that Hou Junji will commit treason. [...] China is secure right now, and the empire is united. [...] What I taught him is sufficient to use against barbarians. [...] If not for treasonous purposes, why would Hou want to learn all of the strategies?" [...] At one point, Li Daozong also spoke to Emperor Taizong, stating, [...] "Hou Junji has too much ambition and too little talent.

2500|$|In 1986 Richie Hayward, Paul Barrere and Bill Payne {{were invited}} to play on Blue Slipper, the 1987 debut album by Helen Watson. They {{subsequently}} appeared on her second album The Weather Inside. The surviving former members of Little Feat then reformed in 1987 when Barrere, Clayton, Gradney, Hayward and Payne added songwriter/vocalist/guitarist Craig Fuller, formerly from the band Pure Prairie League, and Fred Tackett on guitar, mandolin and trumpet. The band admired Fuller's previous work and were impressed when he toured with them in 1978 {{as part of the}} Fuller/Kaz band. They didn't require an audition, having played with him on tour, and thus, the new Little Feat lineup was formed. The initial release by the new lineup, Let It Roll, was a tremendous success and Fuller's presence proved to be a major factor. His strong vocals and songwriting abilities were showcased, co-writing 8 of the 10 songs and handling a large share of lead vocals. The first single, [...] "Hate to Lose Your Lovin'", earned the band their first No.1 hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. All Music Guide critic Stephen Erlewine stated [...] " [...] What's surprising about Let It Roll is not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> works, but that it works smashingly." [...] The LP garnered Feat a certified gold record status on February 14, 1989. On the heels of this success, previous Feat releases experienced a sudden surge in sales. The February 10, 1978 live release Waiting for Columbus went certified platinum on November 8, 1989. Dixie Chicken, originally released on January 25, 1973, went certified gold also on November 8, 1989. The band received more exposure than ever, including an appearance on Saturday Night Live. [...] Concerts were booked nationally and Little Feat played enthusiastic, sold-out shows. [...] Barrere, Payne and company were pleased by the audience reaction; not only were they able to put over the Feat classics, but the new music proved to be artistically and commercially successful. While some Little Feat diehards initially had difficulty accepting the band without Lowell George, the success of Little Feat with Fuller could not be disputed. The band made a comeback that introduced a whole new generation to Little Feat and reignited their past, even though their original creative genius (George) was no longer around.|$|E
