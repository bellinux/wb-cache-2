The song was originally recorded on the Tour Bus in Europe in 2010, {{and was later}} remixed at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California by Trevor Muzzy. Gaga said that the song was inspired {{after a night of}} partying at the Laboratory nightclub in Berlin, Germany. The next day, she wrote [...] "Schei√üe", stating that she [...] "meant [...] like 'shit, it's good.' But I also meant it the other way; because this song is really about wanting to be a strong female without all the bullshit that comes along with. Anything that gets <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> from being brave. It's not the only word I know, I just like that word. It's sexy." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Soviet Union shot down KAL007, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, {{operating}} the commercial airports around New York City, denied Soviet aircraft landing rights, {{in violation of}} the United Nations Charter that required the host nation to allow all member countries access to the UN. In reaction, TASS and some at the UN raised {{the question of whether the}} UN should move its headquarters from the United States. Charles Lichenstein, acting U.S. permanent representative to the UN under Ambassador Kirkpatrick, responded, [...] "We will put no impediment <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>way.</b> The members of the U.S. mission to the United Nations will be down at the dockside waving you a fond farewell as you sail off into the sunset." [...] Administration officials were quick to announce that Lichenstein was speaking only for himself.|$|E

2500|$|General Martin and Governor Patrick Henry kept {{a long-running}} {{correspondence}} through the years, {{some of which}} concerned real estate speculation. Other letters recounted Martin's dealings with the Indian tribes, as well as settlement efforts in Tennessee. As late as 1790, Patrick Henry wrote Joseph Martin concerning a real estate investment, holding out that the hope, Henry noted, that Martin might finally capitalize on his long service to Virginia. [...] "After all the Hazards you have run," [...] Henry wrote, [...] "that you have not acquired so much property as many others would have done in your situation, I was desirous to throw something <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> by which some fine lands would have been offered to you in our purchase." ...|$|E
