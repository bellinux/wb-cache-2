40|$|Operational {{efficiency}} of multi-functional road construction machines depends on number of working bodies which are simultaneously performing technological operations. Systems for propulsion pto to the running equipment drive and active working bodies of road construction machines are developing {{in the way}} of using three-axis hydraulic drives. When designing a hydraulic system for road construction machinery dividing of power flow from propulsion to the running equipment drive and active working bodies is considered as rather essential problem. Leading companies do not pay attention to the development of flow divider designs, preferring to produce more expensive multi-flow pumps. One of the ways to increase {{efficiency of}} multi-functional road construction machinery is an implementation of running equipment hydraulic driving system based on a mono-aggregate pump unit which consists of a pump and a volumetric divider of power fluid flow. A principle of volumetric division and summing-up of power fluid flows, technical realization and methodology for calculation of key parameters of discrete flow distributors has been developed on the basis of discrete hydraulics regulations. The paper presents results of mathematical modeling of hydraulic systems equipped with the discrete flow distributor. Analysis of a dual-motor hydraulic drive operation has shown the following results: a discrete flow distributor ensures independent load mode of the current consumer circuit operation from the load mode of the second consumer circuit within a wide range of loads; rational value of working fluid flow discretization parameter is the following value interval  k  = 4 – 6, maximum value of parameter efficiency is reached when an angular velocity of a distributor rotor coincides with the angular velocity of a pump shaft; discrete flow distributor provides a possibility to change parameters of hydraulic flow feeding in consumers’ pressure lines within a wide range due to changes in geometrical parameters of the design; discrete flow distributor should be installed either close to the pump or be integrated into its design. The developed mathematical model and methodology for determination of parameters for the discrete flow distributor allow to optimize its design. Application of the mono-aggregate pump unit which consists of a pump and a discrete flow distributor of running equipment drive in multi-functional road construction machinery permits to decrease a number of hydraulic drive pumps, to withdraw from large-sized and material-intensive pump <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Central {{differential}} is a {{geared mechanism}} located {{between the two}} driving axles thereby providing torque developed by engine in required ratio to both the axle. In ordinary four wheel drive vehicle, there are two differentials one in rear axle and other in front axle along with a transfer <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> in between, which converts it to four wheel drive. A four wheel drive vehicle without a central differential cannot be driven on dry, paved roads in four-wheel drive mode, as small differences in rotational speed between {{the front and rear}} wheels produces extra torque to be applied across the transmission. This phenomenon is known as "wind-up", and can cause considerable damage to the transmission or drive train.

40|$|The <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{represents}} an important mechanical sub system. In machine tools, the propose of a <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{is to provide}} a series of useful output speeds so that the machining operation can be carried out at its most optimum operating conditions high spindle speeds with low feed rate for roughing operations. An important aspect in the design of machine tool transmission is to keep the cost and volume of the <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> to a minimum. The probabilistic approach to design has been considered to be more rational compared to the conventional design approach based on the factor of safety. The existence of uncertainties in either engineering simulations or manufacturing processes calls for a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) model for robust and cost-effective designs. In the present work a three shaft four speed <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> is designed using reliability principles.

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about {{the control of}} {{magnetic}} gears. A decade ago (2001) the first modern prototype magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> was constructed using rare earth magnets (NdFeB). Magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have some desirable properties not found in their mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> counterparts, these include: contact-less torque transmission, lubrication-free, reduced noise and vibration, and non-destructive torque overload capability. Hitherto, no detailed investigation or analysis has been conducted {{on the effects of}} using a magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> in place of a mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> As will be demonstrated in this thesis, magnetic gears possess a number of undesirable properties which must be given due consideration when designing speed and position controllers. In particular, unlike mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>boxes,</b> magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have extremely low torsional rigidity. Furthermore, the torque transfer characteristic is fundamentally nonlinear and magnetic <b>gear</b> <b>boxes</b> have the potential to ‘slip’. On the one hand, ‘slipping’ is a great benefit as a non-destructive ‘torque fuse’; but on the other, this represents a consequential loss of control. This thesis examines the control issues that arise {{through the use of a}} specially constructed magnetic coupling integrated into an experimental test rig. The development of a linearized mathematical model of the experimental magnetic coupling is used to derive optimized classical controllers for speed and position, demonstrating outstanding theoretical and experimental results. To compensate for the possibility of ‘slip’, a methodology is presented for the detection and recovery from what is defined as ‘pole-slip’ in a magnetic coupling. To avert ‘pole-slip’, a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is developed that prevents over-torque pole-slipping. Feedback linearization is considered for a nonlinear model of the magnetic coupling and nonlinear control laws and state transformations are derived to produce perfect linearization, for both speed and position control, over the entire operating range of the experimental magnetic coupling...|$|R

The project includes two independent proposals. One proposal was made by Airbus Helicopter, which {{will be discussed in}} further detail in this paper, and the other one by DLR FT (Institut für Flugsystemtechnik), dealing with effectiveness of higher harmonic control and individual blade control for five bladed rotors. To push the approach with respect to scaling within the rotorcraft design domain several subtopics are addressed for main rotors within the LuFo V- 1 project SKAT. The first large topic is dedicated to the enhancement of methodologies to predict scaling effects in pre-design. This task comprises the investigation on aerodynamics phenomena for scaling, an improved rotor pre-design process and the definition of design spaces of dynamics parameters for pre-design phase. The second area, which is addressed, is methods for innovative rotor design, including main rotor scalability investigations with respect to aerodynamics, aero-acoustics, performance and limitloads as weil as transition investigations, scaling laws for aeroelastics models and the establishment of an improved blade design process. The third part of the project deals with similarity of interfaces {{of the main}} rotor. The influence of the overall system on scaling of fatigue loads and existing load spectra was investigated.
