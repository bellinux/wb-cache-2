5|$|Several Gemini Ferry {{spacecraft}} were {{proposed to}} provide transportation of crews and cargo to NASA and USAF space stations in low Earth orbit. NASA contracted McDonnell {{to conduct a}} study into what modifications {{would be needed to}} allow the Gemini spacecraft to support this. Three spacecraft were envisioned; a manned spacecraft to transport crew to the stations, a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply the station <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> months.|$|E
25|$|The outer atolls can {{be visited}} {{on the two}} passenger-cargo ships, Nivaga III and Manú Folau, which provide round-trip visits to the outer islands <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> weeks. There is guesthouse {{accommodation}} {{on many of the}} outer islands.|$|E

50|$|Municipal {{elections}} {{are held in}} Canada for the election of local governments. Most provinces hold all of their municipal elections on the same date. Candidates are elected through either ward or at-large systems, <b>every</b> two, <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years, depending on the province. A minority of locations in Canada have local political parties or election slates, while most locations elect only independents.|$|R
25|$|Cincinnati hosts {{a number}} of large annual events. Oktoberfest Zinzinnati, Bockfest, and the Taste of Cincinnati that feature local restaurateurs. Music-related events include the Cincinnati May Festival, Bunbury Music Festival, and Cincinnati Bell/WEBN Riverfest. The Flying Pig Marathon is an annual event {{attracting}} many serious and amateur runners. Tall Stacks, held <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years, celebrates the city's riverboat heritage.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{reconcile}} the warring factions and families, a complex electoral system was developed as mechanism for sharing power. Incumbent officers and appointees carried out a secret ballot <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years. They committed {{the names of all}} those elected into a series of bags, one for each sesto, or sixth, of the city. One name was drawn from each bag every two months to form the highest executive of the city, the Signoria. The selection scheme was controlled to ensure that no two members of the same family ended up in the same batch of six names.|$|E
5000|$|The newness of the Hibernia {{specialty}} beers allowed Healy {{to penetrate}} markets and retail outlets that previously had been unavailable to the brewery, drawing interest from distributors in the Twin Cities, Chicago, and St. Louis, among other locations. Draft accounts were particularly receptive to Healy’s sales pitch that {{by taking on}} the Hibernia seasonal beer line, {{they would have a}} different Hibernia beer on tap <b>every</b> <b>three</b> months, <b>or</b> <b>four</b> distinct beers each year—without adding new tap lines—and a corresponding increase in sales that each prompted from both new and returning customers.|$|R
50|$|In many {{civilian}} {{law enforcement}} agencies in the United States, officers and sheriff's deputies will be awarded service stripes for wear on their long sleeved uniforms, usually on the lower left sleeve. One stripe may be worn for <b>every</b> <b>three,</b> <b>four,</b> <b>or</b> five years of service and differs from agency to agency.|$|R
50|$|Government leaders {{felt the}} {{potential}} for a draft was a critical element in maintaining a constant flow of volunteers. On numerous occasions Gen. Hershey told Congress for <b>every</b> man drafted, <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> more were scared into volunteering. Assuming his assessment was accurate, this would mean over 11 million men volunteered for service because of the draft between January 1954 and April 1975.|$|R
25|$|Association Day is {{analogous}} to UCC's homecoming. Held since 1979, A-Day, as it is informally known, constitutes the school's largest annual event, taking place over the last weekend of September and culminating on the Saturday with a large festival, including competitive matches for all fall sports teams and the Association Dinner for Old Boys celebrating their five-year incremental class reunions. Later in the academic year is the Founder's Dinner, a formal event that has been held {{for more than a}} century. It typically takes place on the Thursday night before the third weekend in January, which is made a special long weekend for students as a commemoration of Sir John Colborne's birthday. Another regular event is the UCC Gala, a black tie dinner and silent auction organized <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years in May.|$|E
25|$|Funafuti is {{the only}} port {{but there is a}} deep-water berth in the lagoon at Nukufetau. The {{merchant}} marine fleet consists of two passenger/cargo ships Nivaga III and Manu Folau. The Nivaga III and Manu Folau provide round trip visits to the outer islands <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> weeks and travel between Suva, Fiji and Funafuti 3 to 4 times a year. The Manu Folau is a 50-metre vessel that was a gift from Japan to the people of Tuvalu. In 2015 the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) assisted the government of Tuvalu to acquire MV Talamoana, a 30-metre vessel that will be used to implement Tuvalu's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) to transport government officials and project personnel to the outer islands. In 2015 the Nivaga III was donated by the government of Japan; it replaced the Nivaga II, which had serviced Tuvalu from 1989.|$|E
25|$|From then on, {{whenever}} she ran short of money (which generally happened <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years), {{she went on}} tour, performing both her classics and new plays. In 1888, she toured Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. She returned to Paris in early 1889 with an enormous owl given to her by the Grand Duke Alexis Alexandrovich, {{the brother of the}} Czar. Her 1891–92 tour was her most extensive, including much of Europe, Russia, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Samoa. Her personal luggage consisted of 45 costume crates for her 15 different productions, and 75 crates for her off-stage clothing, including her 250 pairs of shoes. She carried a trunk for her perfumes, cosmetics and makeup, and another for her sheets and tablecloths and her five pillows. After the tour, she brought back a trunk filled with 3,500,000 francs, but she also suffered a painful injury to her knee when she leaped off the parapet of the Castello Sant' Angelo in La Tosca. The mattress on which she was supposed to land was misplaced, and she landed on the boards.|$|E
50|$|On 16 June 1972, Suribachi {{negotiated}} the locks of the Panama Canal {{and joined the}} Pacific Fleet. Ten days later, she arrived in Pearl Harbor. After an overnight stop, she continued on to the operating area {{off the coast of}} South Vietnam. From mid-July 1972 until 8 February 1973, Suribachi rearmed and refueled the combat units of the 7th Fleet. She departed from the combat zone fairly frequently for port period at Subic Bay in the Philippines and for a visit each to Hong Kong and Sattahip, Thailand. Her periods away from the action zone were brief in <b>every</b> instance, <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> days at most.|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} investigated whether adding metric (higher-order, periodic) {{structure to}} tone sequences stabilizes syncopated finger tapping. Participants tapped in antiphase with metronomic tone sequences in which accents—produced by sounding two tones simultaneously—occurred regularly <b>every</b> two, <b>three,</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> tones (metric), occurred unpredictably (irregular), occurred on every tone (heavy beat), or were absent (light beat). Tap timing variability, although commensurate with metric and light beat sequences, was lower with metric than with heavy beat and irregular sequences {{even when the}} instructions specified using metric grouping in all conditions. Higher-order periodic fluctuations (delays) in tap timing—found only in metric conditions—were associated with low overall tap timing variability, suggesting that a regularly applied, meter-based phase-resetting mechanism stabilizes syncopation...|$|R
25|$|The {{county is}} governed by the Wake County Board of Commissioners, a seven-member board of County Commissioners, elected at large to serve {{four-year}} terms. Terms are staggered so that, <b>every</b> two years, <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> Commissioners are up for election. The commissioners enact policies such as establishment of the property tax rate, regulation of land use and zoning outside municipal jurisdictions, and adoption of the annual budget. Commissioners meet on {{the first and third}} Mondays of each month.|$|R
500|$|During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with {{a number}} of {{industry}} groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies. [...] She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations. [...] Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator {{in the history of the}} agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency – and in the type of position that often sees turnover <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years. [...] Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as [...] "one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA," [...] and wrote that she was [...] "completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues." [...] Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.|$|E
500|$|On the {{subsequent}} Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen generally interspersed hard-rocking song sequences after <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> numbers {{in order to}} give Weinberg's hands a chance to recover. Weinberg's wife Becky unintentionally triggered one of the tour's most celebrated episodes. She was a fan of the This Week with David Brinkley television program and invited panelist George Will to the Washington-area Capital Centre show. After seeing the band perform, Will became convinced that they were exemplars of hard-working patriotism and traditional American values; he wrote, [...] "... consider Max Weinberg's bandaged fingers. [...] The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on." [...] Will further decided that Springsteen might endorse Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign and talked to the campaign, which later led to Reagan's famous extolling of Springsteen at a stop in Hammonton, New Jersey and Springsteen's subsequent negative response.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "solar corrections" [...] {{approximately}} {{undo the}} effect of the Gregorian modifications to the leap days of the solar calendar on the lunar calendar: they (partially) bring the epact cycle back to the original Metonic relation between the Julian year and lunar month. The inherent mismatch between sun and moon in this basic 19-year cycle is then corrected <b>every</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> centuries by the [...] "lunar correction" [...] to the epacts. However, the epact corrections occur at the beginning of Gregorian centuries, not Julian centuries, and therefore the original Julian Metonic cycle is not fully restored.|$|E

40|$|UNION {{elections}} {{are the main}} nerve centers of union democracy, for {{it is through the}} officers that the will of the members is translated into effective action. The basic governing body of the international union is the convention, itself a delegate body of elected representatives. It meets only briefly <b>every</b> two, <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> years; can at best decide only immediate issues or map broad policies; and must in turn place major governing responsibility in the international officers. Local unions must also rely heavily on representative government- 2 ̆ 2 town meeting 2 ̆ 2 democracy has limited usefulness. Many contain hundreds or even thousands of members, often scattered over a wide geographical area; meetings are infrequent and fragmentary; and the day by day decisions which fill out the body of union policy must be made by the officers...|$|R

25|$|Promotion {{from one}} geup {{to the next}} can proceed rapidly in some schools, since schools often allow geup {{promotions}} <b>every</b> two, <b>three,</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> months. Students of geup rank learn the most basic techniques first, {{and then move on}} to more advanced techniques as they approach first dan. Many of the older and more traditional schools often take longer to allow students to test for higher ranks than newer, more contemporary schools, as they may not have the required testing intervals. In contrast, promotion from one dan to the next can take years. In fact, some styles impose age or time-in-rank limits on dan promotions. For example, the number of years between one dan promotion to the next may be limited to a minimum of the practitioner's current dan-rank, so that (for example) a 5th dan practitioner must wait 5 years to test for 6th dan.|$|R
