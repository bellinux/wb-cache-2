40|$|Modern {{automotive}} radar operates at the mm-wave frequency band {{and has to}} provide reliable sensing information about surrounding targets in all weather conditions. The aesthetic requirements for the modern car design and needs for mechanical protections result in the installation of radar sensor behind different types of plastic cover like the bumper for the forward-looking radar. The influence of radar signal propagation through such dielectric layer, which {{is a kind of}} radar radome, usually is taken into account by radar developers and car manufacturers. But during bad weather conditions like rain, this dielectric radome is becoming wet or even covered with a thin layer of water, ice or dirt and the radar signal propagates through the multilayer structure with transmission and reflection characteristics that can be quite different from the single <b>dry</b> <b>radome</b> case. Thus this project is basically focused on water film effects on the wave propagation on the radome and three models, namely a theoretical model fundamentally based on the plane wave propagation on the stratified media, an experimental model based on real measurements and a numerical model based on CST simulation are derived to investigate these effects. In addition, considering the importance of the antenna beam pattern for proper estimation of object angular position, water film effects on the beam distortions are discussed as well. The radar observation of road signs and other components of road/highway infrastructure can be quite useful sources of information for cars local real-time navigation on the road. To make such observation reliable, the road signs are required to have reasonably big radar cross section {{in a wide range of}} observation angles. As the operational wavelength for {{automotive radar}} is quite short (about 4 mm), the backscattered signals from road signs can strongly depend on characteristics of the thin layer of the paint on the surface of the objects. Based on these facts, some radar detectable paint samples with special discrete inclusions inside are experimentally studied and the statistical roughness of the surface for each sample is estimated. Such information can be quite useful for the future road or road infrastructure design, aiming to improve objects' detectability with the automotive radar.
