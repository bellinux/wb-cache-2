2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer surface filtration. In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite. [...] In surface filtration, the wine passes through a thin membrane. Running the wine parallel to the filter surface, known as cross-flow filtration, will minimize the <b>filter</b> <b>clogging.</b> The finest surface filtration, microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|E
40|$|Filtration is a {{critical}} process in many industrial systems to obtain the desired level of purification for liquids or gas. Air, fuel, and oil filters {{are the most common}} examples in industrial systems. <b>Filter</b> <b>clogging</b> is the main failure mode leading to filter replacement or undesired outcomes such as reduced performance and efficiency or cascading failures. For example, contaminants in fuel (e. g. rust particles, paint chips, dirt involved into fuel while tank is filling, tank moisture rust) may lead to performance reduction in the engine and rapid wear in the pump. Prognostics has potential to avoid cost and increase safety when applied to filters. One of the main challenges of prognostics is the lack of failure degradation data obtained from industrial systems. This paper presents the process of design and building of an experimental rig to obtain prognostics data for <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> mechanism and data obtained from the rig. Two types of filters have been used during the accelerated <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> and 23 run-to-failure data have been collected.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} and model efficiency during the filtration of a liquid aerosol through a fibrous filter.

The results also reveal that during <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> there is a decrease in the medium's performance for particles smaller than 100 nm and an increase in efficiency for particles with a diameter greater than 200 nm. Both effects are induced by the amount of liquid collected in the medium. Finally, a model is proposed to describe filter efficiency during clogging with a liquid aerosol...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn today's {{maintenance}} planning, {{fuel filters}} are replaced or cleaned {{on a regular}} basis. Monitoring and implementation of prognostics on filtration system {{have the potential to}} avoid costs and increase safety. Prognostics is a fundamental technology within Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM). Prognostic models can be categorised into three major categories: 1) Physics-based models 2) Data-driven models 3) Experience-based models. One of the challenges in the progression of the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure is the inability to observe the natural <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure due to time constraint. This paper presents a simple solution to collect data for a <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure. Also, it represents a simple state-based prognostic with duration information (SSPD) method that aims to detect and forecast <b>clogging</b> of <b>filter</b> in a laboratory based fuel rig system. The progression of the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> failure is created unnaturally. The degradation level is divided into several groups. Each group is defined as a state in the failure progression of <b>clogging</b> <b>filter.</b> Then, the data is collected to create the <b>clogging</b> <b>filter</b> progression states unnaturally. The SSPD method consists of three steps: clustering, clustering evaluation, and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel wireless vibration-based method for monitoring {{the degree of}} feed <b>filter</b> <b>clogging.</b> In process industry, these filters are applied to prevent impurities entering the process. During operation, the filters gradually become clogged, decreasing the feed flow and, in the worst case, preventing it. The cleaning of the filter should therefore be carried out predictively {{in order to avoid}} equipment damage and unnecessary process downtime. The degree of clogging is estimated by first calculating the time domain indices from low frequency accelerometer samples and then taking the median of the processed values. Nine different statistical quantities are compared based on the estimation accuracy and criteria for operating in resource-constrained environments with particular focus on energy efficiency. The initial results show that the method is able to detect the degree of clogging, and the approach may be applicable to <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> monitoring. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{modelling}} of {{the variation}} in the pressure drop across a HEPA filter during cake filtration in the presence of humidity was studied. A semi-empirical model was developed that considers the pressure drop across the <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> as the sum of the pressure drops across the clean filter and across the cake, which is itself decomposed into several successive layers. The pressure drop across each layer of particles depends on its state of equilibrium with the air humidity. The model includes the specific resistance of each layer of particles and its variation when the cake is exposed to a flow of moist air. This model applies for relative humidity below the deliquescent point of the aerosol if it is hygroscopic. The results show good agreement between the calculated values and experimental values for flat <b>filters</b> <b>clogged</b> with aluminium oxide and sodium chloride test aerosols. The model also revealed the influence of filtration time on the evolution of the pressure drop across a <b>clogged</b> <b>filter</b> in the presence of humidity, especially with a hygroscopic aerosol...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of humidity on {{changes to the}} pressure drop of flat and pleated HEPA <b>filters</b> <b>clogged</b> by polydisperse hygroscopic and non-hygroscopic aerosols has been studied. For flat filters, the results confirm the observations reported by Gupta et al. (1993) that with a hygroscopic aerosol at humidity below the deliquescent point, or with a non-hygroscopic aerosol, the particulate specific cake resistance decreases as relative humidity increases. For pleated filters as for flat filters, the results reveal that during {{the formation of the}} particulate cake, the increase in relative humidity leads to a decrease in the specific cake resistance. When the reduction in filtration area, specific to pleated filters, becomes large, the presence of humidity accelerates the filling of pleats causing a greater pressure drop for a same aerosol mass loading. With a hygroscopic aerosol at a humidity above its deliquescent point, the change in pressure drop through flat or pleated filters is not linear but characteristic of liquid aerosol filtration. The {{influence of}} humidity on the efficiency of pleated filters, measured by a soda fluorescein aerosol, has also been studied. For clean filters, the efficiency decreases with increasing relative humidity above 90 %.

40|$|Dam {{filters are}} mainly {{designed}} using filter criteria {{based on the}} grain size distribution. The main design criteria against which performance is assessed are a criterion for retention of fine particles. The characteristic size of finer fraction influences the size distribution of the filter pore and hence the retention capacity of flowing particles, and the permeability of the filter itself. This paper reports experimental results obtained on the soil-filter system behaviour subject to different hydraulic and geometrical conditions. Many core soils and filters were used. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of the filter to protect the silt submitted to erosion under controlled water flow. Particles transport and filtration through each granular filter were analysed as regards to filter retention capacity and particles size selection. The plasticity of base soil influences greatly the filtration since slightly plastic soils are more erodible than plastic soils. The analysis of hydraulic conductivity in the filter is of a great concern and leads to understand the filtration process. A comparison of the efficiency of the filters is assessed toward the usual required criteria and the most appropriate for the dam filters. Matching experimental results with filter design criteria reveals that many of them are conservative. The filter porosity variation was assessed and correlated with clogging particles volume. The evolution of such parameter may be an indicator of likely <b>filter</b> <b>clogging.</b> A new approach of <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> was proposed by evaluating a damage index which is affected by various parameters such as the ratio D 15 /d 85 and the size of eroded particles.

40|$|Prefabricated {{vertical}} drains (PVD) {{are used}} to accelerate drainage and consolidation of soft sediment. An effective functioning of these PVD depends on its capacity to drain water from the subsurface. Among other causes, the clogging of filter jackets {{is thought to be}} of a considerable negative influence on the functioning of PVD. Current regulations prescribe a minimum ratio between the filters aperture size and the grain size distribution of the soil to prevent this clogging. Objective: The objective of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> on the performance of PVD filter jackets, with regards to the soft soil conditions that are encountered in large parts of the Netherlands. Method: A literature review is performed on the principle of vertical drainage, soil types, filter types, clogging criteria, processes and testing methods. An experimental program was undertaken in the laboratory in which filter jackets were exposed to two different clogging phenomena, i. e. particle clogging and chemical clogging. Also filters from the field were evaluated. All filters were evaluated on their loss of permittivity with constant head measurements on filter pieces of three different filter types, the D 165 and HS 5417 from the Typar line of DuPont and the 30195 of Freudenberg. Particle clogging was evaluated by two different setups, the Oedometer and a long term filtration setup. Within the Oedometer tests the load and the moisture content of the clay sample varied. Chemical testing was done briefly, to see till what extend iron precipitation could induce <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> and if one filter would be more prone to clog than the other. Results: The permittivity tests on the filter pieces showed reproducible results. Repeated measurements on the same sample showed an average standard deviation of not larger than four percent of the samples mean. The initial permittivity also corresponded reasonable with the values provided by the filter manufacturers. With particle clogging, it was seldom observed that clogging ratios were higher than five. Relations between clogging and the applied load on the clay sample could not be found. Increasing moisture content showed a slightly higher clogging ratio. Another clogging indicator was found from work by Aydilek, initial permittivity. This is believed to be a better estimator; higher initial permittivity in general gave lower clogging ratios. In the chemical experiment it was observed that on the filter of Freudenberg large amounts of iron oxide precipitated. During filtration the filter seemed fully clogged. Permittivity tests on this filter showed an approximately four times larger clogging ratio, than that of the other ones. Conclusions: Based on literature and observations from both experiments and field data, it can be concluded that the permittivity reduction of filter jackets is always less than a factor of ten. Hence <b>filter</b> <b>clogging</b> is not a real issue, since the permeability of the soft sediments is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the clogged filters. Hence, the system permeability is mainly determined by the soil behavior. Geo-EngineeringGeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

After 12 weeks operation, sand media <b>filters</b> <b>clogged</b> (hydraulic conductivity declining by 90 %) and all filters were destructively sampled. All biofilters had similar levels of polysaccharide in the surface layer, however only the sand columns clogged. This clogging {{may have been due}} to a combination of polysaccharide and small particle size, the development of a sand-specific microbial community, or other biogeochemical interactions. DNA fingerprinting was used to show that bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic communities were present in all filter types and at all sampling depths (to 45 cm). The bacterial community was far richer (Margalefs index, d, 1. 5 - 2) than the other groups. This was consistent across filter types and sampling depths. The structure of the bacteria and archaea communities in sand filters differed to those in GAC and anthracite filters (P< 0. 05). In contrast, eukaryotic communities were similar in surface biofilm layers, irrespective of filter type. As such, physicochemical properties of filters differentially influence the microbial community.
