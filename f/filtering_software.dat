Our Token Based Switch (TBS) {{implementation}} {{shows that}} a packetbased admission control system {{can be used to}} dynamically select a fast end-to-end connection over a hybrid network at gigabit speeds. TBS helps high-performance computing and grid applications that require high bandwidth links between grid nodes to bypass the regular Internet for authorised packets by establishing shortcuts on network links with policy constraints. TBS is fast and safe and uses the latest network processor generation (Intel IXP 2850) and the Fairly Fast Packet <b>Filter</b> <b>software</b> framework. ...|$|R
25|$|In 1998, the Federal Trade Commission in the USA {{considered}} {{the lack of}} privacy for children on the Internet, and created the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA limits the options which gather information from children and created warning labels if potential harmful information or content was presented. In 2000, Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was developed to implement safe Internet policies such as rules, and <b>filter</b> <b>software.</b> These laws, awareness campaigns, parental and adult supervision strategies and Internet filters can all help to make the Internet safer for children around the world.|$|R

2500|$|A related amendment, {{making up}} article 14 ter A, {{mandated}} that Internet users should [...] "secure" [...] their Internet connection {{so that it}} is not used for transmitting copyrighted works illegally; Internet service providers are supposed to provide users with the suitable technology.

5000|$|Many spam-filtering {{techniques}} work by {{searching for}} {{patterns in the}} headers or bodies of messages. For instance, a user may decide that all email they receive with the word [...] "Viagra" [...] in the subject line is spam, and instruct their mail program to automatically delete all such messages. To defeat such filters, the spammer may intentionally misspell commonly filtered words or insert other characters, often in a style similar to leetspeak, as in the following examples: V1agra, Via'gra, Vi@graa, vi*gra, \/iagra. This also allows for many different ways to express a given word, making identifying them all more difficult for <b>filter</b> <b>software.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In {{this same}} sense, filters lack precision. [...] They block out some {{valuable}} material {{along with the}} harmful material deemed “obscene”. [...] An example of this given in Justice Breyer’s dissent is the ACLU informing Congress during a hearing that <b>filtering</b> <b>software</b> “blocks out valuable and protected information, such as information about the Quaker religion, and web sites {{including those of the}} American Association of University Women, and the AIDS Quilt. [...] This is an extreme weakness of filters, something that will probably be used in arguments against them until, and if, new technology is developed that is able to define and deem what is “obscene” and what is not.|$|E
2500|$|LGBTQ {{individuals}} {{were some of}} the early adopters of the internet, and are still represented in high percentages across social media. [...] In addition, 55% of LGBTQ individuals who responded to a 2009 survey said that they read blogs, compared to 38% of heterosexual respondents. The internet can often be influential to young people seeking information about health, coming out, or to find community, but can also put teens at risk of cyberbullying or harassment. [...] Some libraries and schools, notably the school district in Camdenton, Mo, have been ordered to remove internet <b>filtering</b> <b>software</b> that blocked access to LGBTQ friendly websites that teens often turn to for support.|$|E
2500|$|She {{also argues}} that the Act was {{tailored}} to fit a compelling interest, and {{that the use of}} “alternative” and “less restrictive” regulation such as filters was not tailored to fit a compelling interest, and she in fact argued that filters are the “status quo”. [...] She argues that filters, as they are readily available now, do not further Congress’s goals in any way, and in turn do not pursue a compelling interest. [...] Sticking with the “status quo” is always easier, but it does not further the goal, and it only allows the problem to perpetuate. [...] She gives the example of “despite the present existence of <b>filtering</b> <b>software,</b> children are still gaining access to harmful material”.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to provide a {{framework}} for future researchers to understand and use the FARSITE wildfire-forecasting model with data assimilation. Current wildfire models lack the ability to provide accurate prediction of fire front position faster than real-time. When FARSITE is coupled with a recursive ensemble filter, the data assimilation forecast method improves. The scope includes an explanation of the standalone FARSITE application, technical details on FARSITE integration with a parallel program coupler called OpenPALM, and a model demonstration of the FARSITE-Ensemble Kalman <b>Filter</b> <b>software</b> using the FireFlux I experiment by Craig Clements. The results show that the fire front forecast is improved with the proposed data-driven methodology than with the standalone FARSITE model...|$|R
