5|$|The FN {{has been}} part of several groups in the European Parliament. The first group it helped co-establish was the European Right after the 1984 election, which also {{consisted}} of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), its early inspiration, and the Greek National Political Union. Following the 1989 election, it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group, while the MSI left due to the Germans' arrival. As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance, it chose to distance itself from the FN. From 1999 to 2001, the FN {{was a member of the}} Technical Group of Independents. In 2007, it was part of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group. Between the mentioned groups, the party sat among the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits. It leads the Europe of Nations and Freedom group, which also includes the <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party</b> of Austria, Polish Congress of the New Right, Italian Northern League, Vlaams Belang, the Alternative for Germany, the Dutch <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party,</b> a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania's Conservative Party.

5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party.</b> Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to own their land, and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party</b> of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E

5|$|In the 2016 Austrian presidential election, <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party</b> {{candidate}} Norbert Hofer won {{the first}} round of the election, receiving 35.1% of the vote, making that election the Freedom Party's best ever election result in its history. However, in the second round, Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, who received the support of 50.3% compared to Hofer's 49.7%. On July first the Constitutional Court of Austria voided the results of the second round due to mishandling of postal votes; although the court did not find evidence of deliberate manipulation. The re-vote took place on 4 December 2016 when Van der Bellen won by a significantly larger margin.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September 2014, the Inkatha <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party</b> {{expressed}} its {{concern for}} the residents of Khuma as repairs to their homes were delayed and had not yet commenced. Provincial government spokesperson, Bonolo Mohlakoana said that construction was delayed partly {{due to a lack}} of structural engineers, which were needed to assess the structural damage caused to the houses. Several families affected by the earthquake moved to a community centre while waiting for their houses to be repaired after affected families were instructed to move to safer locations.|$|E
5|$|The Sixth World Congress in 1961 {{marked a}} {{lessening}} {{of the political}} divisions between the majority of supporters of the International Secretariat and {{the leadership of the}} SWP in the United States. In particular, the congress stressed support for the Cuban revolution and a growing emphasis on building parties in the imperialist countries. The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan section, for seeming to support the Sri Lanka <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party,</b> which they saw as bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.|$|E
50|$|Broadcasting {{was vital}} to {{creating}} support for Jake Featherston. After the 1925 assassination of President Wade Hampton V, regular broadcasts by Featherston broke the <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party's</b> decline and helped lead Featherston to the Presidency.|$|R

5|$|The party {{also became}} {{very active in}} {{establishing}} contacts with post-communist parties in Eastern European countries, including the Croatian Party of Rights, Slovak National Party and IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement. While not keeping official contacts, it was in addition very supportive of left-wing nationalist parties such as the Scottish National Party, Irish Sinn Féin and Basque Herri Batasuna. Some of the parties it established contacts with most recently was the <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party</b> of Austria and the Italian Lega Nord, which {{after a period of}} distrust, maintained contacts since 2002.|$|E
5|$|When his {{re-election}} in 1975 seemed unsure, Kreisky proposed that his Social Democratic Party should form a coalition with the <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party,</b> headed by Friedrich Peter. Wiesenthal was {{in possession of}} information proving that Peter {{had been a member}} of the 1 SS Infantry Brigade, a unit that had exterminated over 13,000 Jewish civilians in Ukraine in 1941–42. He decided not to reveal this information to the press until after the election, but forwarded his dossier to President Rudolf Kirchschläger. Peter denied having participated in, or having knowledge of, any atrocities. In the end, Kreisky's party won a clear majority and did not form the coalition.|$|E
5|$|During Jean-Marie Le Pen's presidency, {{the party}} has also been active in {{establishing}} extra-parliamentary confederations. During the FN's 1997 national congress, the FN established the loose Euronat group, which consisted {{of a variety of}} European right-wing parties. Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament, Le Pen sought in the mid-1990s to initiate contacts with other far-right parties, including from non-EU countries. The FN drew most support in Central and Eastern Europe, and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party. The significant <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party</b> of Austria (FPÖ) refused to join the efforts, as Jörg Haider sought to distance himself from Le Pen, and later attempted to build a separate group. In 2009, the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements; it left the alliance since. Along with some other European parties, the FN in 2010 visited Japan's Issuikai ("right-wing") movement and the Yasukuni Shrine.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, several minor <b>freedom</b> <b>parties</b> with no {{elected representatives}} at their {{national}} level, {{expressed support for}} the creation of Liberland. They are the Capitalist Party in Norway, the Libertarian Party (Spain), The Swiss Independence Party up! (Unabhängigkeitspartei) and the Liberal Democratic Party (Turkey) (LDP).|$|R
50|$|The New Bulgarian Media Group, deemed {{close to}} the Turkish-minority Movement for Rights and <b>Freedoms</b> <b>party</b> emerged in 2007 and got own Monitor, Express, Telegraph (dailies), Politika, Weekend, Meridian Match (weeklies), the Borba {{newspaper}} and a publishing house (in the city of Veliko Turnovo).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party's</b> {{campaign}} against blacks {{led to the}} euphemism [...] "population reduction", which was used instead of [...] "genocide." [...] "I'll reduce your population!" [...] or [...] "You'll get your population reduced!" [...] became a Confederate saying; this was parodied in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Strache, the party has cooperated mainly with the Northern League, Vlaams Belang (successor to the Vlaams Blok, which it has traditionally maintained good ties with), and the Pro Germany Citizens' Movement in Germany. The FPÖ also has contacts with the Danish People's Party, the Slovak National Party, the Sweden Democrats, the Lithuanian Order and Justice, IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany and the German <b>Freedom</b> <b>party.</b> In 2007, the party's then-only MEP {{was a member of}} the short-lived Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty grouping in the European Parliament. Outside the EU, it has contacts with Tomislav Nikolić of the Serbian Progressive Party (formerly of the Serbian Radical Party), the Swiss People's Party, the Israeli Likud, the U.S. Republican Party and the United Russia party.|$|E
5|$|ITAK {{had four}} main aims: {{creation}} of a federal union in Ceylon with two states - a Tamil state in the Northern and Eastern provinces and a Sinhalese state in the remaining seven provinces; cessation of state-sponsored colonisation in the two Tamil provinces; unity amongst the Tamil speaking peoples of Ceylon - Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils and Muslims; and equal status for Sinhala and Tamil languages. Chelvanayakam lost his seat in the 1952 parliamentary election but regained it in the 1956 parliamentary election. As Ceylon's two main parties, the UNP and Sri Lanka <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party</b> (SLFP), introduced policies which further discriminated against the country's minorities, such as the Sinhala Only Act which made Sinhala the sole official language of Ceylon, ITAK's Tamil nationalism became more popular than the ACTC's conservatism. In the 1956 parliamentary election the ITAK overtook the ACTC as the most popular party amongst Ceylon Tamils. On 5 June 1956 a group of Tamil activists and parliamentarians, led by Chelvanayakam, staged a satyagraha (a form of non-violent resistance) against the Sinhala Only Act on Galle Face Green opposite the Parliament. The satyagrahis were attacked by a Sinhalese mob as the police looked on, and ITAK MPs E. M. V. Naganathan and V. N. Navaratnam were thrown in Beira Lake.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Federation of Independents (VdU) {{was founded}} as a {{national}} liberal alternative to the main Austrian partiesthe Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), successors to the interwar era Marxist and Christian Social parties. The VdU was founded by two liberal Salzburg journalistsformer Nazi Germany prisonerswho wanted to stay clear of the mainstream socialist and Catholic camps and feared that hostility following the hastily devised postwar denazification policy (which did not distinguish between party members and actual war criminals) might stimulate a revival of Nazism. Aiming to become a political home to everyone {{not a member of}} the two main parties, the VdU incorporated an array of political movementsincluding free-market liberals, populists, former Nazis and German nationalists, all of whom had been unable to join either of the two main parties. The VdU won 12% of the vote in the 1949 general election, but saw its support beginning to decline soon afterward. It evolved into the FPÖ by 1955/56 after merging with the minor <b>Freedom</b> <b>Party</b> in 1955; a new party was formed on 17 October 1955, and its founding congress was held on 7 April 1956.|$|E
