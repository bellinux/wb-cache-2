5|$|After a near two-year absence, Primus made a {{comeback}} to the Portsmouth first team on 18 May 2009, the penultimate {{game of the}} 2008–09 season, as a late substitute appearance against Sunderland at Fratton Park. He received a standing ovation from the home crowd and was cheered each time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball.|$|E
5|$|To {{defy the}} prophecies, Oleg sent the horse away. Many {{years later he}} asked where his horse was, and was told it had died.

Oleg died, thus {{fulfilling}} the prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Kraft's {{world record}} {{initially}} came under scrunity, {{as it appeared}} that <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> snow with his backside as {{he was forced to}} squat down on essentially flat ground. However, slow-motion replay analysis confirmed that his landing was valid, albeit with only millimetres to spare. A week later, Planica caught up to Vikersund with a plethora of more personal bests, and three athletes – including Kraft, twice – landing jumps of or beyond 250m. Kamil Stoch would claim the current hill record of 251.5m, with the season finale competition drawing an attendance of 16,500.|$|E

5|$|On January 18, 2017, {{he set a}} {{new season}} high with 40 points in a 121–100 win over the Thunder. On February 2, 2017, he was named Co-Western Conference Player of the Month for January {{alongside}} teammate Stephen Curry. On February 11, {{in his first game}} back in Oklahoma City, Durant scored 34 points while being booed throughout the night, as he helped the Warriors defeat the Thunder {{for the third time in}} 2016–17 with a 130–114 win. The Thunder crowd jeered him loudly during pregame warmups, starter introductions, and whenever <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball.|$|E
5|$|Robben had an extra-time penalty {{saved by}} former {{teammate}} Petr Čech in the 2012 Champions League final at the Allianz Arena against Chelsea. Had he scored, Bayern Munich {{would have led}} Chelsea 2–1. The match, however, ended in a penalty shootout which Chelsea won. That was the fourth major cup final {{that he had been}} on the losing side during the last two years (FIFA World Cup final, two Champions League finals and the DFB-Pokal). Three days later in the same stadium, and while playing as a second-half substitute for the Netherlands in a friendly against Bayern Munich, he was jeered by some disgruntled Bayern fans every time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball (due to his penalty miss in the Champions League final, and as he did not play on Bayern's side during that match due to a decision taken by Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk). The match had been organized to compensate Bayern, since Robben aggravated an injury playing for the Netherlands at the 2010 World Cup, and went on to miss several months of the 2010–11 season.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2010–11 season, James {{embraced the}} villain role that was {{bestowed}} upon {{him by the}} media. He played for the Heat with an angry demeanor and less joy than in years past, and later admitted that he regretted this approach. On December 2, he faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland {{for the first time}} since departing as a free agent. He scored 38 points and led Miami to a win while being booed every time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball. He finished the season with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting. Miami entered the playoffs as the East's second seed and advanced to the Finals before stumbling against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in six games despite holding a 2–1 series lead going into Game 4. James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series. His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.|$|E

5|$|Early {{on during}} the 2010–11 season, Evra was {{hampered}} by constant inquiries about {{what happened at the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup from the French Football Federation (FFF), the French media, as well as the French government. Evra's contract with Manchester United was also {{up at the end of}} the 2011–12 season, which led to the player being linked with a move to Real Madrid. Evra's hearing with the FFF in Paris, which he attended, was held the day after the team's opening 3–0 league win over Newcastle United. Evra played over 85 minutes in the match. On 20 November, Evra scored his second Premier League goal in a 2–0 win at home against Wigan Athletic. On 21 February 2011, after weeks of negotiations, Evra signed a contract extension with Manchester United that would keep him with the club until at least the end of the 2013–14 season. Two days after signing his contract extension, Evra participated in United's 0–0 draw with Marseille in the first leg of the team's first knockout round tie in the Champions League. The match, played at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, was Evra's first match played in France since the 2010 World Cup debacle. As a consequence, he was subjected to a barrage of jeers and boos every time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball.|$|E
5|$|During the Predators' {{training}} camp in September 2005, Kariya suffered separate ankle and groin injuries that limited his participation in team practices and pre-season games. Recovering {{in time for the}} season-opener, he debuted with the Predators on October 5, 2005, at home against the San Jose Sharks. Early in the game, Kariya was routinely cheered by fans when <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> puck. Trailing 2–1 in the third period, he scored on goaltender Evgeni Nabokov to the tie the game, en route to a 3–2 win. The following game, Kariya participated in his first NHL shootout (the tie-breaker was newly implemented by the League for the 2005–06 season) after the Predators remained tied with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 2–2 following overtime. The last of three shooters for the Predators, Kariya was the lone player to score in the shootout, leading Nashville to a 3–2 win. The two wins helped Nashville go undefeated in their first eight games, two wins shy of the League's record for consecutive victories to start a season. On April 18, 2006, {{the last day of the}} regular season, Kariya scored a hat-trick against the Detroit Red Wings in a 6–3 win, helping the Predators secure the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In his first season with Nashville, Kariya set team records with 31 goals, 54 assists and 85 points. His 14 power play goals also tied defenceman Andy Delmore's team record set in 2002–03, while his 245 shots came within three of Cliff Ronning's mark set in 1998–99. With five shootout goals over seven attempts, Kariya ranked fourth in the NHL in shootout scoring percentage at 71.4% (among players who had taken at least five attempts). On a team basis, the Predators set franchise records with 49 wins and 106 points, ranking fourth in the West. Matching up against the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Kariya opened the post-season with four assists in Game 1 to lead Nashville to a 4–3 win. After taking Game 1, the Predators went on to lose the next four contests and were eliminated from the playoffs. The team was markedly weakened for the playoffs with starting goaltender Tomáš Vokoun unavailable due to injury and Kariya's linemate Steve Sullivan playing hurt. Kariya had two goals and seven points over the series.|$|E

25|$|Games 1 and 2 were Celtic routs, keyed {{by great}} team defense (Atlanta {{averaged}} 79 {{points in the}} first 2 games) and balanced Celtic scoring (six players were in double figures in Game 1, five in Game 2). The most buzz was generated by Mike Bibby stating that Celtic fans were bandwagoners after Game 1, prompting boos every time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball in Game 2.|$|E
25|$|Upset, Midas {{strove to}} divest himself {{of his power}} (the Midas Touch); he hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be {{delivered}} from starvation. Dionysus heard and consented; he told Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. He did so, and when <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> waters the power passed into them, and the river sands changed into gold. This was an etiological myth that explained why the sands of the Pactolus were rich in gold.|$|E

The series {{was one of the}} more dramatic in OHL history given Lindros's attitude toward the team, with fans from the Soo loudly jeering him every time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> puck.

25|$|In the 2003 off-season, Fedorov {{signed with}} the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim after a long {{contract}} dispute with the Red Wings, in which he rejected deals for five-year, $50million and four-year, $40million. On December 3, 2003, Fedorov returned to Detroit {{for the first time}} since signing with the Ducks; he was booed heavily by Detroit fans every time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> puck during a 7–2 Red Wings victory, during which he scored one of Anaheim's goals. He remained with Anaheim from 2003 to 2005. It was with the Ducks that Fedorov picked up his 1,000th point, becoming the first Russian-born and fifth European-born player to do so.|$|E
25|$|Tom van Vollenhoven the brush-cut wing who {{appeared}} on the scene in 1955, was the kind of player who captured the imagination every time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball. His try for the Light Blues against the Junior Springboks in 1955, when he beat one player after another in spectacular a zigzag run of almost 80 metres, is still lauded as the try of all tries. This got him into the Springbok side against the 1955 British Lions of Robin Thomson and in the second test scored a hat trick of tries. He would probably {{have been one of the}} greatest heroes if he had not gone off to play professional rugby league in England so early in his career.|$|E
25|$|The 1930 Ashes series saw a young Don Bradman {{dominate}} the tour, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at Headingley and 232 at the Oval. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 3–1. As {{a result of}} Bradman's prolific run-scoring the England captain Douglas Jardine chose to develop the already existing leg theory into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one {{of a large number}} of fielders placed on the leg side.|$|E

25|$|The {{field goal}} battle {{continued}} in the third quarter, with Zendejas kicking one more and Anderson adding another two, making the score 16–9 {{at the start of}} the fourth quarter. But quarterback Warren Moon finally got his team to the end zone with a 10-play, 80-yard drive to score on his 18-yard touchdown pass to Ernest Givins that tied the game. Following a Pittsburgh three-and-out, Harry Newsome's punt went just 25 yards to the Steelers 38-yard line. From there it took just five plays for Houston to take their first lead of the game, scoring on Moon's 9-yard pass touchdown pass to Givins that put them up 23–16 with 5:16 left in regulation. Starting from their own 18 after the kickoff, Pittsburgh drove 82 yards, featuring a 22-yard run by receiver Dwight Stone (the only time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball all game) on a reverse play, to score on Hoge's 2-yard touchdown run with 46 seconds left, tying the game and sending it into overtime.|$|E
25|$|The next {{relief panel}} has barely survived. It is {{supposed}} that it showed Demeter. She {{is followed by}} Hera, entering the battle in a quadriga. Her four winged horses are identified as the personifications of the four winds, Notos, Boreas, Zephyrus and Eurus. Between Hera and his father Zeus, Heracles is fighting, identified only by a frieze fragment showing a paw of his lion pelt. Zeus is physically especially present and agile. He fights by hurling lightning bolts, sending rain and massed clouds not only against two young Giants but also against their leader, Porphyrion. The next pair of fighters also shows an especially important battle scene. Athena, the city goddess of Pergamon, breaks the Giant Alkyoneus’ contact to the earth, from which {{the mother of the}} Giants, Gaia, emerges. According to legend, Alkyoneus was immortal only as long as <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ground, where the power of his mother could flow through him. The eastern frieze concludes with Ares, the god of war, who goes into battle with a chariot and pair of horses. His horses rear {{up in front of a}} winged Giant.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter, who {{was traded to}} the Nets in 2004 after an acrimonious split, against his former team. So great was the Toronto crowd's disdain for Carter, that he was booed every time <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball. The Nets took home court {{advantage}} in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in Game 2 and tied the series at 1. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets took charge of the series, winning Games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in Game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip away, and had a chance to win it, but Boštjan Nachbar's 3 missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a Game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in Game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with 8 seconds left. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted the pass to seal the series for the Nets.|$|E
