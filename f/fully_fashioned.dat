25|$|When Von Teese was a teenager, {{her mother}} {{took her to}} buy her first bra, made from plain white cotton, {{and gave her a}} plastic egg {{containing}} a pair of wrinkly, flesh-colored pantyhose. Von Teese says she was disappointed, as she had been hoping to receive beautiful lacy garments and stockings, of the type she had glimpsed in her father's Playboy magazines. This fueled her passion for lingerie. She worked in a lingerie store as a salesgirl when she was 15, eventually as a buyer. Von Teese has been fond of wearing elaborate lingerie such as corsets and basques with <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> stockings ever since. In college, Von Teese studied historic costuming and aspired to work as a stylist for films. She is a trained costume designer, often designing (and copyrighting) her photo shoots herself.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> {{knitting}} machines are those flat and circular {{knitting machines}} that produce custom pre-shaped pieces of a knitted garment. Instead of knitting a whole rectangular sheet of fabric, instructions from a knit pattern on a punch card or computer file guide a <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> knitting machine's needles to add or drop stitches to create custom two-dimensional shapes appropriate to the desired finished garment structure. The pieces emerge from the machine ready to be sewn together.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> {{knitting}} {{cuts down}} {{on the amount of}} material required to make a garment by eliminating selvage, the remnants that would be left after cutting from a rectangular fabric sheet. For example, a sweater requires at least four pieces of fabric: two sleeves, the front piece, and the back piece. Prior to <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> machine techniques, a full sheet of material would have to be produced, each of the four pieces would be cut out, and the remaining fabric would be discarded. With full-fashioning, the machine produces only the four required pieces.|$|E

40|$|Knit on Demand is a {{research}} project at the Swedish School of Textiles in collaboration with Ivanhoe AB and SOMconcept AB. The purpose of the project is to test new production methods for knitwear that could strongly influence the fashion industry's need for agility. In autumn 2009 sales started in Stockholm. The project stands on three legs; design, knitting technology and logistics {{and the purpose of}} the paper is to describe the Knit on Demand project from these three perspectives. Designing the garments and the system was the most time consuming part of the project since the products had to be fashionable, manufacturable and preferably not to expensive so a few trade offs hade to be made. Look was however considered essential since fashion always comes first. For knitting a combination of <b>fully</b> <b>fashion</b> and cut and sew are used so that the garments keep some of the <b>fully</b> <b>fashion</b> advantages but remains easily customisable. Logistics becomes a little bit more complicated because of the unique garments but the logistic costs does still not make up more than 3 - 5 percent of the sales price of a garment. Return rates are below one percent, which is rather interesting to further analysis...|$|R

50|$|The {{complete}} garment system's advantages lie in 1) {{a further}} reduction in materials beyond even <b>fully</b> <b>fashioned</b> production by eliminating seam allowances and 2) faster {{time to market}} by {{eliminating the need for}} sewing any components.
