5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who {{thought that he was}} reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E

East of Somerset the highway reaches Allegheny Mountain, going under {{it in the}} Allegheny Mountain Tunnel.

At Bedford, an exit for US220Business (US220Bus.) provides access to US220 and the southern terminus of I-99; this exit also serves Altoona to the north.|$|E

5|$|Paxton's cavalry {{met with}} Lane's {{infantry}} {{at a point}} on Cold Knob Mountain around noon on November 26. The two colonels conferred, and Lane decided that his regiment was not in condition to continue the mission. His men were wet and cold, and they began their return to their camp in Summerville. Paxton also considered ending the mission, but decided to continue after being convinced by Major Powell. Powell was assigned to lead the advance guard, and selected Lieutenant Jeremiah Davidson and 20 men from Company G to join him. The advance guard, followed {{by the rest of}} the cavalry regiment, proceeded <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> toward the rebel camps.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E

The NK 3rd Division was to attack in the Waegwan area northwest of Taegu, the NK 13th Division <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> ridges north of Taegu along and west of the Sangju-Taegu road, and the NK 1st Division along the high mountain ridges just east of the road.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward, {{the drive}} descends <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> toward Copper Harbor.

Near the eastern end, there are two sharp hairpin turns, the first of which has a scenic overlook and parking area. This spot overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway portion of US Highway 41 (US41) just to the east. From here, the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge, through the second turn and ends at M-26 on the western edge of town.|$|E

5|$|Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 the {{advanced}} platoon of E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived {{on top of}} Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter.

5|$|The Italians {{were under}} the {{impression}} that they were facing three Belgian divisions with South African reinforcements. They also only had about two months' provisions left. Gazzera radioed the Allies in Addis Abeba his intentions to negotiate a surrender with the Belgians.

Gilliaert met with them a short distance away from Bortai Brook near Gambela. They requested that all hostilities south of the Blue Nile cease and that their army be granted the honours of war. Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Saïo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.|$|E

Paxton sent the regiment's advance guard, led by Major Powell, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> to scout the rebel camps in Sinking Creek Valley. Each man in the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry's 22-man advance guard was armed with two six-shot revolvers and a saber. The advance guard discovered that the rebels in the first camp were focused on staying warm, and many did not have their one-shot muskets loaded. Powell and his advance guard {{decided to try to}} capture the camp by themselves, and were successful in persuading a 500-man rebel camp to surrender. Rebel weapons were destroyed, and over 100 prisoners on horses were brought up the mountain to the remaining portion of the regiment. Union casualties in the raid were 2 horses killed.|$|E
5|$|While {{ascending}} the mountain, {{the player}} activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While {{there are over}} 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all.|$|E
5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains {{are the source of}} the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E

5|$|Patterson and Langdon both {{claimed to}} control a {{majority}} of the company's stock, and in February 1893, rival boards of directors were elected by stockholders loyal to those two figures. The issue of 600 shares to Patterson, authorized in 1891, turned the issue, and its validity was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and Patterson's board of directors ordered seated. Langdon promptly petitioned for a receivership, and was appointed joint receiver with Patterson. Patterson, however, took most of the responsibility for operations. He was responsible having wyes installed at Wopsononock and Juniata in late 1894 so that the railroad's engines did not have to back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> The co-receivership was lifted on July 6, 1896, and Patterson took full control of the railroad again. However, the railroad failed to cover its operating expenses shortly thereafter, and Patterson was re-appointed receiver on September 28, 1896. On February 29, 1897, it was sold under foreclosure to William L. Shellenberger, on behalf of the bondholders—the group which had allied with Langdon. On March 17, 1897, it was reorganized as the Altoona and Beech Creek Railroad.|$|E
