5|$|Chamberlain was {{not made}} a Privy Councillor. He also spurned advice from Lloyd George about <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> advisors (apart from James Stevenson from the Ministry of Munitions who was briefly Deputy for Civil Recruiting), instead {{appointing}} cronies from Birmingham who were as out of their depth as he was. Chamberlain nearly resigned in June 1917 when, having not been told or consulted, he read in the newspapers {{that he had been}} given a new Parliamentary Secretary.|$|E

5|$|In May 2001, Narayan was hospitalised. A {{few hours}} before {{he was to be}} put on a ventilator, he was {{planning}} on writing his next novel, a story about a grandfather. As he was always very selective about <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> notebooks, he asked N. Ram to get him one. However, Narayan did not get better and never started the novel. He died on 13 May 2001, in Chennai at the age of 94.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840 presidential election, Crittenden again {{encouraged}} Kentucky Whigs {{to support}} the nomination of Henry Clay. After Clay lost the nomination, Crittenden supported eventual victor William Henry Harrison. Crittenden was re-elected to the Senate in 1840 {{even though he was}} widely expected to be named to a position in Harrison's presidential cabinet. He was apparently given <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> cabinet positions, and chose that of Attorney General. He resigned his Senate seat to take this post.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner {{was hired as}} director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous. Burt Reynolds also turned down the role, while Sylvester Stallone was interested, but nothing ever came of it. Paul Newman was offered <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4million, turning down all three roles.|$|E

5|$|Jolliffe's motives {{regarding}} his accusations, {{as well as}} <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> words, would be questioned for many years afterwards. That would change. In the late 1970s, when David Lewis was doing research for his Memoirs he came across archival evidence proving the charge. Due to Lewis's discovery, Drew's son Edward, placed extremely restrictive conditions on his father's papers housed in the Public Archives of Canada that continue as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{had strong}} {{preferences}} in <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> drum set. Those preferences, however, changed {{several times over}} his career. He began with Gretsch drums. In 1957, intrigued {{by the sound of}} a kind of drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{style is}} {{characteristic}} of Hindustani classical music, but <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> solo instrument and his background of learning from teachers outside his community are not common for the genre.

5000|$|While his {{melodies and}} piano accompaniments are {{considered}} [...] "commonplace, with little harmonic interest", <b>his</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> texts were sophisticated, embracing the literary world of his time.

5|$|The new reign was {{supported}} by the Whigs, who were mostly staunch Protestants. The Tories were suspected of supporting the Catholic Pretender James Francis Edward Stuart.

Sarah approved of <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> Whig ministers.|$|E

5000|$|<b>His</b> <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> {{poems by}} {{important}} American poets and their musical settings is remarkable and unexpected, [...] "in {{a man who}} was not native born and spoke so many languages, was the depth of his understanding of and response to American poetry, and the force and precision with which he was able to interpret it in musical terms".|$|R
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} positive {{reviews for}} his pianism, Bache's difficulties with the critics {{on behalf of}} Liszt's music had a negative backlash on his performing career. He was never invited {{to play with the}} Philharmonic Society, even after Liszt personally recommended him as a soloist. After printed inquiries by the Musical Standard, which openly questioned why Bache's career had not advanced despite his obvious talent, he was invited in 1874 to play at the Crystal Palace. While his playing was lauded, <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> music (the Liszt arrangement of Weber's Polonaise Brillante for piano and orchestra) was derided as astoundingly impudent. He also appeared at concerts led by Hans Richter, as organist in Liszt's symphonic poem Die Hunnenschlacht and as pianist in Beethoven's Choral Fantasy and Chopin's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|Going into 2015, the Football League {{made public}} their {{concerns}} over Yeung's attempts to impose <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> directors on the BIHL board despite his conviction disqualifying him from exerting influence over a club. Relationships became increasingly factional, {{as illustrated by}} the failure of three directors, including the club's de facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, {{the names}} of 19 eze Nri were recorded, but the list is not easily {{converted}} into chronological terms because of long interregnums between installations.

5|$|In the {{township}} of Sant Gervasi de Cassoles (now a district of Barcelona), {{the widow of}} Jaume Figueras commissioned Gaudí to renovate the Torre Bellesguard (1900–1909), former summer palace of King Martin I the Humane. Gaudí designed it in a neo-Gothic style, respecting the former building as much as possible, and tried as always to integrate the architecture into the natural surroundings. This influenced <b>his</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> local slate for the construction. The building's ground-plan measures 15 x 15 meters, with the corners oriented to the four cardinal points. Constructed in stone and brick, it is taller than it is wide, with a spire topped with the four-armed cross, the Catalan flag and the royal crown. The house has a basement, ground floor, first floor and an attic, with a gable roof.|$|E
5|$|Massenet {{composed}} {{many other}} smaller-scale choral works, {{and more than}} two hundred songs. His early collections of songs were particularly popular and helped establish his reputation. <b>His</b> <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> lyrics ranged widely. Most were verses by poets such as Musset, Maupassant, Hugo, Gautier and many lesser-known French writers, with occasional poems from overseas, including Tennyson in English and Shelley in French translation. Grove comments that Massenet's songs, though pleasing and impeccable in craftsmanship, are less inventive than those of Bizet and less distinctive than those of Duparc and Fauré.|$|E
