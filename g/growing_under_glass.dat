60|$|While {{the family}} {{and two or three}} guests went to dinner, we walked out to see the place. The gardener, an Irishman, showed us through the garden, which is large and well cared for. They {{certainly}} get everything from Nature which she can possibly be persuaded to give them, here in England. There were peaches and pears growing against the high brick southern walls,--the trunk and branches of the trees being spread out perfectly flat against the wall, very much like the skin of a dead animal nailed up to dry, and not a single branch protruding. Figs were growing in the same way. The brick wall, very probably, was heated within, by means of pipes, in order to re-enforce the insufficient heat of the sun. It seems as if there must be something unreal and unsatisfactory in fruit that owes its existence to such artificial methods. Squashes were <b>growing</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass,</b> poor things! There were immensely large gooseberries in the garden; and in this particular berry, the English, I believe, have decidedly the advantage over ourselves. The raspberries, too, were large and good. I espied one gigantic hog-weed in the garden; and, really, my heart warmed to it, being strongly reminded of the principal product of my own garden at Concord. After viewing the garden sufficiently, the gardener led us {{to other parts of the}} estate, and we had glimpses of a delightful valley, its sides shady with beautiful trees, and a rich, grassy meadow at the bottom. By means of a steam-engine and subterranean pipes and hydrants, the liquid manure from the barn-yard is distributed wherever it is wanted over the estate, being spouted in rich showers from the hydrants. Under this influence, the meadow at the bottom of the valley had already been made to produce three crops of grass during the present season, and would produce another.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the late}} 1960s the main land use around Cheshunt was for its nursery industry, and many new {{techniques}} for <b>growing</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> were developed here. Thomas Rochford {{had a large}} concern here, although now almost all the glasshouses have been redeveloped into housing estates. This is often reflected {{in the names of}} the roads or estates, such as Rosedale or Thomas Rochford Way. A small amount of nursery trade survives {{to the west of the}} town. The neighbouring town of Goffs Oak still has a large number of nurseries as well as a large garden centre.|$|E
50|$|As {{currently}} circumscribed {{the family}} includes three genera. All genera and species are {{native to the}} Old World tropics. The largest and most economically important genus in the family is Musa, famous for the banana and plantain. The genus Musa was formally established in {{the first edition of}} Linnaeus' Species Plantarum in 1753 — the publication that marks the start of the present formal botanical nomenclature. At the time he wrote Species Plantarum, Linnaeus had first hand knowledge of only one type of banana, which he personally had the opportunity of seeing <b>growing</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> in the garden of Mr. George Clifford near Haarlem in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|E. reichenbachii prefer {{full sun}} and require little water. They thrive in dry, well-drained, gravelly, clay, and loam soils, and near rock outcroppings. They are cold and heat tolerant, and <b>grow</b> well <b>under</b> <b>glass.</b> They are drought resistant, but {{susceptible}} to mealybugs and scale insects.|$|R
6000|$|The {{successor}} of the sheet-iron {{hamlet of}} the mangrove marshes has that other Australian specialty, the Botanical Gardens. We cannot have these paradises. The {{best we could}} {{do would be to}} cover a vast acreage <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> and apply steam heat. But it would be inadequate, the lacks would still be so great: the confined sense, the sense of suffocation, the atmospheric dimness, the sweaty heat--these would all be there, in place of the Australian openness to the sky, the sunshine and the breeze. Whatever will <b>grow</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> with us will flourish rampantly out of doors in Australia.--[The greatest heat in Victoria, that there is an authoritative record of, was at Sandhurst, in January, 1862. The thermometer then registered 117 degrees in the shade. In January, 1880, the heat at Adelaide, South Australia, was 172 degrees in the sun.] ...|$|R
500|$|Britton and Rose {{believe that}} M. spinosissima {{has been in}} {{cultivation}} since at least 1835. The species thrives in well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH that is acidic, alkaline, or neutral. They prefer low humidity, and <b>grow</b> well <b>under</b> <b>glass,</b> with full, filtered sun from the south, north, and east. Plants are typically watered once every couple of weeks, and kept nearly dry during the winter months. Propagation is facilitated by offsets of seeds sown in early spring in [...] weather. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are disease resistant, but are susceptible to pests such as mealybugss.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Due {{to strong}} {{eggplant}} {{growth and the}} formation of large vegetative weight quantities in <b>growing</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> and foil it was deemed useful to conduct studies on the effect of pruning intensity on yielding of this vegetable in rooms. The aim of the forego-ing studies was to demonstrate the effect of plant pruning and topping manner on yield quantity and earliness. The experiment was conducted in the years 2001 – 2003. The study objects were the plants of ‘Epic F 1 ’ cultivar. Eggplant was grown in rigid foil cylinders of the capacity of 10 dm 3 in the peat substrates. The plants were trimmed, managing for one, two, three, four, five, six guiding shoots and in the natural form, without trimming. Top-ping cut was performed in each combination after the first fruit harvest. The experiment was established and conducted as a two-factor one, in accordance with a complete ran-domization system: A – pruning method (a = 7), B – topped and non-topped plants (b = 2). Each combination of the examined factors was represented by 20 plants (experimental units). A significant effect of pruning intensity on the quantity and earliness yielding was demonstrated. The highest marketable fruit yield was obtained from plants managed for two (3. 82 kg. m- 2), three (3. 98 kg. m- 2), and four (3. 87 kg. m- 2) guiding shoots. Managing for one guiding shoot significantly decreased the total and marketable fruit number. The highest early yield was collected from plants managed for one and two guiding shoots. A single topping cut performed after the first fruit harvest did not affect marketable yield and marketable fruit number. Key words: Solanum melongena L, quantity and earliness of yield, marketable fruit...|$|E
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} about using of Agrisorb hydroabsorbent for cabbage culture, planted from seeds. In {{literary}} part are named natural and synthetic substances with ability desert water and their characteristics. The describtion of cabbage growing technology, cabbage pests and diseases, special substances contents and statictical dates. Experiment was dividend {{in two parts}} - cabbage growed in field conditions and cabbage <b>growed</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass.</b> The aim of the field experiment {{was to determine the}} effect of Agrisorb when is applied by soaking seeds, which are then seeded directly on the field. The aim of the glass experiment was to determine the differences in germination of model culture in non-stress conditions. Than were evaluated differences of development between treated and not treated seedlings. Germination of treated seeds in field conditions was the best evaluated - with 68, 5 % germinated seeds. Than, plants from treated seeds had significantly higher amount of ascorbic acid in compare with control plants (396, 91 mg asc. ac. / kg, it is 120, 2 % in compare with control culture.) The dry weight of cones of Agrisorb treated plants was 8, 96 % in compare with dry weight of control plants 116, 2 %. It was measured the plant leaf area as well, and results shows, that plants treated by Agrisorb had 43, 33 cm 2 in average, it means 123 % in compare with control plants...|$|R

Amused with a 'Ranunculus' being taken for Fiorin grass; does not trust Dr Richardson's account of 'Agrostis stolonifera' which he has always taken as indicator of barren soil, Dary's report of this grass in his Lectures does not give a better opinion. Received seed of Guinea grass from [James] Brodie; <b>grew</b> <b>under</b> <b>glass</b> but did not flower. Discusses apples: Siberian crab a most beautiful variety, delicious made into tarts; of his Herefordshire patent apples of golden pippins and Ribston pippins only two Grange are forthcoming; and a Ribston is in good health a year after being treated for canker with turpentine. Figs in pots not worth their room in vinery and following Mr Knight's experience will try mulberries. Saw willow bonnets in York whiter and finer than the straw ones. Encloses specimen of willow sent by Mr Nicholas from Wiltshire. Just read of death of Dr [William] Gretton [(1736 - 1813), master of Magdalen College], the mastership will probably be held for George Neville. Summarises letter from [Alexander Gordon, 4 th] Duke of Gordon [(1743 - 1827) ] stating he shot a one horned, one testicled stag, and as deer castrated with or without their horns either never shed them or never produce them this deer must have been wounded in velvet for the defficient horn was a small hump, illustrated with small ink sketch. Davy has been shooting and fishing at Gordon Castle and he is to go "vulcano hunting" in Europe, Berthollet has insured his favourable reception in France. A fruit basket brought from Vicenza, [Italy], by Mr Dawnay has frustrated several local basket makers, but he and his son managed to succeed in replicating it. Expects his son [on tour of Ireland] to arrive at Holyhead, [Anglesey] soon, he has been away for 8 weeks...|$|R
