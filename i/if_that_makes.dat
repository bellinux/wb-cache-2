25|$|Tasmania {{was named}} the 'bogan capital of Australia' with Taswegians earning four spots in the final. This {{prompted}} a response from Luke Martin, CEO of Tourism Industry Council Tasmania, who affirmed that Tasmanians are friendly, down to earth and want people to share their stories and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> them bogans, so be it. On the island of Tasmania, half the population has literacy and/or numeracy difficulties, and {{the unemployment rate is}} higher than it is in mainland Australia.|$|E

The band decided to rebuild their sound from the ground up, quoting to Alternative Press as [...] "Taking out the Metalcore, and then adding the metal into hardcore, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> any sense." [...] (--Scott Danough, guitarist). [...] "I don't think this album sounds like anything else out there right now. We're {{very proud of that}} fact." [...] says guitarist Brian Leppke.|$|E
500|$|Paul Watson {{said he was}} not {{offended}} by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad [...] "Whale Whores" [...] brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience, as well as the role of the Japanese in the deaths. Watson said, [...] "It's a tough situation we are in. We can't hurt the whalers and we have to stay within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> us pussies, so be it. It's better than being portrayed as killers." [...] Watson said the episode failed to portray that his actions have hurt Japanese profits from whaling, but that the episode demonstrated how successful Whale Wars and the Sea Shepherd has been.|$|E

Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide also praised the musical number, saying [...] "that 'Midnight Train to Georgia' number {{at the end}} of tonight's episode... Wow. So out of nowhere and so fun." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that the episode [...] "was a good episode to go into the hiatus with, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> things better". He criticized the fact that the fictional TGS writing staff was not present in this episode, even though they could have been effectively used. Michael Neal of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a grading of A+. The Boston Globes Joanna Weiss reviewed the episode positively, saying [...] " [...] concluded with a musical interlude that was both hilarious and wistful".|$|E
500|$|... "Into the Groove" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and her then-boyfriend Stephen Bray. The singer had initially written the song for her friend Mark Kamins' protégée, Chyne, and recorded a demo which Kamins intended to modify later. However, Madonna {{believed that the}} song would be more suitable for her film Desperately Seeking Susan, and recorded it with Bray for the film's soundtrack. When Kamins {{found out he was}} furious that Madonna did not inform him that she would use the song for the film. The singer retorted: [...] "I'm tough, I'm ambitious and I know exactly what I want. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> me a bitch, that's okay." [...] "Into the Groove" [...] ultimately did not appear on the soundtrack album of the film, but was released on the 1985 worldwide re-issue of Madonna's second studio album, Like a Virgin.

2500|$|The avant-garde {{music video}} for [...] "Take Me Out", {{directed}} by Jonas Odell, {{was inspired by}} Dadaism (especially Max Ernst's Une Semaine de Bonté), Busby Berkeley choreographies and Russian constructivist design. Alex Kapranos explained the many and varied influences behind the 1930s-style promo for second single [...] "Take Me Out": [...] "It's kind of two dimensional in a three dimensional style <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> any sense. It's a montage of images; ourselves, pictures and things taken from other places and put together in a strange, abstract way. That's what gives the video that strange, jerky, style".|$|E
2500|$|Greene {{has stated}} that he sees science as {{incompatible}} with literalist interpretations of religion. He has argued that: [...] "But if you don't view God as the reservoir of temporary answers to issues we haven't solved scientifically, but rather as some overarching structure within which science takes place, and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> you happy and satisfied, so be it. I don't {{see the need for}} that; others do." [...] He has also stated that there is much in the New Atheism movement which resonates with him because he personally does not feel the need for religious explanation. However, he is uncertain of its efficacy as a strategy for spreading a scientific worldview.|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when I {{was visiting}} him in New York, 'I’ve {{always wanted to know}} what you would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity.

50|$|Peripherin, unlike keratin IFs, can self-assemble and {{exist as}} homopolymers (see polymer). They can also heteropolymerize, or co-assemble, with other type III {{proteins}} or the light neurofilament subunit (NF-L) to form intermediate filament networks. Type III proteins like peripherin can exist in different states within a cell. These states include nonfilamentous particles which combine to firm short IFs, or squiggles. These squiggles {{come together to}} form long <b>IFs</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> up cytoskeletal networks. Studies of network assembly in spreading fibroblasts and differentiating nerve cells show that particles move along microtubules in a kinesin and dynein-dependent manner, and as spreading continues, the particles polymerize into intermediate filaments.|$|R

2500|$|Pretty Little Liars {{opened with}} mixed reviews. Metacritic gave the pilot episode 52 out of 100, based upon 14 {{critical}} reviews. The New York Daily News gave the show a positive review, commenting that it [...] "makes most popular vampire romances look anemic", while concluding, [...] "Pretty Little Liars {{could go in}} several directions, including mundane teen clichés. It's got an equally good shot at making us care about these imperfect pretty girls." [...] A writer on Terror Hook has stated that [...] " [...] 'Pretty Little Liars' gets off to a very promising start. Great production all around, the writing keeps the viewer on their toes, and the acting just reinforces it. The overall mystery of the show in the end is dark and unpredictable, even stepping into the slasher film realm." [...] The New York Post gave the show three out of five stars, stating, [...] "OK, so we've established {{that there is no}} socially redeeming value in this series and that your kids shouldn't watch it if they are too young and impressionable. But if you can distract them enough to miss the first 15 minutes, the show isn't half-bad. Actually, it is half-good, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> sense."
