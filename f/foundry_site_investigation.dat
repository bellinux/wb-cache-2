40|$|One of {{the vital}} works before a {{construction}} begin was a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> {{which was the}} site exploration to gain the result for the soil characteristics at the construction area. By undergo some necessary required test such as deep borehole logs, water level measurement, JKR Probe, standard penetration test (SPT) and others, the engineers able to design a suitable, safety and economic structures for the building.

40|$|The <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> phase plays a {{vital role}} in any {{foundation}} design where inadequate characterisation of the subsurface conditions may lead to either a significantly over designed foundation that is not cost-effective, or an under-designed foundation, which may result in foundation failure. As such, the scope of an investigation should be dependent on the conditions at the site and the importance of the structure. However, it is common for the expense dedicated to the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> to be a fraction of the total cost of the project, and is typically determined by budget and time constraints, and the experience and judgement of the geotechnical engineer. However, additional <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> expenditure or sampling is expected to reduce the financial risk of the design by reducing the uncertainties in the geotechnical system and protecting against possible foundation failures. This research has quantified the relative benefits of undertaking <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> of increased and differing scope. This has been achieved by simulating the design process to yield a foundation design {{based on the results of}} a <b>site</b> <b>investigation.</b> Such a design has been compared to an optimal design that utilises the complete knowledge of the soil, which has only been possible due to the use of simulated soils. Comparisons between these two design types indicate the performance of the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> to accurately or adequately characterise the site conditions. Furthermore, the design based on the results of the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> have been analysed using the complete knowledge of the soil. This yields a probability of failure and, therefore, has been included in a risk analysis where the costs associated with the <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> have been measured against the financial risk of the design. As such, potential savings in financial risk for increased <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> expenditure have been subsequently identified. A Monte Carlo analysis has been used in this research to incorporate the uncertainties in the foundation design process. Uncertainties have been included due to soil variability; sampling errors; measurement and transformation model errors; and errors related to the use of a simplified foundation response prediction method. The Monte Carlo analysis has also provided the means to obtain results in a probabilistic framework to enable reliability and risk analyses. Computer code has been specifically developed with an aim to: generate a simulated soil that conforms to the variability of soil properties; simulate a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> to estimate data for a foundation design; simulate the design of a foundation and conduct a reliability and risk analysis of such a design. Results indicate that there are significant benefits to be derived from increasing the scope of a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> in terms of the risk and reliability of the foundation design. However, it also appears that an optimal <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> scope or expenditure exists where additional expenditure leads to a design with a higher financial risk due to the increased cost of the <b>site</b> <b>investigation.</b> The expected savings in terms of financial risk are significant when compared to the increased investigation cost. These results will assist geotechnical engineers in planning a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> in a more rational manner with knowledge of the associated risks. Thesis(Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis focuses on the quantification {{of the effect of}} limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> on the design and performance of pile foundations. Limited <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> {{is one of the main}} causes of structural foundation failures. Over the last 30 years, most <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> conducted for infrastructure projects have been dictated by minimum cost and time of completion, rather than meeting the need to appropriately characterise soil properties (Institution of Civil Engineers 1991; Jaksa et al. 2003). As a result, limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> remain common, resulting in a higher risk of structural foundation failure, unforeseen additional construction, and/or repair costs. Also, limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> can result in over-designing foundations, leading to increased and unnecessary cost (ASFE 1996). Based on the reliability examination method for <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> introduced by Jaksa et al. (2003) and performed by Goldsworthy (2006), this research investigated the effect of limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> on the design of pile foundations. This was achieved by generating three-dimensional random fields to obtain a virtual site consisting of soil properties at certain levels of variability, and by simulating various numbers of cone penetration tests (CPTs) and pile foundations on the generated site. Once the site and the CPTs were simulated, the cone tip resistance (qc) was profiled along the vertical and horizontal axes. The simulated qc profiles yielded by the CPTs were then used to compute axial pile load capacity termed the pile foundation design based on <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> (SI). In parallel, the axial pile load capacity of the simulated pile foundation utilising the “true” cone tip resistance along the simulated pile was also determined. This is termed “the true” design, or the benchmark pile foundation design, and referred to as pile foundation design based on complete knowledge (CK). At the end of this process, the research compared the pile foundation designs based on SI and those based on CK. The reliability of the foundation design based on SI was analysed with a probabilistic approach, using the Monte Carlo technique. The results indicated that limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> have a significant impact on the design of pile foundations. The results showed that minimum sampling efforts result in a high risk of over- or under-designing piles. More intensive sampling efforts, in contrast, led to a low risk of under- or over-design. The results also indicated that the levels of spatial variability of the soil are notable factors that affect the effectiveness of <b>site</b> <b>investigations.</b> These results will assist geotechnical engineers in planning a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> in a more rational manner with knowledge of the associated risks.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} causes of foundation failure is due to insufficient knowledge of ground conditions. Uncertainty in ground conditions can also cause significant cost overruns and time delays for both client and contractor. <b>Site</b> <b>investigations</b> aim to reduce the uncertainty of ground conditions by various combinations of field and laboratory testing. However, time and cost constraints, {{as well as the}} judgement and experience of the consulting geotechnical engineer, have traditionally governed the scope of such <b>site</b> <b>investigations.</b> Analyses have been undertaken to investigate the performance of various <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> schemes with respect to the cost of the resulting pad foundation system and the probability of failure.

40|$|When {{designing}} pile foundations, it {{is normal}} practice {{to perform a}} <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> in order to quantify the physical and engineering properties of the ground. Often, {{the scope of the}} <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> is dictated by construction time lines and budgetary constraints, rather than on the variability of the ground. It has been shown by a number of authors that as little as 0. 04 % – 0. 3 % of the total construction budget is spent on geotechnical <b>investigations.</b> Limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> have the potential to impact significantly on the success or otherwise of the completed project. These include cost over-runs, construction delays, foundation failure and over-design. It has been suggested that “You pay for a <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> whether you have one or not. ” This paper examines the influence of limited <b>site</b> <b>investigations</b> on the design and performance of pile foundations with respect to pile load capacity. This is achieved by carrying out 3 D numerical simulations within a Monte Carlo framework using varying numbers of cone penetration tests (CPTs) and the LCPC method for estimating pile load capacities. In this way, it is possible to determine the probabilities of design failure and pile over-design for a variety of <b>site</b> <b>investigation</b> scenarios represented by various numbers of the CPTs and levels of ground variability. It is observed, as expected, that the probability of pile foundation design failure and over-design decreases as the number of CPTs increases. It is also identified that after a certain number of CPTs, little benefit is derived from additional soundings. A. Arsyad, M. B. Jaksa, G. A. Fenton, W. S. Kaggw...|$|R
