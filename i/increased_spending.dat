5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 12th century, Southampton Castle was valued more for its role in coastal defence and as a coastal base for {{operations}} on the continent than for its value in ensuring internal security. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, and in 1187 the wooden keep was converted into a stone shell-keep. John <b>increased</b> <b>spending</b> on the castle during his reign. Royal visits to Southampton were quite common, and additional royal accommodation, called the King's House, was built outside the castle.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of <b>increased</b> <b>spending</b> on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{involved}} himself {{heavily in}} discussions over army reform, {{the need for}} which had become apparent with the failings of the Boer War. He supported the redesign of army command, {{the creation of the}} Territorial Force, and the decision to provide an Expeditionary Force supporting France in the event of war with Germany. Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the Imperial German Navy as a new strategic threat. Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, who favoured <b>increased</b> <b>spending</b> and a broad deployment, and the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir John Fisher, who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new dreadnoughts.|$|E

5|$|Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, {{which gave}} the party a {{majority}} in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, <b>increased</b> <b>spending</b> on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition of the planning commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.|$|E
5|$|Then-president Carlos Roberto Flores {{estimated}} that Mitch reversed 50years {{of progress in}} the country. Officials estimated it would take at least 15years to rebuild completely. The national gross domestic product (GDP) only grew {{at a rate of}} 3% due to the storm, compared with 5.1% in 1997, due to damaged infrastructure and lingering effects. In 1999, the economy of Honduras contracted by 1.9%, largely due to the storm. The Honduran government <b>increased</b> <b>spending</b> by 24.7%,. much of it emergency funds to restore communications and provide relief, which caused economic deficits. This caused inflation to increase from 13.6% to 15.7%. The Honduran government adjusted its economic plan, including privatization of various federal entities. For two years, the government temporarily halted taxes to businesses affected by the hurricane.|$|E

50|$|For fiscal policy, <b>increases</b> in {{government}} <b>spending</b> are expansionary, while decreases are contractionary. John Maynard Keynes {{was one of}} the first economists to advocate government deficit <b>spending</b> (<b>increased</b> government <b>spending</b> financed by borrowing) as part of the fiscal policy response to an economic contraction. According to Keynesian economics, <b>increased</b> government <b>spending</b> raises aggregate demand and increases consumption, which leads to increased production and faster recovery from recessions. Classical economists, on the other hand, believe that <b>increased</b> government <b>spending</b> exacerbates an economic contraction by shifting resources from the private sector, which they consider productive, to the public sector, which they consider unproductive.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} {{credit card debt}} affects consumer spending. In five experimental and field studies, the authors demonstrate that outstanding credit card debt <b>increases</b> <b>spending</b> for consumers with high self-control. They also show that this effect can be eliminated by increasing the available credit on the credit card. Thus, when the available credit is low, consumers with greater self-control <b>increase</b> <b>spending,</b> but when the available credit is high, they reduce spending. The results extend the literature on goal violation and self-control and offer insights into consumer decision making and consumption patterns under conditions of debt...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the overall {{benefits of the}} <b>increase</b> in <b>spending</b> on medical care in the 1990 s. The paper estimates the health capital of the Japanese population.
