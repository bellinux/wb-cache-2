50|$|The {{advantage}} of a spiral conveyor {{is that it can}} be used with a minimum amount of control software. The disadvantages are that a relatively large area (floor space) is required compared with other product lifts and vertical transport takes {{a great deal of time}} on account of the number of cycles which the transport belt completes. Certain products can also become misshapen since they are transported at an angle. One only has to think of plastic bottles which are wrapped in clingfilm which can become permanently misshapen if the clingfilm has still not completely cooled. A product is only supported at two angles on a spiral conveyor, because of the lifting angle and the radius within which the transport conveyor is placed. If a product has to be supported so that it is flat during transport, this will not be possible with a spiral conveyor. The drive motor of a spiral conveyor must always be controlled with a <b>frequency</b> <b>regulator</b> in order to prevent excessive slippage of the transport belt. It is also necessary to take account that products must not touch at intake. If products are touching each other at intake, the products can become jammed, which can result in the transport belt breaking down. It is, therefore, recommended that a good feed mechanism be provided for a spiral conveyor. In the case of most spiral conveyors, products must also be presented centrally, as the eccentric loading of spiral conveyors can cause excessive slippage. If a product becomes stuck for any reason, there is a good to a very good chance that the lamellae of the transport belt will disintegrate, which can cause a considerable loss in production along the whole of the production line, something which is associated with huge additional costs for replacements.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{organization}} of charge pump circuits {{based on a}} voltage doubler [2] that takes a DC input and outputs a doubled DC voltage. By cascading n multi-phase voltage doublers (MPVD), the resulting charge pump has the voltage gain equal to 2 n. It needs n clock pairs to control the pumping process. MPVD is a minimum capacitance realization of the switched-capacitor based voltage doubler. An n-stage MPVD needs n+ 1 capacitors and 2 n switches. To avoid the short circuit during switching, a clock pairs generator is used to achieve multi-phase non-overlapping clock pairs. A <b>frequency</b> <b>regulator</b> is designed to lower the charging frequency when the load becomes lighter, thus reducing the power loss during switching.

An incentive policy is created that encourages Electric Vehicles (EVs) to demand energy when non-EV demand is low and the electric generators are underutilized. EVs also act as <b>frequency</b> <b>regulators</b> which can control their participation role by modifying their respective payment rate wi. The proposed distributed recharging rate control algorithm can realize a Demand Management solution for EVs and does not require explicit real time communication from the electric generators or between the recharging sockets.

Mice of C 57 Bl/ 6 background showed the lowest levels of stem cells in marrow, averaging 2. 4 +/-. 06 LTC-IC/ 10 (5) cells, BALB/c is intermediate (9. 1 +/- 4. 2 / 10 (5) cells), and DBA/ 2 mice contained a 11 -fold higher frequency of LTC-IC (28. 1 +/- 16. 5 / 10 (5) cells) than C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. The genetic factors affecting the size of the stem cell pool were analyzed in the C 57 Bl/ 6 X DBA/ 2 recombinant inbred strains; LTC-IC frequencies ranged widely, indicating that stem cell frequencies are controlled by multiple genes. Quantitative trait linkage analysis suggested that two loci that have major quantitative effects are located on chromosome 1 near Adprp and Acrg, respectively. The mapping of the locus near Adprp was confirmed by finding an elevated stem cell frequency in B 6.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2017 Isolated coastal {{utilities}} in Arctic villages commonly use a mix {{of diesel}} and wind power to provide electrical service to their consumers. It is common for such communities to experience periods of high wind generation for which no immediate demand exists and either waste, curtail, or poorly utilize the surplus. The objective of the present work is to explore (through mathematical and numerical modelling) the technical feasibility of and optimization strategies for distributing this excess wind energy as domestic space heat {{for use as a}} cleaner, more economical alternative to fossil fuels. Autonomously controlled Electric Thermal Storage (ETS) devices are considered as a solution to decouple the supply of excess wind power with domestic heat demand without the need for communication infrastructure or a second distribution circuit. First, using numerical heat transfer analysis, it is shown that the performance of an ETS heater core can be generalized and expressed in terms of its physical properties and simple geometric dimensions {{in such a way as}} to inform system sizing and economic performance studies for prospective applications. Furthermore, a collection of autonomous ETS units is shown (using a full-scale lab-validated mathematical model) to possess the ability to assume the role of partial and/or sole <b>frequency</b> <b>regulator</b> on a hybrid wind-diesel system. Several design changes are proposed, which render the commercially-available units more amenable to frequency regulation.

Factor analysis of 17 morphological measures produced three morphological factors: factor of mesoectoendomorphy (general morphological factor) and factor of pronounced endomorphy, i. e. excessive adipose tissue, along with low skeleton longitudinality. Factor analysis of 16 motor variables yielded four motor factors: factor of general motoricity; factor integrating leg flexibility and arm explosiveness; factor juxtaposing body flexibility and repetitive leg strength; and factor predominantly defining leg movement frequency. Three significant canonical correlations, i. e. linear combinations, explained the association between the set of six latent variables of the morphological and basic motor system, and five variables assessing the knowledge in competitive gymnastics.

One way to reduce the possibilities of LCOs is to employ a high resolution Digital Pulse-Width-Modulator (DPWM). However, designing such a DPWM which can meet the requirements of VRMs application requires ultra-high system clock frequency, up to several GHz.
