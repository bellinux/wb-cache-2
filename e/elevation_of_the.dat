5|$|The primary {{instruments}} aboard CryoSat-2 are SIRAL-2, the SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeters; {{which uses}} radar to determine and monitor the spacecraft's altitude {{in order to}} measure the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice. Unlike the original CryoSat, two SIRAL instruments are installed aboard CryoSat-2, with one serving as a backup in case the other fails.|$|E
5|$|After Celestine's death Theobald {{returned}} to England, stopping at St Denis Abbey in Paris to help Suger, the abbot, consecrate the newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars. Theobald {{was the only}} bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in France. Meanwhile, Henry of Blois had arrived in Rome and begun negotiations with the new pope, Lucius II, over the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bishopric of Winchester to an archbishopric. It appears that Lucius appointed a legate, Cardinal Icmar, the Bishop of Tusculum, to travel to England and oversee the project, but Lucius died before anything was accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and moving it to higher ground. Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital. However, the process of moving the capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. Belmopan became {{the capital city of}} British Honduras in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. <b>Elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|On- and off-ramps project northward from Eastern Avenue, each {{adding a}} lane to both carriageways. The {{expressway}} continues northward, with the Don River sandwiched between {{the highway and}} Bayview Avenue. The Parkway passes beneath Dundas and Gerrard Streets and rises onto the 'Don Flats' plateau at Riverdale Park. In this section, the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway {{is close to the}} level of the river and is liable to flood after heavy rains, as occurred in June 2010, for example.|$|E

5|$|Placed symmetrically in {{the north}} and south sides of the church are two nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows. Between the two windows on the church's north {{elevation}} is an exterior concrete block chimney. The layout of the east-facing rear <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church is also symmetrical, and features three nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, with the center window placed above and between the other two windows. The church's windows have been repaired using materials consistent with original construction.|$|E
5|$|Ravenscroft {{commissioned}} the architect Thomas Edward Knightley {{to design the}} new hall. Using a floor plan previously prepared by C. J. Phipps, Knightley designed a hall with a floor area of 21,000 square feet (2,000 m²) and an audience capacity of 2,500. Contemporary newspapers commented on the unusual <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, with the grand tier at street level, and the stalls and arena downstairs. The exterior carving was by Sidney W. Elmes and Son, and the furnishing was by Lapworth Brothers and Harrison. The lighting {{was a combination of}} gas and electricity.|$|E
5|$|The Kibble balance {{requires}} extremely {{precise measurement}} of the local gravitational acceleration g in the laboratory, using a gravimeter. For instance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309µGal per metre when the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center of the gravimeter {{differs from that of}} the nearby test mass in the Kibble balance; a change in the weight of a one-kilogram test mass that equates to about 316µg/m.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation. For example, {{the foothills of}} the Himalayas, the Dooars, are densely wooded with sal and other tropical evergreen trees. Above an <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> , <b>the</b> forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above , temperate forest trees such as oaks, conifers, and rhododendrons predominate.|$|E
5|$|West fronts {{in general}} take three {{distinct}} forms: those that follow the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave and aisles, {{those that have}} paired towers {{at the end of}} each aisle, framing the nave, and those that screen the form of the building. The west front at Wells has the paired-tower form, unusual in that the towers do not indicate the location of the aisles, but extend well beyond them, screening the dimensions and profile of the building.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E

5|$|Another refit {{followed}} on 12 December 1925– 11 July 1927. The <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{main battery}} guns was again increased, the bow {{section of the}} belt armor was removed, and half of her boilers were converted to oil-firing models. A third and final modernization began on 20 September 1931 and lasted until 20 August 1934. The rest of the coal-fired boilers were replaced with six Indret oil-fired boilers, new turbines and main battery guns were installed, along with eight new 75mm anti-aircraft guns. After emerging from the refit, Provence and Bretagne {{were assigned to the}} 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast to southeast. The graveyard also abuts the northeastern <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community building. Its interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. The graveyard is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an electrochemist at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing, is interred at the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish loggia {{on the southwest}} <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Bottomley was able to incorporate the existing parapets, finials and pierced railings and posts from the north library bay windows into the loggia design, with a ceiling reconstructed from a sixteenth-century house {{on the grounds of}} a manor in Knole, Kent, England. Wall tiles were used which indicated use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his loggia was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of picturesqueness and romance {{that the rest of the}} house displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the loggia was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for his drawings and construction.|$|E

50|$|Earth-sheltered {{buildings}} {{consist of}} one or more of three types: earth-covered, earth-bunded, and subterranean. An earth-covered building is one where the thermally effective element is placed solely on the roof, but is more usually a continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth-bunding at <b>the</b> unexposed <b>elevations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. An earth-bunded building is one where the thermally significant element insulates one or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheltered <b>elevations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The bunding can be partial or total. A subterranean building is one where the thermally significant element insulates all <b>elevations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, leaving only the roof exposed; or, if the building is built into an incline, {{it may be that the}} roof is covered and only one elevation is left exposed.|$|R

5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} of Manjakamiadana was divided into two vast rooms with {{furniture}} and decor that reflected European influence but with placement of objects respecting the norms of Malagasy cosmology. Following the reign of RadamaII, the building was no longer inhabited but instead was reserved for state occasions. The northernmost of these two rooms {{was the site of}} the signing of important trade treaties with British and American dignitaries. It was also opened annually for the celebration of the Fandroana (Royal Bath) ceremony. Following the imposition of French colonial rule, Manjakamiadana was transformed in 1897 into L'Ecole Le Myre de Vilers (Le Myre de Vilers School), a training centre for Malagasy civil servants employed by the French colonial regime. When the purpose of the building changed, the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main hall's floor was raised by building a platform on top of the original wooden floor.|$|E
