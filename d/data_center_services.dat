40|$|Abstract — With {{the growing}} {{trend in the}} amount of power {{consumed}} by <b>data</b> <b>centers,</b> finding ways to cut their electricity bills has become an important and challenging problem. In this paper, our focus is on the cost reduction that <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> may achieve by exploiting the diversity in the price of electricity in day-ahead and real-time electricity markets. Based on a stochas-tic optimization framework, we propose to jointly select a <b>data</b> <b>center’s</b> <b>service</b> rate and its power demand bids to the day-ahead and real-time electricity markets. In our analysis, we take into account service-level-agreements, risk management constraints, and statistical characteristics of workload and electricity prices. Using empirical electricity price and Internet workload data and through computer simulations, we show that by directly participating in the day-ahead and real-time electricity markets, <b>data</b> <b>centers</b> can significantly reduce their energy expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Thread {{scheduling}} in multi-core {{systems is}} a challenging problem because cores {{on a single}} chip usually share parts of the memory hierarchy, such as last-level caches, prefetchers and memory controllers, making threads running on different cores interfere with each other while competing for these resources. <b>Data</b> <b>center</b> <b>service</b> providers are interested in compressing the workload onto as few computing units as possible so as to utilize its resources most efficiently and conserve power. However, because memory hierarchy interference between threads is not managed by commercial operating systems, the <b>data</b> <b>center</b> operators still prefer running threads on different chips {{so as to avoid}} possible performance degradation due to interference. In this work, we improved the system’s throughput by minimizing inter-workload contention for memory hierarchy resources. W...|$|R
