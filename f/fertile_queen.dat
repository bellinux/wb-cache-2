25|$|In {{pharaoh ant}} colonies new males and queen ants can be {{produced}} when the existing <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> is removed. When queens are absent, the workers in the nest can do two things: either rear existing sexual larvae or transport sexual larvae from other bud nests or from the main nest to its own nest. However, when there are fertile queens still within the nest, the worker ants will cannibalize the sexual larvae and will either reject or consume sexual larvae from other nests. On the other hand, the worker ants will always accept and nurture worker larvae from other nests. Furthermore, according to Schmidt et al., polygamous species such as pharaoh ants will have higher resource allocations towards the female caste instead of the worker caste to ensure rapid growth of new budding colonies.|$|E

In 1987, 400 queens from a mating flight were marked with a durable paint and released in an area heavily populated with the polygynous form. None were recaptured after one week, but 9 months later, 4 clearly-marked queens were found in a nest 65 meters from their release point. This finding clearly points to adoption. About 5 weeks later, 37 of 107 <b>fertile</b> <b>queens</b> collected from 37 polygynous nests, were found to have partially histolyzed wing muscles and undeveloped ovaries. Mating flights had occurred a few days prior to the queen collections, thus it was apparent that these queens were newly adopted.

The results of our 3 studies clearly indicate that polygynous S. invicta can proliferate and perpetuate their colonies by queen adoption...|$|R

Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen.

Observation of the ovarian development and spermathecae indicates that 13 queens had copulated and ovary did not show morphological differences among them.

50|$|Like most eusocial organisms, {{reproduction}} in D. laevigatus {{is handled}} by the reproductive caste, {{made up of the}} sole <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> and her consort males. Because the queens are largely immobile, they cannot participate in a nuptial flight in order to found new colonies. Like all other driver and army ants, D. laevigatus colonies reproduce via colony fission. Males leave the nest at an early age and seek one out again upon reaching maturity. Males of typical surface-forgaging driver ants locate the nests via chemical smells. The mechanism by which the subterranean D. laevigatus male finds the underground nests of his species is still unknown. When he reaches the nest, his wings are torn off and he is carried to a newly grown virgin queen who is bred when the colony reaches a threshold size. The queen mates with the male and the colony then splits, with many workers carrying the newly <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> off to establish a new colony. There is some evidence that D. laevigatus will undergo multiple matings under lab conditions, but this has never been tested in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Colony {{foundation}} in L. apiculatum is by haplometrosis (non-cooperative), that is, a single <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> founds each colony. Colony foundation {{behavior is not}} uniform among founding queens. The time spent exploring, excavating, and removing excavated materials and waste are usually higher throughout the day, while oviposition, brood care, and inactivity increase at night. Founding queens prefer sites close to bodies of water; however, sites slightly further from water are more conducive {{to the establishment of}} a successful colony as persistently high humidity will result in the early death of a colony due to fungal invasion.|$|E
50|$|S.saevissima, {{similar to}} the other social insects in the order Hymenoptera, is eusocial: an extreme form of kin {{selection}} in which {{members of a group}} willingly give up their reproductive abilities in favor of the reproductive success of their close relatives. For S. saevissima, the workers are all sterile female daughters who dedicate their lives to the caring and protection of their future sisters: the broods of the <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> (their mother). In eusociality, the sterile ants often perform specialized tasks to effectively care for the reproductive queen, including group defense and self-sacrifices.|$|E
50|$|Colony {{foundation}} in L. luctuosum is by pleometrosis (cooperative), in which 2 to 40 <b>fertile</b> <b>queens</b> found a single colony. Most colony foundation activities {{take place at}} night. There is a division of labor among founder queens. However, {{this is not always}} divided the same for each foundation event. The amount of time dedicated to each activity by each queen varies with each colony foundation event. Some queens are active in a variety of tasks. For example, some queens dedicate more time to brood care and others more time patrolling the nest area. The fewer ants founding together (3 or less), the more time spent per individual caring for brood, ovipositing, and exploring. Trophallaxis, patrol activity, and inactivity decreases in these cases, but brood care still remains the primary activity of founding queens.|$|R
40|$|Pheromones {{are likely}} {{involved}} in all social activities of social insects including foraging, sexual behavior, defense, nestmate recognition, and caste regulation.

The recent identification of a termite queen pheromone and subsequent studies have elucidated the multifaceted roles of volatile pheromones, including functions such as a fertility signal, worker attractant, queen-queen communication signal, and antimicrobial agent.

40|$|Social insects usually live in colonies {{comprising}} {{one or a}} {{small number}} of reproductive individuals and a few or large number of sterile individuals. In termites only, both sexes are represented among the reproductives as well as among the sterile workers. In other social insects, namely ants, bees, and wasps, males do not participate significantly in the social life of colonies, which involves primarily the <b>fertile</b> <b>queens</b> and sterile female workers (Wilson 1971). The haplodiploid genetic system found universally in the Hymenoptera creates an asymmetry in genetic relatedness such that a female is more closely related to her full sister (coefficient of genetic relatedness, r = 0. 75) than to her offspring (r = 0. 5). This makes inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 19640, b) particularly applicable to the evolution of sterile worker castes in the social hymenoptera (Wilson 1971; Hamilton 1972) ...|$|R

Thus, the parasitic queen has very limited scope for producing alates to secure the next generation, as this time span is often only 2-3 years or fewer. As a result, even within its well-established range, T. atratulum is very scarce, with only a tiny proportion of Tetramorium sp. colonies playing host to this parasite.|$|E

Carpenter ants are described as oligogynous because they have a number of <b>fertile</b> <b>queens</b> which are intolerant of each other and must therefore spread to different areas of the nest. Some aggressive interactions have been known to take place between queens, but not necessarily through workers. Queens become aggressive mainly to other queens if they trespass on a marked territory.

50|$|A queen ant (formally {{known as}} a gyne) is an adult, {{reproducing}} female ant in an ant colony; generally she will be {{the mother of all}} the other ants in that colony. Some female ants, such as Cataglyphis cursor, do not need to mate to produce offspring, reproducing through asexual parthenogenesis or cloning, and all of those offspring will be female. Others, like those in the genus Crematogaster, undergo mating in a nuptial flight. Ant offspring develop from larvae specially fed in order to become sexually mature among most species. Depending on the species, there can be either a single mother queen, or potentially, hundreds of <b>fertile</b> <b>queens</b> in some species. Queen ants have one of the longest life-spans of any known insect - up to 30 years. A queen of Lasius niger was held in captivity by German entomologist Hermann Appel for 28¾ years; also a Pogonomyrmex owyheei has a maximum estimated longevity of 30 years in the field.|$|R

5000|$|When {{a colony}} accidentally loses its queen, {{it is said}} to be [...] "queenless". The workers realize that the queen is absent after as little as an hour, as her pheromones fade in the hive. The colony cannot survive without a <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> laying eggs to renew the population, so the workers select cells {{containing}} eggs aged less than three days and enlarge these cells dramatically to form [...] "emergency queen cells". These appear similar to large peanut-like structures about an inch long that hang from the center or side of the brood combs. The developing larva in a queen cell is fed differently from an ordinary worker-bee; in addition to the normal honey and pollen, she receives a great deal of royal jelly, a special food secreted by young [...] "nurse bees" [...] from the hypopharyngeal gland. This special food dramatically alters the growth and development of the larva so that, after metamorphosis and pupation, it emerges from the cell as a queen bee. The queen is the only bee in a colony which has fully developed ovaries, and she secretes a pheromone which suppresses the normal development of ovaries in all her workers.|$|E
50|$|Development from egg to {{emerging}} bee varies among queens, workers, and drones. Queens emerge from their cells in 15-16 days, workers in 21 days, and drones in 24 days. Only one queen is usually {{present in a}} hive. New virgin queens develop in enlarged cells through differential feeding of royal jelly by workers. When the existing queen ages or dies or the colony becomes very large, a new queen is raised by the worker bees. When the hive is too large the old Queen will take half the hive and half the reserves with her in a swarm. This occurs a few days prior to the new queen hatching. If there are several Queen cells that were made then it means war. If several emerge they will begin piping (a high buzzing noise) signaling their location for the other virgin Queens to come fight. Once there is only one, she will go around the hive chewing the sides of any other cells and stinging and killing the would be queens. The virgin queen takes one or several nuptial flights. This is where the drone makes his entrance. They all leave the hive when the Queen is ready and mate, their member gets stuck in the Queen breaks off, then they fall to their death while another drone bee flies up removes the appendage and inserts his {{to do the same}} thing. She mates once she is established, and begins laying eggs. A <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> is able to lay fertilized or unfertilized eggs. Each unfertilized egg contains a unique combination of 50% of the queen's genes and develops into a haploid drone. The fertilized eggs develop into either diploid workers or virgin queens (but only if exclusively fed royal jelly).|$|E

We show that silencing the expression of DNA methyltransferase Dnmt 3, a key driver of epigenetic global reprogramming, in newly hatched larvae led to a royal jelly–like effect on the larval developmental trajectory; the majority of Dnmt 3 small interfering RNA–treated individuals emerged as queens with fully developed ovaries. Our results suggest that DNA methylation in Apis is used for storing epigenetic information, {{that the use of}} that information can be differentially altered by nutritional input, and that the flexibility of epigenetic modifications underpins, profound shifts in developmental fates, with massive implications for reproductive and behavioral status. Manyorganisms respond to environmen-tal conditions by displaying phenotyp-ic plasticity, that is, producing different phenotypes from the same DNA genome (1, 2).

40|$|Female ant larvae develop either into sterile workers or, {{when they}} receive extra nutrition, into <b>fertile</b> <b>queens.</b> Larvae are thus {{expected}} {{to maximize their}} fitness by acquiring as much food as possible. However, immobile ant larvae are totally dependent on worker care and have only one option for the manipulation of their food intake, begging. Until now {{it was unclear whether}} larvae show begging behaviour at all and how workers respond to this. We identified begging behaviour by quantitative correlation of larval behaviours with the frequency of feeding received from workers in experimental groups of the ant Myrmica rubra. Hungry larvae can attract feeding from workers by keeping their head bent upwards, in a stretch position. This position is assumed without previous contact with workers (non-induced). Although head movements of the larvae co-vary with adoption of the stretch position, we argue that they do not play a role in begging, as larvae that attract more feedings also prolong their stay in the stretch position. Furthermore, in those experimental groups where workers fed the larvae frequently, larvae showed this begging behaviour less often. status: publishe...|$|R

We have found that a single genomic element marked by the protein-encoding gene Gp- 9 is responsible for the existence of two distinct forms of social organization in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. This genetic factor influences the reproductive phenotypes and behavioral strategies of queens and determines whether workers tolerate a single <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> or multiple queens per colony. Furthermore, this factor affects worker tolerance of queens with alternate genotypes, thus explaining the dramatic differences in Gp- 9 allele frequencies observed between the two social forms in the wild.

As yet, the molecular determinants that initiate this shift in worker fertility are still poorly documented. By using RNA interference we here demonstrate that the knockdown of epidermal growth factor receptor, a gene which was previously shown {{to be involved in}} queen-worker caste differentiation, also induces reproduction in worker honeybees (Apis mellifera).

40|$|Queen pheromones, which {{signal the}} {{presence}} of a <b>fertile</b> <b>queen</b> and induces daughter workers to remain sterile, are considered to {{play a key role in}} regulating the reproductive division of labour of insect societies. Although queen pheromones were long thought to be highly taxon-specific, recent studies have shown that structurally related long-chain hydrocarbons act as conserved queen signals across several independently evolved lineages of social insects. These results imply that social insect queen pheromones are very ancient and likely derived from an ancestral signalling system that was already present in their common solitary ancestors. Based on these new insights, we here speculate on what signal precursors social insect queen pheromones may have evolved from and provide compelling evidence that these pheromones should best be seen as honest signals of fertility as opposed to suppressive agents that chemically sterilize the workers against their own best interests. status: publishe...|$|E

The evolutionary origin and maintenance of such sterile workers remains an enduring puzzle in insect sociobiology.

The wasps differed greatly both in the time taken to develop their ovaries and in the magnitude of ovarian development despite having similar access to resources. All females started with no ovarian development at day zero, and the percentage of individuals with at least one oocyte at any stage of development increased gradually across age, reached 100 % at 100. days and decreased slightly thereafter. Approximately 40 % of the females failed to develop ovaries within the average ecological lifespan of the species. Age, body size and adult feeding rate, when considered together, were the most important factors governing ovarian development. We suggest that such flexibility and variation in the potential and timing of reproductive development may physiologically predispose females to accept worker roles and thus provide a gateway to worker ontogeny and the evolution of sociality...|$|R
