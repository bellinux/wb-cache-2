40|$|Understanding of <b>ecologic</b> <b>factors</b> favoring {{emergence}} {{and maintenance}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses is limited. Although low pathogenic avian influenza viruses persist and evolve in wild populations, HPAI viruses evolve in domestic birds and cause economically serious epizootics that only occasionally infect wild populations. We propose that evolutionary ecology considerations can explain this apparent paradox. Host structure and transmission possibilities differ considerably between wild and domestic birds {{and are likely to}} be major determinants of virulence. Because viral fitness is highly dependent on host survival and dispersal in nature, virulent forms are unlikely to persist in wild populations if they kill hosts quickly or affect predation risk or migratory performance.

However, oropharyngeal shedding and transmission by aerosols appear more efficient for HPAI viruses among domestic birds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – A {{number of}} virologic and {{environmental}} factors {{are involved in the}} emergence and re-emergence of viral disease. Viruses do not conservatively occupy a single and permanent ecological niche. Rather, due to their intrinsic capacity for genetic change, and to the evolvability of fitness levels, viruses display a potential to parasitize alternative host species. Mutation, recombination and genome segment reassortment, and combination of these molecular events, produce complex and phenotypically diverse populations of viruses, which constitute the raw material on which selection acts. The majority of emerging viral diseases of humans have a zoonotic origin. Sociologic and <b>ecologic</b> <b>factors</b> produce diverse and changing environments in which viral subpopulations have ample opportunities to be selected from intrinsically heterogeneous viral populations, particularly in the case of RNA viruses. In this manner, new human, animal and plant viruses have emerged periodically and, from all evidence, will continue to emerge.

Attempts at delimiting culture areas in Asia by simi-lar procedures have proved extremely difficult (Bacon 1946, Kroeber 1947, Miller 1953), since the distribution of cultural types, ethnic groups, and nat-ural areas rarely coincide. Coon (1951) speaks of Middle Eastern society as being built on a mosaic principle-many ethnic groups with radically dif-ferent cultures co-reside in an area in symbiotic relations of variable intimacy. Referring to a similar structure, Furnivall (1944) describes the Netherlands Indies as a plural society. The common characteristic in these two cases is the combination of ethnic segmentation and economic interdependence. Thus the “environment ” of any one ethnic group is not only defined by natural condi-tions, but also by the presence and activities of the other ethnic groups on which it depends.

40|$|Twenty-two Costa Rican dairy herds were {{actively}} monitored for vesicular diseases between November 1991 and March 1992, {{in anticipation of}} the annual dry season occurrence of vesicular stomatitis (VS). Thirty-nine confirmed cases of VS were concentrated on nine farms, resulting in an average herd incidence rate of 11. 1 % of mature cattle for the affected farms, or 2. 6 % for all farms. Affected cattle were generally older (average age = 5. 4 years), with seven-year-old cows having the highest age-specific incidence rate (6. 5 %). The New Jersey serotype of VS was diagnosed for all but four cases, primarily manifesting as teat vesicles. Cases had high acute and convalescent antibody titers for both major VS serotypes, New Jersey and Indiana, with significant titer increases after clinical disease. Screening and multiple variable regression analyses of 140 cow, farm, and ecologic variables revealed that clinical disease was significantly associated with cows being in lactation, and with higher acute antibody titers to serotype Indiana, but not with any predisposing diseases. Significant farm factors were the presence of poultry and a longer calving interval on the farm, but not higher rates of other diseases. According to a prior epidemiologic hypothesis, two <b>ecologic</b> <b>factors</b> were forced to be included into the farm model: the reported presence of sand flies, and a higher proportion of the farm being in forest land, with subsequent stepwise regression. The resulting model containing only the two forced variables was significant (P < 0. 003) and correctly classified 78 % of farms into the correct group, as compared with 79 % for the final stepwise model.

40|$|BACKGROUND Prevalence {{rates of}} child maltreatment (CM) can differ {{substantially}} between countries and ethnicities. Reasons, however, {{are complex and}} not sufficiently understood. METHOD This epidemiological study examined prevalence and risk factors of various types of CM in a population-based representative sample of native and immigrant adolescents in Switzerland (N = 6, 787). RESULTS The prevalence of CM in general was lowest in the native group, higher in the Western immigrant group, and highest in the non-Western immigrant groups. An immigrant background was related to an overrepresentation of several risk factors for CM. Adjusted odds ratio of an immigrant background were still significant for physical and emotional abuse but not for neglect and sexual assault. CONCLUSIONS Differences in the prevalence of CM across ethnographic origins are at least partially related to socioeconomic and <b>ecologic</b> risk <b>factors.</b> The distribution of risk factors may {{vary depending on the}} contexts of migration...|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} has examined {{the hypothesis that the}} well-being of individuals is shaped not just by the absolute level of resources available to them but also the level of resources available to them relative to others in their cohort or community. Several causal pathways have been hypothesized to explain associations between relative social position and health. For example, greater community income could increase the overall availability of health care in a community or decrease the availability for people for any given level of individual income. Relative social position could also create stress, resulting in adverse health outcomes through increased hypertension and other pathways. We explore yet another pathway by which relative social position may affect health. Specifically, to the extent that norms about physical appearance might be shaped by one's observations of others, we examine whether obesity might constitute another physiologic pathway by which community attributes could influence aspects of individual health, such as hypertension. We examine this hypothesis in rural China, where income often limits food intake so that, if community norms are an important determinant of individual obesity, higher community income could increase the obesity rate in a community and therefore change norms about obesity. These norms, in turn, could increase individuals' chances of being obese given their income. To test this hypothesis, we use multilevel linear probability models {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>ecologic</b> <b>factors,</b> i. e., relative income and income inequality, and health risk factors, i. e., obesity and hypertension among a sample of Chinese adults interviewed in four waves over 9 years. The results suggest that, among rural Chinese residents, increasing community average income and income inequality are positively associated with both obesity and hypertension. However, the effect of relative income on hypertension is not accounted for by increases in obesity. We did not find a strong relationship between socioeconomic conditions and the health risk factors among urban residents, where norms might be likely to be less strongly influenced by local attributes. Hence, the present study provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that relative income and income inequality affect obesity and hypertension, but no evidence that the effects on hypertension operated through effects on obesity.

The types of control measures depend on the setting (such as epidemiologic, <b>ecologic,</b> and cultural <b>factors).</b> Strict control of the growth and sale of watercress and other edible water plants is important. Individual people can protect themselves by not eating raw watercress and other water plants, especially from endemic grazing areas.
