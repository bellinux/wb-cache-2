40|$|The article {{presents}} the methods, mathematical model and its software implementation for calculating the efficiency indicators of visual and hardware search and detection of <b>ground</b> <b>objects</b> from the aircraft. The methods {{differ from the}} known ones in that they use modern information technologies and are adapted to solve practical test problems. In addition, finding values of the visual detection probability of <b>ground</b> <b>objects</b> in full-scale experiments is unrealizable due to the huge amount of required expenses. The proposed method allows estimating a particular efficiency indicator of an aircraft when searching for <b>ground</b> <b>objects</b> in the flight tests – the yield on a generic object. The developed mathematical model {{takes into account the}} known range of object detection by its linear dimensions. The software implementation allows performing calculations for different values of the meteorological situation. The convergence of simulation results and flight experiments is estimated. To determine the convergence, the results obtained in real flight tests on proof ground with different meteorological conditions were compared with the results of calculations obtained by modeling. The relative discrepancy between the indicators obtained in the flight experiment and calculated by the developed program is less than 5 %. The author proposes new private efficiency indicators for the visual detection task of typical <b>ground</b> <b>objects.</b> This is the area of possible detection of the <b>ground</b> <b>object</b> and the area of guaranteed access to it. These indicators allow performing a comparative assessment of the capabilities of aircraft to detect <b>ground</b> <b>objects</b> in tests. These indicators, unlike the known ones, have greater visibility and informational content. The developed computer program reduces the time spent by the tester on the calculation of indicators and the preparation of materials to the act by 3 times due to automation and usability. It allows us to perform calculations by varying any indicators on which the probability of detecting a typical <b>ground</b> <b>object</b> in the wide range of their change depends on. </p...|$|R

40|$|Evidence from {{behavioral}} experiments {{suggests that}} insects use the skyline as a cue for visual navigation. However, changes of lighting conditions, over hours, days or possibly seasons, significantly affect {{the appearance of}} the sky and <b>ground</b> <b>objects.</b> One possible solution to this problem is to extract the “skyline” by an illumination-invariant classification of the environment into two classes, <b>ground</b> <b>objects</b> and sky. In a previous study (Insect models of illumination-invariant skyline extraction from UV (ultraviolet) and green channels), we examined the idea of using two different color channels available for many insects (UV and green) to perform this segmentation. We found out that for suburban scenes in temperate zones, where the skyline is dominated by trees and artificial objects like houses, a “local” UV segmentation with adaptive thresholds applied to individual images leads to the most reliable classification. Furthermore, a “global” segmentation with fixed thresholds (trained on an image dataset recorded over several days) using UV-only information is only slightly worse compared to using both the UV and green channel. In this study, we address three issues: First, to enhance the limited range of environments covered by the dataset collected in the previous study, we gathered additional data samples of skylines consisting of minerals (stones, sand, earth) as <b>ground</b> <b>objects.</b> We could show that also for mineral-rich environments, UV-only segmentation achieves a quality comparable to multi-spectral (UV and green) segmentation. Second, we collected a wide variety of <b>ground</b> <b>objects</b> to examine their spectral characteristics under different lighting conditions. On the one hand, we found that the special case of diffusely-illuminated minerals increases the difficulty to reliably separate <b>ground</b> <b>objects</b> from the sky. On the other hand, the spectral characteristics of this collection of <b>ground</b> <b>objects</b> covers well with the data collected in the skyline databases, increasing, due to the increased variety of <b>ground</b> <b>objects,</b> the validity of our findings for novel environments. Third, we collected omnidirectional images, as often used for visual navigation tasks, of skylines using an UV-reflective hyperbolic mirror. We could show that “local” separation techniques can be adapted to the use of panoramic images by splitting the image into segments and finding individual thresholds for each segment. Contrarily, this is not possible for ‘global’ separation techniques...|$|R

40|$|Annual Assembly of Chinese Meteorological Society, Xian, China, 2 - 4 November 2016 This paper {{presents}} a macroscopic physical model that can simulate an upward leader initiated from a tall grounded object under thunderclouds. Based on a tri-layer leader channel {{structure and the}} energy conservation law, a new equation for estimating the upward leader propagation speed is proposed. Equations for modeling other physical parameters, such as the leader line charge density, leader core radius, leader corona sheath radius, leader current, leader electric field and leader conductance, are also proposed. Besides, a set of initiation and survival criteria for a steady self-initiated upward leader from a tall grounded object is suggested. Based on the suggested criteria and the proposed model, the critical corona and charge amount {{as well as the}} minimum height for successful initiation of an upward positive leader (UPL) from a tall grounded object are evaluated and discussed. The model is then used to investigate the general properties of UPLs self-initiated from tall <b>grounded</b> <b>objects</b> with and without the effect of corona space charge layer near the ground under different thunderstorm conditions. The modelling results can well explain the leader properties observed in literature. The model is further tested with two set of experiment data and very promising results are obtained.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis aims at investigating the attachment of lightning flashes to wind turbines. Modern wind turbines are highly exposed to lightning strikes, due to the increase of their height and {{the rotation of the}} blades. Upward lightning is the dominant mechanism of lightning strikes to them. Therefore, this study evaluates the initiation of the initial upward leader discharge and the process of lightning attachment of dart leaders taking place prior to the first return stroke in upward flashes. This work extends the self-consistent leader inception and propagation model (SLIM) to evaluate the lightning attachment of dart and dart-stepped leaders to <b>grounded</b> <b>objects.</b> SLIM was originally proposed to evaluate the lightning attachment of stepped leaders. Unlike the well-studied lightning attachment of stepped leaders, upward connecting leaders initiated in response to dart and dart-stepped leaders develop under a significantly faster change of the ambient electric field. Additionally, these connecting leaders could develop in warm air pre-conditioned by the previous strokes in the same flash. An analytical expression to evaluate the charge required to thermalize the connecting leader per unit length is also developed in the extended model. This model is validated through the analysis of three attachment events recorded in rocket-triggered lightning experiments. Good agreement between the predicted properties of the upward leaders and the measurements has been found. The model is utilized to evaluate the different conditions where connecting leaders can develop prior to the return strokes in upward lightning. The extended model of SLIM is also applied to study the interception of lightning dart leaders by upward connecting leaders initiated from wind turbines. The evaluation considers the influence of the return stroke peak current, the blade rotation and wind on the attachment of lightning dart leaders to wind turbines. The probability of lightning strikes to the receptors along the blade and on the nacelle is calculated for upward lightning flashes. It is shown that the lightning attachment of dart leaders is a mechanism that can explain the lightning damages to the inboard region of the blades (more than 10 meters from the tip) and the nacelle of wind turbines. Furthermore, the critical stabilization electric field required to initiate upward lightning from wind turbines is evaluated for both ‘self-initiated’ and ‘other-triggered’ upward flashes. The calculation shows that the stabilization electric field of an operating wind turbine periodically changes due to the rotation of its blades.  The initiation of upward lightning is greatly facilitated by the electric field change produced by nearby lightning events. However, the rate of rise of the electric field only has a weak impact on the stabilization electric field. The evaluation of the stabilization electric field provides essential information needed for the estimation of the incidence of upward lightning to wind turbines. QC 20161201 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} transformative potential of clowns within urban space and examines the becomings of space, human-bodies and clown-bodies through movement (folding) and gesture. I focus specifically on theatrical clowns who have undergone clown through mask {{training in the}} Pochinko style and who maintain connections to the clown community of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Throughout {{it is argued that}} the clown is an inherently affective being that is ideally placed to transformatively transgress space(s) through processes of folding and turning. The theoretical contributions of this dissertation are twofold. First, this dissertation considers the position of affects within the discipline of human geography and contributes to a growing body of interdisciplinary research on theories of affect. Second, it contributes to discussions of how knowledge is produced through the fold (or origami) and to how multiplicity is experienced for individual-clown subjects. I consider the affective potential of the clown by looking at how the clown folds itself, the audience and space together and then turns space, thereby disrupting power dynamics and affects and (re) configuring spaces as it does so. I also consider the latent affects of individuals and clown performance by focusing on the legacy of the late Richard Pochinko (1946 - 1989) and the continued influence of the Pochinko clown through mask technique for clown training. By drawing on Deleuzian affect theory (Deleuze and Guattari 1998) and, to a lesser extent, Jungian psychology this dissertation considers the clown and its relationships to individuals, subjectivities, and individual and collective networked agency with particular attention to transformation (alchemy), transgression, power and the red nosed mask. Empirically, the research project is structured around three research questions: (1) How can spaces be conceptualized as dynamic processes rather than <b>grounded</b> <b>objects?</b> (2) What can human and clown bodies do in and to physical and material space? (3) How can the placement of affects be theorized? Invoking one of the functions of the modern clown—to mirror cult ure back to itself—I mirror my research questions with the insertion of clown: (1) ¿sǝɔɐds ɯɹoɟsuɐɹʇ suʍoןɔ op ʍoɥ (2) ¿ǝɔɐds ןɐɔıɥdɐɹƃoǝƃ oʇ puɐ uı op sǝıpoq uʍoןɔ uɐɔ ʇɐɥʍ (3) ¿pǝzıɹoǝɥʇ puɐ pǝɔɐןd ǝq sʇɔǝɟɟɐ uʍoןɔ uɐɔ ʍoɥ. To address my research questions I take inspiration from the Deleuzian rhizome and use nodes of methodological engagement (e. g., interviews, observations, stop-motion photography) to adequately capture the affects of both humans and clowns. The research methods speak not only to the specifics of this project—research on clowns—but also to the challenges associated with conducting affect based inquiry using standard social science research methods. The dissertation concludes by offering insights into the rhizome of interconnections that affects (and makes affective) the clown-subjects as they (un) fold and are (un) folded into space...|$|E
