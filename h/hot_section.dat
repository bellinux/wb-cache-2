30|$|A {{review of}} recent {{advances}} in gas-turbine technology shows outstanding developments in its major components (Gorji-Bandpy et al. 2010; Najjar and Zaamout 1996; Huda 2009, 2007, 1995). Superalloy and coating advancements for application in <b>hot</b> <b>sections</b> of gas turbine engines {{have resulted in a}} considerable economic leverage in power plants (Miller and Chambers 1987; Reed 2006). The modern CCGT uses single-crystal (SC) superalloys and special thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) and - in one design - closed-loop steam cooling to reach more than 60 % thermal efficiency. The application of advanced superalloys in the <b>hot</b> <b>sections</b> of modern gas-turbines also enables higher temperature operation. The operating temperatures in the first-stage and second-stage SC blades in modern CCGT lie in the ranges of 1, 300 °C to 1, 500 °C and 1, 000 °C to 1, 100 °C, respectively (see ‘Techniques to improve efficiency of GT engines’ section for details). For example, General Electric (GE) Inc. USA’s H-turbine (Fairfield, CN, USA) uses SC materials in first-stage blades and vanes that operate at a temperature of 1, 430 °C over a long service life. Similarly, first-stage turbine blades of Siemens’ SGT 5 - 8000 H machine (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) are made of specialized high-temperature alloy material to combat long-term effects of high temperatures at constant stress (to resist creep deformation).|$|R
