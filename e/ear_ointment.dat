40|$|Case summary We {{report a}} {{clinical}} case of blepharitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans yeasts in a 2 -year-old stray cat from northern Portugal (Vila Real) without concurrent naso-ocular signs. Ophthalmological examination revealed mucopurulent discharge {{from an open}} wound in the right upper and lower lids. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy showed a normal anterior segment, and intraocular pressure was within the normal reference interval. No fundoscopic alterations were detected in either eye by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopic examination. Cytological examination of an appositional smear showed numerous polymorphic neutrophils and macrophages, together with spherical yeast cells compatible with Cryptococcus species. Molecular analysis by means of PCR and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} identified C neoformans genotype VNI. The cat was treated with itraconazole, and amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, combined with a commercial <b>ear</b> <b>ointment</b> and an imidacloprid/moxidectin spot-on application for bilateral parasitic otitis caused by Otodectes cynotis. One month after treatment, the clinical signs were completely resolved. Localised cutaneous lesions, as in the present case, probably result from contamination of cat-scratch injuries with viable encapsulated yeasts. Relevance and novel information This is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first clinical report of feline blepharitis due to C neoformans without concurrent naso-ocular signs. The current findings, together with those from recent reports of the infection in domestic animals, should alert the veterinary community both in Portugal and in Europe to this underdiagnosed disease...|$|E

The type of infection must be identified by the veterinarian by examining a sample of ear exudate under a microscope, since bacterial infection will only respond to antibiotics, fungal infection to a fungicide, and ear mites to an insecticide.|$|R

The method is based on hydrolysis of chloramphenicol with 4 M NaOH and subsequent treatment with ninhydrin reagent. The resulting violet colour exhibits maximum absorption at 570 nm. The Beer's law limits, molar absorptivity, effect of time and reagent concentration, and interference studies are reported. Â© 1984 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
