5|$|Abraham Lincoln is not {{the only}} Lincoln ghost {{witnesses}} claim to have seen in the White House. Willie Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of typhoid on February 20, 1862. Willie Lincoln's ghost was first seen in the White House by staff members of the Grant administration in the 1870s, but has appeared as recently as the 1960s (President Lyndon B. Johnson's college-age daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, saw the ghost and claims to <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him).|$|E
25|$|On 9 April, the Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} ban {{personnel}} from selling their stories {{to the media}} until {{a review of the}} rules governing the issue is completed. Defence Secretary Des Browne said the review was aimed at making rules consistent across the armed forces. His announcement will not affect any of the 15 service members who already <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> media, a Defence Ministry spokesman said.|$|E
25|$|The Galleanists {{knew that}} Salsedo {{had been held}} by the Bureau and might <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> authorities. Rumors swirled in the anarchist {{community}} that Salsedo had made important disclosures concerning the bomb plot of June 2. The Galleanist plotters realized {{that they would have}} to go underground and dispose of any incriminating evidence. After their arrest, Sacco and Vanzetti were found to have correspondence with several Galleanists; one letter warned Sacco to destroy all mail after reading.|$|E

60|$|Anne might grieve, but {{she felt}} the {{gratification}} of being <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> by her uncle {{as a woman who}} could understand, as he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her mother.|$|R
25|$|In a {{conversation}} between Kate Howard and Todd Manning on General Hospital, Erica is mentioned as someone else Todd could <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> about the job he was offering to Kate, implying she survived the final episode of All My Children. On the June 20, 2013 episode of the Prospect Park version of All My Children, Opal Cortlandt tells Dimitri Marick, one of Erica's ex-husbands that Erica {{was out of town}} last seen getting on an airplane to some exotic location without saying when she would be back.|$|E
25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} collapse, the owners {{arrived at the}} mall. A {{representative}} spoke {{on behalf of the}} owner, stating [...] "I'd rather not , because we <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> our lawyers and we’re {{going to be in the}} City Hall to represent ourselves. But nevertheless, we are very much concerned [...] this accident." ...|$|E
6000|$|Midmore grunted impatiently. 'Everybody <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> {{me about}} that brook ever since I came here. It's never done {{anything}} yet.' ...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Luce, during the 1960s, tried LSD and reported that he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> God under its influence.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Horne Fisher had {{considerably}} puzzled everybody {{with his}} new tone and attitude. He <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the colonel about the military and mechanical arrangements, and displayed a remarkable knowledge both {{of the details of}} discipline and the technicalities of electricity. He <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the clergyman, and shown an equally surprising knowledge of the religious and historical interests involved in the relic. He <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the man who called himself a magician, and not only surprised but scandalized the company by an equally sympathetic familiarity with the most fantastic forms of Oriental occultism and psychic experiment. And in this last and least respectable line of inquiry he was evidently prepared to go farthest; he openly encouraged the magician, and was plainly prepared to follow the wildest ways of investigation in which that magus might lead him.|$|R
500|$|... in September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland, and World War II began, Borah mourned, [...] "Lord, if I {{could only}} <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Hitler—all {{this might have}} been averted." [...] This was said to William Kinsey Hutchinson, then International News Service's Washington Bureau Chief. Hutchinson {{indicated}} that Borah confided this [...] "in words that ran like a prayer." [...] McKenna noted, [...] "It was fortuitous that the march of events prevented Borah from joining those pacifists and liberals... who trudged up the hill to Berchtesgaden to lay before the Fuehrer their plans for world peace".|$|E
500|$|McKenna {{saw more}} than Borah {{becoming}} an antique {{in his own}} time, she saw damage inflicted by his positions: [...] "time was to demonstrate the utter bankruptcy of the narrow nationalistic policy which the irreconcilables decreed and to which the Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover administrations submitted with such disastrous results." [...] Borah's comment regretting {{that he could not}} <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Hitler has been repeatedly cited as evidence of naiveté in those who believe in the power of pure diplomacy. Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer has referred to the statement in at least three of his columns, making an analogy to negotiating with China in 1989, with North Korea in 1994 and with Iran in 2006, and it was cited disparagingly in a 2006 speech by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
2500|$|Man Haron Monis, {{the gunman}} who took hostages in a siege at the Lindt Chocolate Café in Sydney, {{was found to}} <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> members of Hizb ut-Tahrir and {{attended}} several of their events.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2002 interview, {{when asked}} if he would work with Jones again, Jackson {{suggested}} he might. But in 2007, when Jones was asked by NME, he said: [...] "Man, please! We already did that. I <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him about working with him again but I've got too much to do. I've got 900 products, I'm 74 years old." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} founded by Savage in {{response}} to the suicide of Billy Lucas and other teenagers who were bullied because they were gay or perceived to be, such as with Raymond Chase, Tyler Clementi, Ryan Halligan, Asher Brown, and Seth Walsh. [...] Savage wrote, [...] "I wish I could <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> this kid for five minutes. I wish I could have told Billy that it gets better. I wish I could have told him that, however bad things were, however isolated and alone he was, it gets better." [...] In September, they launched their YouTube channel. A one-hour special aired on February 21, 2012, hosted by Savage. A second hour long [...] "It Gets Better" [...] special was aired on both MTV and Logo networks on October 9, 2012. On May 3, 2011, a video ad developed by Google Chrome was launched during an episode of Glee and later aired across the nation.|$|E
60|$|I {{might as}} well <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> one of the palm-trees which waved over us.|$|E

60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, not any one <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Christina on the matter; and she strenuously {{repeated}} her own first question in a panic of self-defence.|$|R
5000|$|Mary Matalin stated on Meet the Press that [...] "Somebody <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> some ranch hand". Neither the Sheriff's report nor witness {{statements}} identify {{who this}} first reporter was.|$|R
60|$|And they <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> us--but not prettily, not at all--rather rude {{we should}} call it.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{hope for}} a good deal from Mr. Brand's influence," [...] Mr. Wentworth went on. [...] "He <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him from the first. And he never touches {{anything}} himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Critics!" [...] cried Wally. [...] "Well, I've {{just been}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Alexander of the Times, {{and he said}} it was the best musical piece he had ever seen and that all the other men he <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> thought the same." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That's Nag or Nagaina,' {{he said to}} himself; 'and he's {{crawling}} {{into the}} bath-room sluice. You're right, Chuchundra; I should <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Chua.' ...|$|E

5000|$|On 13 November 2016, Zakharova drew {{criticism}} for joking on Russian state television that the U.S. election results {{were the result}} of a Jewish conspiracy, stating [...] "If {{you want to know what}} will happen in America, who do you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to?</b> You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> our people in Brighton Beach, naturally." [...] She also spoke in a stereotypical Jewish accent.|$|R
