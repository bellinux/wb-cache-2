For components with complex shapes, the <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> needs be continuously adjusted during laser welding, which makes it necessary to know {{the effects of the}} <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> {{on the quality of the}} laser welds. In this paper, the weld quality under two (flat and horizontal) <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> were studied comparatively in the laser welding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy, in terms of weld profiles, process porosity, and static tensile strengths. Results show that the flat <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> led to better weld profiles, less process porosity than that of the horizontal <b>welding</b> <b>position,</b> which resulted from the different actions of gravity on the molten weld metals and the different escape routes for pores under different <b>welding</b> <b>positions.</b> Although undercuts showed no association with the fracture positions and tensile strengths of the welds, too much porosity in horizontal laser welds led to significant decreases in the strengths and specific elongations of welds. Higher laser powers and travel speeds were recommended, for both flat and horizontal <b>welding</b> <b>positions,</b> to reduce <b>weld</b> porosity and improve mechanical properties...|$|R

A theoretical connection between the weld geometry and the power introduced in the welding processes was, therefore, established and experimentally verified.

40|$|Abstract. Detecting the <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> is the {{precondition}} of {{seam tracking}} during an arc welding process, and {{is crucial to}} achieve high-quality welds. Visual sensing {{is one of the}} most attractive approaches to detect the <b>weld</b> <b>position,</b> which provides valuable information to control the arc following the expected path. The weld edge is main characteristics of the <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> image, here the visual technique for detecting the <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> based on Hough transformation is proposed. The <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> can be detected and recognized through Hough transformation, while the weld edge image is detected using the Canny operators. And Hough transformation is modified based on the actual weld situation. Therefore, the precision of the weld detection can be improved. From the analysis of experiments, it has been proved that the proposed method can detect the width and the center of the weld, and is suitable for the seam tracking system based on the computer vision...|$|R

The penultimate digit generally identifies the <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all <b>position</b> <b>welding)</b> and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only).

30|$|In {{order to}} control heat input and reduce spatter {{generation}} and fumes, power sources {{have been developed}} {{with the ability to}} release one drop for a sequence of arc and pulsed time. The arc uses direct current (e.g. pulsed GMAW) or alternative current (e.g. AC-GMAW) with different current waveforms. A pulsed arc can be used in all <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> and with all base material thicknesses in both manual and automatic welding systems. Out of <b>position</b> <b>welding</b> is also possible due to the lower than average current level. Because of the low heat input, this mode is suitable for filling gaps. It is widely used in the GMAW of aluminium (Kah et al. 2012). The method is suitable for welding all standard and high performance grades of stainless steel when nickel base or stainless steel filler metals are used. High alloy steels can also be welded by pulsed arc. Super austenitic stainless steel exhibits better mechanical and metallurgical properties with optimized parameters in GMA welding compare to conventional spray (Sathiya et al. 2012). Pulsed arc welding has applications in the shipbuilding industry, for example, out of <b>position</b> <b>welding</b> of high strength low alloy base materials in ship hull fabrication. The advantages of pulsed arc in shipbuilding are that its electrode efficiency is higher compared to flux-core arc welding (FCAW), and it can deliver lower hydrogen weld deposits (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Knopp and Lorenz 2002; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Ueyama et al. 2005; Lebedev 2010; Torbati et al. 2011; Kah et al. 2013).|$|R

The centre of <b>gravity</b> <b>position</b> travel is found to have a parabolic variation with an increasing mass of aircraft. A nonlinear dynamic inversion-based neurocontroller is designed for the process under investigation. Three radial basis function neural networks are exploited in order to invert the dynamics of the system, one for each control channel. Modal and time-domain analysis results show that the dynamic properties of the aircraft are strongly influenced during aerial refuelling. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is demonstrated through the use of simulation results for an F- 16 aircraft. The longitudinal neurocontroller provided interesting results, and performed better than a baseline nonlinear dynamic inversion controller without neural network. On the other hand, the lateral-directional nonlinear dynamic inversion-based neurocontroller did not perform well as the longitudinal controller. It was concluded that the nonlinear dynamic inversion-based neurocontroller could be applied to control an unmanned combat aerial vehicle during aerial refuelling...|$|R

40|$|In most {{laser welding}} {{applications}} the welding result is highly {{sensitive to the}} <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> and the initial determination of process parameters requires time-consuming adjustments to be made. In case of manufacturing individual parts with low quantities {{this is a significant}} cost driver. State-of-the-art CAD/CAM based manufacturing systems ease the creation of welding contours significantly but position deviations resulting, e. g., from workpiece tolerances or misplacements must still be compensated. Seam tracking systems are rather complicated to handle during process qualification as they require adjustment to a start position and are subject to be misguided by disturbances in the material. Besides, it is difficult to apply seam tracking to scanner-based micro welding operations. Therefore, we developed a system that enables the user to <b>position</b> <b>welds</b> easily and accurately by marking the intended <b>weld</b> <b>position</b> in a calibrated live-image of the workpiece, which is us ed as reference. Thereby, positioning errors are compensated. Because of the live image acquisition, it is also possible to observe the welding process and assess the geometrical properties of the weld surface immediately. Moreover, the paper describes how this idea is extended to a system for more complex weld contours and ends up with a system for image-based contour extraction...|$|R
