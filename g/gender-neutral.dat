5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, <b>gender-neutral</b> ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.|$|E
5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual. These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers, and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example, using <b>gender-neutral</b> terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.|$|E
5|$|Most of the UCSC {{undergraduate}} {{housing is}} affiliated {{with one of the}} ten residential colleges. The residence halls, which include both shared and private rooms, typically house fifteen to twenty students per floor and have common bathrooms and lounge areas.

Single-gender, <b>gender-neutral</b> and substance-free floors are also available.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more <b>gender-neutral</b> pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E
5|$|Indian women {{negotiate}} survival {{through an}} array of oppressive patriarchal family structures: age, ordinal status, relationship to men through family of origin, marriage and procreation as well as patriarchal attributes. Examples of patriarchal attributes include: dowry, siring sons etc., kinship, caste, community, village, market and the state. It should however be noted that several communities in India, such as the Nairs of Kerala, Shettys of Mangalore, certain Maratha clans, and Bengali families exhibit matriarchal tendencies. In these communities, {{the head of the}} family is the oldest woman rather than the oldest man. Sikh culture is also regarded as relatively <b>gender-neutral.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1981, the <b>gender-neutral</b> {{category}} of Best Jazz Vocal Performance existed. The first award specifically for female performances {{was presented to}} Ella Fitzgerald in 1981 for the album A Perfect Match. The category remained unchanged until 1985, when it was combined with the award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male and presented in the genderless category. Gender-specific awards were once again presented from 1986 until 1991. In 1992, the two categories were combined and presented as the category Best Jazz Vocal Performance. This category was later renamed to Best Jazz Vocal Album beginning in 2001. While the gender-specific award has not been presented since the category merge in 1992, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{category}} Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male or Female {{there were two}} categories separated by gender: Best Soul Gospel Performance, Female and Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male. Both awards were presented from 1984 to 1989. The first <b>gender-neutral</b> award was presented in 1990. In 1991, another category restructure resulted in the soul gospel categories being divided into awards for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album and Best Traditional Gospel Album (previously known as Best Soul Gospel Performance, Contemporary and Best Soul Gospel Performance, Traditional from 1978 to 1983), both of which lasted until the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Maxwell House Haggadah is an English-Hebrew Passover Haggadah {{introduced}} by the Maxwell House company as a marketing promotion in 1932 and printed continuously since that time. With over 50 million copies in print, {{it is the best}} known and most popular Haggadah among American Jews, and is considered a cultural icon. It is used at Passover Seders in homes, schools, senior centers, prisons, and the United States Army, and was the edition used by President Obama and his guests at the White House Passover Seder conducted yearly from 2009 to 2016. In 2011 a new English translation replaced archaic phrases in the original and also incorporated <b>gender-neutral</b> language.|$|E
5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced {{by women and}} minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a <b>gender-neutral</b> perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 2011, {{freelance}} translator Nazerine released a fan translation patch {{of the free}} demo version of the game. The initial project involved Nazerine translating, writing, and revising the game text, while another person hacked the game so that the translated text displayed properly on the game screen. This English patch launched {{the first wave of}} western interest in the game, with several video game publications reporting on it due to the game's unusual concept. The success of this translation attracted the attention of Hato Moa herself, who then offered Nazerine the opportunity to translate the full game—and later its sequel, Holiday Star—for an official English release. The translation process of the full game was also a solo effort by Nazerine; however, Hato removed the need for hacking by directly supervising the translation, adjusting images in the game for English sentences. As the demo's English patch was made before Nazerine had access to the full version of the game, several lines of dialogue were translated differently to reflect context revealed in Bad Boys Love; for example, third-person pronouns from Kazuaki Nanaki's route implying that he had a female lover in the fan translation were replaced with <b>gender-neutral</b> ones in the official translation. Few dramatic changes were made, though several jokes were added in Nazerine's translations of the game that were not present in the original Japanese text. The official English version of the game was released for download on 15 February 2012. The 2014 remake has also been confirmed to have used Nazerine's translation.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1795, dissatisfaction with this {{convention}} led {{to calls for}} <b>gender-neutral</b> pronouns, and attempts to invent pronouns for this purpose date back to at least 1850, although the use of singular they as a natural <b>gender-neutral</b> pronoun in English is much older.|$|E
25|$|Ido has gendered and <b>gender-neutral</b> pronouns.|$|E
25|$|Turkish is a <b>gender-neutral</b> {{language}} {{except for}} a few sex-specific compound words (mostly naming professions). The English third-person singular pronouns she, he, and it all correspond to a single Turkish pronoun, o. Since many given names in Turkish are also <b>gender-neutral,</b> it is possible to describe someone without their sex being made known.|$|E
25|$|Georgian has no {{grammatical}} gender; {{even the}} pronouns are <b>gender-neutral.</b>|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, many Haggadah (even {{the most}} widely used, the famous Maxwell House Haggadah) now use <b>gender-neutral</b> English translations.|$|E

25|$|Pressure from father's rights groups, among others, have {{in several}} {{countries}} resulted in <b>gender-neutral</b> program(s) eligible for parental leave. While historically, maternity benefits were given to mothers based on the physical biology of childbirth, including {{the need to protect}} the health and financial well-being of the woman and child, parental leave benefits emphasize <b>gender-neutral</b> child-rearing, the benefits of the participation of fathers in children's care, and redress discrimination against men who wish to be involved with their infants.|$|E
25|$|More recently, in {{the city}} of Baltimore, and {{possibly}} other cities in the United States, yo has come {{to be used as a}} <b>gender-neutral</b> pronoun.|$|E

25|$|In Turkey {{adultery}} {{laws were}} held to be invalid in 1996/1998 because the law was deemed discriminatory as it differentiated between women and men. In 2004, there were proposals to introduce a <b>gender-neutral</b> adultery law. The plans were dropped, {{and it has been}} suggested that the objections from the European Union played a role.|$|E
25|$|With several {{countries}} revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their {{definition of the}} word marriage to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include <b>gender-neutral</b> language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions. The Oxford English Dictionary has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century, nursing was {{considered}} a women's profession, just as doctoring was a men's profession.

25|$|The various {{schools and}} traditions within Buddhism hold {{different}} views {{as to the}} possibilities of women's spiritual attainments. Feminist scholars have also noted than even when a woman's potential for spiritual attainment is acknowledged, records of such achievements may not be kept—or may be obscured by <b>gender-neutral</b> language or mis-translation of original sources by Western scholars.|$|E
