5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{concerns}} women is {{the dress code}} <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Islam requires {{both men and women}} to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{chosen by}} chance was that commanded by Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie, {{who failed to}} brief the men on what was <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and was reported during the battle to be drunk well behind the lines, providing no leadership. Ledlie's men entered the huge crater instead of going around it, becoming trapped, and were subjected to heavy fire from Confederates around the rim, resulting in high casualties.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E

25|$|Favorites for {{the race}} {{included}} 2008 winner Carlos Sastre, 2007 winner Alberto Contador, 2009 Giro d'Italia winner Denis Menchov and two time runner-up Cadel Evans. Lance Armstrong came out of retirement and competed in the race {{on the same team}} as Contador. Menchov and Evans performed far below the levels <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> finishing 51st and 30th respectively, and Sastre only showed briefly among the leaders on the mountain stages that would have provided his best chance of making a bid for victory, coming 17th overall.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of {{what needs to}} be accomplished {{by the end of the}} course. Students will understand what is <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and teachers will know what they need to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of {{what needs to be}} accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E

25|$|Convenient {{transportation}} and an increasingly dense population {{contributed to an}} outbreak of typhoid fever in 1898. Soldiers mustering for the Spanish–American War were encouraged by 40,000 visitors and 500 soldiers took ill from the exposure. By {{the turn of the}} century, resentment of the newest immigrants began to take hold. Henry A. Castle wrote that the earliest immigrants, primarily from the British Isles, Germany, Scandinavia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France easily reached the standards <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In contrast, by the 1880s, most new immigrants were unskilled workers from southern Europe, eastern Europe, and Russia. He described them as illiterate, unable to be assimilated into the city's culture, and often without families. He said they drained the economy by working here and sending money back to their homelands.|$|E
25|$|Pirates {{were mostly}} former {{merchant}} seamen, {{or at least}} men who had sailed on vessels legitimately before turning to piracy. As a result, a pirate ship still had the usual terminology found on merchant ships, but the role each ranking sailor would play on the pirate ship was not the norm. A pirate ship still had a Captain of the vessel. As the economist Peter Leeson argues, pirate captains were democratically elected by the entire crew. This was not a lifelong title and had less power than the merchant captain, as Leeson provides evidence of pirate captains being removed from the position, in one case thirteen captains were removed during one voyage, for not performing at the level that was <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> or for overstepping their bounds of authority. The Pirate captain had absolute command when pursuing a vessel or in military engagements, otherwise he was {{another member of the}} crew.|$|E

500|$|Williams {{returned}} to England in 1990 as White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford and fellow of Corpus Christi. His sons had been [...] "at sea" [...] in California, he said, {{not knowing what}} was <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> {{and he had been}} unable to help. He regretted having made his departure from England so public; he had been persuaded to do so to highlight Britain's relatively low academic salaries. When he retired in 1996, he took up a fellowship again at All Souls.|$|E
500|$|The priesthood of the Temple of Set {{consists}} of members holding the third degree or higher; {{those in the}} first and second degrees are considered [...] "lay members" [...] of the Temple. The first degree serves as a space for mutual evaluation, in which the Temple assesses whether the individual is appropriate for the group, and the individual decides whether they wish to further their involvement with it. Full membership comes with recognition to the second degree. Many members do not advance beyond the second degree, nor is this <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> as while the first and second degree members use the organization's teachings and tools for their own development, the priesthood involves greater responsibilities towards the organization, such as being its official representatives.|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} there are several factors that on the one hand drive {{migrants}} into entrepreneurship, such as the discrimination on the labour market, while on the other hand, access to finance and policies often hinder potential entrepreneurs to put their plans into action and play the role that many <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Other policies and programmes drive migrants into entrepreneurship that are not necessarily suited for this.|$|R

500|$|In 1947, {{with the}} inauguration of Colgate Darden as {{president}} of the university, first-year students were prohibited from joining fraternities and sororities. This restriction was later eased to a one-semester prohibition, which is still in place today. During this time only 20 percent of students were members of the 24 fraternities on grounds. [...] Darden was critical of the fraternities' behavior, arguing in a 1949 report to the Board of Visitors that the groups had failed to uphold the interests of the university community and to provide the leadership <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Additionally, university leaders condemned the fraternities' treatment of their houses, which were extremely run down. Members would often solicit {{tens of thousands of dollars}} of donations from alumni to refurbish houses, only to see the improvements disappear within a few years. Despite the administrators' concerns, this problem was not addressed until 1983, when the university created the Historic Renovation Corporation, or HRC. The HRC, which later became a subsidiary of the UVA Foundation, renovates and manages the properties of a number of fraternity and sorority houses.|$|E
500|$|In early 1964, Wilson {{began his}} {{breakaway}} from beach-themed music. That November, Melody Maker reported that Love {{and the group}} wanted to look beyond surf rock and avoid {{living in the past}} or resting on the band's laurels. When Wilson resigned from touring in order to focus on songwriting and producing, the rest of the band assumed that he would continue making music that their audiences <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Although The Beach Boys Today! and Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) (both released in 1965) were more sophisticated and elaborate than previous albums, they were still within the realm of acceptability for the band, producing a reasonable level of record sales and chart activity. This was not the case for the next two album projects recorded over 1966 and 1967, where Wilson's bandmates were not entirely supportive of his new creative ambitions. Wilson was also encumbered by pressure from Capitol Records and the group's fanbase. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill the Beach Boys as [...] "America’s Top Surfin' Group!", expecting Wilson to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets, despite his growing disinterest.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{included}} in the Australian squad to tour England in 1930. The bonus for Australia from England's 1928–29 visit was the emergence of Jackson and Don Bradman and now much was <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in a rebuilt Australian squad that retained only four players from the 1926 tour of England. But Jackson was frequently ill and his unfamiliarity with English pitches resulted in patchy form. Even so, he was described at the time by former England player Cecil Parkin as, [...] "a better bat than Bradman". He was left out of the team for the First Test at Trent Bridge, the only defeat suffered by the Australians all tour. [...] After the Second Test at Lord's, Jackson recovered some form. Ponsford and Fairfax both fell ill and as a result Jackson {{was included}} in the team for the Third Test at Leeds. He scored one run in his only innings while Bradman made a then-record Test score of 334. Jackson was omitted for the Fourth Test, but a century against Somerset helped him to force his way back into the side for the Fifth and deciding Test at The Oval.|$|E

2500|$|The {{developmental}} feminist {{perspective is}} {{closely tied to}} the social constructionist perspective. It is specifically interested in how society's gender norms affect adolescent development, especially for girls. For example, some researchers on the topic hold the view that adolescent girls are still strongly affected by gender roles imposed on them by society and that this in turn affects their sexuality and sexual behavior. Deborah Tolman is an advocate for this viewpoint and states that societal pressures to be [...] "good" [...] cause girls {{to pay more attention to}} what they think others <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> than looking within themselves to understand their own sexuality. Tolman states that young girls learn to objectify their own bodies and end up thinking of themselves as objects of desire. This causes them to often see their own bodies as others see it, which causes them to feel a sense of detachment from their bodies and their sexualities. Tolman calls this a process of disembodiment. This process leaves young girls unassertive about their own sexual desires and needs because they focus so much on what other people <b>expect</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> rather than on what they feel inside.|$|R

2500|$|Despite this careful {{planning}} and intensive training (by Civil War standards), {{the day before}} the attack, Meade, who lacked confidence in the operation, ordered Burnside not to use the black troops in the lead assault, claiming that if the attack failed black soldiers would be killed needlessly, creating political repercussions in the North. Meade may have also ordered the change of plans because he lacked confidence in black soldiers' abilities in combat. Burnside protested to General Grant, who sided with Meade. When volunteers were not forthcoming, Burnside selected a replacement white division by having the three commanders draw lots. Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie's 1st Division was selected, but he failed to brief the men on what was <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and was reported during the battle to be drunk, well behind the lines, and providing no leadership.

2500|$|The U.S. Navy {{was rapidly}} {{downsized}} {{at the end}} of the war, and Porter, like most of his contemporaries, had fewer ships to command. [...] Some feared that at sea he might provoke a foreign war, particularly with Great Britain, because of what he saw as their support for the Confederacy. To make use of his undeniable talents, Secretary Welles appointed him Superintendent of the Naval Academy in 1865. The academy at that time did little to prepare men for the duties that were <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Porter resolved to change that; he determined to make the Academy the rival of the Military Academy at West Point. The curriculum was revised to reflect the reality of naval life, organized sports were encouraged, discipline was enforced, and even social graces were taught. An honor system was installed, [...] "to send honorable men from this institution into the Navy."
