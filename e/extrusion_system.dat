25|$|Another way {{to create}} {{longitudinally}} oriented channels {{is to create a}} conduit from one polymer with embedded longitudinally oriented fibers from another polymer; then selectively dissolve the fibers to form longitudinally oriented channels. Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were embedded in a (Hydroxyethyl)methacrylate (HEMA) scaffold. PCL was chosen over poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), because it is insoluble in HEMA but soluble in acetone. This is important because HEMA was used for the main conduit material and acetone was used to selectively dissolve the polymer fibers. Extruded PCL fibers were inserted into a glass tube and the HEMA solution was injected. The number of channels created was consistent from batch to batch and the variations in fiber diameter could be reduced by creating a more controlled PCL fiber <b>extrusion</b> <b>system.</b> The channels formed were confirmed to be continuous and homogeneous by examination of porosity variations.

Polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were embedded in the gel, and then selectively dissolved by acetone with sonication to create channels. It was found that HEMA in mixture with 1% AEMA created the strongest gels. When compared to scaffolds without channels, the addition of 82–132 channels can provide an approximately 6–9 fold increase in surface area, which may be advantageous for regeneration studies that depend on contact-mediated cues.|$|E

40|$|Calcium is an {{ambivalent}} signal: it {{is essential}} for the correct functioning of cell life, but may also become dangerous to it. The plasma membrane Ca(2 +) ATPase (PMCA) and the plasma membrane Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger (NCX) are the two mechanisms responsible for Ca(2 +) extrusion. The NCX has low Ca(2 +) affinity but high capacity for Ca(2 +) transport, whereas the PMCA has a high Ca(2 +) affinity but low transport capacity for it. Thus, traditionally, the PMCA pump has been attributed a housekeeping role in maintaining cytosolic Ca(2 +), and the NCX the dynamic role of counteracting large cytosolic Ca(2 +) variations (especially in excitable cells). This view of the roles of the two Ca(2 +) <b>extrusion</b> <b>systems</b> has been recently revised, as the specific functional properties of the numerous PMCA isoforms and splicing variants suggests that they may have evolved to cover both the basal Ca(2 +) regulation (in the 100 nM range) and the Ca(2 +) transients generated by cell stimulation (in the mM range) ...|$|R

The Tg of PCL increased by up to 15 °C on addition of a synthetic fluromica, as the nanoclay constrained chain motion and tethered PCL chains through hydrogen bonding to hydroxyl groups on the edges of the clay platelets. The tensile mechanical properties of PCL were unaffected when a naturally derived clay (montmorillonite) and paracetamol were blended. In contrast, the modulus of PCL increased by 500 % and the stress and elongation at break decreased by 30 % for composites prepared with a partially synthetic fluoromica.

50|$|Due to the machine's {{relatively}} low price, and subsequent popularity, {{all of the}} Solidoodle printers to date have enjoyed an active modding community, with blogs like Solidoodle Tips leading the way. Solidoodle modifications typically strive to enhance the functionality of the printer {{in order to achieve}} the performance of more expensive printers, taking advantage of the machine's relatively sturdy steel gantry system. Common modifications include hot-end and extruder replacements, improved carriage <b>systems,</b> bowden style <b>extrusion</b> <b>systems,</b> build plate replacements, and thread ball screws. Installing a cooling fan at the point of extrusion is a popular modification. This drastically improves the accuracy of prints by allowing the contours to cool rapidly and evenly. This minimises any distortion created by forms that cool unevenly and may buckle during printing. This buckling is persistent in forms like bowls, where the cantilever edge of each layer cools faster than the inside edge of the layer which is kept warmer by its contact with the previous layer. The uneven cooling sees the outside edges shrink inwards and up. As more layers of the print proceed, the extruder can be seen to be pushing the print around with each new layer as the problem of contours leaning inwards and upwards multiplies the distortion. The use of a fan however reduces the binding of the layers with less merging of the surfaces.|$|R
