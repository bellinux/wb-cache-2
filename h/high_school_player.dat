5|$|Without {{the benefit}} of a full senior season to show himself off to scouts, Clippard {{proactively}} sent scouts a schedule of when he was throwing and attended as many showcases as he could.

These data indicate that advantages of RAE are expected to become less apparent toward adulthood when the status of biological maturity evens out. Indeed, the effect size among Q 1 –Q 4 was smaller in elite <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players</b> than in elite elementary and junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players.</b> This phenomenon has already been confirmed in some sports such as soccer, handball, and swimming [2, 6, 7].|$|R

30|$|We {{also have}} to {{consider}} the definition of “elite” players in sports. Anthropometric data in Table  5 show that height and weight values were significantly larger in elite elementary and junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players</b> than in recreational elementary and junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players,</b> while height and weight are generally related to each other. This suggests that biological maturity occurs earlier in elite elementary and junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players</b> than in recreational elementary and junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players.</b> An important point regarding our anthropometric data was that the height was almost the same between recreational and elite <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players,</b> indicating that the status of biological maturity evens out in <b>high</b> <b>school.</b> Recently, Müller et al. [24] investigated the influence of the biological maturity status on RAEs in youth skiers, and showed that the peak height velocity as an indicator of the biological maturity status was significantly earlier in national ski racers than in provincial ski racers. We considered that the significant difference in weight between recreational and elite <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players</b> was related to strength and weight training.|$|R

However, after breaking his foot in the summer of 1961 during a baseball game and thinking about his college decision outside of basketball, Bradley decided to enroll at Princeton due to its record in preparing students for government or United States Foreign Service work. He had been awarded a scholarship at Duke, but not at Princeton; the Ivy League does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships, and Bradley's family's wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 season {{would inevitably}} {{be a new}} era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence {{and the loss of}} 6th-man Lorin Dixon left {{significant}} holes to fill in the roster.

Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA <b>High</b> <b>School</b> <b>Player</b> of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E

In addition to all players returning from the 2007 team, #1 ranked <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>player</b> Maya Moore joined the team after a bitter recruitment battle between UConn and Tennessee. Shortly after Moore's commitment to UConn, Tennessee announced they were cancelling the annual series with UConn, thus ending {{one of the biggest}} rivalries in the sport. Even if both coaches remained vague and unspecific about the reasons of the cancellation, Tennessee filed a complaint to the NCAA about UConn's recruitment of Moore. UConn was found to have committed a secondary violation (involving a tour of the ESPN campus) and no punishment was handed out.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the speed of a thrown ball and differences in the effect of training in junior and senior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> baseball fielders at different developmental stages would be influenced by stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) training and resistance training. The subjects were classified into three groups: a SSC training group (dumbbell fly and medicine ball twist toss), a resistance training group (bench press and shaft twist), and a control group. Training was continued for three sessions per week for seven weeks. Moreover, the subjects performed purely concentric throw (CT) and rebound throw (RT) with medicine balls horizontal to the shoulder and body trunk twist movement, and the throw-index (CT: CT-index, RT: RT-index) and prestretch augmentation (Augmentation) were calculated. The results were as follows: 1) The thrown ball speed increased significantly with SSC training in both the junior and senior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> baseball <b>players.</b> 2) The rate of increase in augmentation was higher in the junior than in the senior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players.</b> 3) The thrown ball speed increased significantly in the junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players</b> who undertook resistance training, but not in the senior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players.</b> 4) The RT-index increased significantly in the junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players</b> who undertook resistance training. 5) Augmentation was not increased significantly in the junior or senior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players</b> who undertook resistance training. These results suggest that the speed of a thrown ball increased significantly in junior and senior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> baseball <b>players</b> who undertook SSC training, and in junior <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>players</b> who undertook resistance training group. In addition, it was clarified that the effect of training differed according to developmental stage...|$|R

Duke returned the favor by gaining a commitment from Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had been a fan of the Fab Five growing up. More recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.|$|E

In the district title contest, he put up 26 points, 15 assists, six rebounds, and three steals. Clinkscales' team won the National Association of Christian Athletes championship behind a 36-win season, and he was named the Ocala Star-Banner boys' basketball player of the year. Despite his success at Ocala, the low competition level prevented him from drawing national attention. However, {{he was in the}} spotlight playing for the Atlanta Celtics, an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) program made up of players such as Dwight Howard, Josh Smith, and Randolph Morris. He joined the team because they required a reliable point guard. The Celtics won the Adidas Big Time Tournament, sparking coaches' interest in him once again. Basketball news website The Hoop Scoop named Clinkscales the 47th-best <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>player</b> in his class as he entered college.

He achieved several distinctions as a <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>player,</b> including two-time Associated Press 2A Offensive MVP and First-team All-state selection. Over his career, he completed 536-of-849 passes (63.1%) for 9,344 yards and 116 TDs. He ranks as the all-time leading passer in Texas Division 2A high school history and is fourth overall in Texas high school history. McCoy also served as Jim Ned High School's punter as a junior and senior. During his sophomore year, McCoy was also playing free safety. However, after he suffered a concussion while tackling 215-pound Bangs High School running back Jacoby Jones (not {{to be confused with}} the Baltimore Ravens wide receiver of the same name), his father decided not to let him play defense anymore. At the time Jim Ned was 8–0, but as McCoy missed the next two games due to the concussion, Jim Ned's season unraveled.
