40|$|We have {{developed}} a new fully kinetic electrostatic simulation, HYBes, to study how the lunar landscape affects the electric potential and plasma distributions near the surface and the properties of lifted dust. The model embodies new techniques {{that can be used}} in various types of physical environments and situations. We demonstrate the applicability of the new model in a situation involving three charged particle species, which are solar wind electrons and protons, and lunar photoelectrons. Properties of dust are studied with test particle simulations by using the electric fields derived from the HYBes model. Simulations show the high importance of the plasma and the electric potential near the surface. For comparison, the electric potential gradients near the landscapes with feature sizes of the order of the Debye length are much larger than those near a flat surface at different solar zenith angles. Furthermore, <b>dust</b> <b>test</b> particle simulations indicate that the landscape relief influences the dust location over the surface. The study suggests that the local landscape has to be taken into account when the distributions of plasma and dust above lunar surface are studied. The HYBes model can be applied not only at the Moon but also on a wide range of airless planetary objects such as Mercury, other planetary moons, asteroids, and nonactive comets...|$|E
40|$|A {{field study}} {{in a dark}} grey basalt quarry nearby Rome is presented. PM 10 {{airborne}} concentration due to typical quarry operations was recorded {{during a period of}} two months. The aim of the work is testing the suitability of the laser light scattering method in measuring airborne dust concentration in such typical environmental conditions like those from quarrying operations. To the scope, two sampling campaigns were developed according with two different methods: from one side a traditional gravimetric method (NIOSH 0600) based on an air sampling pump connected with PVC filters through a 37 mm aluminum cyclone was used to assess PM 10 concentration. On the other hand, a light scatter technology developed with a real time dust monitor was applied. This method, which is based on a photo detector that measures laser light scattered by particles in the sampled stream, allows us to assess airborne dust concentration through a specific calibration generally carried out by comparing the time weighed average photometer readings with field measures of a known <b>dust</b> <b>test</b> (A 1 Arizona Road Dust in this case). The step of assessing airborne dust concentration from a sampled particle number is a critical passage, as concentration itself is strictly connected to the physical and chemical characteristics of the sampled aerosol, such as particle size distribution, density and refractive index that obviously vary from pollutant to pollutant. So after a preliminary comparison of the sampled sets of values, some further analysis was developed in order to test the accuracy of the sampled values and the correlation factor was assessed. The R 2 value (0. 706) showed a fairly good correlation between the two methods suggesting we consider the optical method suitable to survey PM 10 in the specific case. So basalt airborne dust was taken into account and a field calibration was developed. The results showed a fulfilling improvement of correlation factor (0. 794) and a reduction of the bias. The study suggests, though further analysis is necessary, that in basalt quarries or similar activities (for example, brick factories) suffering from elevated levels of airborne dust concentration, the optical method may represent a suitable tool in monitoring PM 10 concentration if integrated with gravimetric samples, aimed to provide a specific calibration for the target environment.

The fibrous dusts (other than gypsum) {{resulted in}} {{a high incidence of}} mesothelioma (30 - 67 %). Gypsum produced only 5 % and granular dusts none at all. It is suggested that the fibrous shape leads to a high multiplication rate of cells and predisposes to tumor formation. Fibrosis, in the other hand, does not so predispose. Milled chrysotile with 99. 8 % fibers than 5 Mm in length are carcinogenic in our experience. The carcinogenicity of glass fibers in our experiments may have significance for occupational situations.

40|$|PhDThe sabkhas of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, some coastal some well inland, exhibit {{variation}} in clastic fraction, evaporite type, and brine composition. The clastic fraction largely reflects the local host lithologies with carbonate tending {{to be more}} important inland than on the coast. While halite is ubiquitous, its abundance is highly varied and it is derived sometimes by evaporation of brine, sometimes deposited as wind blown material. Gypsum forms mainly in layers and again has varied origins. It is particularly abundant where it occurs in the host rocks of the sabkha. The brines are of varied density and composition with the aquifer brines being sometimes relatively fresh while the shallow groundwater is nearly saturated in NaC 1. The molar ratio of C 1 to Na exceeds unity and varies up to about 1. 4. Magnesium is also locally very high- especially where sodium chloride has been extracted from the brine. There are systematic relationships between the ionic concentrations with a numerical relationship occurring between sulphate, bicarbonate, magnesium, and sodium. Brine composition also relates to location but this appears to relate to brine/mineral equilibria with water origin and blending playing a lesser role. The water table has risen into a layer of some 3 metres of fill placed on Sabkhat A 1 Fasl while the level, has remained unchanged in residual windows in the sabkha. Experiments show both seasonal and diurnal cycles in water level and that the rise probably relates mainly to lateral tlow of the groundwater. The flow reflects evaporation in areas where the capillary fringe broaches the ground surface. Where infiltration occurs it does not link up with the capillary fringe but evaporates to produce an embryonic salt crust where the salt is added from wind blown <b>dust.</b> <b>Test</b> beds show that the capillary fringe rises into fill by nearly a metre in a little over a year. The presence of salts in the fill, reduces the level to which the capillary fringe reaches. The fill is clearly ineffective and observed damage to construction and cultivation may be mitigated by the use of a more varied thickness of fill combined with the excavation of windows or drains in the original sabkha surface. Experiments in the use of capillary breaks show that though they slow the rise of mositure and salts they are not particularly effective and consideration needs to be given to the design of such breaks to make them more effective.

40|$|The Circumferential Slot Virtual Impactor (CSVI) and The XMX/ 2 A are two virtual impactors {{designed}} for sampling aerosol particles from a dilute environment by separating the aerosol into a fine and a coarse particle fraction. Dust {{particles in the}} ambient air may deposit within the virtual impactors and affect their performances. In this study the effect of dust loading within the CSVI on the efficiency of transmission was determined for particles from 0. 49 to 9. 9 mm in aerodynamic diameter (AD), {{and the performance of}} the three stage XMX/ 2 A aerosol concentrator was characterized with 1 mm- 9. 9 ?m AD polystyrene latex microspheres (PSL). In the first experimental configuration, the two-stage CSVI had a first stage inflow of 100 L/min and a second stage minor flow of 1 L/min, each stage operating at an inflow/minor flow ratio of 10. An In-line Virtual Impactor (IVI) was used as a pre-separator for sampling inlets to exclude large particles. When the 100 L/min IVI with the two-stage CSVI was tested with Arizona Fine Road Dust (ARD A- 2) particles, the transmission efficiency dropped to 50 % when the dust entering the two-stage CSVI accumulated to about 100 mg. When it was tested with ASHRAE dust, a decrease of 43 % in the efficiency was detected after more than 200 mg ASHRAE dust entered the two-stage CSVI. After cleaning the CSVI unit, the transmission efficiency returned to 99 %, which indicated that the dust dissemination resulted in the plugging of the CSVI unit. The transmission efficiency of CSVI dropped more quickly below 50 % when tested with the ARD A- 2 dust, which had smaller particle sizes. In the second configuration, XMX/ 2 A, a three-stage aerosol concentrator designed to draw 800 L/min of air was used at a measured sampling flow rate of 742 L/min. XMX/ 2 A equipped with an inlet was tested with 1 mm- 9. 9 mm AD PSL in a testing chamber. The peak transmission efficiency of XMX/ 2 A was 39. 5 % for 8 mm AD PSL. By using the room air as cooling air and introducing dilution air to the flow cell, the transmission efficiency of each particle size increased. A combination of monodisperse PSL and oleic acid particles represent the performance of CSVI. In the IVI-CSVI <b>dust</b> <b>test,</b> the CSVI unit SN 003 had the best performance when tested with ASHRAE dust.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{with this}} thesis {{has been to}} find out if it is possible to utilize low cost image sensors combined with fast digital logic as building blocks in laser based dust monitors. The field of application of these kinds of monitors is within environmental monitoring in incinerators and industrial processes. A new dust monitor based on the principles outlined in this thesis, could potentially reduce the cost of the monitor significantly, since expensive optical and mechanical parts as well as a custom detector can be replaced by a high volume image sensor and digital logic circuits. Additionally it has been an objective to compare the new monitor with a traditional monitor based on mainly optical solutions. As part of the implementation of a prototype during the work with this thesis, a simple optical and mechanical system has been designed. A suitable image sensor has been selected and a printed circuit board with code for a field programmable array and an embedded processor has been developed. Three measurement concepts have been evaluated and tested. Two concepts based on scattered light have been tested, of which one was based on blocking the direct laser beam in the center, while the second allowed also the central main part of the beam to reach the sensor. The third measurement concept was based on the measurement of the direct beam or the optical light transmission through the dust. The camera based dust monitor has been compared with the commercially available LaserDust instrument which is based on measurement of a combination of scattered and direct light. Dust monitors will normally be calibrated in-situ in the process, since different types of dust can lead to different response and therefore an absolute calibration will normally not be possible for dust monitors. The camera based dust monitor and the LaserDust instrument have been compared mounted in two different set-ups. The first set-up was below the ceiling in an office environment corridor and the second in a specially designed <b>dust</b> <b>test</b> chamber. Measurement results from the comparisons show satisfactory correlation for most tests, but the camera based dust monitor has a somewhat higher noise level than the LaserDust monitor. This appears to be caused by two main issues, namely that the prototype does not fully utilize the available time for measurement and interference and speckle phenomena related to laser light, optics and the image sensor surface. The complexity of these issues and the extensive work needed to resolve them, made optimization a task {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis. Design of an optical system with reduced interference and speckle problems related to the laser light is one of the fields where further work and optimization is needed. Work to increase the effective measurement time should also be done to improve the signal to noise ratio. Room for improvement is also present in algorithms for dust concentration calculation based on image sensor data. It has also been observed that defective pixels might influence the measurements and a system for handling dead or deviating pixels should be implemented in future versions of the dust monitor. The work during this thesis has shown that it is possible to measure dust based on low cost digital image sensors and digital logic. Even though comparisons between the prototype and a commercial monitor displayed an advantage for the commercial monitor, the camera based monitor has a significant room for improvement by increasing the efficient measurement time and optimizing algorithms for the dust concentration calculation. An improved dust monitor based on image sensors will therefore have a potential to achieve the same performance as a traditional dust monitor, but with reduced component cost...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), {{as part of}} its {{continuing}} {{research program}} for evaluating coal dust explosion hazards, has investigated several areas in which current practices may need to be updated in order to adequately protect mines against coal dust propagated explosions.

40|$|Abstract Background Alveolar macrophages {{are a key}} cell {{in dealing}} with {{particles}} deposited in the lungs and in determining the subsequent response to that particle exposure. Nanoparticles are considered a potential threat to the lungs and the mechanism of pulmonary response to nanoparticles is currently under intense scrutiny. The type II alveolar epithelial cell has previously been shown to release chemoattractants which can recruit alveolar macrophages to sites of particle deposition. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the responses of a type II epithelial cell line (L- 2) to both fine and nanoparticle exposure in terms of secretion of chemotactic substances capable of inducing macrophage migration. Results Exposure of type II cells to carbon black nanoparticles resulted in significant release of macrophage chemoattractant compared to the negative control and to other <b>dusts</b> <b>tested</b> (fine carbon black and TiO 2 and nanoparticle TiO 2) as measured by macrophage migration towards type II cell conditioned medium. SDS-PAGE analysis of the conditioned medium from particle treated type II cells revealed that a higher number of protein bands were present in the conditioned medium obtained from type II cells treated with nanoparticle carbon black compared to other <b>dusts</b> <b>tested.</b> Size-fractionation of the chemotaxin-rich supernatant determined that the chemoattractants released from the epithelial cells were between 5 and 30 kDa in size. Conclusion The highly toxic nature and reactive surface chemistry of the carbon black nanoparticles has very likely induced the type II cell line to release pro-inflammatory mediators that can potentially induce migration of macrophages. This could aid in the rapid recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of particle deposition and the subsequent removal of the particles by phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. Future studies in this area could focus on the exact identity of the substance(s) released by the type II cells in response to particle exposure. </p...|$|R

To attain this goal, permanent relocation of the family is sometimes necessary or advisable for many reasons, including poor housing conditions; extensive lead hazards; lack of abatement resources, landlord compliance and local enforcement capacity; and family eviction. During 1996 â 1998, the Kennedy Krieger Institute implemented a unique capitated program for case management of Baltimore City children with blood lead concentrations (PbB) > 19 Â Î¼g/dL. The Program provided financial, housing, and social work assistance to facilitate relocation {{as a means of}} providing safer housing. Nearly half of the Program families relocated with direct assistance, and 28 % relocated on their own. The Program evaluation examined {{the costs and benefits of}} relocation. Average relocation cost per child was relatively inexpensive (12 months) was less than the 8 -month average time to complete lead hazard control work in 14 city and state programs funded by U. S. HUD. Relocation was associated with (1) a statistically significant decrease in dust lead loadings on floors, windowsills and window troughs that persisted for one year, and (2) statistically significantly greater decreases in childrenâs PbB compared to children who did not relocate from untreated homes. Children relocated to housing that met current Federal residential dust lead standards had statistically significant decreases in blood lead levels. Visual inspection did not consistently identify relocation houses with dust lead levels below current Federal standards, indicating that <b>dust</b> <b>testing</b> should be an essential component of future programs. This will require additional resources for <b>dust</b> <b>testing</b> and possibly cleaning and repairs but is expected to yield additional benefits for children. The findings support recent U. S.

Significant differences in coal dust sink times were observed among the three wetting agents at water mixture concentrations of 0. 05 %, 0. 1 % and 0. 2 %.

The SiC particles (part unmilled and part milled) were able to disturb the structure of erythrocyte membranes and to lead to blood red-cell lysis; they also either interfered with complement and activated the alternate pathway, or interacted with biological media and polymorphonuclear leucocyte membranes, thus eliciting reactive oxygen species production. These in vitro properties were detected both in original large particles and unmilled particles, over 40 % of which were of respirable size. The ability of these SiC particles to produce complement activation in vitro lends support to the previous hypothesis, that the radiographic opacities found in two workers employed {{in the same area}} of the plant from which the <b>dust</b> <b>tested</b> was taken are due to a reaction by pulmonary interstitial structures to SiC particle inhalation. It is speculated that SiC particles could act like asbestos, the ability of which to activate complement through the alternate pathway is considered {{to be one of the}} mechanisms by which the initial asbestotic lesions and subsequent fibrotic inflammatory infiltrates are generated in the lung.

40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 895 â 899 The present paper {{proposes a}} preconcentration {{procedure}} for lead determination using flame {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} (FAAS). It is based on lead(II) ions extraction as brilliant cresyl blue (BCB) complex and its sorption onto Diaion HP- 2 MG, a methacrylic ester copolymer. The optimization step was carried out using factorial design and the variables studied were pH, shaking time and reagent concentration. In the established experimental conditions, lead can be determinate with a limit of detection of 3. 7 Î¼g Lâ 1 lead (N = 20) and a relative standard deviation of 7 % for a lead concentration of 100 Î¼g Lâ 1. The accuracy was confirmed by analysis of a certified reference material, the stream sediment furnished by National Research Centre for Certified Reference Materials (NRCCRM), China (GBW 07310). Effect of other ions in the procedure proposed was also studied. The method was applied for lead determination in real samples of water, tea, soil and <b>dust.</b> <b>Tests</b> of addition/recovery in the experiments for lead determination in water samples revealed that the proposed procedure could be applied satisfactorily for analysis of these samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} phosphine {{resistance of}} two strains of Cryptolestes ferrugineus {{was measured by}} the method of knockdown at 2 mg/L of phosphine. The efficacy of five inert dusts (Puliangtai, G- 1, G- 2, G- 3 and G- 4) against the adults of two strains (JXCF and YYCF) of C. ferrugineus was assessed. The insects were exposed to the five inert dust on filter paper inside petri dishes for 1 day at 30 Â± 1 Â°C and 65 Â± 1 % r. h. Then, the adults were held for 4 days with food at the same conditions without inert dust in surface bioassay. Also, they were placed in 25 Â± 1 Â°C and 65 Â± 1 % r. h. in grain bioassay. In surface bioassay, the two strains of C. ferrugineus were susceptible to the five inert dusts at 0. 08 g/mÂ² and 0. 1 g/mÂ². G- 3 appeared the most effective against both strains, since its efficacy was 3 - 6 times higher than the other four <b>dusts</b> <b>tested.</b> YYCF strain was more susceptible than JXCF, with 1 - 4 times higher mortality level. The five inert dusts were also effective in grain bioassay. This research indicated that inert dusts were effective on phosphine-resistant C. ferrugineus populations...|$|R

At present, China is undergone its revising the national standards, therefore, the development of major air filter standards between America and Europe is compared here. Diameter distribution of KCl aerosol used in ASHRAE 52. 2 is similar with atmospheric dust, but research for <b>test</b> <b>dust</b> representing actual condition is still needed. Concepts for electrostatic discharge between Europe and America are different, and classification upon minimum life efficiency (MLE) is recommended. Final pressure drop in EN 779 : 2002 should be lowered to reflect reality, and particle rebound phenomena should be included. High efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) should be installed upstream of tested filter. Measures to <b>test</b> <b>dust</b> holding capacity is recommended to be incorporated in ASHARE 52. 2...|$|R
