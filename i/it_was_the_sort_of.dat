40|$|This paper {{provides}} two results concerning Order-Sorted Logic with Term Declarations. First, we {{show that}} linear term declarations can be transformed conservatively into function declarations, thus yielding elementary signatures. This provides a simple proof of the well known fact that unification in linear signatures is decidable. A similar transformation exists for semi-linear term declarations, resulting in shallow term declarations. Secondly, we provide an inference system transforming sort constraints over an arbitrary signature into almost solved form. The step from almost solved forms to solved forms requires a procedure to decide emptiness of sort intersections, which is not possible in general. This shows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> intersection problem that accounts for the undecidability of unification in signatures with term declarations...|$|R

For it was a defect in Jimmy's character--one of his many defects--that he loathed and scorned minor poetry and considered minor poets, especially when feminine, an unnecessary affliction. He declined to believe that Ann, his Ann, a girl full of the finest traits of character, the girl who had been capable of encouraging a comparative stranger to break the law by impersonating her cousin Jimmy Crocker, could also be capable of writing The Lonely Heart and other poems. He skimmed through the first one he came across, and shuddered.
