50|$|Cold foil {{evolved from}} <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping.</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> is mostly used offline when foil is {{required}} on a preprinted substrate, {{such as in}} the manufacture of greeting cards and special occasion ribbons. Hot foil is economical but very slow. The types of graphics that can be applied are usually limited to text and bold images. Hot foil is not usable with heat-sensitive substrates such as polyethylene, vinyl, or shrink film.|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} known as <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>{{stamping}},</b> foil stamping machines uses heat to transfer metallic foil to a solid surface. Examples of items that are foil stamped include annual reports, pocket folders, product packaging, note cards/thank you cards, business cards, envelopes and letterhead. The foil stamp is a permanent process.|$|E
50|$|Cold foil {{takes the}} idea of <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> and makes it more {{convenient}} and cost-effective. The cold foil functions like an additional ink and is actually a UV-curable, very fast lamination adhesive and can be bonded in-line in a single run using a printing plate for either flexographic web printing or offset sheet-fed printing. It can be applied precisely with high resolution, even for fine structures such as raster gradients and thin lines. Typeface is legible from about 5 points upwards and has excellent edge definition. Cold foil printing needs smooth surface substrates for excellent image quality.|$|E
50|$|This {{grade is}} made purely from {{bleached}} chemical pulp and usually has a mineral or synthetic pigment coated top surface {{in one or more}} layers (C1S) and often also a coating on the reverse side (C2S). It is a medium density board with good printing properties for graphical and packaging end uses and is perfectly white both inside and out. It can easily be cut, creased, <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamped</b> and embossed. Its other properties, such as being hygienic and pure with no smell and taste, make it usable for packaging aroma and flavour sensitive products such as chocolate, cigarettes and cosmetics.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept of hot stamped conductors on wires in a nano- or microscale. The process of producing arrays of wires selectively on the desired contact pad by electroplating of a template foil is described. The new concept provides electrical conductivity by penetration of wire arrays through the conductive layer of a <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> <b>foil.</b> Because {{of the small}} {{cross section of the}} wires, a large surface provides a low resistance between the contact pad and the conductor. With this process the non-conductive layer of the <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> <b>foil</b> {{does not have to be}} removed. The wires are flexible and provide a good alternative for electrical connection of flexible electronics. Also the process temperature is low, which makes it possible to use materials which are sensitive to high temperatures. When renouncing the use of temperature sensitive materials, this method can be applicable for high temperature operation due to the lack of adhesive or solder...|$|R
50|$|The {{printing}} {{methods used}} in printing wedding invitation cards {{have seen a}} radical transformation with technological advancement. As the invitation wording and design hint the wedding style, {{in the same manner}} the printing technique chosen will conveys how formal the whole wedding ceremony is. The type printing technique selected will also have a big impact on the wedding budget, and it will help in choosing the design and paper type. With the availability of high standard printing techniques, Hindu invitations can be printed by diverse methods like flocking, embossing, <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping,</b> laser cuttings, raised silk screen printing, offset Printing, Letterpress, Thermography, Engraved Wedding Invitations and many more to give a new multidimensional look to Hindu invitation cards. So it all depends on what kind of look is desired and what is the allocated budget for it.|$|E
40|$|Magistrska naloga obravnava področje reprodukcije zlate barve na vinskih etiketah. Glede na to, da je vinska etiketa obraz vina, je v etiketni industriji pomemben tako oblikovni kot tehnološki vidik grafike. Predvsem pa je v nasičenem trgu pomembna dodana vrednost etikete, ki jo lahko dosežemo z zlato barvo. Primerjali smo kakovost treh tehnologij za reproduciranje zlate barve na samolepilni etiketni papir v zvitku, in sicer klasični vroči zlatotisk ter alternativni tehnologiji, to sta digitalni tisk (elektrofotografija) ter sitotisk. Ugotavljali smo, katera izmed tehnologij omogoča kakovostnejše odtise in je racionalnejša. Na površinsko neobdelanih odtisih testne forme smo izvedli analizo tiskovnega materiala in analizo odtisov. Analiza tiskovnega materiala je pokazala dobro pregibno odpornost uporabljenih etiketnih papirjev in minimalno hrapavost. Analiza odtisov pa je glede na izvedene teste pokazala različne rezultate. Vizualna ocena in slikovna analiza sta pokazali najboljše rezultate pri odtisih, upodobljenih z vročim zlatotiskom in elektrofotografijo. Pri meritvah adhezivnosti in abrazivnosti odtisov se je najbolje izkazal odtis, upodobljen s tehnologijo sitotiska. Po izpostavljenosti odtisov na alkohol je očitna degradacija samo na odtisu, upodobljenim z vročim zlatotiskom. Manjšo deformacijo odtisov pa sta povzročila tudi {{detergent}} in voda, medtem ko olje ni povzročilo očitnih sprememb na odtisih. Ugotovili smo, da je na umetno staranje najmanj odporen odtis, upodobljen s sitotiskom. Globoko zamrzovanje pa je največje spremembe povzročilo na odtisu, upodobljenim z vročim zlatotiskom. Vsi vzorci imajo dobro svetlobno obstojnost. Iz rezultatov meritev smo ugotovili, da lahko digitalna tehnologija vsekakor konkurira vročemu zlatemu tisku pri reprodukciji zlate barve na vinske etikete. Na koncu praktičnega dela smo oblikovali kolekcijo vinskih etiket z zlatimi in srebnimi elementi. Etiketo smo odtisnili z digitalno tehnologijo (elektofotografija). Tisk nam je omogočil tiskalnik Xeikon 3030. Tiskali smo na metaliziran etiketni papir SilverVac. The master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{deals with}} the field of reproduction of a golden colour on wine labels. Considering {{the fact that the}} wine label is the face of the wine, the design and the technical aspect of the graphic is important in the labelling industry. Above all, in the saturated market, the added value of the label is important, which can be achieved with a golden colour. We compared the quality of the three technologies for the reproduction of a golden colour on self-adhesive label paper in rolls: classic <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> and alternative technologies such as digital printing (electrophotography) and screen printing. We have examined which of the technologies enables better quality imprints and is more rational. We analysed the printing material and the imprints on the surface of raw and untreated imprints of the test form. The analysis of the printing material showed good flexural resistance of the used labels and minimal roughness. The analysis of the imprints showed different results according to the tests carried out. Visual evaluation and image analysis showed the best results in the imprints made with <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> and electrophotography. In the adhesiveness and abrasiveness measurements of the imprints, the imprint illustrated with screen printing technology was the best. After being exposed to alcohol, the obvious degradation is only on the imprint made with <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping.</b> Minor deformation of the imprints was also caused by detergent and water, while oil did not cause obvious changes. We have found out that the least resistant to artificial aging is imprint made with screen printing. Deep freezing, however, caused the biggest changes on the imprint made with <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping.</b> All samples have good light resistance. The results showed that digital technology can certainly compete with the <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> when reproducing a golden colour on wine labels. At the end of the practical work we created a collection of wine labels with golden and silver elements. The label was printed with digital technology (electrophotography). The print was enabled by the Xeikon 3030 printer. We printed on the metallised label paper SilverVac...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} techniques {{that can be}} used for the decoration of polymeric substrates, dye sublimation, self-colouring, paint spraying, granular injection paint technology, pad printing, in-mould decoration and <b>hot</b> <b>foil</b> <b>stamping.</b> Dye sublimation was selected for this research as it was found to be both the most relevant technology area for IDT Systems Limited and the least understood. It is a customisable digital process which uses specialist Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK) inkjet-able dyes that are transferred into a substrate via a carrier. During the process heat is applied which transforms the dyes from a solid into a gas phase. Analysis of literature identified a number of knowledge gaps, which are addressed during this research and detailed in this report. Initial experimentation concluded that the sublimation dyes can penetrate a range of commercially available amorphous polymers, comparably to semi-crystalline types. These findings dispute previously published work, but these also lacked rigorously recorded methodologies to confirm comparable data. All of the materials, equipment and methodologies used throughout this research were therefore developed in this report. Further detailed experimentation was completed, using amorphous polycarbonate, (PC) and semi-crystalline polybutylene terephthalate, (PBT) focusing on the process time and temperature to understand their influence on the level of dye penetration. The results revealed that increasing the process temperature and time improves the level of dye penetration and that comparable penetration levels were noted at 140 - 180 oC. Further research identified the importance of free volume in the polymer, this increases in size and connectivity as temperature increases above the glass transition points. Additional experimentation confirms that the free volume enables the dyes to penetrate into the polymer. Characterisation of the CMYK sublimation dyes was completed using Differential Scanning Calorimetry enabling the thermal transitions to be identified. Visual experimentation confirmed that the dyes start and finish sublimation between 145 - 210 oC. As no software tool existed to visualise the dye penetration, one was developed using MatLab. The tool imports and then interpolates the data and graphically outputs it for the user. This allows a quicker set up time of the process and reduces the number of samples to be destroyed. As a direct result of the innovations described in this report, the industrial sponsor has benefited with an increase in commercial exploitation. Aspects of this research have been published, presented and a patent has been published, details are provided within...|$|E

40|$|The {{patterning}} of multilayered <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> <b>foil</b> by {{excimer laser}} has been examined {{in terms of}} irradiation parameters and layer structure. The foil consisted of (a) an upper layer of lacquer, (b) intermediate layers of polymer and Al and (c) a base layer {{of low melting point}} resin. Ablation of the foil was characterised by a sequential removal of the layers at a threshold level of fluence and number of pulses. For ablation by single pulse, the upper layer of lacquer (~ 1000 nm) was removed at 20 J/cm 2 and intermediate layers (~ 3500 nm) at 20 - 30 J/cm 2. Multiple pulses (= 5) at fluences of = 40 J/cm 2 resulted in ablation through the base resin layer. Ablation through the layers was accompanied by the formation of molten debris and resulted in the exposure of undamaged interfaces...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{printing}} process via hot embossing of either grating or micro-mirror microstructures {{has been demonstrated}} in thermoplastic acrylic lacquer. Embossing experiments were performed in the temperature range 100 - 150 °C and at 80 kN force. The range of microstructures has included a dot-matrix hologram, grating-based optically variable devices (OVDs) and a micro-mirror based OVD. High quality replicas of each type of device have been fabricated using this process. Embossed replicas of grating-based OVDs have shown optical effects including image switching and color movement. For devices based on micro-mirror arrays, the embossed replicas have shown an optically variable switch between a portrait and a non-portrait image. Printing via an embossing process offers the possibility of incorporating optically variable devices into documents {{without the use of}} <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> <b>foil.</b> This is particularly relevant for documents based on polymeric substrates such as credit cards and polymer banknotes...|$|R
50|$|A {{hologram}} may be embedded either via hot-stamping foil, wherein {{an extremely}} {{thin layer of}} only a few micrometers of depth is bonded into the paper or a plastic substrate by means of a hot-melt adhesive (called a size coat) and heat from a metal die, or it may be directly embossed as holographic paper, or onto the laminate of a card itself.When incorporated with a custom design pattern or logo, hologram <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> <b>foils</b> become security foils that protect credit cards, passports, bank notes and value documents from counterfeiting. Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes. Once stamped on a product, they cannot be removed or forged, enhancing the product at the same time. Also from a security perspective, if stamped, a hologram is a superior security device as {{it is virtually impossible to}} remove from its substrate.|$|R

40|$|Packaging plays {{a crucial}} role in {{communicating}} product benefits to consumers. Oftentimes, designers use high visibility enhancements to differentiate packaging within the competitive array. Although luxury brands commonly use enhanced graphical and printing techniques to convey high quality products, many private label package designers are also utilizing enhancements to attract attention to their products. This research sought to understand how incorporating <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> to the primary panel of fast moving consumer good packaging will affect consumer attention and purchase preference. Through the collection of quantitative data, consumer attention and purchase preference were evaluated. Three different products were selected for evaluation for the study: popcorn, cereal, and boxed pasta dinners. A total of 172 participants completed the study, which took place in a realistic and immersive shopping environment (CUshop™). Two eye tracking metrics were collected using mobile eye tracking technology. Participants completed a qualitative survey, which recorded basic demographic information. Significance tests were conducted to test for statistical differences in consumer attention behavior as well as purchase decision between the foil and control packages. It was determined that <b>foil</b> <b>stamping</b> did significantly (α = 0. 05) affect consumer attention towards the respective product compared to the control, yet the effect was not consistent.
