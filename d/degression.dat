30|$|The {{described}} {{development is}} driven both by demand-side and supply-side arguments. The latter are, for example, {{due to the}} aforementioned cost <b>degressions</b> in ICT {{but they are also}} the outcome of directed industrial policies. Firms are embedded in international and fragmented value creation chains while governments wish to support international competitiveness and welfare in the home country. Aside from direct interventions, the government also may impact the technology development by setting standards or if it appears as a big user. This appears like a guarantee for a certain level of demand thereby reducing uncertainty inherent in innovation processes at the firm level (e.g. Bresnahan 2010 or Grossman and Helpman 1991). Demand-side arguments in the context of service robots mainly arise from future trends; among them, demographic change requires more and also novel types of services.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} half of 2014, 28.5% of gross {{electricity}} production in Germany came from renewable sources. [...] The Federal Environment Ministry estimated that renewables were to save 87 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2012. The average level of feed-in tariff was 9.53 ¢/kWh in 2005 (compared to an average cost of displaced energy of 4.7 ¢/kWh). In 2004, the total level of reallocated EEG surcharges was €2.4 billion, at a cost per consumer of 0.56 ¢/kWh (3% of household electricity costs). By 2013, the figure had risen to €20.4 billion. The tariffs are lowered every year to encourage more efficient production of renewable energy. By 2014, the EEG surcharge - which pays for the additional costs through feed-in tariffs - had increased to 6.24 ¢/kWh. As of July 2014, the regular reductions (<b>degressions)</b> were 1.5% per year for electricity from onshore wind and 1% per month for electricity from photovoltaics.|$|R
2500|$|More specifically, the {{photovoltaic}} tariffs {{were reduced}} somewhat, {{but not enough}} to affect uptake. [...] The <b>degression</b> for PV was tightened from 5% to 8–10%, {{depending on the size of}} installation.

[...] A 'flexible <b>degression</b> cap' was introduced, under which the <b>degression</b> rate could be adjusted to keep the uptake of photovoltaics within a specified corridor. [...] The support for onshore wind improved. [...] The initial tariff was raised, the repowering (when old turbines are replaced by new) bonus (Repoweringbonus) was increased, and an additional system service bonus was granted for specified technical contributions (Systemdienstleistungen or SDL), including the ability to maintain voltage if the transmission grid fails. [...] The tariff for offshore wind was raised substantially. [...] An additional 'early starter bonus' was offered for offshore wind farms entering operation before 2015. [...] In parallel to the EEG, a separate loan program of €5 billion was established, to be administered by the state-owned KfW bank, with the goal of reaching 25GW installed capacity for wind by 2030. [...] Support of biomass was also increased, with special bonuses for a number of different biomass types. [...] Biomass must also comply with specified ecological requirements to be eligible, these requirements being contained in a separate 'sustainability ordinance' (Nachhaltigkeitsverordnung or BioSt-NachV). [...] The hydroelectricity tariffs were raised considerably and particularly for micro and small power plants. [...] The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised considerably too, as was the cogeneration bonus. [...] An additional 'early starter bonus' was introduced for geothermal projects put into operation before 2016. [...] A 'green power privilege' (Grünstromprivileg) was introduced, which exempted electricity suppliers with a minimum quota of renewables from the EEG surcharge under certain circumstances.

40|$|Abstract—In {{practical}} systems, {{due to the}} time-varying radio channel, {{the channel}} state information (CSI) may not be known well at both transmitters and receivers. For most of the current multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) schemes, they suffer a significant <b>degression</b> on the performance due to the mismatch between the true and estimated CSI. To alleviate the performance penalty, a robust downlink multiuser MIMO scheme is proposed in this paper by exploiting the channel mean and antenna correlation. These channel statistics are more stable than the imperfect CSI estimation in the time-varying radio channel, and they are used, in the proposed scheme, to minimize the total mean squared error under the sum power constraint. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates the performance loss due to the CSI mismatch...|$|E
