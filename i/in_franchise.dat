5000|$|The boom <b>in</b> <b>{{franchising}}</b> did {{not take}} place until after World War II.

The practice ended around 1562 but spread to other endeavors. For example, in 17th century England franchisees were granted the right to sponsor markets and fairs or operate ferries. There was little growth <b>in</b> <b>franchising,</b> though, until the mid-19th century, when it appeared in the United States for the first time.|$|R
