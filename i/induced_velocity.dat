5000|$|Blade element theory (BET) is a {{mathematical}} process originally designed by William Froude (1878), David W. Taylor (1893) and Stefan Drzewiecki {{to determine the}} behavior of propellers. It involves breaking a blade down into several small parts then determining the forces {{on each of these}} small blade elements. These forces are then integrated along the entire blade and over one rotor revolution in order to obtain the forces and moments produced by the entire propeller or rotor. One of the key difficulties lies in modelling the <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> on the rotor disk. Because of this the blade element theory is often combined with the momentum theory to provide additional relationships necessary to describe the <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> on the rotor disk (for further details see Blade Element Momentum Theory). At the most basic level of approximation a uniform <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> on the disk is assumed: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} tools {{which allow}} an advanced investigation of {{spatial and temporal}} progress of segmented vortex structures in flow fields with the consideration of vortex dynamics. The work {{is based on the}} local and Eulerian detection and segmentation of vortex structures and the visualization of these structures with recent visualization methods, e. g. the application of LIC-textures on the surfaces of 3 d structures. The second step is the tracking of vortex structures based on the time-dependent integration of vortex core lines. In the third step, according to the vortex dynamics, the individual degree of impact is determined by computation of <b>induced</b> <b>velocities</b> via the Biot-Savart equation for each vortex. The <b>induced</b> <b>velocities</b> are used to determine the induced kinetic energy and enstrophy, which allows the evaluation of a global value of influence for each vortex structure, that can be tracked in time. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{partially}} submerged propeller {{theory was}} developed by employing a singularity distribution method. Unsteady pressure doublets and pressure sources represented the blade camber and blade-and-cavity thickness respectively. The <b>induced</b> <b>velocities</b> were derived by reducing the formula to a lifting-line configuration. The free-surface effect was considered by use of the image method. The <b>induced</b> <b>velocities</b> contained the singular integrals of 5 th order, which are usually numerical unstable. An {{effort was made to}} derive numerically stable formulae from these singular equations by applying a method similar to the induction-factor method of Morgan & Wrench (1965) and Lerbs (1952) used for steady-state fully wetted propeller problems. These new formulae are not only applicable to the present partially submerged ventilated propeller problem, but also to general unsteady subcavitating and cavitating propeller problems such as propeller starting-up and non-periodic loading problems. By combining the two-dimensional water entry-and-exit theory of Wang (1979), the thrust and torque coefficients were calculated for representative partially submerged propellers and favourably compared with the experimental data...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively the {{variation}} of the <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> along the radius can be modeled by breaking the blade down into small annuli and applying the conservation of mass, momentum and energy to every annulus.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is proposed for calculating the rotor performance and aerodynamic blade forces for Darrieus wind turbines with curved blades. The {{method of analysis}} uses a multiple-streamtube model, divided into two parts: one modeling the upstream half-cycle of the rotor and the other, the downstream half-cycle. The upwind and downwind components of the <b>induced</b> <b>velocities</b> at each level of the rotor were obtained using the principle of two actuator disks in tandem. Variation of the <b>induced</b> <b>velocities</b> in the {{two parts of the}} rotor produces larger forces in the upstream zone and smaller forces in the downstream zone. Comparisons of the overall rotor performance with previous methods and field test data show the important improvement obtained with the present model. The calculations were made using the computer code CARDAA developed at IREQ. The double-multiple streamtube model presented has two major advantages: it requires a much shorter computer time than the three-dimensional vortex model and is more accurate than multiple-streamtube model in predicting the aerodynamic blade loads...|$|R

Now, if {{the change}} in lift distribution is known at given lift section, it is possible to predict how that section influences the lift over its neighbors: the vertical <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> (upwash or downwash, [...] ) can be quantified using the velocity distribution within a vortex, and related to a change in effective angle of attack over neighboring sections.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, several {{theories}} were developed. The momentum theory or disk actuator theory - a theory describing a mathematical model of an ideal propeller - was developed by W.J.M. Rankine (1865), Alfred George Greenhill (1888) and R.E. Froude (1889). The propeller is modelled as an infinitely thin disc, inducing a constant velocity along the axis of rotation. This disc creates a flow around the propeller. Under certain mathematical premises of the fluid, there can be extracted a mathematical connection between power, radius of the propeller, torque and <b>induced</b> <b>velocity.</b> Friction is not included.|$|E
50|$|When in the {{unstable}} configuration, {{for a particular}} harmonic component of the initial perturbation, the torque on the interface creates vorticity that will tend to increase the misalignment of the gradient vectors. This in turn creates additional vorticity, leading to further misalignment. This concept is depicted in the figure, where {{it is observed that}} the two counter-rotating vortices have velocity fields that sum at the peak and trough of the perturbed interface. In the stable configuration, the vorticity, and thus the <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> field, will be in a direction that decreases the misalignment and therefore stabilizes the system.|$|E

The {{most common form of}} this factor is given below where B is the number of blades, R is the outer radius and r is the local radius. The definition of F is based on actuator disk models and not directly applicable to BEM. However the most common application multiplies <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> term by F in the momentum equations. As in the momentum equation there are many variations for applying F, some argue that the mass flow should be corrected in either the axial equation, or both axial and tangential equations. Others have suggested a second tip loss term to account for the reduced blade forces at the tip. Shown below are the above momentum equations with the most common application of F: ...|$|E
50|$|Muscles possess {{nonlinear}} visco-elastic properties {{when they}} contract. This property can autocorrect movements when a muscle {{is forced to}} change its length, and at a velocity different from that with which it was originally commanded. Such automatic correction is useful when a commanded action is perturbated, for example, if a step goes into a hole as this causes the foot to unexpectedly stretch down. The nonlinear visco-elastic properties of muscles interact with these perturbation <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> and length differences such that they counteract directly, as they happen, the effects upon {{the body of the}} perturbation.Part of the resistance to perturbation is passive, by means of the nonlinear increase in passive tension and joint torques produced by muscular and other soft tissues. Tissue prestress is a preflexive property that constitutes a basal level of passive tension which, due to its presence in antagonistic tissues of a joint, increases joint passive stiffness and stability.|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} method {{has been developed}} to treat the unsteady aerodynamic interaction between a helicopter rotor, wake, and fuselage. Two existing codes, a lifting line-prescribed wake rotor analysis and a source panel fuselage analysis, were modified and coupled to allow prediction of unsteady fuselage pressures and airloads. A prescribed displacement technique was developed to position the rotor wake about the fuselage. Also coupled into the method were optional blade dynamics or rigid blade performance analyses to set the rotor operating conditions. Sensitivity studies were performed to {{determine the influence of}} the wake and fuselage geometry on the computational results.

30|$|Currently, {{significant}} number of approaches, theories, and models are developed to predict wind turbine performance. Although high fidelity CFD continues to be perused[1, 2, 3], it remains extremely costly as far as computational resources, analysis time, and required expertise. Among lower fidelity approaches, methods, and models, blade element momentum (BEM) method is the oldest and remains {{to be the most}} widely used method for predicting wind turbine performance. It was originally developed by Glauert[4] who combined blade element theory and momentum theory to analyze the airplane propeller performance. Blade element theory assumes that blades can be divided into multiple elements, which can act independently as two-dimensional airfoils. The forces and moments can be calculated separately then summed to obtain the overall blade forces and moments. The other half of BEM method, the momentum theory, assumes that wind turbine harvests energy from incoming flow; thereby, the flow is subjected to pressure and moment losses. Using momentum theory, <b>induced</b> <b>velocities</b> from the momentum loss can be calculated. These <b>induced</b> <b>velocities</b> can affect the flow over blades and the forces on them. By combining the two theories and setting up an iterative process, forces and momentum on blades can be obtained.|$|R

5000|$|... d) Starting flow {{at large}} {{angle of attack}} for wings with sharp leading edges. If, as for a flat plate, the leading edge is also sharp, then {{vortices}} also shed {{at the leading edge}} and the role of leading edge vortices is two-fold：(1) they are lift increasing when they are still close to the leading edge, so that they elevate the Wagner lift curve,(2) they are detrimental to lift when they are convected to the trailing edge, inducing a new trailing edge vortex spiral moving in the lift decreasing direction. For this type of flow a vortex force line (VFL) map [...] can be used to understand the effect of the different vortices in a variety of situations (including more situations than starting flow) and may be used to improve vortex control to enhance or reduce the lift. The vortex force line map is a two dimensional map on which vortex force lines are displayed. For a vortex at any point in the flow, its lift contribution is proportional to its speed, its circulation and the cosine of the angle between the streamline and the vortex force line. Hence the vortex force line map clearly shows whether a given vortex is lift producing or lift detrimental. [...] e) Lagally Theorem. When a (mass) source is fixed outside the body, a force correction due to this source can be expressed as the product of the strength of outside source and the <b>induced</b> <b>velocity</b> at this source by all the causes except this source. This is known as the Lagally theorem.For two-dimensional inviscid flow, the classical Kutta Joukowski theorem predicts a zero drag. When, however, there is vortex outside the body, there is a vortex induced drag, in a form similar to the induced lift.|$|E
