40|$|In {{spline rolling}} process, the billet is mainly driven by {{frictional}} moment at initial forming stage that from starting rolling to billet/workpiece rotated half circle. If {{the rotation of}} billet is not normally driven by rolling die, then the motion between billet and rolling die is not coordinated, and then dividing precision of <b>external</b> <b>spline</b> will be reduced. Thus, the rotatory condition of rolled billet was established in this work. The rotatory condition for the rolling process of spline with even number of teeth {{is different from that}} with an odd number of teeth. However, the changing trends for both rotatory conditions are the same. The results indicated that (i) the rotatory condition can be improved when the friction between die and billet increases or the outside diameter of rolling die increases, (ii) the rotatory condition for odd number of teeth is better than that for even number of teeth, and (iii) the outside diameter of rolling die should be five times greater than the diameter of billet before rolling according to the rotatory condition. The reasonable decrement can be selected by comprehensive considering of rotatory condition and geometry of rolling die...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 85) Today???s Mechanical Engineering {{field is}} growing rapidly in designing techniques to manufacture Splines and Gears. Over the decades, numerous methods and manufacturing processes {{have been used}} in making the various kinds of Splines based on various criteria, including applications, reliability, life time, processing time and manufacturing cost. This thesis is also carried out with the same notion of experimenting to manufacture an <b>External</b> Involute <b>Spline</b> cutting tool using state-of-art CAD/CAM package and current trend CNC machines like Brother HS- 70 A Wire Electrical Discharge Machine and HAAS VF- 2 Vertical Milling Machine. This thesis is divided into two distinct phases: (1) analysis phase and (2) manufacturing phase. The analysis phase is dedicated to the study and simulation of involute splines, while the manufacturing phase covers the actual manufacturing process. This thesis starts with the extensive study of splines and the two different kinds of splines; a) Internal Involute <b>splines</b> and b) <b>External</b> Involute <b>splines.</b> The primary objective is to design the internal involute spline in Dassault Systems??? SolidWorks??. This entire design process is to be automated with embedding Microsoft EXCEL Spreadsheet with SolidWorks. Using this EXCEL spreadsheet, spline design parameters iterations are carried out in SolidWorks with the help of design tables. Based on the calculations made in EXCEL Spreadsheets and CAD design in SolidWorks, CNC machining parameters are defined in DP Technology???s CAM package ESPRIT and the machining process as well as tool/insert design is simulated. The main objective is to manufacture a spline cutting tool using Wire EDM machining process. For this Solid Carbide Machine Inserts are chosen as a cutting tool which cuts the <b>external</b> <b>splines.</b> Once the machine insert was manufactured, it was tested on 6061 Aluminum test specimen and successfully cut on 4340 Steel Drive shaft on the CNC Milling machine. These <b>external</b> <b>splines</b> are the inverse of the Involute splines on the drive shaft hub of the FSAE Formula one car. It can be concluded that, the involute spline cutting tool was successfully manufactured and tested by cutting <b>external</b> involute <b>splines</b> on drive shaft which match with internal splines on drive hub...|$|R
500|$|Pot broaches are cut {{the inverse}} of an {{internal}} broach; they cut the outside diameter of a cylindrical workpiece. They are named after the pot looking fixture in which the broaches are mounted; the fixture {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "pot". The pot is designed to hold multiple broaching tools concentrically over its entire length. The broach is held stationary while the workpiece is pushed or pulled through it. This has replaced hobbing for some involute gears and cutting <b>external</b> <b>splines</b> and slots.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>splines,</b> {{internal}} and <b>external.</b> <b>External</b> <b>splines</b> may be broached, shaped (for example on a gear shaping machine), milled, hobbed, rolled, ground or extruded. There are fewer methods available for manufacturing internal splines due to accessibility restrictions. Methods include those listed above with the exception of hobbing (no access). Often, with internal splines, the splined portion of the part may not have a through-hole, which precludes use of a pull / push broach or extrusion-type method. Also, if the part is small {{it may be difficult to}} fit a milling or grinding tool into the area where the splines are machined.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} “Failure Analysis of Internal splines in Torsion Shaft” of “TPE 331 - 5 - 252 D - GARRET ENGINE” {{which is used}} in Dornier aircraft. Garret Engine {{is a type of}} air {{breathing}} engine. It comes under the category of Turboprop engines of Gas turbine engine. As separate shafts are used for propeller and turbine, this aids them to rotate at different RPM. A torsion shaft is used to transmit the torque from main shaft to propeller shaft. Torsion shaft is used to give a deflection which is also used to measure the torque of the engine. This torsion shaft is internally connected with the main power transmission shaft and its other end is coupled to a coupler shaft with engagement of its internal <b>splines</b> to the <b>external</b> <b>splines</b> of coupler shaft. Further this coupler connects to the gearing system and transmits power to the propeller shaft. Due to Continues variable load over internal splines, it is subjected to high rate of wear and tear. This problem can be rectified by Failure Mode Analysis Method, in which heat treatment process of torsion shaft is being carried out. Two test pieces are heat treated separately at different temperatures of 5800 C and 5400 C at variable time durations. Tuffriding which is a Liquid nitriding process is done with this two test pieces and results are analyzed. The hardness of the material is increased to desired values and its life time is also increased which overcomes the problem...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Web users often rely on {{expectations}} about the availability of knowledge on the Web. In this paper we test intuitive predictions about the availability of knowledge on the Web about a set of concepts from information science. Intuition {{is defined as a}} general expectation of a tendency, based on repeated observations of the <b>external</b> (knowledge) environment. <b>Spline</b> interpolation is applied to the available data, which predicts slight decline of the number of hits on concepts like “artificial intelligence ” and “data mining”. The number of publications on “information retrieval ” and “recommender systems ” is expected to increase, also in the context of new information systems for cardiology. Key words: Information retrieval, knowledge availability, spline interpolation. 1...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic models {{explained}} {{through this}} paper solve the homologous image coordinates search and the image orientation for a CCD of a simplified MMS for 3 D-surveys. A first dynamic model for such an orientation, extending the usual “direct method” (but with GPS measures only) with the “indirect method”, has been issued and tested some years ago. By a dynamic approach again, a matching model for an image sequence acquired with only one CCD, has been also recently proposed, so self-extracting points for relative orientation. In this way, the flow chart for the dynamic analysis of these image sequences only involves, as user’s actions, the point collimation in the first image portraying it. In fact, first, the “matching algorithm” automatically extracts the homologous point in the second image (with external orientation only approximated by “cubic splines functions”). Therefore, the “orientation algorithm”, using coplanarity condition on such a points couple, allows to improve the <b>external</b> orientation from <b>spline</b> approximated values to better ones...|$|R
