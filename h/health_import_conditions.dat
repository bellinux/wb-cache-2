40|$|The {{import of}} protein into chloroplasts is {{mediated}} by translocon components {{located in the}} chloroplast outer (the Toc proteins) and inner (the Tic proteins) envelope membranes. To identify intermediate steps during active import, we used sucrose density gradient centrifugation and blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) to identify complexes of translocon components associated with precursor proteins under active <b>import</b> <b>conditions</b> instead of arrested binding <b>conditions.</b> <b>Importing</b> precursor proteins in solubilized chloroplast membranes formed a two-peak distribution in the sucrose density gradient. The heavier peak was in a similar position as the previously reported Tic/Toc supercomplex and was too large to be analyzed by BN-PAGE. The BN-PAGE analyses of the lighter peak revealed that precursors accumulated {{in at least two}} complexes. The first complex migrated at a position close to the ferritin dimer (approximately 880 kDa) and contained only the Toc components. Kinetic analyses suggested that this Toc complex represented an earlier step in the import process than the Tic/Toc supercomplex. The second complex in the lighter peak migrated at the position of the ferritin trimer (approximately 1320 kDa). It contained, in addition to the Toc components, Tic 110, Hsp 93, and an hsp 70 homolog, but not Tic 40. Two different precursor proteins were shown to associate with the same complexes.

40|$|Translocation and folding of {{proteins}} imported into mitochondria are mediated by two matrix-localized chaperones, mhsp 70 and hsp 60. In order {{to investigate whether}} these chaperones act sequentially or in parallel, we studied their interaction with newly imported precursor proteins in isolated yeast mitochondria by coimmunoprecipitation. All precursors bound transiently to mhsp 70. Release from mhsp 70 required hydrolysis of ATP and did not immediately generate a tightly folded protein. For example, after imported mouse dihydrofolate reductase (a soluble monomeric enzyme) had been released from mhsp 70, folding to a protease resistant conformation occurred only after a lag and was much slower than the release. Under standard <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> no significant association of DHFR with hsp 60 could be detected. Similarly, newly imported hsp 60 subunit was released from mhsp 70 as an incompletely folded, unassembled intermediate which accumulated at low temperature and assembled to hsp 60 14 -mer at higher temperature in an ATP-dependent manner. Mas 2 p (the larger subunit of the MAS-encoded processing protease) first bound to mhsp 70, then to hsp 60, and only then assembled with its partner subunit, Mas 1 p. We propose that ATP-dependent release from mhsp 70 is insufficient to cause folding of imported proteins and that assembly of hsp 60 and Mas 2 p requires sequential, ATP-dependent interactions with mhsp 70 and hsp 60...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of known vacuolar proteins transit through the secretory pathway, two vacuole-resident proteins have been identified that reach this organelle by an alternate pathway. These polypeptides are targeted to the vacuole directly from the cytoplasm by a novel import mechanism. The best characterized protein that uses this pathway is aminopeptidase I (API). API is synthesized as a cytoplasmic precursor containing an amino-terminal propeptide that is cleaved off when the protein reaches the vacuole. To dissect the biochemistry of this pathway, we have reconstituted the targeting of API in vitro in a permeabilized cell system. Based on several criteria, the in vitro import assay faithfully reconstitutes the in vivo reaction. After incubation under <b>import</b> <b>conditions,</b> API is processed by a vacuolar- resident protease, copurifies with a vacuole-enriched fraction, and becomes inaccessible to the cytoplasm. These observations demonstrate that API has passed from the cytoplasm to the vacuole. The reconstituted import process is dependent on time, temperature, and energy. ATP gamma S inhibits this reaction, indicating that API transport is ATP driven. API import is also inhibited by GTP gamma S, suggesting that this process may be mediated by a GTP-binding protein. In addition, in vitro import requires a functional vacuolar ATPase; import is inhibited both {{in the presence of}} the specific V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A 1, and in a yeast strain in which one of the genes encoding a V-ATPase subunit has been disrupted...|$|R

Extraintestinal (muscular) {{sarcocystosis}} and intestinal sarcocystosis are the two known manifestations of disease in humans. In this series of six cases and review, we focus on the invasive extraintestinal ("muscular") form of sarcocystosis in humans. This disease, which until recently was rarely described, has become relevant particularly as an <b>imported</b> <b>condition</b> in travelers due to a recent series of outbreaks reported from Malaysia. Human intestinal sarcocystosis is ubiquitous across the globe. However, absolute numbers of probable and particularly confirmed cases are few, with only several hundred described to date. Characteristically, patients exhibit signs and symptoms either 1 - 2 weeks after exposure, or after 4 - 8 weeks. Whether people remain asymptomatic or develop disease apparently depends on the infecting species, host factors, and the inoculum size. The definitive host(s) remain uncertain, and identification of the animal reservoir(s) requires further research. A better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, as well as its immunological determinants, is hampered by the lack of reliable serological diagnostic methods. Additionally, DNA seems to be contained very effectively within the encysted parasite, thereby rendering PCR detection unreliable. Physicians should suspect the condition in patients with suggestive symptoms and a possible history of exposure.
