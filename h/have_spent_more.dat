At the time Lancashire was one of the strongest footballing regions in the country, with 6 of the 12 founder clubs coming from within the {{boundaries}} of the historic county of Lancashire.

5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that the neck of Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E

5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E
25|$|Hochschild {{cites the}} {{research}} of several historians, many of them Belgian. He refers especially to Jules Marchal, formerly a Belgian colonial civil servant and diplomat who (as Hochschild describes) spent twenty years trying to break Belgian silence about the massacres. The documentation {{was not easy to}} come by; the furnaces of the palace in Brussels are said to <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> than a week burning incriminating papers before Leopold turned over his private Congo to the Belgian nation. For many years Belgian authorities prevented access to what remained of the archives, notably the accounts given by Congolese to the King's Commission.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, USA Today {{revealed}} that Meyer broke J. K. Rowling's record on their bestseller list; the four Twilight books had spent 52 straight {{weeks in the}} top 10. The books <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> than 143 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list. Upon {{the completion of the}} fourth entry in the series, Meyer indicated that Breaking Dawn would be the final novel to be told from Bella Swan's perspective. Midnight Sun was to be a companion novel to the series. It would be a retelling of the events of the novel Twilight, but from the perspective of Edward Cullen. Meyer had hoped to have Midnight Sun published some time shortly after the release of Breaking Dawn, but after an online leak of a rough draft of its first 12 chapters, Meyer chose to delay the project indefinitely. Meyer has decided to pursue non-Twilight related books {{as a result of the}} leak. She made the rough chapters of Midnight Sun available on her website. In 2015, she published a new book in honor of the 10th anniversary of the best-selling franchise, titled Life and Death: Twilight Reimagined, with the genders of the original protagonists switched.|$|E

500|$|David Chater, {{writing in}} The Times, said [...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] was [...] "not quite perfect", as the [...] "spooky" [...] {{elements}} {{suggested that the}} writers [...] "may <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> time with The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville than is strictly healthy". Nonetheless, he felt that [...] "the episode is a distillation of accurate observation that says more about the hope, messiness and disappointment of life {{in half an hour}} than most dramas say over an entire series". There was, he thought, [...] "something infinitely poignant" [...] about the way the episode showed the difference between what could have been and what was.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the use of}} MotionScan was {{critically}} acclaimed for its highly realistic capture of faces, it was criticised for its inability to capture body movements. Many players considered that characters are [...] "dead from the neck down". Game director Brendan McNamara attributed this to players' expectations of realism; [...] "people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of}} the body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games," [...] he said. [...] "We would have loved to <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> time on fine-tuning that for L.A. Noire but it wasn't feasible due to the scope of the scripting and talent involved," [...] said Bao.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a slightly positive review {{and gave it}} a B- rating. He wrote, [...] "The Office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior, but there’s a certain charm to it." [...] McNutt noted that, despite feeling that the episode's description of [...] "Darryl teaches Nellie how to eat a taco" [...] was a poor move on NBC's part, he thought they [...] "could <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> time with Nellie learning how to eat a taco." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode, noting, [...] "For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that actually has a lot going on. Whether the stuff that’s happening is actually meaningful or significant in any way is up for debate, but I actually enjoyed most of this episode." ...|$|E

500|$|With a {{laterally}} and dorsoventrally flexible neck, and {{the possibility}} of using its tail and rearing up on its hind limbs (tripodal ability), Diplodocus would have had the ability to browse at many levels (low, medium, and high), up to around 10m (33ft) from the ground. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to graze below the level of the body, leading some scientists to speculate on whether Diplodocus grazed on submerged water plants, from riverbanks. This concept of the feeding posture is supported by the relative lengths of front and hind limbs. Furthermore, its peg-like teeth may have been used for eating soft water plants. Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited neck movements. They state that the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley et al. were disputed in 2013 and 2014 by Mike Taylor, who analysed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. Taylor found that the neck of Diplodocus was very flexible, and that Cobley [...] et al. were incorrect in that flexibility as implied by bones is less than in reality.|$|E

According to park police, the Holmdel lot where she claimed to have parked was closed that day. Despite her claim to <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> than an hour at the Elks carnival, with Timmy dressed in bright red, the authorities could find no one who had seen her son that night.

2500|$|IGN's Robert Canning {{thought it}} was a fun episode, and said that it [...] "helped that the major flashbacks {{involved}} took place in a fantasy world as to not effect the whole of the show. But even in those flashbacks, the jokes stayed true to what we know of the series. Add to that the great new look of the series and you get a memorable episode from season twenty of The Simpsons." [...] Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict said he had always liked flashback and alternate future episodes, and he thought [...] "Take My Life, Please" [...] put them together in a [...] "clever way". He added: [...] "Maybe it’s all the shiny newness, but I thought {{this was one of the}} best episodes this season.
