Systolic schemes differ from ordinary ones in their edges having a nonnegative integer, called the <b>delay</b> <b>number</b> associated with them.

The buffers are handled in a FIFO way, transmitting data between the corresponding i/o ports of two interconnected processors. The algebraic language which is used to express schemes is different from the most frequently used one, containing composition, pairing and iteration as basic operations. The present language contains sum and a new operation called the “feedback” beyond composition, and only five constants. The axiomatization is carried out in two steps. First we present a set of equational axioms for the class of loop-free schemes, which are called data flowchart schemes. This set of axioms is extended by further axioms describing the syntactic features of the feedback operation...|$|E

The main new features of E-GRP compared to GRID is the ability to work with different cell sizes by giving approximately same results in term of average end-to-end <b>delay,</b> <b>number</b> of overhead packets and delivery ratio in different cell side lengths. It does that by resolving path disconnected problem in grid-based routing protocols. E-GRP also has an efficient election approach comparing to GRID routing protocol.

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve our aims in the experiment, we used {{different}} scenarios of non-congestion events under three different network conditions. First condition is designed to check the throughput of random loss detection according to the rate of packet loss, bandwidth, <b>delay,</b> <b>number</b> of hops, and variation of cwnd size. Thus, in this condition, all packet losses are caused by transmission errors. The second condition aims to cause random loss and packet reordering according to the rate of delay, bandwidth, packet reordering rate, packet loss rate, and percentage of unneccssary retransmissions. Finally, in third condition, we planned to observe the throughput in terms of congestion loss, random loss, and packet reordering according to the rate of queue size, bandwidth, packet loss, delay, and number of hops in order to confirm that TCP NCE is efficient in the co-existence of congestion and non-congestion events.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAirlines {{schedules}} {{are often}} subject to various uncontrollable factors that cause disruptions and delays. These delays not only constitute, for many passengers, the painful part of air travel, but also represent for airlines a significant financial burden. In this paper, {{we present a}} model for building robust aircraft routes that are less vulnerable to disruptions through judiciously distributing slacks to connections where they are most needed operationally. Toward this end, the model assigns legs to aircraft and determines the flights departure times, while maintaining the designated time-slot assignments at airports, and satisfying operational constraints. The considered objective function is a newly proposed surrogate measure of robustness that implicitly captures the robustness both pertaining to aircraft and passenger connections. Computational experiments carried out on real-world-based instances, with up to 1278 flights and 251 aircraft, show that the model yields solutions that are remarkably robust. In particular, a simulation study reveals that the total <b>delays,</b> <b>number</b> of <b>delayed</b> flights, and <b>number</b> of missed connections can be significantly reduced...|$|R

Recent {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) studies have implicated this structure in the transformation of spatial information in memory to guide action, suggesting that memory to motor transformations may be selectively impaired in Parkinson's disease. In order to investigate this possibility we tested a group of Parkinson's disease patients (PDs) using a memory-guided pointing task. Of interest was whether patients showed reduced accuracy in the task as a function of memory load. Twelve PD patients and 13 elderly controls were asked to recall single or four step target sequences with 2 time delays (500 and 3, 500 ms). In all memory-guided conditions PD patients showed increased variability in memory-guided movement end-points.
