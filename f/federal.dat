5|$|If the <b>federal</b> {{property}} is an enclave, then the <b>federal</b> government has exclusive jurisdiction, unless the state reserved rights when it ceded {{the land to}} the <b>federal</b> government. The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a <b>federal</b> crime to violate a state law while at a <b>federal</b> enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by <b>federal</b> law. Under <b>federal</b> law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, the <b>federal</b> {{constitution}} {{provided that}} details concerning the <b>federal</b> institutions, {{such as their}} locations, should {{be taken care of}} by the <b>Federal</b> Assembly (BV 1848 Art. 108). Thus on 28 November 1848, the <b>Federal</b> Assembly voted in majority to locate the seat of government in Berne. And, as a prototypical <b>federal</b> compromise, to assign other <b>federal</b> institutions, such as the <b>Federal</b> Polytechnical School (1854, the later ETH) to Zurich, and other institutions to Lucerne, such as the later SUVA (1912) and the <b>Federal</b> Insurance Court (1917). In 1875, a law (RS 112) fixed the compensations owed by the city of Bern for the <b>federal</b> seat.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} morning, Stuart's eastern pickets at Philomont {{were attacked}} by approaching <b>Federals.</b> In response, he moved his force east to Unison {{at the intersection of}} the turnpike and the major north-south road through the area, thus placing himself between the <b>Federals</b> and D.H.

5000|$|With {{six games}} {{left in the}} season, Bernhard (who once called the <b>Federals</b> [...] "trained gerbils") gave up and sold the <b>Federals</b> to Florida real estate {{developer}} Woody Weiser, who announced plans to move the <b>Federals</b> to Miami as The Spirit of Miami. Weiser quickly signed up Howard Schnellenberger as part-owner, general manager and head coach after the season ended.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Federal</b> Constitution {{adopted in}} 1848 {{is the legal}} {{foundation}} of the modern <b>federal</b> state. It is among the oldest constitutions in the world. A new Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the <b>federal</b> structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines <b>federal</b> jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the <b>federal</b> level: the bicameral parliament (legislative), the <b>Federal</b> Council (executive) and the <b>Federal</b> Court (judicial).|$|E
5|$|A more narrow bail-in process {{pertaining}} to <b>federal</b> observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, a <b>federal</b> court may certify a non-covered jurisdiction to receive <b>federal</b> observers {{if the court}} determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. Jurisdictions certified to receive <b>federal</b> observers under Section 3(a) {{are not subject to}} preclearance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Federals</b> saved {{their best}} game for {{last in the}} 1983 season. Playing at home against the Philadelphia Stars, the <b>Federals</b> shocked the league by {{defeating}} the 15-2 Stars 21 to 14. When all was said and done, despite the fact the <b>Federals</b> were a mere 4-14, there was one positive, they had defeated both teams who later played in the USFL championship game that year.|$|R

2500|$|As Mosby {{approached}} Leesburg his scouts {{reported to}} him {{the presence of the}} <b>Federals</b> under Forbes in the town. In response Mosby led the Rangers into camp west of Leesburg on Catoctin Mountain where the Rangers spent the night. The <b>Federals</b> departed from Leesburg the next morning, July 6, and headed south by Oatlands Mill and on to Aldie. At around 6 p.m. the <b>Federals</b> arrived at the intersection with the Little River Turnpike and [...] stopped to rest {{for an hour or so}} at the Skinner farm near Mount Zion Church. Meanwhile, Mosby entered Leesburg shortly after the <b>Federals</b> left and learned of their withdrawal. He led the Rangers out of town towards Ball's Mill on the Carolina Road, believing that the <b>Federals</b> had returned on the same route they had arrived on. At Ball's Mill Mosby was informed by local citizens of his mistake, whereupon he devised a plan to head southeasterly towards Gum Springs (present day Arcola) and intercept the <b>Federals</b> as they traveled east on the Little River Turnpike.|$|R
5|$|A {{multitude}} of languages {{are used by}} Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians, respectively.

50|$|The Blitz, led {{by former}} Lions and Colts Quarterback Greg Landry, raced out to a 28-0 lead. The <b>Federals</b> were so terrible in the game, the Blitz held Washington to only one first down, and a mere 24 yards total offense in the first half. Chicago led 21-0 before the <b>Federals</b> ever {{recorded}} a second first down. By that time, Landry hit 15 of his first 17 pass attempts, including a 23-yard touchdown pass to Trumaine Johnson. Kim McQuilken had a horrible debut as the <b>Federals</b> quarterback, {{and was replaced by}} back up Mike Hohensee. Hohensee accounted for the <b>Federals</b> only score, a 19-yard pass to Walker Lee.|$|R
5000|$|By 1100 am {{after hours}} of {{fighting}} the CSA continued to push back the <b>federals</b> with their heavy guns. The <b>federals</b> stated in their reports that the CSA was positioned as to every advance by the Feds they were getting slaughtered. Here Col.

50|$|Approx 8 {{miles from}} the river {{crossing}} the advance party led by Col Dibrell encountered 1200 <b>federals.</b> He received the order to charge.

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. <b>federal</b> guidelines generally {{begin the}} process of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the <b>federal</b> government. If the <b>federal</b> government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the <b>federal</b> designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under <b>federal</b> contract the Smith House would be protected. A <b>federal</b> designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E

50|$|By early dawn, the <b>Federals</b> {{had reached}} Broad Run on the Leesburg Pike, and stopped briefly {{at a house}} off the Road to inquire as to the {{whereabouts}} of the Miskel Farm.

5|$|Factors {{in favour}} of Croatia's {{preservation}} of its pre-war borders were the Yugoslav <b>Federal</b> Constitution Amendments of 1971, and the Yugoslav <b>Federal</b> Constitution of 1974. The 1971 amendments introduced a concept that sovereign rights were exercised by the <b>federal</b> units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution. The 1974 Constitution confirmed and strengthened the principles introduced in 1971. The borders had been defined by demarcation commissions in 1947, pursuant to decisions of AVNOJ in 1943 and 1945 regarding the <b>federal</b> organization of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Federal</b> DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed.

In <b>federal</b> enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other <b>federal</b> departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no <b>federal</b> law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
