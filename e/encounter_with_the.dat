5|$|Despite early victories, Pyrrhus {{found his}} {{position}} in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Facing unacceptably heavy losses from each <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Roman army, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns. Seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.|$|E

5|$|Two {{approaches}} have dominated {{explanations of the}} story of the green children: that it is a folktale describing an imaginary <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of another world, perhaps subterranean or even extraterrestrial, or it is a garbled account of a historical event. The story was praised as an ideal fantasy by the English anarchist poet and critic Herbert Read in his English Prose Style, published in 1931.
