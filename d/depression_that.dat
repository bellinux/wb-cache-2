40|$|The {{hydrological}} year 2007 – 2008 {{is the second}} drier in Cyprus since records are kept, {{for more than one}} hundred years. Since most of the rainfall is associated with <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> affect the area during the cold months of the year, a study was carried out to investigate the characteristics of these synoptic-scale systems. The study comprises a statistical analysis of the synoptic and dynamic characteristics of the <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> affected the area of Cyprus during the winter of 2007 – 2008...|$|R

5|$|In the 2000s Unicamp {{consolidated}} {{itself as}} one of the leading research and education centers in Latin America but also brought new challenges: just as with other public universities in Brazil, the high payroll costs (over 90% of the total budget) constrain investment and expansion. This is further aggravated by the economic <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> Brazil is facing since 2014, the largest in the country's history.|$|E
5|$|A {{short-lived}} {{tropical depression}} formed on September3 in the South China Sea, dissipating {{the next day}} while moving eastward. There was another short-lived tropical <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> developed on September4 near the Marianas Islands, but dissipated within one day. Another tropical depression formed on September4 {{to the west of}} the Marianas Islands, which moved to the south and later northeast, dissipating on September6. On September10, a tropical depression formed northeast of Luzon, lasting only two days while moving in a circular track.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, {{the storm}} weakened rapidly {{as it began}} to move west-northwest. Later that morning, MFR downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. By April 15, MFR downgraded the system into a tropical <b>depression.</b> <b>That</b> very day, the JTWC reported that winds of Helisaonia had fallen below hurricane-force. During the morning hours of April 17, the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression. Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped monitoring the system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E

5|$|Erich Hartmann {{was born}} on 19 April 1922 in Weissach, Württemberg, to Doctor Alfred Erich Hartmann and his wife, Elisabeth Wilhelmine Machtholf. The {{economic}} <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> followed World War I in Germany prompted Doctor Hartmann to find work in Changsha, China, and Erich spent his early childhood there. The family was forced to return to Germany in 1928, when the Chinese Civil War broke out. During World War II, Hartmann's younger brother, Alfred, also joined the Luftwaffe, serving as a gunner on a Junkers Ju 87 in North Africa. He was captured by the British and spent four years as a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Leigh {{took the}} lead role in the Noël Coward play South Sea Bubble, but withdrew from the {{production}} when she became pregnant. Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> lasted for months. She joined Olivier for a European tour of Titus Andronicus, but the tour was marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against Olivier {{and other members of}} the company. After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who could still exert a strong influence on her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base {{was closed}} by the Department of Defense, dealing Mobile's economy a severe blow. The closing {{resulted}} in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered {{in a period of}} economic <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> lasted through the 1970s. The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.|$|E
2500|$|The Tortolitas (English: [...] "Sweethearts") are oval-shaped <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> {{were made}} by the Muisca. They served as [...] "baths" [...] where the Muisca women bore their babies. Close to the Tortolitas, Muisca petroglyphs have been found.|$|R
5000|$|MVC {{can result}} in three {{distinct}} fracture morphologies based {{on the type of}} loading at failure. Tensile loading results in equiaxed dimples, which are spherical depressions a few micrometres in diameter that coalesce normal to the loading axis. Shear stresses will result elongated dimples, which are parabolic <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> coalesce in planes of maximum shear stress. The depressions point back to the crack origin, and shear influenced failure will produce <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> point in opposite directions on opposing fracture surfaces. Combined tension and bending will also produce the elongated dimple morphology, but the directions of the depressions will be in the same direction on both fracture surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Nearby hiking attractions are the [...] "weathering pits," [...] {{perfectly}} round <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> {{range between}} 10 and 50 feet (3 to 15 m) {{in diameter and}} are between 20 and 70 feet (6 to 21 m) deep.|$|R
5|$|In the typhoon's early stages, {{news reports}} {{stated that the}} outer bands of the storm {{produced}} heavy rainfall in the Philippines, resulting in 16 fatalities. However, a meteorological analysis of the storm showed that Kirogi was {{not responsible for the}} rain; instead, a monsoon <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> later became Typhoon Kai-tak caused the flooding rains. Typhoon Kirogi was never closer than 835km (520mi) from the Philippines. However, large swells produced by the storm caused moderate damage along coastal areas of the Philippines, forcing workers in Manila to clear debris left by the damaging waves.|$|E
5|$|Leigh became {{pregnant}} in 1956 and {{withdrew from the}} production of Coward's comedy South Sea Bubble. The day after her final performance in the play she miscarried and entered a period of <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> lasted for months. The same year Olivier decided to direct and produce a film version of The Sleeping Prince, retitled The Prince and the Showgirl. Instead of appearing with Leigh, he cast Marilyn Monroe as the showgirl. Although the filming was challenging because of Monroe's behaviour, the film was appreciated by the critics.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (today Tchaikovsky Street), Saint Petersburg. The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms {{at opposite ends of}} the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, she fell into bouts of <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} on rocky lopes of low hills, clay flats and <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> flood {{periodically}} flooding usually in open mallee woodland areas in central South Australia, between Leigh Creek and Arckaringa where it grows in clay soils.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{tropical}} <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> enter or {{form in the}} Philippine Area of Responsibility {{are assigned}} an internal name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). This can often result in the same storm having two names.|$|R
50|$|This melaleuca {{occurs in}} {{and between the}} Marvel Loch, Ravensthorpe and Balladonia districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. The plants grow in sand or clay in <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> fill with water after rain.|$|R
5|$|The Panic of 1873 {{started a}} five-year {{shipping}} <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> strained the finances {{of all of}} the Atlantic competitors. In 1876 the mail contracts expired and the Post Office ended both Cunard's and Inman's subsidies. The new contracts were paid on the basis of weight, at a rate substantially higher than paid by the United States Post Office. Cunard's weekly New York mail sailings were reduced to one and White Star was awarded the third mail sailing. Every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday a liner from one of the three firms departed Liverpool with the mail for New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} {{system that}} would form Dean was a stationary front situated in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico {{in the last week}} of July. On July 27, it developed a weak upper-level circulation indicated by reports from buoys in the Gulf, its structure was disorganized but {{was in the process of}} organizing. The system continued to organize early on July 28, and that afternoon it developed a surface circulation. The tropical <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> spawned Dean was thought to have formed at around 1800 UTC, July 28. It was later declared Tropical Depression Four that same day with the center located about 345miles (555km) southeast of New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was {{a native}} of Pennsylvania, but spent much of his career in Ohio. He {{became a member of the}} United Brethren church and taught {{mathematics}} at several United Brethren colleges in the Midwest. Thompson served as president of Otterbein University from 1872 to 1886. Much of his time as college president was devoted to improving the financial standing of the school during the economic <b>depression</b> <b>that</b> followed the Panic of 1873.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are seven}} {{distinct}} cultural phases determined by McBurney from these excavated layers. [...] Cultural remnants of this {{site in the}} uppermost layer include hearths with shallow <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> were most likely used for cooking fires and midden deposits.|$|R
50|$|Beaufortia squarrosa mainly {{occurs on}} {{the coastal plain}} between the Busselton and Eneabba districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. It usually grows in sand plains and <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> are wet in winter.|$|R
50|$|If one stem in a {{clump of}} willow is affected, then {{all of them are}} likely to be. However, the {{neighboring}} clump may be completely without diamonds. Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) has been known to bear <b>depressions</b> <b>that</b> resemble diamonding.|$|R
