5|$|The cottage {{garden in}} France is a {{development}} of the early 20th century. Monet's <b>garden</b> <b>at</b> Giverny is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage garden origins. Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.|$|E
5|$|After {{service in}} the Mediterranean the brigade {{returned}} to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it was reinforced {{by the arrival of}} the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943.

The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation Market <b>Garden</b> <b>at</b> Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing bridges to be used subsequently by the British Second Army. Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due to the speed of the Allied advance.|$|E

5|$|Gardens, or yards, around medieval castles, abbeys {{and houses}} were formal {{and in the}} European {{tradition}} of herb garden, kitchen garden and orchard. They were often surrounded by defensive walls and they sometimes adjoined a hunting park. The first Renaissance style gardens in Scotland were built for the Stewart dynasty at their royal palaces. French gardeners were hired by James IV at Stirling in 1501 and James V at Holyrood in 1536, where archaeological remains indicate there were sophisticated formal gardens. Similar landscaping is also found at Falkland and Linlithgow, including the king's knot <b>garden</b> <b>at</b> Stirling. From the late sixteenth century, the landscaping of many estate houses was influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. These were seen as retreats from the troubles {{of the world and}} were eulogised in country house poetry like that of William Drummond of Hawthornden (1585â1649). Extensive gardens were developed at Pinkie House by Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline (1555â1622), with lawns, fountains, ponds and aviaries for the entertainment of guests. Dunfermline's nephew, George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584â1650), planted a herb <b>garden</b> <b>at</b> Seaton House in 1620. The Earl of Sutherland's castle at Dunrobin was surrounded by orchards, herbs and flowers. The best surviving garden from the early seventeenth century is that at Edzell Castle, where, between 1604 and 1610, David Lindsay (1551?â1610) created an enclosure adorned with sculptures of the seven Cardinal Virtues, the seven Liberal Arts and the seven Planetary Deities, the expense of which eventually bankrupted him.|$|E
5|$|In 1818 Hope-Weir's {{grandson}} James Hope-Vere (1785â1843) asked Thomas Brown {{to provide}} designs for an attic extension, although this was never carried out. Ten years later, William Burn was commissioned {{to design a}} new north wing, incorporating a dining room, with new kitchens below and bedrooms above. The front of this extension was topped by a pediment matching Bruce's original, complete with pineapples, although this too was removed in the 1950s. The rear is bowed, with a curved stair led down to the <b>garden</b> <b>at</b> the rear. Plans for a matching wing to the south were never carried out. Burn also remodelled the interior, creating a large drawing room from the rooms of the south apartment.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Warner Bros. {{announced}} that negotiations {{had been made}} to produce another installment, with the intention of having Will Smith reprise his role. In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled A <b>Garden</b> <b>at</b> the End of the World, described as a post-apocalyptic variation of The Searchers. Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay, they had the writer Gary Graham rewrite it so it could serve as the next film. Serving as a reboot of the story, the studio hopes to create a franchise of films. Will Smith, who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels, has not commented on whether he will appear or not.|$|E
5|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once {{closed the}} eyes of her husband playfully in a flower <b>garden</b> <b>at</b> their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light {{was taken from the}} universe, and the earth, in turn, was {{submerged}} in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva. Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva. The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.|$|E
5|$|Julia Martha Thomas was {{a former}} schoolteacher who had been twice widowed.

The house was a two-storey semi-detached villa built in grey stone with a <b>garden</b> <b>at</b> the front and back. The area was not heavily {{populated}} at the time, although her house was close to a public house called The Hole in the Wall.|$|E
