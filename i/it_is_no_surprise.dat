5|$|Despite {{the successes}} under Basil, {{during the reign}} of his {{successor}} Leo VI the Wise (886–912), the Empire again faced serious threats. In the north, a war broke out against the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, and a part of the Imperial Fleet was used in 895 to ferry an army of Magyars across the Danube to raid Bulgaria. The Bulgarian war produced several costly defeats, {{while at the same time}} the Arab naval threat reached new heights, with successive raids devastating the shores of Byzantium's naval heartland, the Aegean Sea. In 891 or 893, the Arab fleet sacked the island of Samos and took its stratēgos prisoner, and in 898, the eunuch admiral Raghib carried off 3,000 Byzantine sailors of the Kibyrrhaiotai as prisoners. These losses denuded Byzantine defences, opening the Aegean up to raids by the Syrian fleets. The first heavy blow came in 901, when the renegade Damian of Tarsus plundered Demetrias, while in the next year, Taormina, the Empire's last outpost in Sicily, fell to the Muslims. The greatest disaster, however, came in 904, when another renegade, Leo of Tripoli, raided the Aegean. His fleet penetrated even into the Dardanelles, before proceeding to sack the Empire's second city, Thessalonica, all while the Empire's fleet remained passive in the face of the Arabs' superior numbers. Furthermore, the Cretan corsairs' raids reached such intensity, that by the end of Leo's reign, most of the southern Aegean islands were either abandoned or forced to accept Muslim control and pay tribute to the pirates. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that a defensive and cautious mindset is prevalent in the Leo's contemporary instructions on naval warfare (Naumachica).|$|E
25|$|Upper Canadians saw {{themselves}} as citizens of Great Britain with all the rights granted by the British Constitution. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> then, that the Upper Canadian Reform Movement should adopt the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement.|$|E
25|$|He showed early {{promise as}} an all-round sportsman, excelling in both cricket and football, and {{achieving}} good standards in golf and basketball.

25|$|In this sense, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that Bach's {{music is}} easily and often {{performed}} on instruments {{it was not}} necessarily written for, that it is transcribed so often, and that his melodies turn up in unexpected places such as jazz music. Apart from that, Bach left a number of compositions without specified instrumentation: the Canons BWV 1072–1078 fall in that category, {{as well as the}} bulk of The Musical Offering and The Art of Fugue.|$|E
25|$|Kinetics is {{the science}} of motion. Joule was a pupil of Dalton and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that he had learned a firm belief in the atomic theory, {{even though there were}} many {{scientists}} of his time who were still skeptical. He had also been {{one of the few people}} receptive to the neglected work of John Herapath on the kinetic theory of gases. He was further profoundly influenced by Peter Ewart's 1813 paper On the measure of moving force.|$|E
25|$|President Toda's linking of Makiguchi's {{progressive}} {{ideals and}} Nichiren Shōshū institutions created an immensely effective, if inherently unstable alliance, {{which resulted in}} periodic outbreaks of tension between the priesthood and the laity. Other scholars have observed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that a culturally conservative Japanese priesthood built on ideas of hierarchy, ritual, and traditional custom should conflict with a global lay movement built on ideas of egalitarianism, active faith, and rational adaption to the modern world would be unsustainable.|$|E

50|$|The Herings' {{house in}} St John's Wood {{was in the}} midst of a {{thriving}} artistic community and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that on 10 August 1875 Jeanie married an artist, John Adams-Acton, one of England's top sculptors.|$|R
25|$|In 1846 another Act of Parliament {{established}} the Great Western Dock Company to provide full facilities for shipping at Millbay. Gill sold his Millbay Pier to this company {{and became a}} director. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was engaged to design new docks; both he and Gill {{were involved in the}} South Devon Railway, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the first railway station in Plymouth was opened nearby in 1849. The next year a railway extension was built to the new docks, customs facilities were granted and the docks were recognised as a Government mail packet station.|$|E
25|$|Since prehistoric times, {{trade routes}} like the Lindenweg or Linienweg {{connected}} the Rhine-Main plain with the Usingen basin, {{which had been}} a centre of population since the Neolithic. Such routes would have followed a course {{from the mouth of}} the Nidda near Höchst, northwards across the low Taunus ridge, as does the modern Bundesstraße 456. A location along major communication routes almost always equals a strategic importance. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the mountain pass beside the Saalburg was first fortified by Roman troops during Domitian's wars against the Chatti (AD 81-96), when two simple earthen enclosures were erected (Schanzen A and B, located between the restored fort and the modern road).|$|E
25|$|Without {{waiting to}} be {{told what to do}} by the Senate, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An {{aqueduct}} (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply of the city of Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the Pontine Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{disagreements}} {{about the}} structure of the insect head, on which most effort has been spent, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the potential homologies between it and other arthropods, notably the chelicerates, are also very controversial. From after the second world war to the 1980s a commonly accepted model of arthropod evolution was that the extant euarthropods were polyphyletic, i.e. the main lineages had evolved independently from soft-bodied, annelid-like ancestors, following the work of Tiegs and especially Sidnie Manton. In this view, most of the head structures would also be convergent, and thus there was no point looking for specific homologies between major groups. However, the monophyletic theory of arthropod origins has since decisively gained the upper hand, which raises the problem of head homology once more.|$|E
500|$|The head {{of comedy}} at Television Centre deserves {{six of the}} best for {{bringing}} back Chalk (BBC1) for a second term. If the opening episode of the new series is anything to go by, we are in for six of the worst half-hours of comedy {{in the history of}} television ... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the show has been relegated to a late slot. It is a watershed for smut. Some of the jokes were in the worst possible taste. The standards of comedy are so pitiful, Galfast High School should not have been given a grant from TV licence-payers' money and it is time it closed its gates for good. David Bamber ... deserves a better vehicle for his acting talents. He was lured into playing Eric Slatt because the character {{was supposed to be the}} classroom equivalent of Basil Fawlty. They are as different as Chalk and Cleese.|$|E
500|$|Medieval Mediterranean naval warfare was {{therefore}} essentially coastal and amphibious in nature, {{carried out to}} seize coastal territory or islands, and not to exercise [...] "sea control" [...] as it is understood today. Furthermore, following the abandonment of the ram, the only truly [...] "ship-killing" [...] weapon available prior to the advent of gunpowder and explosive shells, sea combat became, {{in the words of}} John Pryor, [...] "more unpredictable. No longer could any power hope to have such an advantage in weaponry or the skill of crews that success could be expected." [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> therefore that the Byzantine and Arab manuals emphasize cautious tactics, with the priority given to the preservation of one's own fleet, and the acquisition of accurate intelligence, often through the use of spies posing as merchants. Emphasis was placed on achieving tactical surprise and, conversely, on avoiding being caught unprepared by the enemy. Ideally, battle was to be given only when assured of superiority by virtue of numbers or tactical disposition. Importance is also laid on matching one's forces and tactics to the prospective enemy: Leo VI, for instance, contrasted (Tactica, XIX.74–77) the Arabs with their heavy and slow ships (koumbaria), to the small and fast craft (akatia, chiefly monoxyla), of the Slavs and Rus'.|$|E

500|$|Writing that {{he belongs}} to the Intersex Society of America, Cal notes {{that he has not}} participated in any of the group's rallies because he is not a [...] "political person". While {{discussing}} political activism, Cal uses the word [...] "intersex", though {{in other parts of the}} novel, he uses the word [...] "hermaphrodite". In the 1920s, Bernice L. Hausman described [...] "intersexuality" [...] as a [...] "continuum of physiological and anatomical sex differences", contesting the notion of a [...] "true sex" [...] concealed in the tissues of the body. Though [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] is burdened by the implications of the anomaly, [...] "intersexuality" [...] is a neologism that tries to [...] "naturalize various sexes, which themselves are naturally occurring." [...] Because Cal uses [...] "hermaphrodite", he indicates that the sole normal genders are the classifications of male and female. Eugenides was asked by an Oprah's Book Club member why he used the term [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] despite its usage being [...] "either terribly ignorant or unforgivably callous". Eugenides replied that he reserved [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] for a literary character: Hermaphroditus. He further stated: [...] "When speaking about real people, I should—and I do my best to—use the term 'intersex'." [...] Noting that one of the initial sources he consulted was the journal Hermaphrodites with Attitude published by the Intersex Society of North America, he said that those writers have [...] "co-opted" [...] the term [...] "hermaphrodite". Their action is reminiscent, Eugenides wrote, of how some members of the gay community have [...] "reclaimed" [...] the term [...] "queer". Eugenides stated that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that Cal uses [...] "hermaphrodite" [...] and further elaborated: [...] "It's paradoxical: Cal can say 'hermaphodite' but I can't. Or shouldn't." ...|$|E
