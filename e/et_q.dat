Furthermore, we prove, the Noether "counting" theorem, that the maximum dimension of the Noether algebra of a particle Lagrangian is live and corresponds to A 5, 40. Then we show that a particle Lagrangian cannot admit a maximal four-dimensional Noether point symmetry algebra.

40|$|Objective: To study whether {{sensorimotor}} cortical {{areas are}} involved in Essential Tremor (ET) generation. Background: It {{has been suggested that}} sensorimotor cortical areas can play a role in ET generation. Therefore, we studied median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in 10 patients with definite ET. Methods: To distinguish SEP changes due to hand movements from those specifically related to central mechanisms of tremor, SEPs were recorded at rest, during postural tremor and during active and passive movement of the hand. Moreover, we recorded SEPs from 5 volunteers who mimicked hand tremor. The traces were further submitted to dipolar source analysis. Results: Mimicked tremor in controls as well as active and passive hand movements in ET patients caused a marked attenuation of all scalp SEP components. These SEP changes {{can be explained by the}} interference between movement and somatosensory input (‘gating’ phenomenon). By contrast, SEPs during postural tremor in ET patients showed a reduction of N 20, P 22, N 24 and P 24 cortical SEP components, whereas the fronto-central N 30 wave remained unaffected. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in ET patients the physiological interference between movement and somatosensory input to the cortex is not effective on the N 30 response. This finding thus indicates that a dysfunction of the cortical generator of the N 30 response may play a role in the pathogenesis of <b>ET.</b> <b>q</b> 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

This report set as objectives to: a) assess the hydrological variables interception loss, I, potential and actual evapo-transpiration, E, Et, runoff, Q, and soil moisture content, θ; b) evaluate whether these variables are presenting consistent trends or oscillations {{that can be}} associated to global warming or climate variability; and c) relate θ {{to the number of}} wildfires and the burned area in Durango, Mexico. A mass balance approach estimated daily variables of the water cycle using sub-models for I and Et to calculate Q and θ for a time series from 1945 to 2007. Regression and auto-regressive and moving averaging (ARIMA) techniques evaluated the statistical significance of trends. The cumulative standardized z value magnified and ARIMA models projected statistically similar monthly and annual time series data of all variables of the water cycle. Regression analysis and ARIMA models showed monthly and annual P, I, E, and <b>Et,</b> <b>Q,</b> and θ do not follow consistent up or downward linear tendencies over time with statistical significance; they rather follow oscillations that could be adequately predicted by ARIMA models (r 2 ≥ 0. 70). There was a consistent statistical association (p ≤ 0. 05) of θ with the number of wildfires and the area burned regardless of the different spatial scales used in evaluating these variables. The analysis shows seasonal variability is increasing over time as magnifying pulses of dryness and wetness, which may be the response of the hydrological cycle to climate change. Further research must center on using longer time series data, testing seasonal variability with additional statistical analysis, and incorporating new variables in the analysis...|$|E
40|$|Recently a {{monograph}} appeared {{dealing with}} Roman epigraphical monuments from the West-Serbian town of Čačak and its neighbourhood (S. Ferjančić / G. Jeremić / A. Gojgić, Roman Epigraphic Monuments from Čačak and its Vicinity Čačak 2008, Engl. Summary pp. 103 - 107). Authored by one specialist in Roman history and epigraphy and two archaeologists, {{the book is}} rather thin and does not provide much new data, apart from {{the identification of the}} equestrian officer Tiberius Claudius Gallus with Severus' senator - which was taken from my PhD thesis without citing it - and from two inscriptions, № 20 and № 21, forming the subject of the present paper. Published here for the first time, they both contain important information which the co-authors failed to notice. The consuls of 227 A. D. in an inscription from Čačak The № 21 (fig. 1) was found in the site of Gradina on the mountain Jelica, S. of Čačak. It is engraved on a whitish limestone monument, apparently an ara, the middle and lower parts of which are preserved after it has been reshaped to be used as building material. The four-line inscription was read by the editors as follows: [- - -] Aur(elius) F[- - - v(otum) ] l(ibens) p(osuit) Mal+[- - -]et Al[- - - co(n) s(ulibus) ] Idibus [- - -]. Unable to identify the pair of consuls mentioned in lines two and three, the authors interpret the inscription as a funerary one: [- - -]Aur(elius or -elio) F[- - - vix(it) ann(is) ] L P. Mal+[- - -]et Al[- - - f(ecerunt) ? die ?] Idibus [- - -]. In fact, they misread the final cluster of the line two, by having mistaken for L the long right serif of M (in ligature with A) together with a trace of a subsequent letter, which proves to be an X. The alignment of the letters {{at the beginning of the}} lines suggests that the left side of the inscription is entirely preserved. The inscription reads as folows:] Aur(elius) F+[-] l(ibens) p(osuit) Max[imo] et Al[bino co(n) s(ulibus) ] Idibus [-]. M. Laelius Maximus Aemilianus (PIR 2 L 56) - probably son of Marcus Laelius Maximus (PIR 2 L 55), one of the leading senators under Septimius Severus - and M. Nummius Senecio Albinus (PIR 2 N 235) were the eponymous consuls of 227. The pair is attested in several inscriptions, e. g. CIL VIII 18831 from Numidia which resembles this one in recording the exact date: Bacaci Aug(usto) sac(rum) Albino et Ma co(n) s(ulibus) Kal(endis) Mai(is) [3] Si Novellus <b>et</b> <b>Q.</b> Galerius Mu magg(istri) [Thib(ilitanorum?) ]. Here Albinus' name precedes that of Maximus, which is usually the case. Nevertheless, a parallel with Maximus named before Albinus is provided by an inscription from Dacia (ILD 774, near Cluj) : Deae Ne sac Aur(elius) Ru[f]inus be(ne) f(iciarius) co(n) s(ularis) leg(ionis) XIII Gem(inae) Sever(ianae) v(otum) l(ibens) p(osuit) Maximo et Albino] co(n) s(ulibus). Consequently, № 21 is a votive inscription, largely restorable and precisely datable. The Collegium curatorum of the Cohors II Delmatarum in an inscription from Čačak Forty years ago within the Ascension Church yard in Čačak the lower part of a Roman limestone monument has been accidentally unearthed, bearing an inscription, three last lines of which are partially preserved (№ 20 of the catalogue, (fig. 2), wherein only the mention of a cohort was recognized by the editors, who read:]- - -]ALB[- - -| -]GIATI +[- - -|- - -co]h(ortis) eiusde(m) [- - -|- - - The elegant, shaded letters are lined up one below the other, which suggests that the text was arranged following the principle of centering. Above the L in the first line there is a trace of an O or a Q, unnoticed by the editors. So, there are 4 lines partially preserved. The space left between the lines 2 and 3 being larger than that between 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 respectively, the two last lines seem to constitute a separate entry. The genitive case cohortis eiusdem implies a preceding designation of the dedicant(s), and what we have before is a nominative plural ending in ‑giati followed by a word of which only the first letter, C or O, is still discernible. As the most probable, if not the only possible, we propose the following restoration of the last two lines (fig. 8) : [colle]giati c[urat(ores) ]|[co]h(ortis) eiusde[m] possibly with a p(osuerunt) or d(edicaverunt) in the end. Despite its fragmentariness, the present inscription bears an important testimony to the existence, within the Roman army, of professional associations (collegia militaria) independent of regular military structures. The evidence for them is based solely on epigraphic sources; some hundred inscriptions contradict the paragraph of the Digesta (47. 22) forbidding the soldiers to organize corporate associations in the camps. The cohort in question is doubtless the cohors II Aurelia Delmatarum milliaria equitata, which is known to have been stationed permanently, from the seventies of the second century A. D. to the fifties of the third century, in the eastern part of Dalmatia around the modern city of Čačak. It was a mixed infantry and cavalry unit, and the rank of curator (curator equitum singularium, curator alae, curator cohortis) is attested exclusively in the mounted units of the Roman army. It was higher than the simple eques; in the auxiliary troops, the curators may have been charged with special tactical or economic-administrative tasks. The lower officers (principales) and the soldiers with special tasks were allowed to form private associations fostering loyalty to the Emperor. All Roman collegia including the military ones, had their religious purpose and their official meeting room (schola) was also a sanctuary of their patron deity. It might be a part of the headquarters building, as in the case of the Castra Nova equitum singularium in Rome, where, beneath the Basilica of St John Lateran an Ionic capitel was uncovered with inscription on it dated with AD 197 recording the dedication of the schola curatorum to Minerva Augusta (AE 1935 156 = AE 1968, 8 b) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the components of the land surface water budget in the four land surface models (Noah, SAC-Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model, (VIC) Variable Infiltration Capacity Model, and Mosaic) applied in the newly implemented National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational and research versions of the North American Land Data Assimilation System version 2 (NLDAS- 2). This work focuses on monthly and annual components of the water budget over 12 National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Centers (RFCs). Monthly gridded FLUX Network (FLUXNET) evapotranspiration (ET) from the Max-Planck Institute (MPI) of Germany, U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) total runoff (Q), changes in total water storage (dS/dt, derived as a residual by utilizing MPI <b>ET</b> and USGS <b>Q</b> in the water balance equation), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observed total water storage anomaly (TWSA) and change (TWSC) are used as reference data sets. Compared to these <b>ET</b> and <b>Q</b> benchmarks, Mosaic and SAC (Noah and VIC) in the operational NLDAS- 2 overestimate (underestimate) mean annual reference ET and underestimate (overestimate) mean annual reference Q.

These results demonstrate that the three intertwined efforts of improving (1) the scientific understanding of parameterization of land surface processes, (2) the spatial and temporal extent of systematic validation of land surface processes, and (3) the engineering-oriented aspects such as parameter calibration and optimization are key to substantially improving product quality in various land data assimilation systems...|$|R
