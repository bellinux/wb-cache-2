40|$|Many {{models have}} been {{developed}} to assist contractors and clients in their cash flow forecasting. The majority of these have been based on standard cash flow S-curves, developed using the traditional manual approach, mathematical and statistical models. Many of these models failed to consider and analyse the factors responsible for the considerable variations in the modelled cash flow profiles. This study as a first step in a knowledge-based expert system (KBES) modelling of construction cash flow to incorporate risk and uncertainties, identified and assessed the risk factors responsible for the variation in construction cash flow profiles. The study was conducted through a questionnaire survey administered on contracting organisations. Analyses were carried out using mean response and univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results showed that the major risk factors involved in cash flow forecasting relate to changes in the design or specifications, contract conditions pertaining to cash in flow, <b>interim</b> <b>valuations</b> and certificates and construction programming issues such as inclement weather. Results also indicated that cash flow forecasting modelling that incorporates risk would need to consider categorisation along the groupings of firm size, procurement methods and construction duration...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of cash retention {{has been identified}} to be an opportunity cost to the contractor, equivalent to interest loss on cash retained, which could amount to a huge sum for larger contract. Literature revealed the use of retention bond as the best solution {{to the problems of}} cash retention. Hence, the need to evaluate and compare the cost of ‘cash retention’ and ‘retention bond’ costs to the contractor. This study will assist in improving payment practice in the construction industry and also improves financial stability of the contractor. Data were collected from <b>interim</b> <b>valuations</b> of completed projects and subsequently analyzed using “compounding method” to evaluate the compound interest loss on cash retained by the client and the cost of providing retention bond in-lieu of cash retention. T-test analysis was further used to determine the level of significance of the difference between both costs. The results of both analyses reveal that there is a significant difference between both cost and the utilization of retention bond in-lieu of cash retention will reduce the cost of retention by 65 %. Subsequent to the findings of this research, it is therefore suggested that, clients should adopt retention bond in-place of cash retention as this will reduce the cost of retention to the contractor, while still providing adequate level of security to the clients’ money...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenges}} of cost and time overruns, construction disputes and client dissatisfaction have plagued {{the construction industry}} in Nigeria. This may be {{as a result of}} the approaches used in monitoring construction costs. The execution phase of a construction project relies on post-contract cost controlling techniques, such as cash flow monitoring, <b>interim</b> <b>valuations,</b> final account preparation, monitoring activities, site meetings and documentation of activities on site. These techniques are imperative for project success. The purpose of this paper is to assess the various techniques used in post-contract cost control in Nigeria, in terms of their effectiveness. The data was gathered from one hundred and thirty five (135) cost and project managers in Nigeria. The Kendall’s coefficient of concordance was used to test the post-contract cost controlling techniques identified, through an extensive literature review along with one sample run test. The findings reveal that monitoring material cost was the most effective and important technique with a Kendall’s W score of 1. 33 and 11. 44 respectively. Cash flow monitoring had the lowest score of 7. 85 for effectiveness, while variation management had the lowest score of 6. 88 for importance. The effectiveness of the techniques was further evaluated using one sample run test. The findings show that sixteen out of the eighteen techniques were not effective from an overall point of view. The cost controlling techniques used in the Nigerian construction industry are deficient and generally ineffective. Therefore, there is a need to research alternative post-contract cost controlling techniques for the construction industry in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{performance of}} {{private equity funds}} is only known once all investments have been sold, and the cash returned to investors. This typically takes over a decade. In the meantime, the reported performance depends on the valuation of the remaining portfolio companies. Private equity houses market their next fund {{on the basis of}} these <b>interim</b> <b>valuations</b> of their current fund. In this paper we analyze whether these valuations are fair, whether the extent of conservative or aggressive valuations differ during the life of the fund, and at what stage interim performance measures predict ultimate performance. This paper is the first to use the quarterly valuations and cash flows for the entire history of 761 fund investments made by Calpers – the largest U. S. investor in private equity. Our main findings are as follows. First, over the entire life of the fund we find evidence that fund valuations are conservative, and tend to be smoothed (relative to movements in public markets) : valuations understate subsequent distributions by around 35 % on average. We find a significant jump in valuations in the fourth-quarter, when funds are normally audited. Second, the exception to this general conservatism is the period when follow-on funds are being raised. We find that valuations, and reported returns, are inflated during fundraising, with a gradual reversal once the follow-on fund has been closed. Third, we find that the performance figures reported by funds during fund-raising have little power to predict ultimate returns. This is especially true when performance is measured by IRR. Using public market equivalent measures increases predictability significantly. Our results show that investors should be extremely wary of basing investment decisions on the returns - especially IRRs – of the current fund...|$|R

This legislation {{was based on}} the concept that the rateable value resulting from an <b>interim</b> <b>valuation</b> shall not exceed the level of rateable value in the valuation list. This concept allowed a rateable value to be determined at a level below the “tone” if there was a decline in rental levels during the period from the date the valuation list came into force to the time of the <b>interim</b> <b>valuation.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of recent {{financial}} crises and corporate failures, chief executive officers (CEOs) are often blamed for their overconfidence leading to earnings manipulation and excessive risks. Why is it then that these overconfident CEOs obtain job offers in the first place? This paper presents a novel explanation for the co-existence of CEO overconfidence and earnings manipulation observed in practice. In an agency model with an external capital market, I identify two potential reasons for a board to hire an overconfident CEO and design a contract that accommodates earnings manipulation: an internal motive, directed at maximizing the ex ante firm value, and an external motive, directed at enhancing the <b>interim</b> market <b>valuation</b> of the firm. The flip side, however, is that the firm can {{be more likely to}} become insolvent and bear greater risks of bankruptcy. Some policy implications and limitations are also discussed.

40|$|The control {{needed in}} the {{management}} of a project was analysed with particular reference to the unique needs of the construction industry within the context of site management. This was explored further by analysing the various problems facing managers within the overall system and determining to what extent the organisation would benefit from an integrated mangement information system. Integration and management of information within the organisational units and the cycles of events that make up the main sub-system was suggested as the means of achieving this objective. A conceptual model of the flow of information was constructed within the whole process of project management by examining the type of information and documents which are generated for the production cycle of a project. This model was analysed with respect to the site managers' needs and the minimum requirements for an overall integrated system. The most tedious and time-consuming task facing the site manager is the determination of weekly production costs, calculation and preparation of <b>interim</b> certificates and <b>valuation</b> of variations occurring during the production stage and finally the settlement and preparation of supplier and sub-contractors' accounts. These areas where microcomputers could be of most help were identified and a number of packages were designed and implemented for various contractors. The gradual integration of stand-alone packages within the whole of the construction industry is a logical sequence to achieve integration of management system. The methods of doing this were analysed together with the resulting advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} multiple roles of chief executive officers (CEOs) and financial information, and {{it consists of}} four chapters. Chapter 1 reviews selectively the literature on: (i) the determinants {{and the consequences of}} CEO turnover; (ii) the relationship between CEO turnover and earnings management; and (iii) the effects of CEO career concerns and overconfidence on financial reporting. The CEO turnover literature finds robust evidence that CEO turnovers are preceded by poor accounting performance or poor stock market performance. There is also extensive evidence for the relationship between CEO turnover and earnings management and for the effects of CEO overconfidence on financial reporting. However, there is inconclusive evidence regarding market reactions to CEO turnover announcements, post-turnover performance improvements, the relationship between earnings quality and CEO turnover, and the effects of career concerns on financial reporting. Chapter 2 addresses the following question. In the wake of recent financial crises and corporate failures, CEOs are often blamed for their overconfidence leading to earnings manipulation and excessive risk. How is it then that these overconfident CEOs obtain job offers in the first place? In an agency model with CEO overconfidence and public regulation, this paper provides conditions under which earnings manipulation and CEO overconfidence can increase the ex ante firm value and the <b>interim</b> market <b>valuation</b> of the firm. Moreover, it is socially optimal for a regulatory body to impose a lenient policy on earnings manipulation rather than a zero-tolerance policy. These results provide an explanation for why earnings manipulation and CEO overconfidence can co-exist even under firm-value-maximizing corporate governance and public regulation. The dark side, however, is that the firm bears greater risk and is more likely to go bankrupt ex post. Chapter 3 examines the effects of market competition on CEO hiring decisions by firms in a Cournot model where the hired CEOs determine the research and development investment and production level for their respective firms. The central result is that CEO overconfidence and the intensity of market competition (measured by the number of firms in the industry) have an inverted U-shaped relationship. This suggests that, in equilibrium, firms in an oligopoly hire CEOs with relatively greater overconfidence than do firms in a duopoly. As the market tends towards being perfectly competitive, strategic concerns vanish and firms hire realistic CEOs. Chapter 4 explains a `big bath', a phenomenon where a CEO manipulates a company's income statement to make poor results look even worse. In a financial reporting game played by an outgoing CEO, an incoming CEO, and outside investors in the capital market, this study identifies conditions under which a big bath can be sustained as an equilibrium outcome. In particular, when the earnings report issued by the outgoing CEO is sufficiently low, the incoming CEO’s reporting strategy will feature a big bath. The paper also generates several predictions relating the likelihood of a big bath, the sensitivity of a CEO’s reporting strategy to true earnings and a prior earnings report, and the sensitivity of the stock price to earnings reports...|$|R

50|$|However, sharp {{increases}} in property rents {{in the early}} 1970s gave rise to strong opposition from leaseholders to the payment of the full market rental value of the land, {{as required by the}} lease conditions, for the renewal term. In view of this situation, Government introduced a number of alternative methods of renewal. Finally, on 14 December 1973, the Crown Leases Ordinance, now re-titled the Government Leases Ordinance (cap. 40 of the Laws of Hong Kong), came into operation. The Ordinance provided that for the renewal term, a leaseholder should pay an annual rent equivalent to 3% of the rateable value of the land at the date of renewal of the lease. The Cap. 40 rent so assessed would remain unchanged throughout the renewal term unless and until the land was redeveloped, in which case it would be re-assessed at 3% of the rateable value of the <b>interim</b> <b>valuation</b> of the new building erected on the land.|$|E
50|$|The Rating (Effective Date of <b>Interim</b> <b>Valuation)</b> Regulation {{applies to}} newly {{completed}} buildings {{by reference to}} the relevant documents which allow the property to be occupied. If the tenement is used wholly or primarily for residential purposes, the effective date is 90 days from the date of issue of the relevant document. If the tenement is used for non-residential purposes, the effective date is 180 days from the date of issue of the document, or the date on which the tenement was first occupied, whichever is the earlier. However, if the non-residential tenement was occupied before {{the issue of the}} relevant document, the effective date is the date of occupation. In this context, a relevant document means an Occupation Permit issued by the Building Authority, a Certificate of Compliance issued by the Director of Lands or a document signed by the Director of Housing certifying completion of a building erected by the Hong Kong Housing Authority.|$|E
