500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} modalities {{exist to}} demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The gold standard is cerebral angiography (with or without <b>digital</b> <b>subtraction</b> <b>angiography).</b> This involves puncture {{of a large}} artery (usually the femoral artery) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the aorta towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, radiocontrast is injected and its downstream flow captured on fluoroscopy (continuous X-ray imaging). The vessel may appear stenotic (narrowed, 41–75%), occluded (blocked, 18–49%), or as an aneurysm (area of dilation, 5–13%). The narrowing may be described as [...] "rat's tail" [...] or [...] "string sign". Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure, and it requires large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as kidney damage. Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood in the vessel wall, as opposed to more modern modalities. The only remaining use of angiography is when endovascular treatment is contemplated (see below).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} ability of multidetector CT (MDCT) to {{diagnose}} arterioportal shunts (APS) associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) {{and its impact on}} further management of the patient. Patients and methods: 252 Patients with HCC were examined by triphasic MDCT scanning. Images were analyzed for the presence, locations, types and degrees of APS, being with or without thrombosis. <b>Digital</b> <b>subtraction</b> <b>angiographies</b> (DSA) were performed for 22 patients as a part of further therapeutic management. Results: MDCT revealed APS in 37 patients including 20 central, 9 peripheral and 8 mixed. According to the degree we had 13 severe, 15 moderate and 9 mild APS. 18 patients had associated portal venous thrombosis. During DSA examinations; APS were demonstrated in 19 out of 22 as 3 mild and peripheral shunts were faint and missed. Embolization of the shunt was performed in 17 patients prior to injection of the cytotoxic drug-lipiodol mixture. In one patient the APS was closed to improve the hepatic status without further chemotherapy and in one patient the shunt was ignored and not closed. Conclusion: Good understanding of MDCT findings of APS complicating HCC contributes to the diagnosis and improves the therapeutic outcome of the chemoembolization procedures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for estimating the blood flow in angiographic image data. In <b>digital</b> <b>subtraction</b> X-ray <b>angiography</b> (2 D-DSA) the projective blood flow is measured {{and then the}} spatial blood flow is recovered by centerline reprojection to 3 D X-ray rotation angiography (3 D-RA) data of the same object. This measure is used as boundary condition for blood flow simulations. The algorithm has been tested on phantom data resulting in a deviation of between 9. 7 % and 17. 7 % compared to Laser Doppler Velocimetry measurements. First plausibility tests of the re-projection method on patient data have been performed. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} cone-beam computed tomography with automated bone subtraction (CBCT-ABS) in the preoperative embolization of hypervascular tumors located in the pelvic bone. This retrospective study included 26 patients with pelvic bone tumors who underwent preoperative embolization between January 2014 and October 2016. A CBCT-ABS scan was taken {{in a total of}} 17 patients (CBCT-ABS group), and only a series of <b>digital</b> <b>subtraction</b> <b>angiographies</b> (DSAs) was taken in the remaining 9 patients (DSA group). The percent devascularization, number of angiographic runs, total dose-area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time, interventional procedure time, operative time, and estimated blood loss were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney test. The percent devascularization, interventional procedure time, fluoroscopy time, operative time, and estimated blood loss were not statistically different between the two groups (p > 0. 05). On the other hand, the number of angiographic runs in the CBCT-ABS group was significantly lower than that in the DSA group (p = 0. 029). The total DAP of the CBCT-ABS group (mean, 17700. 7 μGym 2) was higher than that of the DSA group (mean, 8939. 4 μGym 2) (p = 0. 002).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to compare {{selective}} arterially enhanced spiral computed tomographs (ACT) with <b>digital</b> <b>subtraction</b> <b>angiographies</b> (DSA) in the presurgical assessment of cerebral aneurysms. A total of 24 aneurysms in 18 patients were explored in a prospective study by ACT and DSA, using an interactive combined CT-angiography suite. Dimensions of the aneurysm, its relation to the parent vessel, and the aneurysmal index were defined on DSA and on surface-shaded display of 3 D reformatted images obtained from ACT. Results were correlated with surgical findings. Three aneurysms suspected on DSA were not confirmed by ACT. One fusiform aneurysm suspected on DSA corresponded to a sacciform aneurysm on ACT. Surgical findings confirmed 20 sacciform aneurysms. The aneurysmal index could be measured in all 20 cases of sacciform aneurysms on ACT {{and could not be}} determined with confidence in 55 % of the cases on DSA. DSA and ACT gave identical results in 35 % of cases. In 10 %, the index measured by ACT was superior to that determined by DSA for aneurysms which had a diameter of less than 3 mm. In conclusion, the combination of DSA and ACT improved the results of DSA alone. ACT is a reliable method to measure the aneurysmal index in aneurysms with a diameter superior to 3 mm.

To this purpose, we exploit both spatial and temporal sparsity of DSRA. For computational efficiency, we use a proximal implementation that accommodates multiple ℓ 1 -penalties.

To further improve the subtracted image quality in the second step, a novel 3 D refinement algorithm is suggested to effectively remove unwanted residuals.
