When it was too dark to see to plough any more he took Fritz Friedleburg's horse back home again, and then he went home himself.|$|E
6000|$|It {{has already}} been illustrated, that every natural process is a version of a moral sentence. The moral law lies at the centre of nature and radiates to the circumference. It is the pith and marrow of every substance, every relation, and every process. All things with which we deal, preach to us. What is a farm but a mute gospel? The chaff and the wheat, weeds and plants, blight, rain, insects, sun,--it is a sacred emblem from the <b>first</b> <b>furrow</b> of spring to the last stack which the snow of winter overtakes in the fields.

50|$|The blastula {{stage of}} early embryo {{development}} {{begins with the}} appearance of the blastocoele. The origin of the blastocoele in Xenopus {{has been shown to be}} from the <b>first</b> cleavage <b>furrow,</b> which is widened and sealed with tight junctions to create a cavity.|$|R
50|$|An {{amphibian}} embryo in the 128- cell {{stage is}} considered a blastula as the blastocoel in the embryo becomes apparent during this stage. The fluid-filled cavity forms in the animal hemisphere of the frog. However, the early formation of the blastocoel has been {{traced back to the}} very <b>first</b> cleavage <b>furrow.</b> It was demonstrated in the frog embryo that the <b>first</b> cleavage <b>furrow</b> widens in the animal hemisphere creating a small intercellular cavity that is sealed off via tight junctions. As cleavage continues, the cavity expands to become the developed blastocoel. The blastocoel is a crucial component of amphibian embryo development. It permits cell migration during gastrulation and prevents the cells beneath the blastocoel from interacting prematurely with the cells above the blastocoel. For instance, the blastocoel prevents the vegetal cells destined to become endoderm from coming in contact with those cells in the ectoderm fated to give rise to the skin and nerves.|$|R
40|$|Background: Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI) of {{mitochondria}} {{occurs when}} both {{mothers and fathers}} are capable of transmitting mitochondria to their offspring, {{in contrast to the}} typical Strictly Maternal Inheritance (SMI). DUI was found in some bivalve molluscs, in which two mitochondrial genomes are inherited, one through eggs, the other through sperm. During male embryo development, spermatozoon mitochondria aggregate in proximity of the <b>first</b> cleavage <b>furrow</b> and end up in the primordial germ cells, while they are dispersed in female embryos. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used MitoTracker, microtubule staining and transmission electron microscopy to examine the mechanisms of this unusual distribution of sperm mitochondria in the DUI species Ruditapes philippinarum. Our results suggest that in male embryos the midbody deriving from the mitotic spindle of the first division concurs in positioning the aggregate of sperm mitochondria. Furthermore, an immunocytochemical analysis showed that the germ line determinant Vasa segregates close to the <b>first</b> cleavage <b>furrow.</b> Conclusions/Significance: In DUI male embryos, spermatozoon mitochondria aggregate in a stable area on the animalvegetal axis: in organisms with spiral segmentation this zone is not involved in cleavage, so the aggregation is maintained. Moreover, sperm mitochondria reach the same embryonic area in which also germ plasm is transferred. In 2 -blastomere embryos, the segregation of sperm mitochondria in the same region with Vasa suggests their contribution in male germ lin...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a clear}} spring morning, one {{of those}} mornings which on the wide grass-lands fill one's heart with hope and stir the frost-chilled blood, when Harry and I stood beside our teams ready to drive the <b>first</b> <b>furrow.</b> A warm breeze from the Pacific, {{crossing}} the snow-barred Rockies, set the dry grasses rippling; and the prairie running northward league after league was dappled with moving shadow by the white cloudlets that scudded across the great vault of blue. Behind us straggling silver-stemmed birches sheltered the little log-house of Fairmead, which nestled snugly among them, with its low sod-built stable further among the slender branches behind. Trees are scarce in that region, and the settlers {{make the most of}} them. The white prairie was broken by a space of ashes and black loam, with a fire still crackling in crimson tongues among the stubble at the further end of it. Straw is worth nothing there, so a little is cut with the ear, and the rest burned off in spring, while the grasses growing and rotting for countless centuries have added to the rich alluvial left by some inland sea which covered all the prairie when the world was young. Nature, as those who love her know, is never in a hurry, and very slowly, little by little, working on through forgotten ages, she had stored her latent wealth under the matted sod against the time when the plowshare should convert it into food for man and beast. There is no wheat soil {{on the surface of the}} earth to beat that of Assiniboia and Manitoba.|$|E
6000|$|Basket in hand I went away, {{over the}} dewy grass, {{whistling}} light-heartedly, and after half an hour's walk found the spot indicated, where about an acre {{and a half}} of land had been recently turned; there also, lying in the furrow, I found the plow, an implement I knew very little about. This particular plow, however, appeared to be a simple, primitive thing, consisting of a long beam of wood, with an upright pole to guide it; a metal share in the center, going off to one side, balanced on the other by a couple of small wheels; and there were also some long ropes attached to a cross-stick {{at the end of the}} beam. There being no horses or bullocks to do the work, and being unable to draw the plow myself as well as guide it, I sat down leisurely to examine the contents of my basket, which, I found, consisted of brown bread, dried fruit, and a stone bottle of milk. Then, not knowing what else to do, I began to amuse myself by blowing on the whistle, and emitted a most shrill and piercing sound, which very soon produced an unexpected effect. Two noble-looking horses, resembling those I had seen the day before, came galloping towards me as if in response to the sound I had made. Approaching swiftly to within fifty yards they stood still, staring and snorting as if alarmed or astonished, after which they swept round me three or four times, neighing in a sharp, ringing manner, and finally, after having exhausted their superfluous energy, they walked to the plow and placed themselves deliberately before it. It looked as if these animals had come at my call to do the work; I therefore approached them, with more than needful caution, using many soothing, conciliatory sounds and words the while, and after a little further study I discovered how to adjust the ropes to them. There were no blinkers or reins, nor did these superb animals seem to think any were wanted; but after I had taken the pole in my hand, and said [...] "Gee up, Dobbin," [...] in a tone of command, followed by some inarticulate clicks with the tongue, they rewarded me with a disconcerting stare, and then began dragging the plow. As long as I held the pole straight the share cut its way evenly through the mold, but occasionally, owing to my inadvertence, it would go off at a tangent or curve quite out of the ground; and whenever this happened the horses would stop, turn round and stare at me, then, touching their noses together seem to exchange ideas on the subject. When the <b>first</b> <b>furrow</b> was finished, they did not double back, as I expected, but went straight away to a distance of thirty yards, and then, turning, marched back, cutting a fresh furrow parallel with the first, and as straight as a line. Then they returned to the original starting-point and cut another, then again to the new furrow, and so on progressively. All this seemed very wonderful to me, giving the impression that I had been a skillful plowman all my life without knowing it. It was interesting work; and I was also amused to see the little birds that came in numbers from the wood to devour the worms in the fresh-turned mold; for between their fear of me and their desire to get the worms, they were in a highly perplexed state, and generally confined their operations to one end of the furrow while I was away at the other. The space the horses had marked out for themselves was plowed up in due time, whereupon they marched off and made a fresh furrow as before, where there was nothing to guide them; and so the work went on agreeably for some hours, until I felt myself growing desperately hungry. Sitting down on the beam of the plow, I opened my basket and discussed the homely fare with a keen appetite.|$|E

In 1776 the Dutch East India Company established an outpost for the provision of timber; its location is thought to be near the western end of York Street. The Timber Post had its own Poshouer (manager), some 12 woodcutters, a blacksmith, wagon maker and 200 oxen plus families. After 1795 and the British occupation of the Cape, a caretaker of the forests in the area was appointed. After the second British occupation in 1806, it was decided that the Swellendam magistracy was too large and needed to be sub-divided. George was chosen because of the availability of good water. In 1811 George was declared a separate district and Adriaan Geysbertus van Kervel was appointed the first Landrost (magistrate) and the town was proclaimed by the Earl of Caledon, governor of the Cape Colony on St George's Day, 23 April 1811, and named after the reigning British monarch, King George III.

40|$|The <b>first</b> {{cleavage}} <b>furrow</b> in eggs of Arbacia (sea urchin) {{is accompanied}} by a uniform ring of aligned microfilaments, called the contractile ring. Individual contractile ring filaments measure 35 – 60 A and occasionally appear "hollow.

It is closely associated with the plasma membrane at all times, and is probably assembled there. It is about 8 µ wide and 0. 2 µ thick throughout cleavage. Its volume decreases, however, suggesting a contraction-related disassembly of contractile ring filaments, rather than a sliding-filament mechanism in the strict sense. Cytochalasin B (> 10 - 6 M) arrests cleavage within 60 sec, by which time contractile ring filaments are no longer visible ultrastructurally. The furrow may be seen to recede within this time. Karyokinesis is unaffected. Simultaneous disruption of furrowing activity and of the contractile ring largely confirms the vital role of the contractile ring as the organelle of cell cleavage...|$|R
