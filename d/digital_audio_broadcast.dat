40|$|A {{practical}} passive bistatic radar that {{is based}} on target illuminations by <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasts</b> is described. As with all such radars, direct signal interference (DSI) is identified as a major limitation, the effect being exacerbated by the multiplicity of illuminators. In addition, such multiplicity can also make the extraction of the original transmitted signal difficult. DSI is reduced by a combination of analogue and digital null formation and isolation by use of cross polarisation. Fast techniques are developed for signal extraction and digital null formation, allowing these operations to be achieved in real time. Both the hardware and algorithms of the system are described and representative radar observations are included to show the systems effectiveness. C. Coleman, H. Yardle...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the limited}} audio quality of the {{majority}} of AM receivers, and also because AM stereo receivers are relatively scarce, relatively few AM stations employ stereo. Various modulation schemes are used for AM stereo, of which the best-known is Motorola's C-QUAM, the official method for most countries in the world that transmit in AM stereo. More AM stations are adopting digital HD Radio, which allows the transmission of stereo sound on AM stations. For <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> Broadcasting, MP2 audio streams are used.

Significant attention is devoted to developing novel stochastic models for images, investigating the information theoretic performance bounds for them, and designing efficient learning and inference methods for the proposed models. Unlike the commonly accepted approach in which the design of communication systems is performed by first compressing the data into binary representation and then channel coding it to recover from transmission errors, this thesis advocates the joint source-channel coding solution to the problem. The joint approach potentially leads to significant performance gains in emerging multiuser communication scenarios like <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> and video <b>broadcast</b> (DAB and DVB) and multicast over wireless and wireline networks, multimedia communication in heterogeneous environments, and situations with uncertainty and fluctuations in the data source or channel parameters as is typic [...] ...|$|R

High-quality streaming {{can be achieved by}} using, e.g., error-correcting codes and by allowing large delays, large bandwidths, or dedicated/prioritized networks. However, for certain applications, long delays cannot be tolerated. For example, for interactive services such as voice over IP or musicians playing together via the internet, it is crucial that the delay is kept at a minimum. Indeed, for the latter case, it has been noted that delays less than 5 ms are often required [1].|$|E

The objective of this task is to develop, build, test, and demonstrate a prototype receiver that is compatible with reception of <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> programs <b>broadcast</b> via satellites. The receiver is being designed to operate under a range of reception conditions, including fixed, portable, and mobile, as well as over a sufficiently wide range of bit rates to accommodate broadcasting systems with different cost/audio quality objectives.

One solution may be a basic low cost core design suitable for a majority of reception conditions, with optional enhancements for reception in especially difficult environments. Some of the receiver design parameters were established through analysis, laboratory tests, and a prototype satellite experiment accomplished in late 1991.

40|$|Passive {{radar systems}} use illuminations by {{transmitters}} of opportunity, such as <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasts</b> (DAB), {{to detect and}} track targets. In bistatic radar systems, the transmitting and receiving antennas are separate and widely spaced. In an era of strong demand for enhanced surveillance, proponents of passive bistatic radar (PBR) technology assert that it offers many benefits, in particular the use of already existing transmitters. PBR systems suffer from high system complexity however. This presents challenges for PBR designers and researchers, as testing ideas experimentally is prohibitively expensive. Direct signal interference (DSI) {{is a major problem}} in all passive radar systems and occurs when the direct signals transmitted by the illuminators are stronger than the target return signals. This can lead to a large reduction in the dynamic range that is available for target detection. DAB networks are particularly problematic because there are often a large number of illuminators present that are transmitting virtually identical signals at the same frequency. This thesis describes the development of a realistic model/simulator for a general PBR system {{that can be used to}} develop radar algorithms, DSI mitigation techniques and optimise the design of radar systems. The simulator can be applied to multi-transmitter/multi-receiver systems, which allows researchers to test ideas without building equipment. In this thesis, a brief introduction is given to PBR, including its history, challenges and an overview of radar modelling and simulation. A rudimentary PBR model is then described and verified by comparison of a simulated radar signal produced by the model with that of an off-the-air radar signal. The rudimentary model is made more realistic by the addition of more sophisticated propagation effects, namely, diffraction, multipath and depolarisation. Further enhancements are made with the development of radar cross section and antenna gain components. The model is then used to simulate a number of realistic scenarios involving typical aircraft flight paths around the University of Bath in the UK. Finally, the model is applied to the testing of a DSI mitigation technique, namely, shielding by topography, using the Bath region as a test case. The success of the simulation results suggests that the technique can be used in the Adelaide area of South Australia. The simulator serves as a virtual multi-static environment for developing applications such as a tracker. A tracker would need to function in a variety of situations, and its operation would be affected by factors such as terrain and DSI. A detailed knowledge of the propagation environment would be necessary for the development of such a tracker, and the simulator can provide this knowledge. Thesis (M. Phil.)

The satellite used its onboard propulsion system to raise both its apogee and its perigee to geostationary orbit {{as well as to}} decrease the orbital inclination to zero, however its propellant was depleted prior to successfully raising its orbit. The satellite used two different propellant tanks, built in Germany and India, which resulted in an unequal flow of fuel, causing the spacecraft to tilt.

Recovery required the use of more propellant than planned which resulted in the satellite having no propellant left to complete its final circularization maneuver.
