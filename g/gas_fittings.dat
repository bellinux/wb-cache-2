5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since <b>gas</b> <b>fittings</b> would not be compatible.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{line that}} used to run {{alongside}} {{the western side of}} the factory has disappeared, as has a large water cooler that stood to the northeast of the factory. A 1929 Ruston Hornsby Model 9XHC 132 horsepower diesel engine, with a seven-foot flywheel, and a 1935 Ruston Hornsby Model VER 220 horsepower diesel of 18 tonnes, remained on site until June 2004. These engines would have been used to run the factory's machinery, as well as to generate electricity for Nanango.

50|$|The {{cornerstone}} for the {{new building}} was laid on May 21, 1903. The public reception {{for the opening of}} the new building was held on January 16, 1904. The total cost of the library was $15,597, almost $600 more than the gift of Andrew Carnegie. The cost of the furniture for the building was $950. The architects were the Emery Brothers and Mr. J. B. Simonson. The mason contractor was John M. Rooney. The carpentry was done by E.H. DeBaun. Plumbing and <b>gas</b> <b>fitting</b> was done by A.L. Henry. Painting and decorating was done by Hill and Hubbell. The library expanded in 1973, 1993, and 2010. The grand opening of the renovated Carnegie building and the new wing was on May 7, 2011.|$|R
50|$|The college offers further {{education}} to about 19,000 students in full- and part-time education including courses for 14- to 16-year-olds {{in collaboration with}} local schools.

40|$|This report {{resulted}} from a request by the Council of Australian Governments to conduct a preliminary high-level review of sixteen areas of policy reform, aimed at improving productivity. The paper was provided on 29 June 2012 to the cross jurisdictional Taskforce established to advise Council of Australian Governments (COAG) {{on the development of}} a National Productivity Compact between governments and business associations. This review covers 16 topics nominated by COAG spanning an assortment of activities, markets, processes and practices. The nominated reform topics span several broad reform streams, including reducing regulatory burdens on business, reducing government administration costs, improving productivity, enhancing regulatory processes and guarding against backsliding of reforms already achieved. Reflecting this, the topics also vary considerably in scope. Best practice regulation (avi), for example, could affect most of the Australian economy, whereas the inclusion of <b>gas</b> <b>fitting</b> in the National Construction Code is of a different order of magnitude...|$|R
50|$|There are two US {{standards}} {{for determining the}} quality of any PTFE tape. MIL-T-27730A (an obsolete military specification still commonly used in industry in the US) requires a minimum thickness of 3.5 mils and a minimum PTFE purity of 99%. The second standard, A-A-58092, is a commercial grade which maintains the thickness requirement of MIL-T-27730A and adds a minimum density of 1.2 g/cm3. Relevant standards may vary between industries; tape for <b>gas</b> <b>fittings</b> (to UK gas regulations) is required to be thicker than that for water. Although PTFE itself is suitable for use with high-pressure oxygen, the grade of tape must also be known {{to be free from}} grease.|$|E
5000|$|Inside {{the church}} the nave is {{separated}} from the aisles by arcades of four bays supported on alternate round and octagonal piers. All the fittings date {{from the time of}} the building of the church. These include the pews with poppyhead ends, the stone font, the stone pulpit, and the wooden chancel screen. [...] The original <b>gas</b> <b>fittings</b> are still in the church, although they are no longer functioning. These include the pipes, the wall brackets, and on the top of the chancel screen, a burner bar consisting of a row of gas jets. [...] The organ formerly in the church has been removed.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes the {{opposite}} (left-handed, counterclockwise, reverse) sense of threading {{is used for}} a special reason. A thread might need to be left-handed to prevent operational stresses from loosening it. For example, some older cars and trucks had right-handed lug nuts on the right wheels and left-handed ones on the left wheels, so that, as the vehicle moved forward, the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen. For bicycle pedals, {{the one on the}} left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use. Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening. A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other. Some <b>gas</b> <b>fittings</b> are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections: oxygen fittings are right-handed, but acetylene, propane, and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings.|$|E

50|$|Police {{investigations}} {{after his}} arrest in 1892 revealed that Deeming had moved to Australia in 1882, chiefly working in Sydney, but also working for John Danks, a Melbourne importer of plumbing and <b>gas</b> <b>fitting</b> supplies. His Melbourne employers regarded him as an excellent worker and extended him 200 pounds credit, supposedly to open a business in Rockhampton, Queensland. The money was never repaid. Deeming {{is known to have}} worked for a Sydney gasfitter, where he was charged with theft of brass fittings from his employer. Deeming indignantly denied the theft, but the items were found at his home and he was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment. Deeming pretended to faint when the sentence was pronounced. After his release he continued to work in Sydney as a gasfitter until, in December 1887, he was again committed for trial, now on a charge of fraudulent insolvency. He disappeared from New South Wales while on bail.|$|R

50|$|The {{most unusual}} feature of Gough's design {{was a great}} blank arch in the east wall, {{furnished}} externally with niches for statues instead of window lights. At first the interior walling was finished off in plain brick, in anticipation of decorative glories to come. Some rich fittings had been installed by the date of consecration, notably the Caen stone pulpit, designed apparently by Gough and carved by Baron Felix de Sziemanowicz of Kennington (placed in continental fashion almost halfway down the nave, as though to distance it from the altar), some carving outside the Lady Chapel and the sedilia and piscina on {{the south of the}} Sanctuary (1888).The soundingboard designed by J. Harold Gibbons and made by Pearson, Brown and Company of Manchester was added in 1907. The seven sacrament font in its baptistery all designed by Gough and carved by Sziemanowicz with panels 'after Müller's pictures at Düsseldorf', (1888), the walls were still plain brick. Lighting was by means of metal <b>gas</b> <b>fittings</b> (1887) looking rather like open thimbles, which have sadly long since vanished. They were provided by the firm of J.

40|$|A {{series of}} strict {{emission}} control measures were implemented in Beijing and surrounding regions to ensure good air quality during the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and 2015 Grand Military Parade (Parade), {{which led to}} blue sky days during these two events {{commonly referred to as}} >APEC Blue> and >Parade Blue>. Here we calculated Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO and HCHO results based on well known DOAS trace <b>gas</b> <b>fitting</b> algorithm and WRF-Chem model (with measured climatology parameter and newest emission inventor) simulated trace gases profiles. We found the NO columns abruptly decreased both Parade (43 %) and APEC (21 %) compared with the periods before these two events. The back-trajectory cluster analysis and the potential source contribution function (PSCF) proved regional transport from southern peripheral cities {{plays a key role in}} pollutants observed at Beijing. The diminishing transport contribution from southern air mass during Parade manifests the real effect of emission control measures on NO pollution. Based on the ratios of HCHO over NO we found there were not only limited the NO pollutant but also suppress the O contaminant during Parade, while O increased during the APEC. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
