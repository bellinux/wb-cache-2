40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the algorithm <b>hat</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> during the upcoming Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission for discriminating between clouds and aerosols detected in two wavelength backscatter lidar profiles. We first analyze single-test and multiple-test classification approaches based on one-dimensional and multiple-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) {{in the context of}} a two-class feature identification scheme. From these studies we derive an operational algorithm based on a set of 3 -dimensional probability distribution functions characteristic of clouds and aerosols. A dataset acquired by the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) is used to test the algorithm. Comparisons are conducted between the CALIPSO algorithm results and the CPL data product. The results obtained show generally good agreement between the two methods. However, of a total of 228, 264 layers analyzed, approximately 5. 7 % are classified as different types by the CALIPSO and CPL algorithm. This disparity is shown to be due largely to the misclassification of clouds as aerosols by the CPL algorithm. The use of 3 -dimensional PDFs in the CALIPSO algorithm is found to significantly reduce this type of error. Dust presents a special case. Because the intrinsic scattering properties of dust layers can be very similar to those of clouds, additional algorithm testing was performed using an optically dense layer of Saharan dust measured during the Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE). In general, the method is shown to distinguish reliably between dust layers and clouds. The relatively few erroneous classifications occurred most often in the LITE data, in those regions of the Saharan dust layer where the optical thickness was the highest...|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{multi-rate}} {{nature of}} the system equations given in Eqs. (12) and (13), the estimation process consists of two parts: the prediction step at every fast sample time T_s, and the correction step at every vision sample time T_v. The key {{point is that the}} correction is operated in a retrospective way to fully recover the measurement delay coming from the delayed vision data, thereby ensuring that the estimates reflect the current (real-time) state information. In the remaining part of the paper, the bar notation, ∙̅ <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to denote the values measured by the sensors while the <b>hat</b> notation, ∙̂, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to denote the estimated values.|$|R

40|$|Australian {{children}} and their families live and enjoy an outdoor lifestyle in an environment with variable and at times, high ultraviolet radiation levels. Generally they have been successfully educated to care for their skin against sun damage. However a similar message regarding the need for eye care has not been as forthcoming. Recent research has shown evidence of sun damage in young Australian children's eyes and indicates the need for eye sun protection. Developing strategies such as wearing hats and sunglasses which aim to mmrmrse eye damage are indicated. In doing this the link between sun avoidance and vitamin D deficiency-related disease needs to be considered. This paper presents a review of the scientific literature which reports on the prevalence of sun-related eye changes and damage in children's eyes. Possible prevention strategies which offer protection to Australian children's eyes such as sunscreen, sunglasses and <b>hats</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> discussed.
