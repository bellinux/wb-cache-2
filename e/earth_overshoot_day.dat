5000|$|... == <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> == Previously {{known as}} Ecological Debt Day, <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> {{is the day}} when {{humanity}} has exhausted nature's budget for the year. For {{the rest of the}} year, society operates in ecological overshoot by drawing down local resource stocks and accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The first <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> was December 19, 1987. In 2014, <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> was August 19. The <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> in 2015 was on August 13 and on August 8 in 2016.. In 2017, <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> landed on August 2.

50|$|The {{concept of}} an {{environmental}} credit is aligned to <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> (Ecological Debt Day). <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> is {{the point in the}} year at which the world economy moves from generating growth with renewable resources, to generating growth with non-renewable resources. After <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day,</b> humanity is dependent on environmental credit to sustain its standard of living. Currently just over a quarter of the year is spent living on environmental credit.|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{phytohemagglutinin}} (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A) responsiveness of thymus {{and bone}} marrow cells, and E, EA, and EAC rosette-forming cells (E, EA, EAC) of these organs and spleen were studied in Fisher rats at various time intervals following a carcinogenic treatment with urethan (UR). Immediately after treatment, organ cellularities were drastically reduced with a progressive recovery as time passed. 1 day after treatment, {{the response of}} thymocytes to PHA showed a fourfold increase while organ cellularity dropped to 1 %. This response fell below normal values after 7 <b>days</b> with an <b>overshoot</b> after <b>days</b> 14 and 21. UR-treated bone marrow cells showed a response to PHA below normal values after 1 and 7 days, a twofold increase after 3 <b>days</b> and an <b>overshoot</b> after 14 and 21 days. The responsiveness to Con A of both organs was affected by UR treatment to a much lesser extent, although following a pattern {{similar to that of}} PHA. E were never found, whether in normal nor in UR-treated animals. As far as the B-cell compartment is concerned, UR causes a progressive diminution of EAC, while the number of EA remains unaffected. The data are discussed in terms of selective effect on T- and B-cell subpopulation...|$|R
30|$|Peak {{electricity}} demand usually occurs {{during the late}} afternoon and early evening hours on weekdays, as {{large numbers of people}} arrive home from work, turn on appliances, and cool or heat their homes [8]. Peaking technologies, which have historically been fueled by natural gas, can ramp up quickly on a daily basis and provide the necessary energy to achieve supply and demand equilibrium. In order to ensure that supply is adequate and no blackouts occur, electricity system operators require a certain amount of reserve capacity that is usually represented as a percentage <b>overshoot</b> of that <b>day’s</b> anticipated peak demand. For example, if the peak expected hourly demand is 50 MW, an additional 8 MW are needed as a cushion to ensure sufficient supply during periods of unanticipated stress [9]. Operating reserves are comprised of spinning and non-spinning reserve capacity. Spinning reserves are plants that are already connected to the grid system and are capable of ramping up their power output within minutes. Non-spinning reserves are offline facilities that can be turned on to provide power after a short delay.|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of acetylcholinesterase molecular forms were examined after separation on sucrose gradients during notexin-induced necrosis {{and the following}} regeneration in rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles. All forms dropped rapidly in both muscles {{in the first few}} days after single notexin injection. After a delay small globular forms (G 1 +G 2) started to regenerate from day 7 and larger forms (G 4 and A 12) from day 10 in EDL. The A 8 form which cannot be detected in normal EDL was present between day 7 and day 28. In SOL the recovery of AChE forms begun already on day 3. The small globular forms displayed a more rapid increase between day 3 and day 7 then the other forms. In SOL we observed a temporary <b>overshooting</b> peak at <b>day</b> 7 in the {{activity of}} all molecular forms. Both muscles recovered their normal AChE pattern by that time when muscle fibres regained their normal diameter (day 28). Most of the events of regeneration of AChE forms resembled those of normal myogenesis. © 2005 Springer...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> (EOD), {{previously}} {{known as}} Ecological Debt Day (EDD), is the calculated illustrative calendar date on which humanity’s resource consumption {{for the year}} exceeds Earth’s capacity to regenerate those resources that year. <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> is calculated by dividing the world biocapacity (the amount of natural resources generated by Earth that year), by the world ecological footprint (humanity's consumption of Earth’s natural resources for that year), and multiplying by 365, {{the number of days}} in one Gregorian common calendar year: ...|$|E

50|$|When {{viewed through}} an {{economic}} perspective, EOD represents {{the day in}} which humanity enters an ecological deficit spending. In ecology the term <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> illustrates the level by which human population overshoots its environment.|$|E
6000|$|And besides all this, {{is there}} nothing in dark providences, {{for the sake}} of the sight and {{observation}} of which, such a day may be rendered lovely, when it is upon us? Is there nothing of God, of his wisdom and power and goodness to be seen in thunder, and lightning, in hailstones? in storms? and darkness and tempests? Why then is it said, he [...] "hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm" [...] (Nahum 1:3). And why have God's servants of old made such notes, and observed from them such excellent and wonderful things. There is that of God to be seen in such a day as cannot be seen in another. His power in holding up some, his wrath in leaving of others; his making of shrubs to stand, and his suffering of cedars to fall; his infatuating of the counsels of men, and his making of the devil to outwit himself; his giving of his presence to his people, and his leaving of his foes in the dark; his discovering the uprightness of the hearts of his sanctified ones, and laying open the hypocrisy of others, is a working of spiritual wonders in the day of his wrath, and of the whirlwind and storm. These days! these days are the days that do most aptly give an occasion to Christians, of any, to take the exactest measures and scantlings of ourselves. We are apt to <b>overshoot,</b> in <b>days</b> that are calm, and to think ourselves far higher, and more strong than we find we be, when the trying day is upon us. The mouth of Gaal and the boasts of Peter were great and high before the trial came, but when that came, they found themselves to fall far short of the courage they thought they had (Judg 9:38). We also, before the temptation comes, think we can walk upon the sea, but when the winds blow, we feel ourselves begin to sink. Hence such a time is rightly said to be a time to try us, or to find out what we are, and is there no good in this? Is it not this that rightly rectifies our judgment about ourselves, that makes us to know ourselves, that tends to cut off those superfluous sprigs of pride and self-conceitedness, wherewith we are subject to be overcome? Is not such a day, the day that bends us, humbleth us, and that makes us bow before God, for our faults committed in our prosperity? and yet doth it yield no good unto us? we cold not live without such turnings of the hand of God upon us. We should be overgrown with flesh, if we had not our seasonable winters. It is said that in some countries trees will grow, but will bear no fruit, because there is no winter there. The Lord bless all seasons to his people, and help them rightly to behave themselves, under all the times that go over them. Farewell. I am thine to serve thee in the gospel, JOHN BUNYAN.|$|R
5000|$|The Breakthrough Institute {{regards the}} idea of <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> and how many Earths we consume as [...] "a nice {{publicity}} stunt". According to United Nations data, forests and fisheries are, as a whole, regenerating faster than they are depleted, while cropland and pasture use is equal to what is available. Hence, <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> does a poor job at measuring water and land mismanagement (e.g., soil erosion) and only highlights the excess of carbon dioxide that humanity releases above what the ecosystem can absorb. In other words, the additional equivalent number of Earths that humanity requires is equivalent to land area that, if filled with carbon sinks like forests, would balance carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to the Breakthrough Institute Report, Mathis Wackernagel, {{founder and president of}} the Global Footprint Network, points out that a reliable adjustment to the current analysis behind <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> would [...] "require data sets that do not exist", and that the fishery surplus [...] "might be more a reflection of poor UN fisheries data than healthy fisheries".|$|E
50|$|Advocates for <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> {{note that}} the costs of {{ecological}} overspending are becoming more evident over time. Climate change — a result of greenhouse gases being emitted faster than they can be absorbed by forests and oceans — is the most obvious result and widespread effects. Other cited effects include: shrinking forests, species loss, fisheries collapse, higher commodity prices and civil unrest.|$|E
50|$|Andrew Simms of UK {{think tank}} New Economics Foundation {{originally}} developed {{the concept of}} <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day.</b> Global Footprint Network, a partner organization of New Economics Foundation, launches a campaign every year for <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day</b> {{to raise awareness of}} Earth’s limited resources. Global Footprint Network measures humanity’s demand for and supply of natural resources and ecological services. Global Footprint Network estimates that in less than eight months, we demand more renewable resources and CO2 sequestration than what the planet can provide for an entire year. Throughout most of history, humanity has used nature’s resources to build cities and roads, to provide food and create products, and to release carbon dioxide at a rate that was well within Earth’s budget. But by the early 1970s, that critical threshold had been crossed: Human consumption began outstripping what the planet could reproduce. According to Global Footprint Network’s calculations, our demand for renewable ecological resources and the services they provide is now equivalent to that of more than 1.5 Earths. The data shows us on track to require the resources of two planets well before mid-2000-century.|$|E
5000|$|The global hectare (gha) is a {{measurement}} unit for quantifying both the ecological footprint of people or activities {{as well as the}} biocapacity of the earth or its regions. One global hectare represents the average productivity of all biologically productive areas (measured in hectares) on earth in a given year. Examples of biologically productive areas include cropland, forests, and fishing grounds; they do not include deserts, glaciers, and the open ocean. [...] "Global hectare per person" [...] refers to the amount of biologically productive land and water available per person on the planet. The total number of global hectares is approximately 11.3 billion, averaging about 1.8 global hectares per person (2004). A total of 13.4 billion hectares were used, or 2.2 global hectares per person, meaning about 20% more was consumed than produced. This is possible because there are natural reserves all around the globe that function as backup food, material and energy supplies, although only for {{a relatively short period of}} time. Due to rapid population growth, these reserves are being depleted at an ever increasing tempo. See <b>Earth</b> <b>Overshoot</b> <b>Day.</b>|$|E
