500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. I want it to really reflect the song. So I wanted to make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E

60|$|Sir Ratcliffe hurried his tutor along. 'Here <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> Constance,' he eagerly exclaimed. Lady Armine {{rose and}} welcomed Mr. Glastonbury very cordially. 'Your presence, my dear sir, has, I assure you, been long desired by both of us,' she said, with a {{delightful}} smile.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, Jack!' she cried. 'I {{have heard}} such a fearsome rumour--what doth it mean? He {{who told me}} <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> He must be deceived!

6000|$|... “Yes,” he said; “but {{not in the}} way I {{think you}} mean. She <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend’s</b> sweetheart, and nothing to me. No doubt she has married him by now.” ...|$|R
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Ah! {{you must}} be at home to me, Arthur. You <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> Perhaps by to-morrow you will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> only friend. My wife has {{discovered}} everything.|$|R

6000|$|... "Will! O Will! That's horrible! Aside {{from the}} vulgarity----Some ways, Vida <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> Even if she HAD said it. Which, {{as a matter}} of fact, she didn't." [...] He reared up his thick shoulders, in absurd pink and green {{flannelette}} pajamas. He sat straight, and irritatingly snapped his fingers, and growled: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what you are asking?" [...] said the Fairy of the Desert, frowning, and looking at him suspiciously. [...] "Do you want me to employ my art against the Yellow Dwarf, who <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> and take away from him a proud princess whom I can but look upon as my rival?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hilda shuddered with evident horror. [...] "He {{is not my}} father--thank Heaven!"

I mean him to live. He <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> now--and my bitterest enemy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crazy! The idea! Indeed, Mr. Fairwell, {{these boys}} are not crazy. They <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends.</b> They <b>are</b> Tom and Sam Rover, {{and they are}} {{brothers}} to the Dick Rover I told you about." ...|$|R

60|$|WISE MAN. If {{there is}} one amongst you that believes, he will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> Surely there <b>is</b> one amongst you. [They are all silent.] Surely what you learned at your mother's knees has not been so soon forgotten.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] says I. [...] "Now, Rebosa, I'm {{old enough}} to have owed money to your father. And that old, specious, dressed-up, garbled, sea-sick ptomaine prancing about avidiously like an {{irremediable}} turkey gobbler with patent leather shoes on <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> Why did you go and get him invested in this marriage business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That is true,” {{the little}} Indian replied. “The Englishman’s eyes must be quick indeed, and his nerve steady. It was seeing him catch up his gun that first called my {{attention}} to it. You have laid us both under a great obligation, señor, for Pita <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> and were aught to befall him I should feel that I had lost part of myself. Perhaps before the journey {{comes to an end}} {{we may be able to}} show you how grateful we are.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because it is true! Because I can't help it! Because I {{wish to be}} {{everything}} to you, and I have to begin by saying that. But don't answer me now; you need never answer me. I only wish you to use me as you would use some one who loved you beyond anything on earth,--as freely as that, and yet not be bound or hampered by me in the least. Can you do that? I mean, can you feel, 'This <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> the truest friend that any one can have, and I will let him do anything and everything he wishes for me.' Can you do that,--say that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! no! no! not two <b>best</b> <b>friends.</b> And you <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> Mysie, ever so {{much better}} than Alberta Fitzhugh, if only you'll come always to me this little time when I'm here, and sit by me instead of that Dolly.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of her style, Feltus says, [...] "I sing you {{the song}} as if I <b>were</b> telling you <b>my</b> story {{in your kitchen}} and you <b>were</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> At other times I sing it as if you're not even there, as if no one's watching." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{quarrel with}} you," [...] murmured Almayer with unwilling deference. [...] "Only I wish I could {{understand}} you.

6000|$|... "I {{know quite}} well," [...] said the Mermaid, [...] "that the Princess is {{sitting by the}} brook-side, just where you saw her as you passed, but as you will have many enemies to fight with before you can reach her, take this sword; armed with it you may dare any danger, and {{overcome}} the greatest difficulties, only beware of one thing--that is, never to let it fall from your hand. Farewell; now I will wait by that rock, {{and if you need}} my help in carrying off your beloved Princess I will not fail you, for the Queen, her mother, <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> and it was for her sake that I went to rescue you." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the present}} time Raymond evidently wished to appear amiable. Wit, hilarity, and deep {{observation}} were mingled in his talk, rendering every sentence that he uttered as a flash of light. He soon conquered my latent distaste; I endeavoured to watch him and Perdita, and {{to keep in mind}} every thing I had heard to his disadvantage. But all appeared so ingenuous, and all was so fascinating, that I forgot everything except the pleasure his society afforded me. Under the idea of initiating me in the scene of English politics and society, of which I was soon to become a part, he narrated a number of anecdotes, and sketched many characters; his discourse, rich and varied, flowed on, pervading all my senses with pleasure. But for one thing he would have been completely triumphant. He alluded to Adrian, and spoke of him with that disparagement that the worldly wise always attach to enthusiasm. He perceived the cloud gathering, and tried to dissipate it; but the strength of my feelings would not permit me to pass thus lightly over this sacred subject; so I said emphatically, [...] "Permit me to remark, that I am devotedly attached to the Earl of Windsor; he <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> and benefactor. I reverence his goodness, I accord with his opinions, and bitterly lament his present, and I trust temporary, illness. That illness, from its peculiarity, makes it painful to me beyond words to hear him mentioned, unless in terms of respect and affection." ...|$|E
50|$|Barnes' second book, A Buzzard <b>is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Friend,</b> was {{published}} in 1981. A Buzzard <b>is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Best</b> <b>Friend</b> was autobiographical, and dealt with her life in Virginia as a farmer, and earned Barnes a Georgia Author of the Year Award. Her third book, The Tragedy and the Triumph of Phenix City, Alabama, dealt with corruption and crime in Phenix City, Alabama, which is across the Chattahoochee River from Columbus, Georgia.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is Malcolm Anderson; {{it is to}} him I owe everything. He {{carried me}} off and took me away with him to Scotland the day <b>my</b> father <b>was</b> arrested. He has <b>been</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> ever since, and it is he who brought me here to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Torrance closed one hand. [...] "Grant of Fremont <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> {{and when}} he died I 'most brought the lad up as a son. When he got hold of his foolish notions it hurt me considerably, and I did what I could {{to talk him out}} of them." ...|$|R
60|$|Frankness <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> {{in dealing}} with Castelroux--frankness and his distaste for the {{business}} they had charged him with. As for Marsac and Lesperon, they were both eager enough to have the mystery explained, and when Castelroux having consented--I invited them to my chamber, they came readily enough.|$|R
