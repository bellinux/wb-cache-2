40|$|It is not {{an unusual}} {{complaint}} that in patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris or hand eczema, using warm water causes pain and/or itching of the injured skin. In using warm water, there are some patients with injured skin who do not complain of pain and/or itching and ordinary patients with skin injured as much as former who complain of pain and/or itching. This made us think {{that there must be}} a difference in the warm water used by these patients. Usually we get warm water from gas instantly heated water or from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water. In patients using warm water from gas instantly heated water the complaints were more frequent than in patients using warm water from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water. Residual chlorine in water is well known to be the main factor worsening skin disease. Therfore, residual chlorine levels in gas instantly <b>heated</b> water and <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water were measured at same temperature (40 ℃). Levels of the former were 67. 5 ～ 77. 5 % and that of the latter were 12. 5 - 31. 7 % of tap water. Then this significant difference in the levels of residual chlorine was thought to be a cause for the difference of complaints between patients using warm water from gas instantly heated water and patients using warm water from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water...|$|R

40|$|In the Pacific Northwest, {{about 40}} % of new <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> homes are HUD-code {{manufactured}} homes (commonly called {open_quotes}mobile homes{close_quotes}). The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) sets national energy-efficiency construction standards for manufactured homes that preempt them from local building codes. Until October 1994, {{a relatively low}} efficiency requirement established in 1976 by HUD was in place for manufactured homes. The Bonneville Power Administration (Bonneville) is required to acquire cost-effective energy efficiency to meet the electricity needs of the Pacific Northwest. Because <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> manufactured homes are so common and are relatively inefficient, Bonneville, utilities, state energy offices, and others have {{conducted a series of}} programs since 1982 to upgrade their efficiency (1). Because of the preemptive national code, these programs have all been voluntary for manufactured homes. Bonneville and the regional utilities and manufacturers created the Manufactured Housing Acquisition Program (MAP) in April 1992 after conducting projects for ten years to determine the cost of manufactured home energy-efficiency upgrades, predict and measure energy consumption, and establish a regional partnership. The program was phased in over several months; since October 1992, all <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> manufactured homes produced in the region have been built to MAP specifications...|$|R
