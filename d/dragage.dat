50|$|In the 1970s a major {{consolidation}} movement {{happened in}} the dredging industry in Europe. In 25 years, the number of European dredging companies dropped from fourteen in 1970 to six {{by the turn of}} the century. On 27 November 1974 the dredging division of Ackermans & van Haaren merged with Société Générale de <b>Dragage</b> - creating synergies that proved to be much welcome in the booming markets of the Middle East after the 1973 oil shock. Together they formed Dredging International.|$|E
50|$|The {{founding}} {{companies of}} DEME {{have always been}} active both on their first home market Belgium and abroad. Total volume dredged by Ackermans & van Haaren between 1888 and 1967, both in Belgium and abroad has been calculated at 593,254,000 m3 - without counting the 8,548,000 m3 of rock that was removed and some 1,941,000 m3 of civil constructions and bank protection. Before the First World War, Ackermans & van Haaren was involved in port construction and dredging in France, Russia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Since the early 1950s Baggerwerken Decloedt & Zoon and Société Générale de <b>Dragage</b> became involved in dredging and reclamation projects all over the world.|$|E
5000|$|Bongo was a commune until March 2012, when {{it became}} one of 1126 communes {{nationwide}} that were abolished.Bongo {{is in fact a}} gathering of four different villages. the division is based on the will of the Well known rubber company, SAPH, to set dwelling places for its workers. Among the villages we have Bongo, which comprises V1 and Bongo Village (V1 and Bongo village form one place), then we have V2 commonly known as Point d'Eau (because of the river flowing in it), V3 commonly name G12 (because of its geographic location between the 25 hectares of rubber trees identified as G11 and the other 25 hectares of rubber trees identified as G13), the fourth village is CU (Centre Usine) that name {{is due to the fact}} that the rubber transformation factory is located in this village, CU is commonly known as <b>Dragage.</b>|$|E

5000|$|According to Mort J. Richardson in The Dynamics of Dredging Ackermans & van Haaren held {{a leading}} {{position}} in technological innovation, {{from the very}} beginning. In 1895 Ackermans & van Haaren was at the cradle of hydraulic dredging techniques and successfully designed a suction dredger, capable of unloading by its own. In the same year, a first vessel of that type was built and christended as Schelde II. Société Générale de Dragage/Algemene Baggermaatschappij (SGD) realized the very first application of a submersible pump in dredging, when such a device was developed and fixed on the drag head of TSHD Maas. At {{the time of her}} commissioning in September 1994 DEME's 17,000 m3 flagship Pearl River became, according to Richardson (p. 11), [...] "the very first suction hopper dredge of a completely new generation - featuring twice as much capacity as its biggest successor." [...] In 2005 DEME's French subsidiary Société de <b>Dragage</b> International (SDI) launched the world's largest heavy-duty and ocean-going cutter suction dredger d'Artagnan (28,200 kW installed power).|$|E
50|$|DEME has a {{fleet of}} almost 300 vessels, among which over 80 main {{dredging}} and hydraulic engineering vessels. At the end of 2009 DEME owned and operated 25 trailing suction hopper dredgers (TSHDs such as the Jade River) with a capacity from 1,635 to 30,000 m3. They include the 24,130 m3 Pearl River {{which was the first}} megatrailer in the world when she was commissioned in 1994. At the same date the group owned and operated 20 cutter suction dredgers (CSD's), whose installed power is between 441 kW and 28,200 kW. The CSD fleet includes the world's heaviest self-propelled and ocean-going rock breaker, the 28,200 kW d'Artagnan. d'Artagnan was built for DEME's French subsidiary Société de <b>Dragage</b> International (SDI) and launched in 2005. In July 2010 a model of CSD d'Artagnan was handed over to the Panama Canal Authority. Further plant includes a variety of backhoe dredgers (a.o. the 2,600 kW Pinocchio); lifting vessels (a.o. the 3,300 tons Rambiz); self-elevating drilling platforms (a.o. the 1,600 tons Goliath fallpipe vessels (a.o. the 19,000 tons Flintstone); and auxiliary equipment. In 2010 DEME appointed Wilhelmsen Ships Service as supplier for maintenance products and technical gases globally.|$|E
40|$|Une procédure d'évaluation des risques pour l'écosystème aquatique engendrés par un dépôt de matériaux de <b>dragage</b> dans une gravière type a été élaborée, et testée avec des échantillons de sédiments d'un canal du Nord-Est de la France. La procédure comporte une étape d'évaluation sommaire des risques, à partir de quotients des {{concentrations}} mesurées par les critères de danger correspondants, et une étape d'évaluation détaillée où des essais de toxicité et de lixiviation en colonnes sont mis en œuvre. Le scénario testé retient trois hypothèses, qui concernent (a) les effets sur les peuplements d'invertébrés benthiques, représentés notamment par Hyalella azteca et Chironomus riparius, (b) les effets sur les peuplements d'organismes pélagiques, représentés par Chlorella vulgaris, Ceriodaphnia dubia, et Brachionus calyciflorus, et (c) la pollution de la nappe alluviale associée. Différentes modalités d'exposition (essais normalisés, microcosmes) ont été testées. Dans le contexte particulier des trois sédiments étudiés, ces hypothèses se sont avérées plus ou moins discriminantes, la pollution de la nappe étant la plus sensible. Des améliorations de la procédure doivent être envisagées qui concernent à la fois la formulation des hypothèses (risques à court et long terme sur les organismes pélagiques), et les protocoles d'essai, tant pour les organismes du sédiment (rôle de la nourriture notamment) que pour les essais de lixiviation en colonnes. When {{contaminated by}} metals or synthetic organic compounds, dredged sediments may have negative impacts on receiving ecosystems. Therefore, {{there is a}} need for an operational risk assessment approach. Such a framework is proposed for dredged material deposits in open gravel quarries, which is a rather common means of disposal in France. The first step of the assessment relies upon chemical characterisation of the sediments; the resulting concentrations are divided by "probable effect concentrations" and pooled together, in order to calculate a global hazard quotient. According to the value of this quotient, several decisions can be taken: (a) undertake a detailed risk assessment, (b) dispose of the materials without further constraints, or (c) in case of uncertainty, do some biological testing (with Hyalella azteca and Chironomus riparius) in order to allow decisions. The second step is a detailed ecological risk assessment. Three different assessment endpoints have been proposed, which are (1) the deposit should have no effect on the structure and abundance of benthic invertebrates in the quarry, (2) it should have no long term effect on pelagic species, and (3) it should not cause groundwater pollution, as such quarries are in fact cross sections of shallow alluvial groundwater aquifers. A fourth assessment endpoint should be introduced, regarding health risks for recreational uses, including fishing, but this endpoint was not implemented in the current version of the approach. The analysis phase includes aquatic bioassays (bacteria - Metplate TM-, algae, microcrustaceans Ceriodaphnia dubia, rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus), and leaching assays in columns under ascendant flow. The proposed approach was tested with 3 sediments from a canal located in the north-eastern region of France. Microcosm assays were introduced in parallel to the proposed tests, in order to explore alternatives to standardised bioassays. According to their hazard quotient, the 3 sediments showed a contamination gradient; one of them should not have entered the detailed risk assessment phase, while another would have been further tested with H. azteca and C. riparius. In that case, this latter sediment would not have entered the detailed phase either, as it was not toxic to these species. However, the detailed risk assessment approach was applied to the three sediments, so as to test completely the relevance of the framework. The three sediments were not significantly toxic to either C. riparius or H. azteca. However, some effects were observed in microcosms, including genotoxicity to molluscs. In this case, no risk characterisation could be made. Pore waters extracted from the three sediments were not toxic or slightly toxic to bacteria, algae, and C. dubia; an EC 10 value could be determined only for B. calyciflorus. Therefore, due to exposure calculations, it seems there is a risk to pelagic species. However, as 3 bioassays out of 4 were negative or inconclusive, a refinement step would seem to be necessary. The highest concentrations of cadmium, copper, chromium, nickel and zinc were measured in the first lixiviates of the most contaminated sediment. Yet, even in that case, the total extracted fraction remained less than 10 % of the total load. This fraction was below 1 % for the other sediments, whatever the metal. Maximum concentrations and predicted concentrations at 1 year were compared to drinking water standards. This comparison showed a real risk of degrading groundwater quality for that most contaminated sediment, and a transient risk due to cadmium and nickel for the following one on the contamination gradient. Considering these results, the design of the first step of the proposed assessment approach may be discussed, as one sediment which would not have been assessed in depth according to its hazard quotient did show a risk to pelagic species. This discrepancy underlines the fact that some sediment toxicity may exist below the lowest threshold. As it would be unrealistic to enter systematically into detailed risk assessments, the proposed thresholds in the decision diagram must be pragmatic compromises rather than absolutely safe boundaries. Moreover, protocol improvements are needed for sediment toxicity bioassays. Chronic endpoints are preferable, as they are more sensitive and more relevant. Another issue is related to the role of additional food: not adding food may increase the apparent toxicity, but the sediment organic content, which is an alternative food source, may also be a contaminant carrier. Furthermore, the second assessment endpoint (risk to pelagic species) should be reformulated, as it includes in fact two different questions. Short-term risks related to the deposition phase could be assessed with standardised bioassays like C. dubia survival and reproduction and algal growth, while longer term risks related to contaminant diffusion could be assessed with microcosms. Genotoxic effects were observed at rather high levels, as compared to published results. This result stresses the interest of introducing sensitive and early markers in the risk assessment process, although their real meaning for ecosystems is not yet fully elucidated. Finally, the leaching tests in columns are not completely satisfactory, as the column filling implies that one must first dry the sediments, which will alter their structure. Other application trials along with field validation studies should be carried out prior to the introduction of this scenario in operational or regulatory frameworks...|$|E

25|$|The {{second phase}} of the centre, located on an {{artificial}} island, was constructed from 1994 to 1997, and features a bird-like rooftop (also referred to as a turtle by some critics). The project took only 48 months from reclamation to completion. The main constructor of the extension was a joint venture named Hip Hing Construction Co Ltd <b>Dragages</b> et Travaux Publics. Originally, Phase Two was connected to Phase One with an atrium link (a sky bridge), and to Convention Road with two road bridges, but now the two phases are connected by an expanded exhibition hall.|$|R
50|$|A tunnel {{was planned}} in the {{long-term}} development plan for Aberdeen approved by the Governor-in-Council in 1964. Support for the tunnel grew following {{the closure of the}} Wong Nai Chung Gap by landslides. In 1970, Aberdeen kaifong leaders and industrialists called on the government to build the tunnel. A pilot tunnel was dug in the mid-1970s to examine underground rock conditions. Official approval for the full project, comprising the tunnel and the Canal Road flyover extension, was granted in late 1975. The opening of the tunnel was much delayed by both difficult tunneling conditions, and the late arrival of communications equipment from overseas. The contractor was <b>Dragages</b> Hong Kong.|$|R
