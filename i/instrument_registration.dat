40|$|An {{effective}} method is proposed, {{in the present}} work, to reduce considerably the high errors normal in solar radiation data obtained by actinographs or by non-calibrated Eppley-type pyranometers. The method is based on constructing two annual distributions of clear sky solar radiation in each location studied. One of them should be constructed using measurements of an accurate instrument for this purpose, while the other {{is based on the}} actinograph or/and non-calibrated Eppley-type pyranometer under utilization. Then the correction factor can be deduced from these distributions. The correction factor for a Robitzsch-type pyranometer {{has been found to be}} strongly dependent on the ambient temperature. Unlike the case of the Robitzsch instrument, the correction factor for Eppley <b>instrument</b> <b>registrations</b> is practically independent of weather conditions, but it depends highly on the length of the non-calibrated period. Validation of the proposed method is provided by comparison of measurements between those of an accurate instrument and the corrected Robitzsch measurements: it was found that the corrected values are reasonably accurate.

40|$|AbstractThe {{surgical}} {{navigation system}} has experienced tremendous development {{over the past}} decades for minimizing the risks and improving the precision of the surgery. Nowadays, Augmented Reality (AR) -based surgical navigation is a promising technology for clinical applications. In the AR system, virtual and actual reality are mixed, offering real-time, high-quality visualization of an extensive variety of information to the users (Moussa et al., 2012) [1]. For example, virtual anatomical structures such as soft tissues, blood vessels and nerves can be integrated with the real-world scenario in real time. In this study, an AR-based surgical navigation system (AR-SNS) is developed using an optical see-through HMD (head-mounted display), aiming at improving the safety and reliability of the surgery. With {{the use of this}} system, including the calibration of <b>instruments,</b> <b>registration,</b> and the calibration of HMD, the 3 D virtual critical anatomical structures in the head-mounted display are aligned with the actual structures of patient in real-world scenario during the intra-operative motion tracking process.

5000|$|The organ concerto was {{commissioned}} by Princess Edmond de Polignac in 1934, as a piece with a chamber orchestra accompaniment and an easy organ part that the princess could probably play herself. The commission was originally given to Jean Françaix, who declined, but Poulenc accepted. Poulenc quickly abandoned this idea for something much more grandiose and ambitious; his earlier harpsichord concerto and double-piano concerto were simpler, more light-hearted pieces. As {{he wrote in a}} letter to Françaix, [...] "The concerto...is not the amusing Poulenc of the Concerto for two pianos, but more like a Poulenc en route for the cloister." [...] The death of a colleague and friend, the young critic and composer Pierre-Octave Ferroud, in the spring of 1936 made Poulenc go on a pilgrimage to the Black Virgin of Rocamadour, where he rediscovered his Christian faith. This new religious conviction not only nurtured an interest in religious music, which he began to compose, but also highly influenced his incomplete Organ Concerto. Indeed, Poulenc referred to it as being on the fringe of his religious works. Poulenc himself had never actually composed for the organ before, and so he studied great baroque masterpieces for the instrument by Johann Sebastian Bach and Dieterich Buxtehude; the work's neo-baroque feel reflects this. Poulenc was also advised about the <b>instrument's</b> <b>registration</b> and other aspects by the organist Maurice Duruflé. Duruflé was also the soloist in the private premiere of the work on 16 December 1938, with Nadia Boulanger conducting, at Princess Edmond's salon. The first public performance was in June 1939 at the Salle Gaveau in Paris, with Duruflé once again the soloist and Roger Désormière conducting.|$|R

40|$|A sensor-based {{electromagnetic}} system which was presented {{for the first}} time in 2001 was examined on its accuracy, influencing factors and disturbance sources. The system was used in cranial surgical procedures of 250 patients within july 2001 and january 2007. Clinical application was examined regarding different indications in application on the fixed and unfixed cranium. Fiducial Registration Error (FRE) and Target Registration Error (FRE) were measured representing the quality of image data registration. Position Error (PE) was measured representing the application accuracy. Furthermore brainshift, target volume and target depth were determined. All data was analyzed in total and in groups of different indications. For evaluation of application with free head movement, FRE and PE were compared with data of application with fixed head in 40 cases. The influence of potential disturbance sources as electrical devices and surgical instruments was examined. Performance data could be achieved in 246 cases for analysis of image data registration. mean FRE was 1, 66 mm (+/- 0, 61 mm), mean TRE was 1, 59 mm (+/- 0, 57 mm). mean brainshift was 1, 61 mm (+/- 1, 14). it could be achieved in 196 cases. The Examination of the application with free head movement showed a mean FRE of 1, 71 mm (+/- 0, 63 mm) with oral sensor positioning and 1, 75 mm (+/- 0, 41 mm) with retroauricular sensor positioning. Mean FRE in the control group with fixed head was 1, 51 mm (+/- 0, 36 mm).

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} registering for taxes on firm profits in Bolivia, {{the country with the}} highest levels of informality in Latin America. A new survey of micro and small firms enables the authors to control for a rich set of measures of owner ability and business motivations that can affect both profits and the decision to formalize. The paper identifies the impact of tax registration on business profitability using the distance of a firm from the tax office where registration occurs, conditional on the distance to the city center, as an <b>instrument</b> for <b>registration.</b> Proximity to the tax office provides firms with more information about registration, but is argued to not directly affect profits. The findings show that tax registration leads to significantly higher profits for the firms that the instrument affects. However, there is also evidence of heterogeneous effects of tax formality on profits. Tax registration is found to increase profits for the mid-size firms in the sample, but to lower profits for both the smaller and larger firms, in contrast to the standard view that formality increases profits. The analysis shows that owners of large firms who have managed to stay informal have higher entrepreneurial ability than formal firm owners, in contrast to the standard view (correct among smaller firms) that informal firm owners have low ability.

Of 518, 212 patients, 4182 were referred to C-L services (referral rate 5 0. 72 %). Typical con-sultations were for female patients (60. 1 %), admitted to med-ical wards (71. 5 %), aged 55 – 75 years. Most interventions were carried out within 2 days; a minority (22 %) were urgent requests. Gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders, and unexplained medical symptoms were the most frequent ICD- 9 somatic diagnoses at admission. One-third of the patients were not informed of having been referred to C-L and half of them had a lifetime history of psychiatric disturbances.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{consists}} of eight middle-size compositions and a written commentary. Each {{of the pieces}} explores a different pitch system. In Chapter 1, the aesthetic behind these pieces is discussed. This {{is based on the}} transformation of a single unifying sonority; every note has a function both in the moment and on a large scale. This implies a hierarchy that is established through techniques derived from Schenker and Lerdahl’s analytical methods, which are also explained. The following chapters apply these methodologies in the analysis of the eight pieces, unveiling a good deal of techniques and compositional issues derived from those presumptions. Momentum for 4 percussionists deploys rhythmic gestures, patterns, and regular pulsations. The piece has a ‘moment form’, where the materials are in constant transformation and the concept of balance emerges as a compositional issue. Knots in Time for ensemble makes use of a functional harmony constructed by analogy with the tonal system. In Looking forward/backward for ensemble modal and serial techniques merge with harmonic fields and pitch-class set techniques. The ‘solution’ to this puzzle is found through an extension of Schenker’s reduction techniques so that each of these conflicting systems belongs to a deeper or a more superficial level of the music. Across 1000 Oceans for String Trio is an instance of geometry applied to music since it uses quasi-symmetric and symmetric chords as a means to create tension and relaxation in the phrasing. Hasta dentro de un solo, Nunca más solos for scordatura violin is a synthesis of the previous compositional techniques. Fractal for 2 pianos is based on the fractal geometry. Interlude for piano and <b>instrument</b> uses <b>registration</b> as a structural element. In both cases, the geometric organization is enhanced to create an ‘organic’ form. ‘Organicism’ and ‘fractality’ are also compared, hypothesizing that Romantic writers had in mind a fractal model when discussing their ideas. Finally, Genesis Songs represents a hypertext in which several musical traditions coexist in a collage typical of the postmodern aesthetic, which is also discussed.

40|$|High speed Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{has made}} it {{possible}} to rapidly capture densely sampled 3 D volume data. One key application is the acquisition of high quality in vivo volumetric data sets of the human retina. Since the volume is acquired in a few seconds, eye movement during the scan process leads to distortion, which limits the accuracy of quantitative measurements using 3 D OCT data. In this paper, we present a novel software based method to correct motion artifacts in OCT raster scans. Motion compensation is performed retrospectively using image registration algorithms on the OCT data sets themselves. Multiple, successively acquired volume scans with orthogonal fast scan directions are registered retrospectively in order to estimate and correct eye motion. Registration is performed by optimizing a large scale numerical problem as given by a global objective function using one dense displacement field for each input volume and special regularization based on the time structure of the acquisition process. After optimization, each volume is undistorted and a single merged volume is constructed that has superior signal quality compared to the input volumes. Experiments were performed using 3 D OCT data from the macula and optic nerve head acquired with a high-speed ultra-high resolution 850 nm spectral OCT as well as wide field data acquired with a 1050 nm swept source OCT <b>instrument.</b> Evaluation of <b>registration</b> performance and result stability as well as visual inspection shows that the algorithm can correct for motion in all three dimensions and on a per A-scan basis. Corrected volumes do not show visible motion artifacts. In addition, merging multiple motion corrected and registered volumes leads to improved signal quality. These results demonstrate that motion correction and merging improves image quality and should also improve morphometric measurement accuracy from volumetric OCT data...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{information}} and communication technology have significantly increased the possibilities for firms to connect interdependent but widely distributed user groups. In recent years, the management literature has devoted considerable attention to organisations, called two-sided platforms, which bring together groups of agents between whom there is some form of externality in their interactions. Examples of two-sided platforms mentioned in the literature abound and range from credit cards and social networking websites, to newspapers and video games. Despite good progress made in the literature, current understanding of two-sided platforms is incomplete. From a conceptual point of view, it is remarkably unclear as to what defines a two-sided platform. From an empirical point of view, relatively {{little is known about}} how these platforms evolve and how they are managed. This thesis seeks to contribute to the management literature by shedding more light on these gaps. Drawing on intermediation theory, this thesis approaches two-sided platforms as firms creating decentralised markets in which firms have no direct control over transactions between buyers and sellers. It provides exploratory empirical evidence on the evolution of six platforms in two innovative industries, namely ride-sharing and custom apparel. The formation management of these platforms is studied over several years and particular attention is paid to how firms have managed access to, interaction in, and affiliations with their centralised markets. The main conclusion of this research is that firms use an array of instruments to actively manage decentralised markets. In contrast to the literature, this research finds that price instruments play a comparatively limited role. Among other <b>instruments,</b> firms use <b>registration</b> procedures and submission rules to manage access to their markets. Interactions between users are managed with search and ranking instruments, among others. This research also highlights the multi-faceted nature of affiliations between firms and users of decentralised markets, which often range from informal to formal classes of affiliation.

40|$|Thesis (M. Env. Dev.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. Various {{literature}} {{suggest that}} securing access {{to land and}} guaranteeing land tenure security is essential for diverse land-based livelihoods and remains a prerequisite for sustainable agriculture, economic growth and poverty reduction. Secure land tenure is recognized as a key element to meeting the MDG target 11 to achieve significant improvement {{in the lives of}} 100 million slums dwellers by 2020. In the case of Rwanda, land tenure reform involves changes in land tenure systems from traditional and customary arrangements to more simple, modern and streamlined land tenure mechanisms guided by a core land registration system which is affordable, efficient and participatory. This development towards change in land registration patterns requires strong instruments for monitoring and evaluation and impact assessment of land registration implementation. The main purpose of this research is to develop key indicators to be used as baseline monitoring and evaluation <b>instruments</b> for land <b>registration</b> implementation in Rwanda, the shortage of time having limited the case study to one, but important District of Rwanda: Gasabo. The conceptual argument follows the logic of thinking that, when land tenure, symbolized by different values is supported by formal or legal land registration procedures, it gives it a dimension of power, insurance, guarantee and security that can be symbolized by different indicators measurable as variables. Seven key indicators were identified. To test the defined baseline indicators for validity, data was obtained from a sample of 150 respondents using a cluster sampling technique and structured interviews. The findings demonstrate the defined indicators could be measured and the quality of measurement (validity) established from statistical behavior of the variables. The results have shown that none of sampled households has a land title, this effect being recognized as a major hindrance to tenure security and to fruitful investment in land. Only those few who had other kinds of documents confirming rights to land, although of lesser weight, were eligible to a loan from a bank. The results have shown that the beneficiaries of bank loans have improved their income by being involved in land transactions and by acquiring a new land as well as buying domestic animals. The results also show that these interactions have brought a significant improvement in land productivity and consequently, raised income. Although household date showed low rate of land disputes, secondary data at district level showed significantly higher rates of occurrence and very low rates of dispute resolution. It is generally observed that land disputes could be avoided or solved if sufficient operational, legal and institutional instruments for disputes resolution and land registration are in place...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{prevalence}} {{and nature of}} violence towards health care personnel {{and its implications for}} quality of care. The research presented here is based on a comprehensive perspective of violence as an occupational issue that may have negative consequences for health care personnel, health care organizations, and for the quality of care that they provide. Data from a total of eleven different studies were used in the analyses. The first study was based on a representative national sample of registered nurses, the largest group of health care personnel in Sweden. The Örebro Regional Hospital (RSÖ) was the site of four surveys of the work environment of hospital staff, and three surveys of patients' views of the quality of care. A controlled, longitudinal intervention study concerning workplace violence was carried out at 47 health care work sites in the greater Stockholm area and was the source of three data sets. Two instruments have been developed within the framework of this thesis. The first is the Violent Incident Form (VIF), a practical <b>instrument</b> for the <b>registration</b> of violent incidents in health care environments. The second instrument is the Quality of Care Patient Questionnaire, which measures quality of care from the patient perspective, including patient's views of the staff s work environment. This thesis uses a broad definition of violence that includes verbal threats and aggression in addition to physical violence. Standard epidemiological methods of measurement were used to identify risk factors and risk groups for violence. Approximately 30 % of nurses in the representative national sample had been victims of violence at some time in their nursing career. Those nurses working with psychiatric or geriatric patients were at increased risks for violence at work. Compared to this national sample, standardized prevalence ratios for violence were significantly higher for general hospital nursing personnel and physicians. Standardized incidence rates were highest for practical nurses. Experience with violence at work was significantly associated with lower staff ratings for mental energy, work efficiency, participation in work processes and decisions, and with higher work load/stress ratings. Staff experience with violence was also an important (inverse) predictor of a positive overall quality grade from patients. Results from the longitudinal, structured intervention project for dealing with violence indicate that regular registration and review of violent events may be an effective method for increasing understanding of violence in health care settings. Violence towards health care personnel may have significant implications for the quality of care that health care organizations provide. Improving the work environment of health care personnel and their influence over work processes may have an attenuating effect on violence, and a favorable impact on patient ratings of the quality of care...|$|R
40|$|Bronchoscopy is {{the most}} {{important}} and safest examination method for suspected lung cancer. It is used for visual inspection of the airways as well as for extracting tissue at suspicious lesions. Solely based on a sample acquired in this way, the decision, whether the lesion is malignant or not, can be made. For executing the biopsy at the correct location, it is especially important to precisely guide the bronchoscopic instruments inside the bronchial tree. Therefore, the physician uses the camera {{at the tip of the}} bronchoscope and intraoperative C-arm fluoroscopy. Unfortunately, none of these visualizations provide 3 D views of the bronchial tree or the current 3 D location of the instrument. Bronchoscopic navigation systems provide this support, thereby contributing considerably to the accuracy of instrument guidance and to the acceleration of the intervention. Bronchoscopic navigation systems mostly use EM sensors to track the current position of the instrument inside the bronchial tree. These systems not only need to be installed expensively and elaborately, but also the respective instruments need to be replaced costly after each use. To avoid this problem, some systems use only the bronchoscopic camera images for 2 D/ 3 D registration. Consequently, navigation support can only be provided as far as the bronchoscope can be pushed forward. However, especially these poorly reachable peripheral ramifications need navigation support. Therefore, this work presents a navigation method, which is independant of the bronchoscopic reach and uses only the already existing facilities on the operation room. Thus, a higher clinical applicability and acceptance is expected. The innovative principal idea is that, if the C-arm pose during image acquisition is known, a virtual ray starting at the C-arm's X-ray source through the patient's CT towards the instrument's tip on the fluoroscopic image can be generated. This 3 D ray intersects the bronchial tree exactly at the position where the instrument's tip currently resides. The biggest challenge is to determine the C-arm pose during image acquisition. For this, I designed an innovative marker board to be placed on the patient's table. On each fluoroscopic image, a section of the radio-opaque markers is pictured. For C-arm pose estimation, the imaged 2 D markers need to be mapped unambiguously to their corresponding 3 D source markers on the board. Therefore, I, for the first time, use the projective invariant cross-ratio for the arrangement of the markers on the board. This enables reliable identification and mapping of the markers even after projection. The marker board I developed was subject to numerous experiments, among them also phantom and animal cadaver experiments. In the process, very good quantitative results were measured for C-arm pose estimation regarding success rate and accuracy. Furthermore, this work presents other important components of a bronchoscopy navigation system: bronchial tree segmentation, bronchial tree skeletonization, tumor segmentation, 2 D <b>instrument</b> tracking, patient-to-table <b>registration,</b> path calculation, and 3 D visualization. For this, partly existing methods were selected and extended and partly new methods were developed. All of these components were evaluated individually and also their interaction with each other was tested. Experiments on a bronchial tree model led to very promising qualitative results...|$|R
40|$|VII 121 p. ill. The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide knowledge to assess to what extent an alternative or adapted financing scheme for home nursing in Belgium is needed and possible. An important question is whether the financing principles can be based on a patient case-mix. This study is limited to homecare nursing as currently reimbursed at the Belgian federal level through the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI). Home help services, social services, general practitioners, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, as well as community nursing activities such as preventive mother and child care, psychiatric care, midwifery, school health nursing and occupational nursing are beyond the scope of this study. Financing is studied from the provider perspective. Patients accessibility and equity are not addressed. This report describes the financing of home nursing in Belgium as in 4 selected European countries. It also discusses measures of patient dependency in Activities of Daily Living, currently used for case-mix financing. Finally, it reports Belgian stakeholder opinions on issues related to the future financing of home nursing in Belgium.

40|$|Consequent {{upon the}} {{institution}} of liberal policies by the Government of Pakistan in 1980 s, aimed at transferring the import and sale of chemical pesticides to the private sector, numerous companies entered the country’s pesticide market. Easy imports, low prices and availability {{of a variety of}} pesticides were distinct advantages of these liberal policies. On the other hand, Agriculture Extension lacked the capacity and necessary expertise to monitor such a long range of pesticide products available in the market, reflecting imperfect competition and a high level of windfall profits. As a result, the sale of substandard pesticides is a common problem of farming community. Besides, overuse and misuse of pesticide by untrained farmers increased the health and environmental risks especially in the prime cotton growing districts. The status of pesticide industry in Sindh province was critically reviewed in the study, in the light of international experiences. Using survey method, 263 stakeholders (19 key respondents and 244 sample respondents) were interviewed during 2003 - 04. Knowledge of farmers and extension agents about proper selection, usage and safe handling of pesticides was assessed. Recommendations were developed regarding registration, monitoring and evaluation of pesticides and extension education programs for capacity building of farmers and extension agents. The status review revealed that the public sector has been able to train critical manpower (18 % PhDs) in plant protection. Research on new active pesticide ingredients could not, however, be undertaken due mainly to non-availability of operational funds, advanced training, and appropriate equipment. The on-going public sector research program dealt with IPM related-technology and testing of efficacy of pesticides. Use of IPM techniques was found limited to research stations due mainly to poor extension services. Therefore, pesticide was the sole source of cotton pest control by majority of farmers. Three legal <b>instruments</b> for pesticide <b>registration</b> were in vogue; namely Form 1, Form 16, and Form 17. Prerequisite for Form 1 is to test efficacy of pesticides for two consecutive years at two research stations while Form 16 and Form 17 are liberal schemes; and do not need any research trials. Due to easy registration, 47 and 36 percent of the pesticides are registered in Form 16 and 17 respectively. Only 17 percent pesticides are registered in Form 1. Square root regression model was developed on the import of pesticides in the country. Estimates of the proposed model revealed steeper growth trend than that of ordinary regression model; and it was much higher than agricultural productivity growth trend. Directorate General, Agriculture Extension, is responsible for monitoring and evaluation of pesticides. According to information provided by District Officers (Agriculture), the accused Dealers of adulteration and supply of substandard pesticides were penalized with minor fines due to specific legal and administrative shortcomings; while according to section 21 / 2 b of Agricultural Pesticide Ordinance, provided for imprisonment of not less than six months and not more than two years, with fine which may extend to five hundred thousand rupees. Majority of the stakeholders including District Officers (Agriculture), Sales Executives, and Pesticide Dealers were dissatisfied with the present monitoring and evaluation system for pesticides. District Officers did not get due cooperation from police in lodging FIR and protocol in courts during hearing of pesticide cases. Sales Executives stated that the process of drawing samples was targeted and marred with corruption of the highest order. All Pesticide Dealers were of the opinion that pesticide companies be named in FIR when samples are declared unfit by the laboratories; because the companies supplied sealed pesticides and should be held responsible for any adulteration at their end. Local companies offered high profit margins (up to 30 %) and incentive schemes including lotteries and foreign tours to the Dealers who, in addition, charged exorbitant interest rate of 30 to 40 percent per annum from the farmers while giving pesticides on loan. Unlike local companies, multinationals offered normal profit margins (up to 15 %) to Dealers, supplied quality pesticides and imparted effective training programs for the capacity building of Contact Farmers and Pesticide Dealers. Total sale amount of insecticides in Sanghar, Nawabshah, and Naushahro Feroze districts was estimated to be Rs. 471. 73 million in 2003 - 04. Top five insecticides in terms of weight were methamidophos (29 %), endosulfan (12 %), cypermetherin (9 %), imidacloprid, (8 %), and fenpropthrin (7 %). The above ranking reflected the persistence of old groups of pesticides i. e. organophosphate, organochlorine and synthetic parathyroid in the market; while the recent literature revealed that cotton insect pests had developed resistance to these groups. Non-Contact Farmers’ knowledge was recorded to be significantly low (41 %) regarding proper selection, usage and handling of pesticides; while corresponding averages scores for Contact Farmers, Field Assistants, and Pesticide Agents were 75, 57, and 97 percent respectively. Low level of knowledge of Non-Contact Farmers established the need for their training to mitigate health and environmental risks associated with the misuse of pesticides. Non-Contact Farmers’ channels of knowledge were landlords and Pesticide Dealers while Contact Farmers directly received information from representatives of pesticide companies. Role of public sector extension in disseminating proper information about pesticide was limited owing to institutional problems such as poorly motivated staff, inadequate operational funds, and lack of relevant technology. Private sector extension targeted large and progressive farmers to minimize the per unit costs. Non-Contact Farmers had to rely on Pesticide Dealers who had limited knowledge and profit maximization motives. Based upon the research findings, it was recommended that APO- 71 may be reviewed and liberal pesticide registration schemes be rationalized. Monitoring and evaluation system of pesticides may be redesigned by appointing attorneys and introducing training programs and incentives for Chemists and Inspectors. Well designed extension education programs may be made mandatory for registration of companies. Alternate methods of pest control may be encouraged in the process. Agricultural extension activities such as the farmers’ field schools on IPM may be fully supported so as to optimize pesticide import bills, curtail health and environmental risks associated with the over/misuse of pesticides, and manage quality cotton production in the wake of trade globalization...|$|R
