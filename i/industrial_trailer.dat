It {{is based on the}} product behavioral modeling approach and uses an evaluation method that determines performance indicators for different domains of the product lifecycle. We are mainly focused on semantic and fuzzy domains that are complex to formalize. We show how the product design solutions represented in a CAD system can be analyzed to evaluate the product performances at some specific domains. After a short state of art on product modeling methods we define a FBS product behavioral modeling approach based on the object-oriented modeling formalism. Here the product is described as a conceptual object with properties and formal criteria evaluation methods for different domains. Then a behavioral performance evaluation procedure is detailed and we outline software architecture for implementation in a CAD system. An application for product maintainability assessment of an <b>industrial</b> <b>trailer</b> illustrates the approac...|$|E

5000|$|These are {{available}} for loads between 10000 and 30000 lb. They are used for larger trailers and provide considerably more stability than does a traditional hitch. Both styles have trailers attach to a coupler mounted above the axle within {{the bed of the}} tow vehicle such as a flat deck or pickup truck. A fifth-wheel coupling is also referred to as a kingpin hitch and is a smaller version of the semi-trailer [...] "fifth wheel". Though a fifth wheel and a gooseneck trailer look much the same, their method for coupling is different. A fifth wheel uses a large horseshoe-shaped coupling device mounted a foot or more above the bed of the tow vehicle. A gooseneck couples to a standard 2+5/16 in ball mounted on the bed of the tow vehicle. The operational difference between the two is the range of movement in the hitch. The gooseneck is very maneuverable and can tilt in all directions, while the fifth wheel is intended for level roads and limited tilt side to side. Gooseneck mounts are often used for agricultural and <b>industrial</b> <b>trailers.</b> Fifth-wheel mounts are often used for recreational trailers. Standard bumper-hitch trailers typically allow a 10% or 15% hitch load while a fifth wheel and gooseneck can handle 20% or 25% weight transfer.|$|R

As {{the company}} grew and extended its reach beyond Asia, it expanded into new market segments, producing full lines of tires for passenger car, bus, truck, light truck, bicycle, motorcycle, ATV, race kart, <b>trailer,</b> <b>industrial</b> and lawn & garden. Examples are Luxgen and BYD.|$|R
50|$|The {{fusion of}} both tradesmen's {{businesses}} in 1956 in Donautal made KÃ¶gel {{one of the}} first businesses to settle in the new industrial area. The transition from a tradesmen's business to an industrial concern was completed when production started in the new generously dimensioned manufacturing workshops in the Donautal industrial area. <b>Industrial</b> production of <b>trailers</b> and bodies had begun and continuous growth was achieved. However, special projects were also handled in addition to this manufacture, e.g. a 9-seater cab for the 70 kW Kaelbletractor.|$|R
50|$|It was {{considered}} to be an authentic extant example of American roadside architecture from the mid-century. The ranch-style office, motel and restaurant were originally built on the side of Highway 101 and Highway 101A (Alternate) in 1947. The office/restaurant complex incorporates a variety of roof lines, primarily low to medium pitched gables covered with wood shingles and punctuated by several decorative cupolas with weather vanes, and neon lighting. A free-standing 12-unit, two-story motel addition was completed in 1953. One of the most recognizable features of the motel was the giant neon sign that included an animated stagecoach driver and galloping horses. Today millions of motorists drive by the Wagon Wheel each year on the Ventura Freeway. The Wagon Wheel sits alongside the 101 freeway at the northern edge of a 64 acre site between the Santa Clara River and the Home Depot shopping center (formerly the Esplanade Shopping Center). The site is also home to <b>industrial</b> buildings, a <b>trailer</b> park an ice skating rink, a former roller skating rink, a bowling alley and empty shopping center, all of which are scheduled for demolition and redevelopment as a European Village themed development with retail, for sale residential, condos and two high-rise towers totaling 1500 residential units.|$|R
