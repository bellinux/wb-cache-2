40|$|Summary: Although the second-generation or {{atypical}} antipsychotic {{drugs have}} been breakthrough medicines {{for the treatment}} of schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions, cognitive dysfunction and to some extent negative symptoms of the disease continue to be the main cause of poor vocational status of the patients. Thus, the majority of investigational drug development efforts today target these unmet medical needs. This review postulates that the field of schizophrenia research has advanced sufficiently to develop biochemical hypotheses of the <b>etiopathology</b> of the disease and target the same for revolutionary disease modifying therapy. This postulate is based on recent studies that have begun to provide a testable <b>etiopathology</b> model that integrates interactions between genetic vulnerability factors, neurodevelopmental anomalies, and neurotransmitter systems. This review begins with a brief overview of the nosology and <b>etiopathology</b> of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders to establish a context for subsequent detailed discussions on drug discovery and development for psychotic disorders. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in genetic association studies of schizophrenia and how this can be integrated with evidence supporting neurodevelopmental abnormalities associated with the disease to generate a testable model of the disease <b>etiopathology.</b> An in-depth review of the plethora of new targets and approaches targeting the unmet medical need in the treatment of schizophrenia exemplify the challenges and opportunities in this area. We end the review by offering an approach based on emerging genetic, clinical, and neurobiological studies to discover and validate novel drug targets that could be classified as disease modifying approaches...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPsychiatric {{disorders}} like mood disorders, schizophrenia, or {{drug addiction}} affect a sizeable {{proportion of the}} human population and severely compromise quality of life. Therefore, measures to prevent the manifestation, and treatments to ameliorate the symptoms, of these disorders are in high demand. Brain lipids determine the localization and function of proteins in the cell membrane of neurons. Lipids may also act as neurotransmitters or other signalling molecules. The lipid composition of the brain can be influenced by nutrition, environmental factors, and by behavioural activity. Thus, lipids represent a target for preventive medicine of psychiatric disorders. Here we review how brain lipids contribute to normal behaviour and to major psychiatric disorders with the focus on phospholipids/fatty acids, sphingolipids, and endocannabinoids. Accumulating evidence suggests a crucial role for membrane forming and signalling lipids in the brain in the <b>etiopathologies</b> of depression, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Lipids also represent potential preventive interventions for these psychiatric disorders by either targeted dietary supplementation or pharmacological manipulation of lipid regulating enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Evidences {{indicate}} that many physiological and pathological {{conditions such as}} ageing, inflammation, viral infections, and neurodegenerative diseases may develop through the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS). During the last 10 years, increasing evidence has been provided {{that a large number}} of intracellular signaling pathways are regulated by intracellular ROS. Several growth factors and cytokines binding to different types of cell membrane receptors can elicit a rise in intracellular ROS. These include cytokine receptors, receptor tyrosine and G proteincoupled receptors. In addition to the activation of different members of signaling cascades involved in cell growth and differentiation, ROS may also directly regulate the activity of transcription factors through oxidative modifications of conserved cysteines for example. Several transcription factors have been shown to be redox-sensitive, including p 53. At present, the <b>etiopathologies</b> of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease and Huntington's chorea are unknown. However, the most accepted hypothesis is selective oxidative stress in the central nervous system. It has been also proposed that enzymes such as xanthine oxidase are the major source of reactive oxygen species generated during the re-oxygenation of ischemic tissues. The function of most antioxidant systems is to modify the highly reactive oxygen species to form less reactive intermediate which no longer pose a threat to the cell. Superoxide dismutase convert superoxide to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, the later is the converted to water and molecular oxygen by catalase, or to water only by glutathione peroxidase. In conclusion, control of reactive oxygen species by antioxidant defense systems appears to maintain low concentrations rather than complete elimination of reactive oxygen species. The aim of this manuscript is to shed light on the role of ROS both at physiological and pathological level...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} human {{microdeletion}} occurs at chromosome 22 q 11. 2. The associated syndrome (22 q 11. 2 DS) has {{a complex and}} variable phenotype with {{a high risk of}} schizophrenia. While the role of stress in the <b>etiopathology</b> of schizophrenia has been under investigation for over 30  years (Walker et al. 2008), the stress–diathesis model has yet to be investigated in children with 22 q 11. 2 DS. Children with 22 q 11. 2 DS face serious medical, behavioral, and socioemotional challenges from infancy into adulthood. Chronic stress elevates glucocorticoids, decreases immunocompetence, negatively impacts brain development and function, and is associated with psychiatric illness in adulthood. Drawing knowledge from the extant and well-developed anxiety and stress literature will provide invaluable insight into the complex <b>etiopathology</b> of schizophrenia in people with 22 q 11. 2 DS while suggesting possible early interventions. Childhood anxiety is treatable and stress coping skills can be developed thereby improving quality of life in the short-term and potentially mitigating the risk of developing psychosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the virulence of 3 CSFV field isolates obtained from wild boar in the 1990 s using in vivo and in vitro methods. The isolates belong to genotypes 2. 3 Rostock (2 isolates from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) and 2. 3 Guestrow (1 isolate from Brandenburg). A special focus of this work was to validate in vitro methods for their suitability to characterize the virulence of different CSFV strains. Infection experiments with each CSFV isolate were carried out using both, domestic pigs and wild boars, to elucidate the influence of host factors and species on clinical outcome and <b>etiopathology.</b> A virulence score for the respective CSFV isolate was calculated for every single animal as well as for the particular species of swine due to clinical course and severity of the virus infection. Independently of the applied CSFV isolate all infected domestic pigs showed a subacute <b>etiopathology</b> and a lethal outcome of the disease. All 3 tested CSFV field isolates proved to be highly virulent for the infected domestic pigs. In contrast wild boars partially showed a less homogenous clinical outcome. Especially in one of the wild boars the disease took a chronic course with viraemia and virus shedding during the entire experiment. Due to the more variable <b>etiopathology</b> the examined CSFV isolates were classified as moderately virulent for wild boars. Potential reasons for the differences in virulence scores of the tested virus isolates observed between individual wild boars and in comparison with domestic pigs are elucidated. Furthermore, the relevance of chronic CSFV infections in wild boars for the epidemiology of CSF is discussed. Taken together the results emphasize the impact of host factors for the outcome of a CSFV infection. Experiments for the in vitro characterization of CSFV additionally included several older isolates of genotype 1. 1 representing different virulence scores as well as another field isolate from wild boar belonging to genotype 2. 3. The latter proved to be low virulent in experimentally infected wild boars. One-step growth curves revealed a distinct correlation between in vitro multiplication and genotype of the tested CSFV isolates. On the other hand the analysed parameters showed no association to virulence of the respective viruses. Furthermore, glycoprotein E 2 expression also appeared to depend on the genotype of the respective CSFV, but not on its virulence...|$|E
