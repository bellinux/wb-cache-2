5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, 2.9% of the Jews in {{the city}} were Haredi, {{compared}} to 7.5% on a national scale. However, the Haredi community in Haifa is growing fast due to a high fertility rate. 66.6% were secular, compared to a national average of 43.7%. A {{significant portion of the}} immigrants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union either lack official religious-ethnic classification or are Non-Jews as they are from mixed-marriage families of some Jewish origin.|$|E
5|$|Until 1964 Arad {{had about}} 160 families, {{most of whom}} were natives. After 1971 Arad began {{absorbing}} olim (Jewish immigrants), mostly from the Soviet Union, but also from English speaking countries and Latin America, and its population increased from 4,000 in 1969 to 10,500 in 1974. During {{the first half of the}} 1990s, Arad absorbed 6,000 immigrants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared Arad a city on 29 June 1995.|$|E

5|$|Tel Aviv {{gained in}} status, while Haifa {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} the role as regional capital. The opening of Ashdod as a port exacerbated this. Tourism shrank when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing Tiberias as a tourist centre. Nevertheless, Haifa's population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union boosted the population by a further 35,000. Many of Wadi Salib's historic Ottoman buildings have now been demolished, and in the 1990s a major section of the Old City was razed {{to make way for a}} new municipal center.|$|E
5|$|C. m. soemmerringii (Fischer, 1811) {{is found}} in {{north-eastern}} Europe and north and central Asia, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union to Lake Baikal and north-west Mongolia, and south to Turkey, Israel and the eastern Himalayas. Its south-western limits are Serbia and southern Romania. It winters in Iran and northern India (Kashmir). Johann Fischer von Waldheim described this taxon as Corvus soemmerringii in 1811, noting its differences from populations in western Europe. Its species name was given in honour of the German anatomist, Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring. It is distinguished by the nape and {{the sides of the}} neck being paler, creating a contrasting black crown and lighter grey part collar.|$|E
5|$|Pita {{bread is}} a {{double-layered}} flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E

5|$|Raoul Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy von Dardel, a {{well-known}} physicist, retired from CERN, {{was dedicated to}} finding out his half-brother's fate. He traveled to the Soviet Union about fifty times for discussions and research, including {{an examination of the}} Vladimir prison records. Over the years, Professor von Dardel compiled a 50,000-page archive of interviews, journal articles, letters, and other documents related to his quest. In 1991, Dardel initiated a Swedish-Russian working group to search eleven separate military and government archives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union for information about Wallenberg's fate, but the group was not able to find conclusive information. Many, including Professor von Dardel and his daughters Louise and Marie, do not accept the various versions of Wallenberg's death. They continue to request that the archives in Russia, Sweden, and Hungary be opened to impartial researchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the An-70 {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1970s, when Antonov Design Bureau began {{preliminary}} design work on a successor for the An-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. The Soviet Armed Forces, by the 1980s, were looking for a replacement for the An-12 and a complement to the Ilyushin Il-76 four-engine jet transporter; in 1987, the Ministry of Defence, with a new emphasis on air mobility, specified an aircraft with a quick loading time, the ability to operate from short unprepared airfields, could carry up to 300 troops, and have good operating economy. The initial contract for work on the An-70 was concluded in May 1989; Antonov began advanced design work on the new aircraft during the same year. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in June 1993, the Russian and Ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop the An-70, with 80percent of the funding expected to come from Russia. The following year, twenty companies and organisations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union agreed to jointly develop, market and support the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, massive {{immigration}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union boosted {{the student population}} from 9,000 to 10,500.

25|$|Significant {{migration}} {{took place}} {{in the first years of}} Ukrainian independence. More than onemillion people moved into Ukraine in 1991–92, mostly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> republics. In total, between 1991 and 2004, 2.2million immigrated to Ukraine (among them, 2million came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union states), and 2.5million emigrated from Ukraine (among them, 1.9million moved to other <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union republics). Currently, immigrants constitute an estimated 14.7% of the total population, or 6.9million people; this is the fourth largest figure in the world. In 2006, there were an estimated 1.2 million Canadians of Ukrainian ancestry, giving Canada the world's third-largest Ukrainian population behind Ukraine itself and Russia. There are also large Ukrainian immigrant communities in the United States, Poland, Australia, Brazil and Argentina.|$|R
