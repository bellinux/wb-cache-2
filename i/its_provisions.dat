5|$|Federal Governments have twice {{proposed}} the amendment of Section116, principally to apply <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> to laws {{made by the}} states. On each occasionin 1944 and 1988the proposal failed in a referendum.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the Norris bill in <b>its</b> <b>provisions,</b> {{this bill}} defined a civil union as {{providing}} all {{the rights and}} duties as defined for marriage, but specifically limited civil unions to same-sex couples. It also provided for adoption by couples in such unions.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Raja of Panagal {{introduced}} the Hindu Religious Endowments Bill. As per this bill, trusts were established to maintain temple funds and given complete {{power over the}} administration of temples. This act evoked severe protests from some sections of the assembly which {{felt that this was}} an intrusion in the religious affairs of the populace. However, the Shankaracharya of Kanchi gave his support to the bill even while expressing his concern over some of <b>its</b> <b>provisions.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Act {{includes}} {{a number of}} miscellaneous points, mainly in Sections 5 and 6. The Act and <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> are taken to extend to The Crown, which can be held tortiously liable to the extent {{laid out in the}} Crown Proceedings Act 1947. It repeals Section 4 of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, replacing it with Section 4 of this Act, and unlike the 1957 Act does not allow any provisions or duties to be excluded or restricted.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Rights was {{originally}} proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment {{applied only to}} laws enacted by the Congress, and many of <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding {{the free exercise of}} religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E

5|$|After {{just half}} a year as vice president, Arthur {{found himself in the}} {{executive}} mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor. To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced <b>its</b> <b>provisions.</b> He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
5|$|After the war, an Australian {{military}} historical {{mission was}} sent to Gallipoli, led by Charles Bean. On Bean's advice the Australian government sought permission from the newly formed Turkish Republic to establish an official war cemetery in the area. In 1923 the Treaty of Lausanne was ratified, and through <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> the Lone Pine cemetery {{was established in the}} area, dubbed the Daisy Patch by the Australians. There are a total of 1,167 graves in the cemetery and as of 2012, the identities of 471 bodies interred in the cemetery remain unknown. Also standing within the cemetery's grounds is the Lone Pine memorial. It is the main Australian and New Zealand memorial at Gallipoli and commemorates all the Australian and some of the New Zealanders who died during the campaign, including those who have no known grave and those buried at sea.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} assistance of the Czech Republic. The first part focuses on explanation {{of the definition of}} the development assistance, its historical development and incorporation into the international context. Through a historical excursus occurs to the individual motives for <b>its</b> <b>provision.</b> The second part is devoted to development assistance of the Czech Republic, its territorial and sector orientation and motives of the Czech Republic for <b>its</b> <b>provision.</b> The third part focuses on Mongolia as a partner in development assistance of the Czech Republic...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{significant}} portion of the act was <b>its</b> <b>provision</b> prohibiting a railroad company from demanding that a worker not join a union as a condition for employment (Section 10).|$|R
5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator. The remedy for the act complained of {{is provided by the}} statute, as well as the officers to carry it into execution. It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, {{and from time to time}} to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which {{included}} among <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> {{the creation of}} treaty ports in which Christian missionaries {{would be free to}} preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 998, Dalassenos {{learned that a}} catastrophic fire had broken out in Apamea and {{destroyed}} most of <b>its</b> <b>provisions,</b> so he marched towards the city. The Aleppines too endeavoured to seize Apamea and arrived there first, but withdrew at the approach of Dalassenos, who could not permit a vassal to grow too strong and intended to capture the town for the emperor. Although ostensibly allies with the Byzantines, the Aleppines left the provisions they had brought with them to be collected by the inhabitants of Apamea, aiding them in their resistance. Subsequent events are presented by several authors, including the brief narrative of John Skylitzes and the more extensive accounts of the Christian Arab Yahya of Antioch and the Armenian Stephen of Taron. Arab accounts also survive, all apparently drawing upon {{the work of the}} 11th-century historian Hilal al-Sabi; the most detailed version is preserved by Ibn al-Qalanisi.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 The Rainbow Project {{formally}} recognised {{a change}} in its service user demographic and changed its Articles of Association to include LGBT people and their families in <b>its</b> <b>provision</b> of service.|$|R

5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully passed by Congress. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states could choose {{not to participate in}} the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim plurality of Americans polled, although <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{concerned}} property bequeathed in {{the will}} of Alfred's father, Æthelwulf. This does not survive, but Alfred described some of <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> in a preamble to his own will. Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons, Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, stipulating that {{all of it was}} to be inherited by the brother who lived the longest. When Æthelred inherited the throne in 865, Alfred asked for the property to be divided between them. Æthelred refused, offering instead to leave it to Alfred on his death, together with any further property he acquired, and Alfred agreed. The Viking invasion of Wessex, and the need to provide for their children, led to a revision of the terms. Under an agreement in late 870 or early 871, the survivor was still to keep the property bequeathed jointly to the three brothers, but he would give his brother's children any lands which he had received separately from his father, and any he had acquired later.|$|E
5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E

50|$|Sullivan was a vocal {{opponent}} of abortion. He voted {{against his own}} government's omnibus bill to update the Canadian criminal code in 1969, because he disagreed with <b>its</b> <b>provision</b> to liberalize the country's abortion laws.|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} gained a number of {{national}} awards {{for the quality of}} <b>its</b> <b>provision,</b> including the Artsmark Gold award (2003), Sportsmark award (2002), Investors in People (1999) and Careers Education and Guidance award (1996).|$|R
5|$|Klein was {{appointed}} general of division in 1799 {{and crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl in Jean-Baptiste Jourdans Army of the Danube. He commanded the right flank of the Advance Guard, under command of François Joseph Lefebvre. His command included the 4th and 5th Hussar Regiments, the 17th Dragoons, the 1st Chasseurs à cheval, a light horse regiment, two companies of horse artillery, two of foot artillery, and a company of sappers. At the Battle of Ostrach, Klein's cavalry helped to secure the village of Hosskirch, a strategically important forward post, prior to the general engagement. After the French losses at Ostrach and the subsequent Battle of Stockach, Jourdan ordered a general withdrawal to the Black Forest. The reserve cavalry and most of Klein's division crossed the mountains and quartered near Offenburg, where their horses could find better forage. Despite the organized withdrawal and the relatively secure positions {{on the western side}} of the Black Forest, the army was in shambles. Jourdan placed his chief of staff Jean Augustin Ernouf in provisional command and went to Paris to complain about the state of his army, its equipment and <b>its</b> <b>provisions.</b> Discipline in the ranks disintegrated. Most of the divisional generals left their posts, except for Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino, Joseph Souham, Dominique Vandamme and Klein. In May, Andre Massena received overall command of both the Army of the Danube and the Army of Helvetia; Klein's column joined Massena near Zurich.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{with the}} Buyids were {{initially}} good, as Abu Taghlib, unlike his father, had no direct claim on Baghdad, and Bakhtiyar himself was too preoccupied with affairs in Iraq and elsewhere to focus {{his attention on}} the Jazira. However, the Buyid prince offered refuge to Hamdan and other disgruntled members of the Hamdanid clan (including another of Abu Taghlib's brothers, Abu Tahir Ibrahim) and intervened in the Hamdanid family quarrels. Thus in 970 Hamdan was restored in Rahba thanks to Buyid pressure, only to be chased away again in 971. The exiled prince now urged Bakhtiyar to make war on Abu Taghlib: in 973 the Buyids once again occupied Mosul, while Abu Taghlib with his army outflanked them and threatened Baghdad. The conflict ended in a negotiated settlement in 974 that included in <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> the award of the laqab of ʿUddat al-Dawla ("Instrument of the Dynasty") to Abu Taghlib by the caliph and the restoration of Hamdan to his domains. During the same period, Abu Taghlib also faced the attacks of the Byzantines, who under Emperor John I Tzimiskes penetrated deep into the Jazira, forcing the Hamdanids to pay tribute. The devastating raids of 972 were partly avenged through the defeat and capture of the Domestic of the Schools Melias at Amid in 973, but in 974 Tzimiskes himself raided the Jazira in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|The Corpus Juris Civilis {{remained}} {{the basis of}} Byzantine law until {{the publication of the}} Ecloga legum in 741 by Emperor Leo III and his son and co-regent Constantine V. The Ecloga was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with Christian values. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and <b>its</b> <b>provisions</b> continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in Slavic, Armenian and Arabic. Emperor Basil I, who ruled in the 9th century, issued the Prochiron and the Epanagoge, which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the Ecloga and restoring the Justinian laws. The Prochiron served {{as the basis for the}} legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, Saint Sava. His legal compilation was intended for the Serbian church but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches. Around 900, Emperor Leo VI commissioned the Basilica, a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.|$|E
