5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{no changes}} {{were made to the}} text, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> a remake of the 5th with very minor updates. All in all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions are {{virtually}} the same as each other. Rather than revising the main text of the encyclopedia with each edition, Constable chose to add all updates to the supplement. It's probable that the 6th edition only exists because of the need to remove the long s, which had gone out of style, from the font, which required the whole encyclopedia to be re-typeset.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} modules to Jet. One was the Native Jet ISAM Driver, a Jet {{dynamic link library}} (DLL) that could {{directly}} manipulate Microsoft Access database files (MDB), which was a modified form of an Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) database. Another one of the modules were the ISAM Drivers, DLLs that allowed access to ISAM databases, among them being Xbase, Paradox, Btrieve and FoxPro files. The final module was the Data Access Objects (DAO) DLL, DAO allowed programmers access to the Jet engine. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> an object-oriented data language used by Access Basic and Visual Basic application developers to access Jet.|$|E

25|$|His last commercially {{available}} project, Papa Woody, {{was released in}} 1996 under the name Ether Bunny, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> a solo effort. Serving as his personal tribute to the cartoon and jazz music, Vahnke claims to have been more satisfied with his work on Papa Woody than on any Vampire Rodents album. A collaboration with Athan Maroulis called Alchemia, later renamed Obsidian, was planned for release in 1997 but never came into fruition. The overall project {{was described as a}} SBC and LTG approach to The Blue Nile with string orchestra. Also, a completely instrumental Vampire Rodent album was completed the same year, but like the Alcemia/Obsidian project was shelved indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|UFOIC's start was {{overshadowed by}} a large, more active Sydney group, the Northern Suburbs Flying Saucer Research Association. The two Sydney groups competed for members {{and soon the}} {{relationship}} between the two broke down. NSFSRA became the central NSW group, primarily due to their public support and hosting of George Adamski on his 1959 Australian visit, organised by Victorian and Queensland Groups. Adamski held his Sydney lecture at Adyar Hall on 27 February 1959. Adamski's visit resulted in UFOIC membership falling away dramatically until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> a small, close-knit group of enthusiasts. So bitter was the dispute, UFOIC President Dr. Greenwell resigned in disgust; this opened the position to Dr Miran Lindtner who became president in March 1959. The damage had been done and the Sydney experience scared the NSW UFO community.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} began with RYM I and II meeting in an {{opposite}} wing than PL, on different {{sides of the}} Coliseum. As discussion eventually resumed between the two groups, “it {{became clear that the}} expulsion of PL was inevitable”. Dohrn spoke again about Third World Struggles and anti-imperialism, things of which PL had no concern. She ended her speech with the proclamation that SDS “was becoming a revolutionary movement; and as such, it could not allow a group such as PL in its ranks”. Chanting began again, with PL fighting for their beliefs; however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> over. “Although they controlled a third of the delegates at the final SDS convention,” the reality was that PL “had a presence in only a handful of the locations where SDS was active, and everyone knew it. It was over.”.|$|E

25|$|David II's {{liberation from}} hostage in 1357 {{did not come}} without conditions, {{one of which was}} that Edward would hold on to the lands in the {{southeast}} of the country; this ensured that Dryburgh and the other border abbeys stayed in English held territory. David allowed the abbeys to keep their Scottish possessions and did not interfere with the canons and monks from receiving the income from those. Dryburgh's records had all been lost at this time and it is only from what is known at Melrose that Dryburgh's position can be traced. The wool export trade and the resultant customs duty was important to David and so the Border abbeys who produced large amounts of wool were encouraged to use the Scottish ports and at the expense of Edward's Berwick. The 1360s and 1370s saw the English hold over the Border areas diminish until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> the castles at Berwick, Jedburgh and Roxburgh with the county of Berwick and {{the eastern part of the}} county of Roxburgh still in their grip. Pressure on these bastions intensified during 1384 and 1385 and Scottish raiding parties moved deep into England forcing Richard II to launch his army on a hugely damaging incursion through the Borders to Edinburgh which he burned. On the way he ordered the sacking of Dryburgh, Melrose and Newbattle. It was while Richard was in Newbattle Wood in August 1385 that he took reprisals against all those in Teviotdale who had returned to the Scottish cause.|$|E
500|$|After {{considerable}} confusion, {{the program}} was reinstated on 11April1957 with North American awarded a contract for two prototypes.

500|$|Burger King and Blitz Studios {{split the}} {{creative}} process up for the three games. Sneak King is the game that Burger King had creative control over, and which was envisioned based on the King commercials. Oliver stated, [...] "Sneak King is derived by them, purely from their commercials. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> 'here's our commercials, {{we have to have}} a video game around them.' They threw in all their ideas, and we made it work." [...] Originally, Sneak King was designed as a tile-based puzzle game, but it soon evolved into a Spy vs Spy caper with multiple Kings who are [...] "trying to out-deliver one another while laying traps for their enemies".|$|E
500|$|Art {{designer}} Sylvain Despretz {{claimed the}} art department {{was assigned to}} create something that had {{little or nothing to}} do with the Superman comic book, and also explained that Peters [...] "would bring kids in, who would rate the drawings on the wall as if they were evaluating the toy possibilities. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> a toy show." [...] Peters saw a cover of National Geographic, containing a picture of a skull, going to art department workers, telling them he wanted the design for Brainiac's space ship to have the same image. Burton gave Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was [...] "a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside. Imagine you take Merlin's hat, and you stick a fish bowl on top, with a skull in it." [...] Concept artist Rolf Mohr said in an interview he designed a suit for the Eradicator for a planned scene in which it transforms into a flying vehicle.|$|E

There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E

500|$|Pearl Jam's {{contract}} with Epic Records had ended in 2003, but {{the band was}} not ready to release an album without label backing. Independent label Epitaph Records was considered, but the band wanted a company that would guarantee a wide release. Manager Kelly Curtis signed a one-record deal with J Records - which ironically during production became, like Epic, a subsidiary of Sony Music after said company merged with J's parent company BMG. J had approached Pearl Jam as early as 2001, and had its first experiments with the band issuing the live album Live at Benaroya Hall in 2004. Vedder said J was picked as they searched for [...] "somebody who'll allow us to be who we are and respects how we do things" [...] and contributed with the [...] "facilitation of getting the music out there". Gossard added the label did not input any time or creative constraints upon the band - [...] " [...] We didn't play them much music until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> done, and they were pleased. They weren't expecting us to do something that was unnatural for us." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{discovery}} of gold in 1851 (when the Port Phillip District became the new Colony of Victoria), and the resulting influx of population, law and order became more difficult to maintain. [...] Subsequently, a new wing, with its own perimeter wall, was constructed between 1852 and 1854; the building using bluestone instead of sandstone. The design was based on that of British prison engineer Joshua Jebb, and especially the designs for the Pentonville Model Prison in London (which suited the current prison reform theories at the time). [...] The new wing was extended in between 1857 and 1859, with the boundary wall also being extended during this time. [...] In 1860, a new north wing was built; which included entrance buildings, a central hall and chapel. Between 1862 and 1864, a cell block was built for female prisoners {{on the western side}} – <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> a replica of the present east block (until this time, female convicts were not kept apart from the male prisoners). [...] In 1864, the perimeter wall, and the gaol overall, was completed; making it a dominant feature of authority on the Melbourne skyline.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Ruffalo said he {{believed}} the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, [...] "I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did The Avengers <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>basically</b> 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version {{of what it would}} be." [...] In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU, by saying, [...] "After the first Avengers, Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in [...] So it was really about, frankly, saving somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie, so [...] could continue to play with that in [...] Where we go after that, we'll see." [...] In October 2014, again on a solo film, Feige said [...] "we'll see. We'd love to do it, we'd love to find the place to put it, but right now, Hulk will be appearing, with his friends, in their [...] films." ...|$|E
