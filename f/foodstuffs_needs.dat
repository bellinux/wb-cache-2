50|$|A {{limiting}} factor of the Māori fortifications {{that were not}} built as set pieces, however, was {{the need for the}} people inhabiting them to leave frequently to cultivate areas for food, or to gather it from the wilderness. Consequently, pā would often be seasonally abandoned for 4 to 6 months of each year. In Māori tradition a pā would also be abandoned if a chief was killed or if some calamity took place that a tohunga (witch doctor/shaman) had attributed to an evil spirit (atua). In the 1860s, Māori, though nominally Christian, still followed aspects of their tikanga at the same time. Normally, once the kūmara had been harvested in March-April and placed in storage the inhabitants could lead a more itinerant lifestyle, trading, or harvesting gathering other <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>needed</b> for winter but this did not stop war taking place outside this time frame if the desire for utu or payback was great.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{atmospheric}} testing {{of nuclear weapons}} during the 1950 s and early 1960 s produced large amounts of radio-carbon. This 14 C bomb pulse provides useful age information in numerous scientific fields, e. g. in geosciences and environ-mental sciences. Bomb-pulse dating {{can also be used}} to date human material (e. g. in forensics and medical science). Bomb-pulse dating relies on precise measurements of the declining 14 C concentration in atmospheric carbon dioxide collected at clean-air sites. However, local variations in the 14 C specific activity of air and foodstuffs occur, which are caused by natural processes as well as by various human activities. As 14 C enters the human body mainly through the diet, variations of 14 C con-centration in <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>need</b> to be considered. The marine component of the diet is believed to be of particular importance due to the non-equilibrium in 14 C specific activity between the atmosphere and aquatic reservoirs during the bomb pulse.

A aflatoxina B 1 (AFB 1), {{principal}} metabólito produzido por fungos do gênero Aspergillus, manifesta seus efeitos tóxicos após conversão hepática em AFB 1 -epóxido, o qual reage com macromoléculas celulares, incluindo proteínas, RNA (ácido ribonucléico) e DNA (ácido desoxirribonucléico). A reação com o DNA ocorre através da ligação com guaninas, ao nível do códon 249, do gene supressor de tumores p 53. Em seres humanos, estudos de biomonitoramento individual de derivados AFB 1 -N 7 -guanina tem demonstrado que as aflatoxinas constituem importantes fatores de risco, com uma provável interação sinergística com o vírus da hepatite B, para o desenvolvimento do carcinoma hepatocelular em populações expostas. Considerando-se a ocorrência freqüente das aflatoxinas em produtos alimentícios, no Brasil, ressalta-se a necessidade de estudos que avaliem criteriosamente o impacto dos níveis de exposição a estas toxinas sobre a saúde humana. Current concepts {{derived from}} intensive research {{over the last}} decade, on biotransformation, mechanisms of toxicity and evidences for the involvement of aflatoxins in the etiolgy of human liver cancer are summarily presented. Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), the main metabolite produced by moulds of genus Aspergillus, exerts its effects after conversion to the reactive compound AFB 1 -epoxide, {{by the action of}} cytochrome P 450 -dependent enzymes. This epoxide can form derivatives with cellular macromolecules, including proteins, RNA and DNA. The reaction with DNA occurs with guanines in the códon 249 of tumor suppressor gene p 53. Primary biotransformation of AFB 1 also produces hydroxylated and less toxic derivatives, such as aflatoxins Q 1 and P 1. Differences intra and interspecies in the pathways of activation/detoxification are directly related to the susceptibility of animals to aflatoxin effects. In humans, studies of individual biomonitoring of AFB 1 metabolites such as AFB 1 -N 7 -guanine have demonstrated that aflatoxins constitute an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in exposed populations. Some of these studies also show a synergistic action between aflatoxins and the hepatitis B virus in the development of human HCC. In view of these concepts, and taking into account the frequent detection of aflatoxins in Brazilian <b>foodstuffs,</b> the <b>need</b> for investigation into the level of exposure to these toxins and its impact on human health is stressed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Background Poverty in {{the rural}} areas often results in people being unable to buy the {{necessary}} food to feed their families and at the end, the children suffer, as they do not get the necessary <b>foodstuffs</b> <b>needed</b> for their development. Workers living in rural or agricultural communities do not have adequate access to basic primary health care facilities. Children need to be immunized and have regular check-ups during their developmental years and this is often lacking in farming communities. Farm workers and their children are also often denied access to other Government services. They are often not informed of services which are available and which will benefit them. Children attend schools without clean drinking water or proper sanitation, putting them at risk of disease. Some children travel far to reach the schools. A lack of state-funded transport from homes hinders access to education in commercial farming areas. Such exhausting conditions adversely affect the ability of these children to adequately participate in activities in the classroom. This results in poor performance, nonattendance or regular absence. Children from families who are dependent on employment on commercial farms for their livelihoods are vulnerable due to low education status of their parents/guardians, low pay, poor working conditions and dependence on the farmer. Project aim The main aim of the project was to investigate the effects of a daily vegetable meal on the health of farm school children. Objective of the study The specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of vegetables in the school feeding programme over a 15 week period on: the school attendance in the experimental and control schools, the prevalence of infections, the occurrence of sores in the school going learners of both the experimental and the control schools. Research setting This study was part of the larger FLAGH (Farm Labour And General Health) programme that was a follow up of the THUSA study. The FLAGH programme consists of a number of different projects and studies mainly aimed at improving the nutritional status and quality of life of black South African farm dwellers in the North-West Province. Two schools in the Rysmierbult district were selected to participate in this study. One of the schools was used as a control school and the other school was used as the intervention (experimental) school. The vegetable garden in the experimental school started in 2003 and in the control school it was started in 2001. In 2004 after the school opened, the garden in the control school was not functional due to some reasons. Therefore the school was used as a control school as the learners were not fed vegetables each day. Subjects A total number of 109 primary school learners between the ages of 6 and 14 years old took part in the study. The intervention school enrolment was 70 learners {{at the beginning of the}} study and at week 7 to 15 it was 67, as 3 learners had left school with no reason. The control school enrolment was 42 learners. Study design It was a comparative evaluation intervention study with baseline and end measurements to assess the effects of vegetable gardens in farm schools to supplement the school feeding programme. This was a comparison study of two farms schools. The implementation of vegetable garden projects at schools was one of the interventions aimed at improving the nutritional status of the children. Research Methods Four types of instruments were used in the study namely: anthropometric measures (height and weight) were used to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for age and Z-scores (by age) for all the children (Annexure 11), observation of the occurrence of skin sores and infection (Annexure I), a structured face-to-face interview for learners (Annexure Ill), a questionnaire for teachers to get their views towards the vegetable garden project (Annexure IV). Results The school attendance for the control school was throughout the 15 week intervention period better than the experimental school. Although the anthropometric measurements of learners at baseline in the experimental school differed statistically significantly from those in the control school it was of low practical significance (d< 0. 5). The learners in the experimental school were more undernourished (Z-score for weight for age: - 1. 86 and height for age: - 1. 55) than those in the control school (Z-score for weight for age: - 0. 99 and height for age: - 1. 37). Over the 15 week period the children in the control school got more undernourished (Z-score for weight for age: - 1. 34 and height for age: - 1. 44) while the nutrition status of the children in the experimental school improved (Z-score for weight for age: - 1. 65 and height for age: - 1. 48). No differences in the occurrence of infections in the children were observed between the two schools. However, the results on the occurrence of skin sores indicated a highly significant (p<O. OOI) improvement in the occurrence thereof in the experimental school. Conclusion Malnutrition is still a major problem worldwide and especially in Asia and Africa especially the Sub-Sahara area. There are a number of factors contributing to malnutrition. The underlying factors include access to food, caring practices, health services, the environment and lastly the immediate factors include dietary intake and infection/illness. From the results of this study it seems as if a vegetable meal can improve the nutrition status of learners and it can help to reduce the incidence of skin sores in children. The fact that no improvement in the incidence of infections was measured during this study by the occurrence of symptoms such as colds, flu, coughs and a running nose was observed, might be due to the short period of the intervention (15 weeks) and the small number of children included in the study. Recommendation A multifaceted approach is recommended to improve the nutritional status of learners attending schools in the farming areas. One of these approaches can be to include vegetables in the daily school meal. The study period was too short (15 weeks) to determine an explicit outcome, so it would be more appropriate to extend the study to a longer period. Master...|$|R

A method suitable for the simultaneous determination of Cd and Pb in various matrices of foodstuffs was validated and applied to different samples including fruit juice, bottled iced tea, several types of condiments, and in edible tissues of dried f ish locally produced in the Philippines. Fruit juice and bottled iced tea samples were filtered prior to quantif ication of metals using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Condiments and dried f ish samples were mineralized using microwave-assisted nitric acid digestion before subsequent metal detection with ICP-MS. The method was validated usingcer tif ied reference materials DORM 3 and NIST 1643 e, and evaluation of recovery of spiked samples. The method was linear in the concentration range 0. 01 to 500 μg L- 1 with correlation coeff icients of 0. 999 for both analytes. The estimated detection limits were 0. 060 μgL- 1 and 0. 186 μgL- 1 for Cd and Pb, respectively. The determined levels of Cdin fruit juice were in the range 0. 06 ± 0. 01 to 0. 67 ± 0. 01 μgL- 1, and Pb was detected in only one sample at 0. 37 ± 0. 02 μgL- 1. For the bottled iced tea samples, Cd was detected in only one sample (0. 13 ± 0. 02 μgL- 1) while none of the samples had detectable Pb concentration. For the condiments, the determined Cd levels were in the range 0. 83 ± 0. 06 to 306. 13 ± 2. 52 μgL- 1, whereas, the determined Pb levels were in the range 2. 14 ± 0. 38 to 67. 45 ± 7. 76 μgL- 1.

40|$|Difficult {{economic}} times began for Namibia in 2008 as real economic growth suddenly dropped to 4. 3 per cent from the 5. 5 per cent recorded in 2007. There were also wide {{fluctuations in the}} general level of prices of goods and services, including food commodities. Cost-of-living inflation rose {{to a high of}} 10. 4 per cent from a low of 2. 3 per cent in 2003 and unemployment rates were high, well in excess of 50 per cent; thus many households faced an increasing cost of living without reliable sources of income. The unfavourable circumstances of these households were exacerbated by inauspicious climatic and soil conditions, which greatly limit the role of subsistence farming as a viable source of livelihood {{in many parts of the}} country. In order to mitigate the impact of rising food prices and address food security concerns, the government decided to increase from eight to fourteen the number of basic commodities (foodstuffs and services) that had zero-rated value added tax (VAT) in 2000, as a means of improving access to basic <b>foodstuffs</b> and services <b>needed</b> for daily survival, particularly for the poor. This paper offers an ex-ante analysis of how the zero-of rating VAT on these basic commodities affected the well-being of poor households. We use data from the 1993 / 94 and 2003 / 04 National Household Income and Expenditure Survey and a mini survey conducted in 2009 to determine the consumption patterns of these commodities. The VAT burden lifted is determined and disaggregated by income decile. The analysis reveals that, contrary to expectations, rich households are more likely to benefit from VAT zero-rating than poor households. The findings of the study make it plausible to conclude that the zero-rating of VAT on basic commodities in 2000 and 2008 did not adequately target the commodities that the poor consume in large quantities and that they acquire in formal markets; hence the measure is unlikely to bring additional benefits to the poor. The government might have to reconsider the choice of VAT zero-rated commodities and include those that are consumed mostly by the poor and acquired in formal markets, while simultaneously strengthening and expanding other schemes such as social transfers which would benefit the poor disproportionately.

40|$|Consumers {{and food}} {{authorities}} are, to an increasing extent, concerned about {{factors such as}} the origin of food, how it is produced, and if it is healthy and safe. There are methods for general quality control to map the safety and nutritional value; however {{there is a need for}} suitable analytical methods to verify information such as the production method (wild/farmed), geographical origin, species, and process history of foods. This thesis evaluates the applicability of using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with pattern recognition techniques for authentication of foodstuffs. Fish and marine oils were chosen as materials. 13 C NMR was applied to authenticate marine oils and muscle lipids of both fatty and lean fish, according to production method (wild/farmed), geographical origin, species, and process history. 1 H NMR was applied on low molecular weight compounds extracted from cod muscle to authenticate fish according to species and processing conditions. 13 C NMR combined with pattern recognition techniques enabled the differentiation of marine oils according to wild/farmed and geographical origin of the raw material. It is suggested that this was mainly due to the different diets of the fish from which the oil was produced. It was also possible to authenticate marine oils according to species, and to say something about the level of mixtures detectable. The sn- 2 position specificity of fatty acids in triacylglycerols was shown to be an important characteristic to separate oils of different species. Esterified fish oil (concentrates) could easily be differentiated from natural fish oil by their 13 C NMR profile. 13 C NMR on muscle lipids, combined with pattern recognition techniques enabled the classification of wild and farmed salmon. The classification according to geographical origin was somewhat more complicated. A combination of analytical methods may be the best approach to obtain reliable results on geographical origin of fish. The analysis of lean fish showed that it was possible to classify lean gadoids according to species, and two stocks of Atlantic cod could be differentiated. There were also minor differences in the sn- 2 position specificity of 22 : 6 n- 3 in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) among the species investigated. 1 H NMR on water soluble extracts of fish muscle provided information about a wide range of compounds, and the two species investigated (cod and haddock) displayed different 1 HNMR profiles. Dimethylamine (DMA) was used as a marker for frozen, non processed fish. When applying the 1 H NMR data in pattern recognition techniques, frozen fish could be differentiated from non-frozen fish, and in the classification of the cod of the different processing methods 80 % of the samples were correctly classified. Common for the methods presented in this thesis, NMR spectroscopy combined with pattern recognition for authentication of traceability data on <b>foodstuffs,</b> is the <b>need</b> for databases with analytical data on reference samples, covering the natural variation among the samples to be classified. Databases for marine oils need not be as extensive as for fish, since marine oils are generally produced from fish batches. Oils can also be analyzed directly without extensive sample preparation, and the greatest potential for official application may lie in the analysis of oils.   PhD i bioteknologiPhD in Biotechnolog...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} American-African ties in the Second World War and considers the impact which the war had upon American perceptions of Africa and its peoples. The United States responded to the grave threat to its security posed by Germany and Japan by incorporating the land and resources of Africa into its overall strategy for survival. Americans, especially policy-makers, had their awareness of Africa shaped {{in an era of}} wartime upheaval and uncertainty. ^ The Second World War altered irrecoverably America 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with Africa. Colonial Africa occupied a central place in Allied strategy. The two most important developments were the creation of the American operated trans-African air ferry supply route, and, the incorporation of the port city of Dakar, Senegal on the bulge of French West Africa into the Allied network for the defense of the South Atlantic and North Africa. President Franklin D. Roosevelt displayed a keen interest in both of these projects and used them in several of his fireside chats to impress upon Americans Africa 2 ̆ 7 s important role in the defense of the western hemisphere. Economically, the raw materials of Africa fueled American war industries and supplied the Allied homefront with much <b>needed</b> <b>foodstuffs.</b> And, it was uranium from the Belgian Congo which enabled the United States to win the race for the atomic bomb. These twin concerns [...] raw materials and military strategy [...] determined American policy toward colonial, sub-Saharan Africa in the war years. ^ In light of the overriding strategic and material stakes Africa held for the United States in the Second World War, {{it is not surprising that}} most Americans took little note of the African peoples themselves. Official Washington, especially, was hesitant to support nationalism in Africa and thereby risk upsetting its allies and disrupting the war effort. Washington offered no serious resistance to postwar European rule in sub-Saharan Africa despite Roosevelt 2 ̆ 7 s first-hand 1943 observation of the debilitating impact of British imperialism upon the Africans of Gambia, West Africa, and, his often-stated desire to prevent the French from reclaiming Dakar after the war. The exigencies of total war, including the need for a secure flow of raw materials, a strategic base, and, the desirability of maintaining a close relationship with Great Britain, precluded a bold assault on the imperial policies of one 2 ̆ 7 s allies, especially in an area of the world such as Africa with which there had been little previous, sustained contact and even less understanding. ^ American reticence to speak out against colonialism in Africa flowed in part from an easy, rarely vocalized evaluation that the Africans were simply ill-prepared for self-determination. The denigration and segregation of Afro-Americans in the United States influenced an American policy which rendered the peoples of Africa all but invisible and relegated them to an inferior status in the evolution of human societies. American policy-makers during the war years dismissd nascent African nationalism as immature. A general ignorance about African conditions also influenced American officials who preferred the order and stability of colonial rule to the seemingly certain chaos self-government would bring. Given Africa 2 ̆ 7 s importance to the defense of the Western community, and emerging tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union at the close of the war, Washington viewed as inappropriate African decolonization. This was the key lesson that guided American policy-makers on African affairs in the Cold War years prior to 1960. ^ The chief resource materials for this study included recently screened or declassified records at the National Archives, as well as the holdings of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, the Library of Congress, the Naval Historical Center, the Public Record Office, London, and the Rhodes House Library, Oxford, England. ...|$|R
