5|$|During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a {{considerable}} amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952–54), an examination from a feminist {{point of view of a}} male-centred epic poetry. H.D. used Euripides's play Helen as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's Cantos, a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include Sagesse, Winter Love and Hermetic Definition. These three were published posthumously with the collective title Hermetic Definition (1972). The poem Hermetic Definition takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's Canto 106. Sagesse, written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to Trilogy. being partly written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. Winter Love was written together with End to Torment and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to Helen in Egypt.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, cadences can be {{classified}} as either transient (a pause, like a comma in a linguistic sentence, that implies the piece will continue after a brief lift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice)</b> or terminal (more conclusive, like a period, that indicates the sentence is done). Most transient cadences are half cadences (which stop momentarily on a dominant chord), though IAC or deceptive cadences are also usually transient, as well as Phrygian cadences. Terminal cadences are normally perfect, and rarely plagal.|$|E

3000|$|For {{unvoiced}} sections, {{the general}} trends of the LT quantization technique discussed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voiced</b> {{case can be}} retrieved in Figure 6. However, at a given bit rate, <b>the</b> ASD obtained <b>in</b> this case is generally slightly lower than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voiced</b> case, especially for the frame-by-frame quantization. This is because unvoiced LSF vectors are easier to quantize than voiced LSF vectors, as pointed out <b>in</b> [31]. Also, <b>the</b> LT coding curves are more [...] "spread" [...] than for <b>the</b> <b>voiced</b> sections of speech. As a result, the bit rates gains compared to the frame-by-frame quantization are positive only below, say, 900 [*]bits/s, and they are generally lower than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voiced</b> case, although they remain significant for the lower bit rates. This can be seen more easily on Figure 7, where the optimal LT curve is reported for unvoiced sections. For example, at 2.0 [*]dB the LT quantization bit rate is about 464 [*]bits/s, while the frame-by-frame quantizer bit rate is about 618 [*]bits/s (thus the relative gain is 24.9 %). Compared to the 2 D-transform techniques, the LT coding technique is also less efficient than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voiced</b> case. <b>The</b> [...] "crossing point" [...] between LT coding and 2 D-transform coding is here at about [...]...|$|R

25|$|The English {{music critic}} John Steane, {{reviewing}} Simon Keenlyside's performance of this aria, wrote:Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and {{brings out the}} best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it draws on the graceful French lyricism we know from the tenor solos in Mignon, adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice,</b> where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.|$|E
25|$|In a 2012 {{doctorate}} dissertation {{submitted to}} the Department of Linguistics at the University of Colorado, a researcher followed fifteen transmasculine individuals from the San Francisco Bay Area in a long-term ethnographic and sociophonetic study for {{one to two years}} after the start of masculinizing hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The analysis focused on changes in formant frequency and fundamental frequency through regular recordings over a one-year time period. Of the ten speakers whose voices were analyzed {{over a long period of}} time, all underwent a drop in fundamental frequency in the early stages of HRT; however, testosterone could not account for all the changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> and mannerisms. The dissertation concludes that social factors also affect changes in transmasculine voices.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a dynamic loudspeaker, uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a voice coil to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, a magnetic field is created by the electric current <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied electrical signal coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E
