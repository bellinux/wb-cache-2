40|$|Oscillatory {{systems in}} biology are tightly {{regulated}} process where the individual components (e. g. genes) express {{in an orderly}} manner by virtue of their functions. The temporal order among the components of an oscillatory system may potentially be disrupted for various reasons (e. g. environmental factors). As a result some components of the system may <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> or even cease to participate in the oscillatory process. In this article, we develop a novel framework to evaluate whether the temporal order is unchanged in different populations (or experimental conditions). We also develop methodology to estimate the order among the components with a suitable notion of "confidence. " Using publicly available data on S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and Homo sapiens we discover that the temporal order among the genes cdc 18; mik 1; hhf 1; hta 2; fkh 2 and klp 5 is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans...|$|E
40|$|We {{can make}} optimum {{scheduling}} results using various methods that are proposed by many researchers. However, {{it is very}} difficult to process the works on time without delaying the schedule. There are two major causes that disturb the planned optimum schedules; they are (1) the variation of productive capacity, and (2) the variation of products' quantities themselves. In this paper, we deal with the former variation, or productive capacities, at flow-shop works. When production machines in a shop <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> at flow-shops, we cannot continue to operate the productions and we have to stop the production line. To the contrary, we can continue to operate the shops even if some workers absent themselves. Of course, in this case, the production capacities become lower, because workers need to move from a machine to another to overcome the shortage of workers and some shops cannot be operated because of the worker shortage. We developed a new re-scheduling method based on Branch-and Bound method. We proposed an equation for calculating the lower bound for our Branch-and Bound method in a practical time. Some evaluation experiments are done using practical data of real flow-shop works. We compared our results with those of another simple scheduling method, and we confirmed the total production time of our result is shorter than that of another method by 4 %...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Cost of five {{different}} investigative procedures {{in a survey}} situation, based on different orderings of examinations, X-ray chest and sputum examination along with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis, have been calculated under certain TXU motions. The esti” 1 are subject to variation with {{any change in the}} assumptions. The objective here was to pro comparison of the five investigative procedures in a survey situation by taking un auxiliary example rather than precise estimation of cost. The main criterion for comparing the individual investigative procedures is the cost per bacillary case identified by an individual procedure. The study reveals that, while carrying out a prevalence survey through an investigative procedure, persons eligible for sputum examination should be offered microscopy and culture examination of sputum specimens because it is more efficacious and cost per bacillary case identified is also lower as coin-pared to microscopy examination of sputum specimens. In cities, under such a plan, cost per bacillary case identified is the lowest under investigative procedure TV and cost per bacillary case identified under procedure II is only slightly more. In towns/villages, cost per bacillary case identified is the lowest under procedure II and cost per bacillary case identified under procedure IV is only slightly more. Therefore any of these investigative procedure can be adopt-ed for carrying out a tuberculosis prevalence survey according to situation. It is suggested that procedure IV should be adopted if mobile X-ray unit is available and whenever the X—ray unit <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> procedure II can be followed as an alterna-tive. It is suggested that the work load of various activities should be estimated while plann-ing a tuberculosis prevalence survey. It will help in proper utilization of resources and adjust-ing sample si/e and thus reducing total cost under an investigative procedure...|$|R

40|$|DissertationThis {{dissertation}} examines {{opposition to}} nuns and convent life in America {{as it was}} expressed through vigilante violence, propaganda literature, and party politics. While nuns may seem like an unlikely target of hostility, a vast cohort of Americans singled them out as {{a serious threat to}} the republic. Between 1830 and 1860 anti-convent propaganda, including Awful Disclosures of the Hotel Dieu by “escaped nun” Maria Monk, flooded the literary market. Monk’s work warned of a Catholic conspiracy in the United States through the cloister, depicted alleged horrors of convent life, and cast nuns variously as masculine tyrants, foolish slaves, and whores. Investigators quickly unveiled Maria Monk as an impostor, but her book became the second best-seller after Uncle Tom’s Cabin before the Civil War, and it has never <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print. In <b>order</b> to “protect” American women from the nun’s life, mobs stormed convents from Massachusetts to Maryland. By the 1850 s, suspicion of nuns became formally politicized by Know-Nothing legislators who established “Nunnery Committees” for convent investigations. Although the Civil War quieted the outcry against nuns for a time, the campaign against convents had far-reaching implications. Members of the second Ku Klux Klan relied on anti-convent propaganda to buttress their positions, and common stereotypes of nuns—first evident in nineteenth-century convent narratives—have also persisted in popular culture. This dissertation argues that the campaign against nuns and convent life was a much greater part of nineteenth-century American popular culture and politics than previous historians have recognized...|$|R

5000|$|Kierkegaard {{was criticized}} by his former teacher and pastor Hans Lassen Martensen, he concludes from Kierkegaard's writing, {{here and in}} Concluding Unscientific Postscript, that he's saying an {{individual}} can be saved {{without the help of}} the Church. Martensen believed 19th century Socialism would destroy individuality, but regarded Kierkegaard's emphasis on the single individual as too one-sided. Kierkegaard was responding to Hegelian writers such as Ludwig Feuerbach and David Strauss who emphasized the objective nature of God. God is just man's idea. [...] Man is an object to God, before God perceptibly imparts himself to man; he thinks of man; he determines his action in accordance with the nature of man and his needs. God is indeed free in will; he can reveal himself or not; but he is not free as to the understanding; he cannot reveal to man whatever he will, but only what is adapted to man, what is commensurate with his nature such as it actually is; he reveals what he must reveal, if his revelation is to be a revelation for man, and not for some other kind of being. Now what God thinks in relation to man is determined by the idea of man - it has arisen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reflection on human nature. God puts himself in the place of man, and thinks of himself as this other being can and should think of him; he thinks of himself, not with his own thinking power, but with man's. In the scheme of his revelation God must have reference not to himself, but to man's power of comprehension. That which comes from God to man, comes to man only from man in God, that is, only from the ideal nature of man to the phenomenal man, from the species to the individual. Thus, between the divine revelation and the so-called human reason or nature, there is no other than an illusory distinction; - the contents of the divine revelation are of human origin, for they have proceeded not from God as God, but from God as determined by human reason, human wants, that is, directly from human reason and human wants. And so in revelation man <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> himself, in <b>order,</b> by a circuitous path, to return to himself! Here we have a striking confirmation of the position that the secret of theology is nothing else than anthropology - the knowledge of God nothing else than a knowledge of man!

40|$|In microprocessors, {{achieving}} {{an efficient}} {{utilization of the}} execution units is {{a key factor in}} improving performance. However, maintaining an uninterrupted flow of instructions is a challenge due to the data and control dependencies between instructions of a program. Modern microprocessors employ aggressive optimizations trying to keep their execution units busy without violating inter-instruction dependencies. Such complex optimizations may cause subtle implementation flaws that can be hard to detect using conventional simulation-based verification techniques. Formal verification is known for its ability to discover design flaws that may go undetected using conventional verification techniques. However, with formal verification come two major challenges. First, the correctness of the implementation needs to be defined formally. Second, formal verification is often hard to apply at the scale of realistic implementations. In this thesis, we present a formal verification strategy to guarantee that a microprocessor implementation preserves both data and control dependencies among instructions. Throughout our strategy, we address the two major challenges associated with formal verification: correctness and scalability. We address the correctness challenge by specifying our correctness in the context of generic pipelines. Unlike conventional pipeline hazard rules, we make no distinction between the data and control aspects. Instead, we describe the relationship between a producer instruction and a consumer instruction in a way such that both instructions can speculatively read their source operands, speculatively write their results, and <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their program <b>order</b> during execution. In addition to supporting branch and value prediction, our correctness criteria allow the implementation to discard (squash) or replay instructions while being executed. We address the scalability challenge in three ways: abstraction, decomposition, and induction. First, we state our inter-instruction dependency correctness criteria in terms of read and write operations without making reference to data values. Consequently, our correctness criteria can be verified for implementations with abstract datapaths. Second, we decompose our correctness criteria into a set of smaller obligations that are easier to verify. All these obligations can be expressed as properties within the Syntactically-Safe fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (SSLTL). Third, we introduce a technique to verify SSLTL properties by induction, and prove its soundness and completeness. To demonstrate our overall strategy, we verified a term-level model of an out-of-order speculative processor. The processor model implements register renaming using a P 6 -style reorder buffer and branch prediction with a hybrid (discard-replay) recovery mechanism. The verification obligations (expressed in SSLTL) are checked using a tool implementing our inductive technique. Our tool, named Tahrir, is built on top of a generic interface to SMT solvers and can be generally used for verifying SSLTL properties about infinite-state systems...|$|R
