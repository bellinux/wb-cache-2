5|$|A circovirus—given {{the name}} raven circovirus or RaCV—was {{isolated}} from an Australian raven suffering from feather lesions in 2006. It has affinities with canary circovirus (CaCV) and pigeon circovirus (PiCV). Its clinical significance is unknown. Tick <b>infestation</b> {{is rare in}} the Australian raven, with Ixodes holocyclus and Amblyomma triguttatum recorded. Lice and hippoboscid flies have been recorded yet little-researched, and an <b>infestation</b> by the fly Passeromyia longicornis was recorded in one nest.|$|E

40|$|The species {{composition}} nf southern pine bark beetle <b>infestations</b> was examined in east Texas in 1979, A total of 545 <b>infestations</b> {{were located in}} thirteen 18, 000 acresurvey blocks. Ips spp, were observed in 98. 9 of ihe <b>infestations,</b> with black turpentine beetles, Dendrnclonus lerebrans Olivier, present in 42. 4 % ofthe <b>infestations.</b> Southern pine beetles, D. fronlulis Zimmemiann. were only observed in 11 <b>infestations</b> (2. 0 %), and were less abundant than other bark beetle species in these <b>infestations.</b> Almost 80 % of the <b>infestations</b> were associated with a recognizable pre-disposing factor (lightning, fire, etc.). Most <b>Infestations</b> were small (less than six trees), though <b>infestations</b> associated with fire damage typically contained more than five infested trees. In {{the absence of an}} identified pre-disposing factor, <b>infestations</b> were frequently located in stands rated as high or moderate hazard for southern pine beetl...|$|R
50|$|Plant {{communities}} that have high densities of large perennial bunchgrasses are more resistant to medusahead invasion, so managing rangelands to promote and maintain large perennial bunchgrasses is critical {{to prevent the spread}} of medusahead. This will reduce the establishment of new <b>infestations,</b> but successful management will also require searching for and eradicating new <b>infestations.</b> Controlling new <b>infestations</b> is more effective, and often more feasible, than trying to control large <b>infestations.</b>|$|R
25|$|Broad bean {{plants are}} highly {{susceptible}} to early summer <b>infestations</b> {{of the black}} bean aphid, which can cover large sections of growing plants with <b>infestations,</b> typically starting {{at the tip of}} the plant. Severe <b>infestations</b> can significantly reduce yields, and can also cause discolouration of pods and reduction in their saleable values.|$|R
5|$|Many {{vegetarian}} {{restaurants and}} producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher, certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect <b>infestation</b> and steps {{have been taken}} to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael. Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect <b>infestation.</b> The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.|$|E
5|$|A {{gypsy moth}} <b>infestation</b> began on Nescopeck Mountain {{in the summer}} of 2014, causing {{hundreds}} of trees to be defoliated. The Bureau of Forestry expects to begin spraying the area in May 2015 and June 2015.|$|E

40|$|The red {{imported}} fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (hereafter {{referred to}} as imported fire ant), long considered a regional problem, is receiving renewed attention nationwide, with <b>infestations</b> found in Arizona, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, and Virginia (Mitchell 1996). Recently, <b>infestations</b> discovered in several regions of California caused great public concern (Brennan 1999, Schrader 1999). Initially, <b>infestations</b> appeared to be isolated in almond groves in Kern County; presumably these <b>infestations</b> originated from bee hives transported interstate {{for the purpose of}} pollinating crops. Separately, ornamental plants arriving in Las Vegas, NV, were infested with fire ants, and records showed that the point of origin was a nursery in Orange County, CA. Further inspections revealed <b>infestations</b> in over 16, 000 acres of Orange County. Finally, <b>infestations</b> were identified in some desert irrigated agricultural regions of the Coachella Valley in Riverside County, CA. Subsequently, a toll-free telephone number was established for reporting fire ant mounds in the state of California (800 - 491 - 1899) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to wet fields and localized flooding, this winter’s record snow cover {{is likely to}} contribute to abundant winter annual weed <b>infestations</b> in no-till fields.

5|$|Its first {{association}} with the potato plant (Solanum tuberosum) was not made until about 1859 when it began destroying potato crops {{in the region of}} Omaha, Nebraska. Its spread eastward was rapid, at an average distance of 140km per year. By 1874 it had reached the Atlantic Coast. From 1871, the American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans about the potential for an accidental <b>infestation</b> caused by the transportation of the beetle from America. From 1875, several western European countries, including Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland, banned imports of American potatoes to avoid <b>infestation</b> by L. decemlineata.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic mites include Syringophiloidus bombycillae, first {{identified}} on this species, and the nasal mite Ptilonyssus bombycillae. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma species, and a Leucocytozoon first {{identified in this}} waxwing. Bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms, but levels of parasitic worm <b>infestation</b> are generally low.|$|E
5|$|The {{desert locust}} (Schistocerca gregaria) is {{probably}} the best-known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) {{and its ability to}} migrate over long distances. A major <b>infestation</b> covered much of western Africa in 2003-4, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in the autumn of 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost of handling the <b>infestation</b> was put at US$122 million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5 billion.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Unusual {{clinical}} course Background: In {{the past}} decade, bed bug <b>infestations</b> have been increasingly common in high income countries. Psychological {{consequences of these}} <b>infestations</b> are rarely examined in the scientific literature. Case Report: We present a case, based on a coroner’s investigation report, {{of a woman with}} previous psychiatric morbidi-ty who jumped to her death following repeated bed bug <b>infestations</b> in her apartment. Our case report shows that the bed bug <b>infestations</b> were the likely trigger for the onset a negative psychological state that ultimate-ly led to suicide. Conclusions: Given the recent surge in <b>infestations,</b> rapid action needs to be taken not only in an attempt to control and eradicate the bed bugs but also to adequately care for those infested by bed bugs.

40|$|Plumeless thistle (Carduus acanthoides L.) is one {{of seven}} noxious weeds in Nebraska. An {{introduced}} invasive broadleaf weed native to Europe and Asia, plumeless thistle currently infests about 65, 000 acres in Nebraska. <b>Infestations</b> of plumeless thistle may reduce productivity of pastures and rangeland, where <b>infestations</b> {{tend to be the}} largest. Plumeless thistle competes with and suppresses growth of desirable species. Heavy <b>infestations</b> prevent livestock from grazing the area and lighter <b>infestations</b> prevent livestock from eating plants growing near the thistle. Estimates place the annual loss in Nebraska agricultural production due to plumeless thistle at $ 162, 000. Although plumeless thistle is more limited in distribution than its close relative the musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.), the <b>infestations</b> require landowners and producers in Nebraska to spend thousands of dollars each year for control...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, bed bugs {{have been}} {{considered}} uncommon in the industrialized world. This study determined the extent of reemerging bed bug <b>infestations</b> in homeless shelters and other locations in Toronto, Canada. Toronto Public Health documented complaints of bed bug <b>infestations</b> from 46 locations in 2003, most commonly apartments (63 %), shelters (15 %), and rooming houses (11 %). Pest control operators in Toronto (N = 34) reported treating bed bug <b>infestations</b> at 847 locations in 2003, most commonly single-family dwellings (70 %), apartments (18 %), and shelters (8 %). Bed bug <b>infestations</b> were reported at 20 (31 %) of 65 homeless shelters. At 1 affected shelter, 4 % of residents reported having bed bug bites. Bed bug <b>infestations</b> can have an adverse effect on health {{and quality of life}} in the general population, particularly among homeless persons living in shelters...|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} (as at 2010) of two breeding {{pairs of}} wild peregrine falcons (nesting {{one in each}} of the telescope's two support towers) prevents the nuisance of pigeon <b>infestation</b> (by droppings fouling, and their body heat affecting sensitive instrument readings) that some other radio telescopes suffer from.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to <b>infestation</b> by B. siricidicola; <b>infestation</b> rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>infestation</b> by this aphid, leaves of sugar beet become swollen, roll, and cease developing. The roots grow poorly and the sugar content is reduced. In some other plants the leaves do not become {{distorted}} but growth is affected and flowers abort due to {{the action of the}} toxic saliva injected by the aphid to improve the flow of sap.|$|E
50|$|Prescribed grazing {{may be an}} {{effective}} means of controlling <b>infestations.</b> All growth forms are nutritious to sheep. High-density <b>infestations</b> can be controlled by fencing in the control area with sheep until the desired level of removal is achieved.|$|R
50|$|<b>Infestations</b> of Trichodectes canis {{are treated}} {{according}} to typical lice <b>infestations</b> in dogs.

40|$|Urban rat <b>infestations</b> have multifactorial {{causes and}} {{may result in}} severe public health and {{environmental}} problems, as well as heavy economic losses. The identification of putative environmental determinants of urban rat <b>infestations</b> and the mapping of areas prone to experiencing such <b>infestations</b> (hot spots) are crucial for effectively addressing intervention efforts. We investigated the associations between a selection of environmental factors and the occurrence of rat <b>infestations</b> {{in the city of}} Madrid, Spain. This was done by modelling 10, 956 citizen-reported rat sightings from 2002 to 2008 using generalized additive models, both at municipality (Madrid) and district (Latina) levels. Increased age and density of housing, and decreased distance to vegetated areas, markets and cat feeding stations were factors associated with an increased risk of rat <b>infestations.</b> Risk maps for rat <b>infestations</b> were also developed and recurrent hot spots of rat activity were identified. Although a better fit to the data was obtained in the model for the smaller scale and possibly more environmentally homogenous study area of Latina, modelling the spatial distribution of rat sightings was useful for identifying factors associated with an increased risk of urban rat <b>infestations,</b> as well as for identifying hot spots of rat activity, providing local authorities with a practical tool for effectively targeting intervention efforts to high-risk situations based on the local environmental contexts...|$|R
5|$|Banksia aculeata {{has been}} {{reported}} as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study this pathogen {{was found to have}} no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage of populations infested or facing imminent <b>infestation,</b> the species was classed as having a very low extinction risk.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the <b>infestation</b> of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults emerging from diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, {{the board}} of {{trustees}} of the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens announced that the old Woman's Club of Jacksonville, which was to become a center for programming for the museum, would have to be demolished because of an <b>infestation</b> of Formosan subterranean termites, costing the museum its $7 million investment into the building. It had been previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
40|$|Ocular <b>infestations</b> by {{arthropods}} {{consist in}} the parasitization {{of the human}} eye, either directly (e. g., some insect larvae causing ophthalmomyiasis) or via arthropods feeding on lachrymal/conjunctival secretions (e. g., some eye-seeking insects, which also act as vectors of eye pathogens). In addition, demodicosis and phthiriasis may also cause eye discomfort in humans. Ophthalmomyiasis by larvae of the families Oestridae, Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae, are frequent causative agents of human ocular <b>infestations.</b> Over the last decades, the extensive use of macrocyclic lactones in cattle has reduced the frequency of <b>infestations</b> by Hypoderma bovis and Hypoderma lineatum (family Oestridae), and consequently, human <b>infestations</b> by these species. A prompt diagnosis of ocular myiasis (e. g., by serological tests) is pivotal for positive prognoses, particularly when the larvae are not detectable during the ophthalmologic examination. Molecular diagnoses may also assist physicians and parasitologists in achieving time-efficient diagnoses of <b>infestations</b> by Oestridae causing myiasis. Finally, due to widespread international travel to exotic destinations, cases of myiasis are increasing in non-endemic areas, therefore requiring physicians to acquire a profound knowledge of the clinical symptoms linked to these <b>infestations</b> to prevent costly, inappropriate treatments or severe complications...|$|R
40|$|Different {{planting}} and termination dates of Pima S- 6 and Upland (Deltapine 90) cotton (Gossypium barbadense L. and hirsutum L. respectively) were tested for {{their effects on}} pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella) <b>infestations.</b> Tests were conducted during 1989 and 1990 cotton seasons at the University of Arizona Yuma Valley Agricultural Experiment Station. Planting dates indicated little effect on early season <b>infestations</b> of pink bollworm for either cotton. However. irrigation termination had the greatest effect on late season <b>infestations.</b> In 1989. heat unit (degree day 12. 8 / 30 ° C. lower and upper thresholds) accumulations were several days earlier than 1990, due to a very warm year. Pheromone trap counts indicated higher populations in 1989 than 1990; however. <b>infestations</b> in the field were similar between the years. <b>Infestations</b> dramatically increased during July through September, indicating that a longer cotton season with actively growing fruit, results in a continued population increase.

5|$|L.gigas is {{very often}} parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa, which are common mollusk parasites. Those coccidian parasites, which are spore-forming, {{single-celled}} microorganisms, initially establish themselves in large vacuolated {{cells of the}} host's digestive gland, where they reproduce freely. The <b>infestation</b> may proceed to the secretory cells of the same organ. The entire life cycle of the parasite typically occurs within a single host and tissue.|$|E
5|$|Once an <b>infestation</b> is detected, quarantines are {{typically}} imposed by state or national government agencies disallowing transport of ash firewood or live plants outside {{of these areas}} without permits indicating the material has been inspected or treated (i.e., heat treatment or wood chipping) to ensure no live emerald ash borer {{are present in the}} bark and phloem. In urban areas, trees are often removed once an <b>infestation</b> is found to reduce emerald ash borer population densities and the likelihood of further spread. Urban ash {{are typically}} replaced with non-ash species such as maple, oak, or linden to limit food sources. In rural areas, trees can be harvested for lumber or firewood to reduce ash stand density, but quarantines may apply for this material, especially in areas where the material could be infested.|$|E

Bed bug <b>infestations</b> can have an adverse effect on health {{and quality of life}} in the general population, particularly among homeless persons living in shelters. The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) is a wingless, red-brown, blood-sucking insect that grows up to 7 mm in length and has a lifespan from 4 months up to 1 year (Figure 1) (1). Bed bugs hide in cracks and crevices in beds, wooden furniture, floors, and walls during the daytime and emerge at night to feed on their preferred host, humans. The common bed bug is found worldwide. <b>Infestations</b> are common in the developing world, occurring in settings of unsanitary living conditions and severe crowding (2, 3). In North America and Western Europe, bed bug <b>infestations</b> became rare {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century and have been viewed as a condition that occurs in travelers returning from developing countries (4).
