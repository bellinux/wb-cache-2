500|$|The {{action bar}} and battle command input method differs {{slightly}} between the PC and PlayStation versions. The PC version supports both point and click and <b>keyboard</b> <b>selection</b> of commands or macros {{from the action}} bar. Macro commands are customizable sequences of actions that allow players to execute desired abilities at a specific time. The PlayStation version instead maps the action bar and macros to the [...] "Cross Hotbar"—sets of four icons arranged in a cross shape. These are the grouped and accessed {{through a combination of}} the L2 and the R2 buttons and the directional pad or the face buttons. Using each shoulder button to cycle through the cross sets, players have quick access to commands. This interface is also available to PC players who use controllers.|$|E
50|$|In January 2011, Xfce 4.8.0 was released. This version {{included}} {{changes such as}} {{the replacement}} of ThunarVFS and HAL with GIO, udev, ConsoleKit and PolicyKit, and new utilities for browsing remote network shares using several protocols including SFTP, SMB, and FTP. Window clutter was reduced by merging all file progress dialog boxes into a single dialog. The panel application was also rewritten for better positioning, transparency, item and launcher management. 4.8 also introduced a new menu plugin to view directories. The 4.8 plugin framework remains compatible with 4.6 plugins. The display configuration dialog in 4.8 supports RandR 1.2, detecting screens automatically and allowing users to pick their preferred display resolution, refresh rate and display rotation. Screens can be configured to either work in clone mode or being placed next to each other. <b>Keyboard</b> <b>selection</b> has become easier and more user-friendly. Also, the manual settings editor has been updated to be more functional.|$|E
40|$|Although {{handwriting}} {{is typically}} taught during early childhood and keyboarding {{may not be}} taught explicitly, both may be relevant to writing development in the later grades. Thus, Study 1 investigated automatic production of the ordered alphabet from memory for manuscript (unjoined), cursive (joined), and keyboard letter modes (alphabet 15 sec) and their relationships {{with each other and}} spelling and composing in typically developing writers in grades 4 to 7 (N = 113). Study 2 compared students with dysgraphia (impaired handwriting, n= 27), dyslexia (impaired word spelling, n= 40), or oral and written language learning disability (OWL LD) (impaired syntax composing, n= 11) or controls without specific writing disabilities (n= 10) in grades 4 to 9 (N= 88) on the same alphabet 15 modes, manner of copying (best or fast), spelling, and sentence composing. In Study 1, sequential multilevel model regressions of predictor alphabet 15 letter production/selection modes on spelling and composition outcomes, measured annually from grade 4 to grade 7 (ages 9 to 13 years), showed that only the cursive mode uniquely, positively, and consistently predicted both spelling and composing in each grade. For composing, in grade 4 manuscript mode was positively predictive and in grades 5 - 7 <b>keyboard</b> <b>selection</b> was. In Study 2 all letter production modes correlated with each other and one’s best and fast sentence copying, spelling, and timed sentence composing. The groups with specific writing disabilities differed from control group on alphabet 15 manuscript mode, copy fast, and timed sentence composing. The dysgraphia and dyslexia groups differed on copying sentences in one’s best handwriting, with the dysgraphia group scoring lower. The educational and theoretical significance of the findings are discussed for multiple modes and manners of letter production/selection of the alphabet that support spelling and composing beyond the early grades in students with and without specific writing disabilities...|$|E

40|$|A {{joystick}} {{text entry}} method for game controllers and mobile phones would be valuable, since these devices often have joysticks but no conventional keyboards. But prevalent joystick {{text entry method}}s are slow because they are selection-based. EdgeWrite, a new joystick text entry method, {{is not based on}} selection but on gestures from a unistroke alphabet. Our experiment shows that this new method is faster, leaves fewer errors, and is more satisfying than date stamp and <b>selection</b> <b>keyboard</b> (two prevalent selection-based methods) for novices after minimal practice. For more practiced users, our results show that EdgeWrite is at least 1. 5 times faster than <b>selection</b> <b>keyboard,</b> and 2. 4 times faster than date stamp...|$|R

5000|$|The breath {{controller}} {{allowed the}} DX7 {{to be used}} to produce sounds similar to a wind instrument but with a piano <b>keyboard</b> for note <b>selection.</b> This could enable a synthesizer player to produce a more vocal-like performance of a melody, as it overcame one of the limitations of keyboard controllers, namely that the note is only triggered, and then either decays (as with a piano sound), or is sustained at the same volume (with a pipe organ sound). In contrast, with a breath controller, a synthesizer player could imitate a singer or a flute player's performance of a melody, swelling notes with crescendos.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} visual and tactile intra-oral sensor-position feedback for target selection tasks {{with the tip of}} the tongue. Method: Target selection tasks were performed using an inductive tongue-computer interface (ITCI). Visual feedback was established by highlighting the area on a visual display corresponding to the activated intra-oral target. Tactile feedback was established using a sensor-border matrix over the sensor plates of the ITCI, which provided sensor-position tactile queues via the user’s tongue. Target selection tasks using an on-screen keyboard by controlling the mouse pointer with the ITCI’s was also evaluated. Results: Mean target selection rates of 23, 5 and 15 activations per minute were obtained using visual, tactile and “none” feedback techniques in the 3 rd training session. On-screen <b>keyboard</b> target <b>selection</b> tasks averaged 10 activations per minute in the 3 rd training session. Involuntary activations while speaking or drinking were significantly reduced either through a sensor-matrix or dwell time for sensor activation. Conclusions: These results provide key design considerations to further increase the typing efficiency of tongue-computer interfaces for individuals with upper-limb mobility impairments...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{research}} has looked into the three dimensional (3 D) related technology especially in 3 D content capture, production, compression, and delivery. However, few research has addressed the design practice of interaction techniques for stereoscopic 3 D video interaction. This paper presents a study of object selection in 3 D from users' perspective. The aim is to learn the user preferences and user behaviour of selecting stereoscopic 3 D content. The study suggests that interaction techniques affects users' decision of object selection in terms of chosen location in 3 D, while user attitudes do not have significant impact. Furthermore, the ray-casting based interaction usingWiimote can outper-form the volume-based interaction technique using the mouse and <b>keyboard</b> for object <b>selection</b> accuracy. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} by this expert system concerns {{the expansion of}} capability of a Real Time Trainer for the Spacelab flight crew. As requirements for more models or fidelity are placed upon the system, expansion is necessary. The simulator can be expanded using a larger processor or by going to a distributed system and expand by adding additional processors. The distributed system is preferable {{because it is more}} economical and can be expanded in a more incremental manner. An expert system was developed to evaluate modeling and timing capability within a real time training simulator. The expert system is based upon a distributed configuration. Components of the modeled system are control tasks, network tasks, emulator tasks, processors, displays, and a network. The distributed module expert system (DMES) allows the configuring of processors, tasks, display use, <b>keyboard</b> use, and <b>selection</b> of alternate methods to update the data buffer.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new method of {{computer}} input for capturing engineering workpiece profiles in the geometry creation {{stage of a}} computer-aided part programming (CAPP) environment. It represents an alternative approach differing from the (existing) input methods that rely on: a) sets of commands made at the <b>keyboard</b> &/or through <b>selection</b> of iconic / text menus which are on-screen or tablet-based; b) the building up of the profile on a piecewise line by line and arc by arc basis. This unique method employs pattern analysis /recognition techniques to capture directly the basic profile of the engineering component as it is drawn on the digitizer tablet in a flexible manner akin to draughting at the drawing board. A profile analysis algorithm deduces the topological relationship between the straight line and arc segments making up the profile. An on-line symbol recognition package is then invoked to give dimensional information to the newly-drawn profile. The entire operation of hand-drawing the profile and hand-writing the dimensions (radius, horizontal and vertical dimensions, angles between lines, etc.) reduces the geometry entry procedure to that of traditional draughting. This more flexible method imposes on the designer relatively few rules to remember and thus may present a unique solution to the description of two-and-a-half dimensioned geometrical objects {{such as in the}} initial geometry definition stage of CNC machining...|$|R
