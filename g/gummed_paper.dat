60|$|Smoke Printing.--When other {{apparatus}} {{is not at}} hand, a method of obtaining very clear impressions is to smoke a plate over a lighted candle, to press the finger on the blackened surface, and then on an adhesive one. The following details must, however, be borne in mind: the plate must not be smoked too much, {{for the same reason}} that a slab must not be inked too much; and the adhesive surface must be only slightly damped, not wetted, or the impression will be blurred. A crockery plate is better than glass or metal, as the soot does not adhere to it so tightly, and it is less liable to crack. Professor Bowditch finds mica (which is sold at photographic stores in small sheets) to be the best material. Certainly the smoke comes wholly off the mica on to the parts of the finger that touch it, and a beautiful negative is left behind, which can be utilised in the camera better than glass that has been similarly treated; but it does not serve so well for a plate that is intended to be kept ready for use in a pocket-book, its softness rendering it too liable to be scratched. I prefer to keep a slip of very thin copper sheeting in my pocket-book, with which, and with the gummed back of a postage stamp, or even the gummed fringe to a sheet of stamps, impressions can easily be taken. The thin copper quickly cools, and a wax match supplies enough smoke. The folders spoken of (p. 42) may be smoked instead of being inked, and are in some cases preferable to carry in the pocket or to send by post, being so easy to smoke afresh. Luggage labels that are thickly gummed at the back furnish a good adhesive surface. The fault of <b>gummed</b> <b>paper</b> lies in the difficulty of damping it without its curling up. The <b>gummed</b> <b>paper</b> sold by stationers is usually thinner than luggage labels, and still more difficult to keep flat. Paste rubbed in a very thin layer over a card makes a surface that holds soot firmly, and one that will not stick to other surfaces if accidentally moistened. Glue, isinglass, size, and mucilage, are all suitable. It was my fortune as a boy to receive rudimentary lessons in drawing from a humble and rather grotesque master. He confided to me the discovery, which he claimed as his own, that pencil drawings could be fixed by licking them; and as I write these words, the image of his broad swab-like tongue performing the operation, and of his proud eyes gleaming over the drawing he was operating on, come vividly to remembrance. This reminiscence led me to try whether licking a piece of paper would give it a sufficiently adhesive surface. It did so. Nay, it led me a step further, for I took two pieces of paper and licked both. The dry side of the one was held over the candle as an equivalent to a plate for collecting soot, being saved by the moisture at the back from igniting (it had to be licked two or three times during the process), and the impression was made on the other bit of paper. An ingenious person determined to succeed in obtaining the record of a finger impression, can hardly fail altogether under any ordinary circumstances.|$|E

60|$|Canoe of Three Planks.--A swift, safe, {{and graceful}} little boat, {{with a sharp}} stem and stern, and with a bottom that curves upwards at both ends, can be made out of three planks. The sketch, fig. 1, is a {{foreshortened}} view of the boat, and the diagram, fig. 2, shows {{the shape of the}} planks from which it is made. The thwart or seat shown in fig. 1 is important in giving the proper inclination to the sides of the boat, for, without it, they would tend to collapse; and the bottom would be less curved at either end. If the reader will take the trouble to trace fig. 2 on a stout card, to cut it out in a single piece (cutting only half through the cardboard where the planks touch), and to fasten it into shape with pieces of <b>gummed</b> <b>paper,</b> he will understand the architecture of the boat more easily than from any description. If he wishes to build a boat he had best proceed to make as large a model in pasteboard as his materials admit, and to cut the planks to scale, according to the pattern of his model. The grace of the boat depends on the cut of its planks, just as much as the elegance of a dress does on that of its cloth. These three-plank canoes are in frequent use in Norway. Bark may be used instead of planks. If the canoe be built of five planks instead of three, a second narrow side-plank being added above each gunwale, the section of the canoe is decidedly improved.|$|E
60|$|As a {{means of}} getting over the {{difficulty}} of procuring really representative faces, I contrived the method of composite portraiture, which has been explained of late on many occasions, and of which a full account will be found in Appendix A. The principle on which the composites are made will best be understood by a description of my earlier and now discarded method; it was this--(1) I collected photographic portraits of different persons, {{all of whom had}} been photographed in the same aspect (say full face), and under the same conditions of light and shade (say with the light coming from the right side). (2) I reduced their portraits photographically to the same size, being guided as to scale by the distance between any two convenient points of reference in the features; for example, by the vertical distance between two parallel lines, one of which passed through the middle of the pupils of the eyes and the other between the lips. (3) I superimposed the portraits like the successive leaves of a book, so that the features of each portrait lay as exactly as the case admitted, in front of those of the one behind it, eye in front of eye and mouth in front of mouth. This I did by holding them successively to the light and adjusting them, then by fastening each to the preceding one with a strip of <b>gummed</b> <b>paper</b> along one of the edges. Thus I obtained a book, each page of which contained a separate portrait, and all the portraits lay exactly in front of one another. (4) I fastened the book against the wall {{in such a way that}} I could turn over the pages in succession, leaving in turn each portrait flat and fully exposed. (5) I focused my camera on the book fixed it firmly, and put a sensitive plate inside it. (6) I began photographing, taking one page after the other in succession without moving the camera, but putting on the cap whilst I was turning over the pages, so that an image of each of the portraits in succession was thrown on the same part of the sensitised plate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dialogue {{systems for}} {{spatially}} situated tasks {{need to provide}} referential descriptions of spatially located objects and understand such descriptions from users.

The aim is to explore the relation between specific semantic configurations and the dialogically and situationally embedded linguistic forms employed. Specifically, we first extracted different types of localization utterances from the corpus and then paired these with semantic categories provided by the linguistically motivated spatial ontology <b>GUM.</b> The <b>paper</b> concludes with a discussion of the characteristics of different types of localization expressions on the basis of spatial concepts and descriptions employed. ...|$|R

5000|$|Nashua {{began as}} a <b>gummed</b> <b>paper</b> {{manufacturer}} in Rockport, Massachusetts. In 1898 the company folded. The owner, Charles H. Crowell, was not only an inventor, {{but he was also}} a farsighted entrepreneur. He sold his crumbling company to Carter, Rice & Company of Boston, who kept Crowell on as manager of their new division, now renamed to Winthrop Manufacturing Company. A fire destroyed the factory in February, 1904, which had in the meantime moved to south Boston. The search for a new locale led owners Carter and Rice to Nashua, New Hampshire, where they found the heavily in debt Nashua Card and Glazed Paper Company, which had been founded in 1849 as a manufacturer of cardboard and glazed paper. During the California Gold Rush Nashua made playing cards for miners and became known as a result as the Card Shop. This name stuck with the company for almost 100 years, well into the 1950s. The owners of Nashua were happy to sell their factory to Carter and Rice for $74,000, plus mortgage. At that moment, 1904, the present day Nashua Corporation was founded. In April, 1904 the wholly owned subsidiary was incorporated. It became known as the Nashua Card, Gummed and Coated Paper Company. The new company brought together the capabilities of both companies, continuing to manufacture the products of Carter, Rice & Company, namely gummed flats, <b>gummed</b> <b>paper,</b> and sock linings, they added the products of the previous company, that is, glazed paper, cardboard, and [...] "surface coated" [...] paper.|$|E

This machine printed received messages directly on to <b>gummed</b> <b>paper</b> tape {{at a rate of}} 65 words per minute. Creed created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the Daily Mail for daily transmission of the newspaper contents. The Creed Model 7 page printing teleprinter was introduced in 1931 and was used for the inland Telex service. It worked at a speed of 50 baud, about 66 words a minute, using a code based on the Murray code.|$|E

The Restatement of Contracts (Second) notes that Impressions {{directly on the}} paper were recognized early and are still common for notarial and corporate seals, and <b>gummed</b> <b>paper</b> wafers have been widely used. In the absence of statute, decisions have divided {{on the effectiveness of}} the written or printed word 'seal', the printed initials 'L.S.' ..., a scrawl made with a pen (often called a 'scroll') and a recital of sealing. The relaxation of the definition of a seal was generally contemporaneous with reduced distinctions given to sealed contracts.

It has been noted that [...] "about two-thirds of the US states have now adopted statutory provisions depriving the seal of its binding effect," [...] although several important jurisdictions, such as New Jersey and Wisconsin, have retained the concept. Schnell v. Nell (1861), which is widely cited as an example of nominal consideration, involved a sealed contract.

40|$|In India {{a mixture}} of trees and grass {{is proving to be}} an {{effective}} way to make saline soils productive. If the right species are grown useful quantities of firewood and forage can be produced. There are more than 900 million hectares of land around the world whose production is affected by salt or high alkalinity. Most of this land is abandoned and produces nothing. For the last ten years however, researchers at the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute of India have been looking at agroforestry as a system that could make these areas productive. Since 1984 they have been running a trial with trees (Prosopis juliflora) interplanted with Karnal grass (Leptochloa fusca). Over a four-year period the grass was cut 15 times and yielded over 46 tonnes of forage per hectare. The Prosopis yielded nearly 8 tonnes of firewood over the same period. At the end of four years the grass was roughed under and replaced by less salt-tolerant but more palatable fodder crops such as Trifolium and Medicago. Yields of these proved {{to be as good as}} when they are grown on normal soils. At the beginning of the trials the pH of the soil was 10. 3 but at the end of the four year period it had dropped to 9. 4. Central Soil Salinity Research Institute Karnal Haryana 132001, INDIA Scientists in Australia who have also been testing tree species that will tolerate saline or waterlogged conditions have collected red river <b>gums,</b> <b>paper</b> barks and she oaks that already grow under these conditions in Australia.
