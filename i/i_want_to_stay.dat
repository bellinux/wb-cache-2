It's not special any more. I think the Champions' League is just a starter for {{what they want to do}} in the future, create a European League." [...] Overmars' exposure to European football had prompted him to be a sought-after player in England. He knew of Arsenal's interest, but was puzzled as to why a move [...] "didn't work out." [...] In the summer of 1995, he was linked with a move to Manchester United, but said, [...] "No thanks <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with Ajax for two more seasons." ...|$|E

I don't want to be involved with anything or condone any school of thought that at some point and in some way causes the death of innocent people, or tragedies where initial fantastic ideas [...] distorted.

Everything from that point on in terms of wars and fighting over land and territories and religious things, none of that was even included in anything he said. His message was pretty simple, be really nice to each other and everything will be okay." ...|$|E
