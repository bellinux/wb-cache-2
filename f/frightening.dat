5|$|An eclipse is {{a natural}} phenomenon. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens.

5|$|Kafka {{finished}} {{none of his}} full-length {{novels and}} burned around 90 percent of his work, much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts. In his early years as a writer, he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described {{in a letter to}} Bauer as <b>frightening,</b> and whom he considered closer than his own family.|$|E

5|$|Despite these <b>frightening</b> {{character}} traits, however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} an able, even an ideal, king. Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected. He met contemporary expectations of kingship {{in his role}} as an able, determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals. In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs began {{appearing}} in films {{soon after the}} introduction of cinema, the first being the good-natured animated Gertie the Dinosaur in 1914. However, lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced by monsters as moviemakers recognized the potential of huge <b>frightening</b> monsters. D. W. Griffith in 1914's Brute Force provided the first example of a threatening cinematic dinosaur, a Ceratosaurus who menaced cavemen. This film enshrined the fiction that dinosaurs and early humans lived together, {{and set up the}} cliché that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked anything that moved.|$|E
5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward <b>frightening,</b> particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the <b>frightening</b> atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E

5|$|Kids Can Say No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being <b>frightening</b> to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E
5|$|Scholar M. Daphne Kutzer {{points out}} that Mr. McGregor's role is larger in The Flopsy Bunnies than in the two {{previous}} rabbit books, but he inspires less fear in The Flopsy Bunnies than in Peter Rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist is diminished when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes. Nonetheless, for young readers, {{he is still a}} <b>frightening</b> figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies whose parents have failed to adequately protect them.|$|E

5|$|The Hickmans {{began work}} on Ravenloft in the late 1970s, intent on {{creating}} a <b>frightening</b> portrait of a vampire in a setting that combined Gothic horror with the D game system. They play-tested the adventure {{with a group of}} players each Halloween for five years before it was published. Strahd has since appeared in a number of D accessories and novels. The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations, including a campaign setting of the same name and a sequel. In 1999, on the 25th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons, two commemorative versions of Ravenloft were released.|$|E

The story was adapted for the 1969 Belvision film, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|The textual {{description}} of Matrikas is generally awesome, <b>frightening</b> and ferocious.

They are described as living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well as beautiful. But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers.
