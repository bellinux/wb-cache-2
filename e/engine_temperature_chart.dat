40|$|Reducing fuel {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the main aims when developing new trucks at Scania. For instance, there are a lot of new EU regulations on what emission levels are allowed. Also, having a low {{fuel consumption}} gives Scania an edge over their competitors. This master thesis will investigate one possible way of reducing the fuel consumption in a truck. The aim is to allow a higher <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> which gives a higher oil temperature causing less friction in the engine. Thus leading to a more ecient engine and reduced fuel consumption. This needs to be done without risking that the engine overheats. The method used to achieve this is a controllable thermostat which regulates the <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> with respect to dierent driving scenarios. In this work a control strategy for a controllable thermostat is produced with help of a Simulik environment where it's tested. A controllable thermostat consisting of a three way valve and an actuator is then installed in a truck and tested on roads. The tests in the truck shows that the controllable thermostat can eciently regulate the <b>engine</b> <b>temperature</b> to dierent reference temperatures and results from simulations showed that a fuel reduction is possible...|$|R
