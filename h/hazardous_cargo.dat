5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a <b>hazardous</b> <b>cargo</b> shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E

40|$|The {{transportation}} of hazardous materials keeps increasing across the United States {{due to the}} growing consumption of goods and rising need for manufactured materials. Furthermore, concerns are mounting over the safe surface {{transportation of}} hazardous materials. Highways and rails {{are the most common}} modes of transport for hazardous materials, although the risk posed from highway transport of hazardous materials may be higher {{due to the fact that}} highways are public while rails are mostly private. The majority of <b>hazardous</b> material <b>cargo</b> is carried on the highway network by trucks. Due to possible adverse effects on human and animal populations in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials, there is a need for the development of a highway route risk assessment tool that precisely represents transportation risks associated with <b>hazardous</b> <b>cargos</b> and to build a framework for designating a set of risky routes based on different factors. The research presented in this thesis explains a methodology to analyze the spatial patterns of truck accident data, discern potentially risky routes of truck traffic carrying hazardous materials, and estimate the impact area of an identified risky route by quantifying the human population affected in that area. Lancaster County in Nebraska was used as the study area and the hazardous material exposure from a theoretical truck-involved accident was estimated. It was concluded that the developed procedures successfully identified vulnerable areas in terms of hazardous material transport and estimated the affected areas and human population.

40|$|Truck {{rollover}} is {{a serious}} highway safety problem, with consequences that make the occurrences important despite their relative infrequency. Truck accidents on urban freeways occur more frequently at interchange off-ramps that at any other location, accounting for about 5 % of fatal truck accidents, according to accident statistics summarized in a study performed by Bellomo-McGee, Inc., for FHWA. Severe traffic disruption often results from truck rollover, and the severity of incidents can be sorely multiplied {{by the type of}} cargo the truck is hauling. Some <b>hazardous</b> <b>cargos</b> have the potential to cause true disaster is they are spilled as a result of truck rollover. Because of the severity of consequences of truck rollover accidents, it is important to seek ways to avoid such accidents. In the near-term future, the most likely means to prevent such rollover accidents is a condition responsive system that can warn truck drivers of impending rollover in time for them to take corrective actions...|$|R

40|$|When a ship {{gets into}} difficulties, {{one of the}} main options of an owner or master is to seek to put into {{sheltered}} waters where the difficulties can be remedied or minimised before proceeding on the voyage. This place is referred to as a ‘Place of Refuge’. Since 1999, there have been three major incidents involving ships, laden with crude oil and other <b>hazardous</b> <b>cargoes,</b> requesting and being refused access to places of refuge. In two of these cases, involving the Erika and the Prestige, the ships subsequently sank and caused severe pollution damage. In the third, involving the Castor, a disaster was narrowly avoided. The primary aims of this thesis are to address the issues that arose from the three incidents, to analyse the two proposals to deal with these issues, namely, voluntary Guidelines issued by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the proposal by the Comite Maritime International (CMI) for a discrete convention on places of refuge and assess their adequacy to deal with future incidents. In doing so, the thesis assesses {{the manner in which the}} problem of places of refuge is treated, first, under international law; second, on the international level, by international bodies such as IMO, CMI and shipping industry bodies; third, at the national level, by Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom; and fourth, at the regional level, by the European Union and regional arrangements for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Any proposal for reform in the area of places of refuge must inevitably encounter and attempt to balance two firmly entrenched and largely incompatible positions. Shipping interests involved in the success of the marine adventure have a strong interest in preserving the vessel through timely intervention in a place of refuge. Coastal States have an equally strong interest in preserving their national waters and territory from pollution damage and their populations from danger from <b>hazardous</b> <b>cargoes.</b> To date, the task of trying to balance these varying interests, either through existing laws and institutions or through the solutions proposed by the IMO and CMI, has proved to be difficult. Additionally, there are a number of factors which could influence the way in which coastal States respond to requests for access. These include the age and condition of the world fleet; the failure of flag State control, port State control and classification societies to detect substandard shipping; and the failure of current international conventions to cover all aspects of possible damage to places of refuge. The conclusion of the thesis is that there is, currently, no complete answer to the problem of places of refuge since the necessary balance of interests is absent in the current proposed solutions. This balance must be found and factors influencing the decision of coastal States to grant access must be addressed. The problem of places of refuge is likely to persist until this occurs...|$|R

40|$|Whenever a major {{accident}} occurs to a ship – whether a fire or an explosion on {{board of the}} ship, or a collision with another ship, or the ship running aground or sinking and becoming a wreck – {{it is likely that}} this casualty will result in considerable physical damage to the ship and its cargo, and in some cases also in loss of life or personal injury to crew members and passengers aboard the ship. Obviously this may have huge financial implications for parties interested in ship and cargo and for crew members, passengers and their relatives. However, a maritime casualty not only affects parties involved in the ship's operation but also third parties. Depending on the circumstances of the incident {{and the nature of the}} resulting damage, (many) third parties from various countries are likely to suffer losses as well. A few examples may help to draw the picture. States may be affected, e. g. if wreck removal and clean-up operations become necessary, but also the financial interests and livelihoods of private individuals and businesses, such as local hotels and restaurants who lose earnings from tourists when the coast line becomes covered by a thick layer of crude oil or fisheries who temporarily or permanently lose access to their fishing grounds. Indirectly, the financial interests of many more parties will be affected by the disaster as its consequences ripple on through the local and national economy. This group includes the sub-buyers and final users of the goods as well as underwriters, whether Hull and Machinery (H&M) underwriters or Protection & Indemnity (P&I) insurers of the ship or marine cargo underwriters. Besides the multitude of interests likely to be affected by a maritime casualty involving a ship, there is also a potential for exceptional financial losses resulting from it. It was reported in 2008 that the costs of clean-up operations in Alaska following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 had reached the figure of US$ 3, 5 billion and still counting. But not only oil tankers and ships carrying other <b>hazardous</b> <b>cargoes</b> are capable of generating such enormous losses. Modern container vessels with over 12, 000 TEU capacity may easily have cargoes on board worth hundreds of millions of Euros, as is illustrated by the fires involving the m. v. “Hanjin Pennsylvania” in 2002 and the m. v. “Hyundai Fortune” in 2006, and the voluntary grounding of the “MSC Napoli” in 2007...|$|R
40|$|In April 2009, the Pulitzer {{committee}} awarded {{its public}} service prize to the Las Vegas Sun for {{its coverage of}} the high fatalities on Las Vegas Strip construction sites. The newspaper attributed failures in safety policy to 2 ̆ 2 the exponential growth in the Las Vegas market. 2 ̆ 2 In fact, since Las Vegas 2 ̆ 7 founding in 1905, rapid development in the region has always strained occupational health standards. From transporting <b>hazardous</b> railroad <b>cargoes</b> to building Hoover Dam, chemical processing at Basic Magnesium, nuclear testing, and dense megaresort construction on the Strip, workers, residents, and tourists alike {{have been exposed to}} the threat of living in close proximity to large-scale industries. In the process, workplace injuries and fatalities became an accepted risk. The safety lapses produced several cataclysmic disasters- carbon monoxide poisoning at Hoover Dam, atmospheric nuclear testing and the Baneberry disaster at the Nevada Test Site, the MGM Grand and Hilton fires, and the Pacific Engineering Production Company of Nevada (PEPCON) explosion. After each disaster, public outcry prompted federal, state, and municipal governments to implement rigorous changes. But in the probusiness state of Nevada, laissez-faire always prevailed. Adherence to occupational health has therefore been historically boom and bust in southern Nevada. This study examines the region 2 ̆ 7 s most hazardous industries, emphasizing how the medical community interpreted and responded to the risks they posed.
