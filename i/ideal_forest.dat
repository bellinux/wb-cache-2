To improve our understanding of in-canopy mixing, we use large-eddy simulation to study the effect of scalar source/sink distributions on scalar concentration moments, fluxes, and correlation coefficients within and above an <b>ideal</b> <b>forest</b> canopy. Scalars are emitted from: (1) the ground, (2) the canopy, and (3) both {{the ground and the}} canopy; a scalar is also deposited onto the canopy. All scalar concentration moments, fluxes, and correlation coefficients are affected by the source location/distribution, as is the scalar segregation intensity. We conclude that vertical source/sink distribution has a profound impact on scalar concentration profiles, fluxes, correlation coefficient, and scalar segregation...|$|E
40|$|Waveform LiDAR {{systems is}} widely used in several fields such as terrain survey, {{disaster}} monitoring and forest monitoring. Especially, in forest research, using an echo signal is expected for understanding structural characteristics of the forest. However, an echo signal highly depends on the sensor configuration, the footprint size, the canopy structure, and terrain condition. Therefore, {{it is not easy}} to understand the forest attributes from the echo signal. In this paper, we describe the development and application of model which to simulate laser intersections within <b>ideal</b> <b>forest</b> environments and to visualize intersections. The developed model has three components. The first component was a creation of the forest environment as full polygon in 3 DCG software. Characteristics of the forest was decided by individual trees which were generated by the plant growth model using species and planting years as the initial parameter. The second component was a simulation using a ray tracing to calculate intersections between the forest object and the modelled laser beam. In this study, a laser beam with a specific footprint and a pulse width was defined by spatiotemporal features. In point of view of spatial feature, numerous sub laser beams were generated within a specific footprint to make the laser beam hit the target uniformly. Each sub laser beam had the intensity which was calculated by both the distance from the center of laser beam and the TEM 00. On the other hand, in point of view of time feature, each sub laser beam was defined as several particles based on the sampling rate. Each particle had the intensity which was calculated by the pulse width and the sampling rate. The third component was a creation of an echo signal of a specific footprint using the calculated intersections and its intensity, reflectance of target at intersections and sampling rate. Moreover, the developed model had a view function that was able to show the calculated intersections on the surface of target object. As results of simulation of <b>ideal</b> <b>forest</b> environment scenarios, the developed model demonstrated that the model generated the echo signal of different environments well and the viewer function helped to understand the interactions between sub laser beams and target objects...|$|E

Highly multiplexed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays are increasingly used to study genetic variation in living organisms and for practical applications in plant and animal breeding and genetic resource conservation. We developed a 9 k Illumina Infinium SNP array and genotyped maritime pine trees from (i) a three-generation inbred (F 2) pedigree, (ii) the French breeding population and (iii) natural populations from Portugal and the French Atlantic coast. A {{large proportion of the}} exploitable SNPs (2052 / 8410, i. e. 24. 4 %) segregated in the mapping population and could be mapped, providing the densest ever gene-based linkage map for this species. Based on 5016 SNPs, natural and breeding populations from the French gene pool exhibited similar level of genetic diversity. Population genetics and structure analyses based on 3981 SNP markers common to the Portuguese and French gene pools revealed high levels of differentiation, leading to the identification of a set of highly differentiated SNPs {{that could be used for}} seed provenance certification. Finally, we discuss how the validated SNPs could facilitate the identification of ecologically and economically relevant genes in this species, improving our understanding of the demography and selective forces shaping its natural genetic diversity, and providing support for new breeding strategies.

40|$|The {{choice between}} {{different}} forest management practices {{is a crucial}} step in short, medium, and long-term decision making in forestry and when setting up measures to support a regional or national forest policy. Some conditions such as biogeographically determined site factors, exposure to major disturbances, and societal demands are predetermined, whereas operational processes such as species selection, site preparation, planting, tending, or thinning can be altered by management. In principle, {{the concept of a}} forest management approach provides a framework for decision making, including a range of silvicultural operations that influence the development of a stand or group of trees over time. These operations vary among silvicultural systems and can be formulated as a set of basic principles. Consequently, forest management approaches are essentially defined by coherent sets of forest operation processes at a stand level. Five <b>ideal</b> <b>forest</b> management approaches (FMAs) representing a gradient of management intensity are described using specific sets of basic principles that enable comparison across European forests. Each approach is illustrated by a regional European case study. The observed regional variations resulting from changing species composition, stand density, age structure, stand edges, and site conditions can be interpreted using the FMA framework. Despite being arranged along an intensity gradient, the forest management approaches are not considered to be mutually exclusive, as the range of options allows for greater freedom in selecting potential silvicultural operations. As derived goods and services are clearly affected, the five forest management approaches have implications for sustainability. Thus, management objectives can influence the balance between the economic, ecological, and social dimensions of sustainability. The utility of this framework is further demonstrated through the different contributions to this special issue...|$|E
40|$|Deforestation in the North {{western part}} of Pakistan is a long {{standing}} problem. The Forestry Department, as formal managers of the forest resources, has been undergoing a long reform process aimed at improving its performance. This reform process has not resulted in less deforestation. From the policy perspective this has been leading to stated intentions to further reform the Forestry Department, {{the question is whether}} organizational reform is the answer. We think there are more limiting bottlenecks to sustainable forest management in Pakistan. De facto property rights are not as simple as denoted by statutory law. In this article we explore the mechanisms behind the deforestation and try to uncover mechanisms to reverse the process. Although our conclusions are not very optimistic, we provide a framework for determining the bottlenecks in the management of common resources from the perspective of institutions. We show that in circumstances where institutional change is necessary we are faced with a trade-off between the transaction costs related to the enforcement of “improved” institutional arrangements and the transaction costs improving enforceable institutional arrangements. Incurring these transaction costs only makes sense if the benefits from improved institutional arrangements outweigh them and the transition costs. When we relate this dilemma to the management regime of the forest in North west Pakistan, we identify at the one end of the spectrum the <b>ideal</b> <b>forest</b> management system; at the other end we see the spontaneous evolution of self organization.

The paper first describes the early development of fitness running in Sweden, which was facilitated by the establishment of illuminated tracks, locker rooms, parking spaces, etc., in forests and parks, investments which still affect where and how running is performed. The location of these facilities {{can be taken to}} reveal the importance of certain landscape ideals within planning, in particular the idea of the forest as the natural place to run.

40|$|Summary: Sites in {{four areas}} of Canterbury, New Zealand were {{examined}} {{to determine the}} principal factors influencing wind damage, and study sites at two areas were used to investigate forest age-class structure and stand dynamics. At all sites large-scale topographic features funnelled storm winds to produce recurrent damage, and smaller-scale topographic features determined precise points affected by winthrow. Lee slopes provide shelter to susceptible sites during normal weather conditions and therefore permit better stand growth, but stand damage increases in storms. Stands on exposed windward slopes form a wind-shaped canopy which is constrained by stem breakage during minor storms. Damage occurs in stands over a critical height of about 18 m and where stem diameter is large. Winddamaged forests have restricted age-distribution {{compared with those of}} partially damaged and vulnerable forests. Wind damage is little cause for concern as it must be viewed in a framework of short-term forest stability.
