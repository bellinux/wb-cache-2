25|$|In {{the later}} Legend of Atrahasis, Enlil, {{the king of}} the gods, sets out to {{eliminate}} humanity, whose noise <b>is</b> <b>disturbing</b> his rest. He successively sends drought, famine and plague to eliminate humanity, but Enki thwarts his half-brother's plans by teaching Atrahasis how to counter these threats. Each time, Atrahasis asks the population to abandon worship of all gods, except the one responsible for the calamity, and this seems to shame them into relenting. Humans, however, proliferate a fourth time. Enraged, Enlil convenes a Council of Deities and gets them to promise not to tell humankind that he plans their total annihilation. Enki does not tell Atrahasis directly, but speaks to him in secret via a reed wall. He instructs Atrahasis to build a boat in order to rescue his family and other living creatures from the coming deluge. After the seven-day Deluge, the flood hero frees a swallow, a raven and a dove in an effort to find if the flood waters have receded. Upon landing, a sacrifice is made to the gods. Enlil is angry his will has been thwarted yet again, and Enki is named as the culprit. Enki explains that Enlil is unfair to punish the guiltless, and the gods institute measures to ensure that humanity does not become too populous in the future. This {{is one of the oldest}} of the surviving Middle Eastern Deluge myths.|$|E

500|$|In the game's fourth mission, [...] "No Russian", {{the player}} {{controls}} an undercover CIA operative, Joseph Allen, who participates {{in a mass}} shooting at a Moscow airport to gain the trust of a Russian terrorist group. It begins with the player exiting from an elevator with four other gunmen, who proceed to open fire on {{a large group of}} civilians at a security checkpoint. The player then accompanies the gunmen as they assault the airport, killing any civilians. The level is very graphic, as screams can be heard throughout, and the injured crawl away leaving blood trails. However, the player is never forced to partake in the massacre, and may instead let their comrades kill the civilians. The only legitimate targets are lightly armed security personnel within the airport terminal, and a group of more heavily armed FSB members who are deployed on the tarmac. If the player does not feel comfortable during the level, they are allowed to skip to the next level with no penalties. A warning before the campaign also notifies players that there <b>is</b> <b>disturbing</b> material, at which point they can either elect {{to go ahead with the}} mission anyway or skip it.|$|E

The nationwide release date was pushed back to January 11, 2013, moving {{it out of the}} crowded Christmas period and closer to the Academy Awards. After the film's limited release, given the controversy related to the film's depiction of torture and its role in gaining critical information, The New York Times columnist Frank Bruni concluded that the film is [...] "a far, far cry from the rousing piece of pro-Obama propaganda that some conservatives feared it would be". Two months later, the paper's columnist Roger Cohen wrote that the film was [...] "a courageous work that <b>is</b> <b>disturbing</b> in the way that art should be". Cohen disagreed with Steve Coll's critique of the screenwriter's stated effort not to [...] "play fast and loose with history", writing that [...] "Boal has honored those words". Cohen ended with a note about a Timothy Garton Ash analysis of George Orwell mixing fact and [...] "invented" [...] stories in Down and Out in Paris and London – as further support for Boal's method.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 2012, a {{group of}} alumni and supporters, {{under the name of}} Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship, {{released}} a review of the Freeh Report that was critical of the Freeh Group's investigation and conclusions. On February 10, 2013 a report commissioned by the Paterno family was released by Dick Thornburgh, former United States Attorney General and former Governor of Pennsylvania, maintaining that the Freeh report was [...] "seriously flawed, both with respect to the process of [...] investigation and its findings related to Mr. Paterno". In response, Freeh called the Paterno family's report [...] "self-serving" [...] and said that it did not change the facts and findings of his initial investigation. On June 23, 2014, at Jerry Sandusky's pension forfeiture appeal, hearing arbiter Michael Bangs ruled Sandusky's pension should be reinstated and criticized the Freeh Report stating it [...] "was based on significant hearsay and was mostly ruled inadmissible (for the proceedings), (but) was admitted in part to show it had found Sandusky had received 71 separate payments from Penn State between 2000 and 2008". Later in a footnote Bangs states [...] "The terrifically significant disparity between the finding in the Freeh report and the actual truth <b>is</b> <b>disturbing.</b> While the Freeh report found that Penn State had made 71 separate payments to (Sandusky) between 2000-2008, they were off by almost 85 percent, as the correct number was six separate payments". Bangs {{goes on to say that}} the error [...] "calls into question the accuracy and veracity of the entire report".|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 78 we {{find out}} about a rival who's male and a poet and whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86. [...] The rivalry between the poets {{may appear to be}} literary, but, {{according}} to the critic Joseph Pequigney, it is in reality a sexual rivalry. This <b>is</b> <b>disturbing</b> because the subject in the sonnet is one that the persona has found erotically profitable, in part because the other poet may be superior in learning and style. Shakespeare is not concerned with poetic triumph he is vying only for the prize of a fair friend. The combat between the two rivals is indirect and the speaker never addresses his literary adversary and only mentions his beloved. It is the body language of Sonnet 78 (the first in the series) 79, 80 and 84 that serves to convert the topic of letters into that of eroticism. Shakespeare is known for his usage of puns and double meaning on words. So it isn't surprising that he uses wordplay in the first quatrain on [...] "pen" [...] for the male appendage, or, as a Stein-cum-Joyce might say, [...] "a pen is a penis a pen," [...] is fully utilized. The poet remarks at 78.4, [...] "every alien pen hath got my use," [...] where [...] "alien" [...] = 'of a stranger' and [...] "use," [...] besides 'literary practice,' can = 'carnal enjoyment.' These sexual allusions are made in passing; they are overtones, restricted to a line or two.|$|E
