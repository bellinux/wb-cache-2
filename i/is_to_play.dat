5|$|At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to put on}} a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns the members of his team various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the Sabre Pyramid more appealing, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is to give a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the part of a sexual predator— much to Packer's chagrin. As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim— who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down— leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice president by Nellie.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, in Week 17 {{against the}} Minnesota Vikings, Urlacher sprained his MCL when {{teammate}} Major Wright and Vikings receiver Percy Harvin landed {{on him with}} 5:15 left in the game. Luckily for him, there was no ACL damage, according to his MRI. Urlacher was eventually named to the Pro Bowl, but didn't play due to the injury against Minnesota. Though he participated in the team's first four training camp practices, he hadn't participated in any other practices since July 31. On August 14, 2012, Urlacher had an arthroscopic debridement procedure on his left knee, and has stated that his goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the 2012 season opener. He eventually practiced on September 3, and played against the Colts in the season opener, though he sat out the second half.|$|E
5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident {{in his ability to}} escape in 13rounds than in his ability to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another workaround <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E

They then <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a prepared etude and sightreading piece which consists of the rest of their score. Harp players also <b>are</b> only able <b>to</b> audition for the orchestra, and <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a technical etude (40% of score); a prepared piece (40% of score); and sightreading (20%) of score.|$|R

5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E
25|$|Consider a Stackelberg game (i.e. {{one which}} {{fulfills}} the requirements described above for sustaining a Stackelberg equilibrium) in which, for some reason, the leader believes that whatever action it takes, the follower will choose a Cournot quantity (perhaps the leader {{believes that the}} follower is irrational). If the leader played a Stackelberg action, (it believes) that the follower will play Cournot. Hence it is non-optimal for the leader to play Stackelberg. In fact, its best response (by the definition of Cournot equilibrium) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Cournot quantity. Once it has done this, the best response of the follower <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Cournot.|$|E

25|$|After {{retiring}} from cricket in 1998 Germon <b>was</b> persuaded <b>to</b> <b>play</b> cricket again by his former Canterbury coach Denis Aberhart and former New Zealand coach Glenn Turner <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for Otago.

25|$|Due to the {{excessive}} {{length of the}} official version, in international {{events such as the}} Olympic Games, professional soccer games, and the Rugby World Cup, only the instrumental introduction (which lasts 1 minute 6 seconds) is played. Another variation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the musical break that leads into the chorus, the chorus itself, and the coda. Although traditional, these arrangements are not recognized by Argentine law.|$|E
25|$|Ties are {{relatively}} rare in baseball, since the practice {{dating back to}} the earliest days of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> extra innings until one side has the lead after an equal number of innings played. An exception is spring training, where a game can be called a tie upon agreement by both teams, usually in a case where one or both teams have used all available pitchers. Games can be called after nine innings, or after any extra inning, and typically do not last more than 11 innings.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this very}} fact (that the {{follower}} would play non-Stackelberg if the leader were to play Stackelberg) means that this profile {{is not a}} Nash equilibrium of the subgame starting when the leader has already played Stackelberg (a subgame off the equilibrium path). If the leader has already played Stackelberg, the best response of the follower <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Stackelberg (and therefore {{it is the only}} action that yields a Nash equilibrium in this subgame). Hence the strategy profile - which is Cournot - is not subgame perfect.|$|E

25|$|The University's Royal Academic Orchestra {{was founded}} in 1627. Its main purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> at {{academic}} ceremonies, but holds concerts on other occasions as well. Its leader has the title of director musices. The position has been held by composers such as Wilhelm Stenhammar, Hugo Alfvén and Lars-Erik Larsson. Affiliated with the University are three choirs, the mixed Uppsala University Choir (Allmänna Sången), founded in 1830, the male choir Orphei Drängar, founded in 1853, and the Academy Chamber Choir of Uppsala, founded in 1957. A number of other choirs and orchestras are affiliated with the nations.|$|E
25|$|Tennis is {{a racket}} sport {{that can be}} played {{individually}} against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the ball {{in such a way}} that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.|$|E
25|$|Two brothers, Joe and Brian Hackett, own a small airline {{company on}} Nantucket Island. Their {{childhood}} friend, Helen, runs the diner inside the airport. She {{has always been}} in love with Joe, the older brother. Helen's dream <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the cello in an orchestra and attends auditions when not sandwich-making. Roy Biggins runs another, larger airline. Lowell Mather is the airport mechanic, who maintains the planes for both Aeromass and Sandpiper as the airport is very small. They are joined by an Italian immigrant, Antonio, who operates a taxi service. Fay runs the ticket counter. Members of the cast of Cheers visit occasionally as the setting of the show is close to Boston.|$|E

25|$|The World Rainforest Movement {{has argued}} that poor {{developing}} countries could be pressured to accept reforestation projects under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism in order to earn foreign exchange simply {{to pay off the}} interest on debt to the World Bank. Tensions also exist over forest management between the sovereignty claims of nations states, arguments about common heritage of mankind and the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities; the Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) arguing the anti-deforestation programs could merely allow financial benefits to flow to national treasuries, privilege would-be corporate forest degraders who manipulate the system by periodically threatening forests, rather than local communities who conserve them. The success of such projects will also depend on the accuracy of the baseline data and the number of countries involved. Further, {{it has been argued that}} if biosequestration <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a significant role in mitigating anthropogenic climate change then coordinated policies should set a goal of achieving global forest cover to its extent prior to the industrial revolution in the 1800s.|$|E
25|$|Although jazz is {{considered}} highly difficult to define, {{at least in}} part because it contains so many varied subgenres, improvisation is consistently regarded as being one of its key elements. The centrality of improvisation in jazz is attributed to influential earlier forms of music: the early blues, a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of the African-American slaves on plantations. These were commonly structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early blues was also highly improvisational. European classical music performance is evaluated by its fidelity to the musical score, with much less discretion over interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment: the classical performer's primary goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized as the product of group creativity, interaction, and collaboration, which places varying degrees of value on the contributions of the composer (if there is one) and performers. In jazz, the skilled performer will interpret a tune in very individual ways, never playing the same composition the same way twice; depending on the performer's mood and personal experience, interactions with other musicians, or even members of the audience, a jazz musician may alter melodies, harmonies or time signature at will.|$|E
25|$|Hagrid is {{introduced}} in the opening chapter of the first novel. Following the death of James and Lily Potter, Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with rescuing the infant Harry from his parents' house {{after they have been}} murdered by Lord Voldemort. When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about {{the fact that it was}} Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. Ten years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosopher’s Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find his bearings in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. Later in the book, a hooded person (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) gives him a dragon egg to elicit details about Fluffy. Hagrid lets slip to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the way to get past Fluffy <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> music, for which they use the flute Hagrid himself carved for Harry, which allows them to pursue the potential thief. The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Ron’s older brother, Charlie Weasley, works.|$|E

[...] Grzyb says that the same applies to Joseph's earlier Christmas Around the World CD, which he found even more interesting because of the use of other instrumental sounds.|$|E
