5000|$|Oh ho ho is {{the code}} name {{given by the}} Legitimate Kingdom for the pop idol and pilot of the Information Alliance's Heavy Object [...] "Rush", a second {{generation}} Object. Originally assigned to a joint operation in Oceania with the Kingdom's Object Baby Magnum, Oh ho ho prevented Milinda from providing backup to Qwenthur and Havia's mission under the orders of the joint task force commander Councillor <b>Flide.</b> They would cross paths again in Alaska in a battle between Rush and Baby Magnum, where Qwenthur confronts the pilot in her cockpit and finds out her true appearance is child-like due to genetic enhancements. After this confrontation {{she seems to have}} developed a crush on Qwethur. She even wanted him as her personal object maintainer.|$|E

All spoken-word recognition involves multiple concurrent activation of word candidates, with selection of the correct words achieved by a process of competition between them. L 2 listening involves more such activation than L 1 listening, and we report two studies illustrating this. First, in a lexical decision study, L 2 listeners accepted (but L 1 listeners did not accept) spoken non-words such as groof or <b>flide</b> as real English words. Second, a priming study demonstrated that the same spoken non-words made recognition of the real words groove, flight easier for L 2 (but not L 1) listeners, suggesting that, for the L 2 listeners only, these real words had been activated by the spoken non-word input. We propose that further understanding of the activation and competition process in L 2 lexical processing could lead to new understanding of L 2 listening difficulty...|$|E
