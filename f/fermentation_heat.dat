In addition, SOD 1 gene encoding Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, an important antioxidant enzyme, was required for tolerance to several stresses occurring during <b>fermentation,</b> including <b>heat,</b> ethanol, osmotic, and oxidative stresses (Auesukaree et al. 2009).

In the W 303 strain, the intracellular ROS levels were dramatically increased after being challenged with not only the oxidant H 2 O 2 but also ethanol, glucose, and sorbitol (Fig.  3 b), suggesting the effects of ethanol and hyperosmolarity on inducing endogenous oxidative stress. On the other hand, the intracellular ROS levels in the other strains, which exhibited higher growth rates than the W 303 under these stress conditions, were not significantly increased after treatments (Fig.  3 b).

50|$|A {{byproduct}} of the energy created during <b>fermentation</b> is <b>heat</b> which raises {{the temperature of the}} fermenting must as the yeast work. When temperatures near 104°F (40°C), activity slows and yeast start to die. If temperatures stay high and the yeast stop reproducing then the fermentation is at grave risk of getting stuck. Even if the must is cooled back down, fermentation will be very difficult to restart due to a chemical compound released by the dying yeast that serves as an inhibitor to the growth of future yeast cells in the batch. Modern winemaking equipment includes temperature control mechanisms such as stainless steel fermenting tanks with a cooling jacket to help regulate temperatures. Another potential cause is a combination of lack of oxygen and yeast nutrients found in the lipids suspended in grape solids. In the absence of oxygen, yeast will seek out the lipids in grape solid as a source of nutrients to sustain its activity. If the wine is lacking grape solids (such as if the wine's been clarified) then the yeast are at risk of starving and causing the fermentation to get stuck. This risk is lower for red wines which are often fermented with their skins in open air containers or oak wine barrels which provide plenty of oxygen and grape solids for the yeast to feed on.|$|R

Certain strains of the fungus {{can also be used to}} convert whey to ethyl acetate, an alternative fuel source. K. marxianus is also used to produce the industrial enzymes: inulinase, β-galactosidase, and pectinase. Due to the heat tolerance of K. marxianus, high <b>heat</b> <b>fermentations</b> are feasible, reducing the costs normally expended for cooling as well as the potential for contamination by other fungi or bacteria. In addition, fermentations at higher temperatures occur more rapidly, making production much more efficient. Due to the ability of K. marxianus to simultaneously ustilize lactose and glucose, the prevalence of K. marxianus in industrial settings is high as it decreases production time and increases productivity. Recent efforts have attempted to use K. marxianus in the production of food flavourings from waste products tomato and pepper pomaces as substrata.|$|R
40|$|Heat {{treatment}} {{is a well-known}} process in food preservation. It is made to avoid and to slow down food deterioration. The process was developed by Louise Pasteur French scientist to avoid late among others wine further <b>fermentation.</b> The different <b>heat</b> treatments influence the shelf life in food production. In our article we present the process of grape must fermentation, as grape must is the base material of wine production. The treatment of harvested fresh grape juice has a big influence on end product quality. It is our experiments we examined the same grape must with four different methods in closed and in open spaces to determine CO 2 concentration change. There are four different methods for treatment of grape juice: boiling, microwave treatment, treatment by water bath thermostat and a control without treatment. As {{a result of the}} comparison it can be stated that the heat treatment delays the start of fermentation, thereby increasing shelf life of grape must. However, {{no significant differences were found}} between two fermentation of heat-treated grape must by the microwave and water-bath thermostat. The different heat treatment of grape must base materials was done at the laboratory in Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of Szent István University. The origin of the table grapes used for the examination was Gödöllő-hillside. Normal 0 21 false false false HU X-NONE X-NONE <! [...] [endif] [...] ...|$|R
