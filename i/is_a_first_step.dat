If the European Chemical Agency assigns SVHC status, the presence of BPA in a product at a concentration above 0.1% must be disclosed to a purchaser (with different rules for consumer and business purchasers). In February 2016, France had announced that it intended to propose BPA as a candidate SVHC by 8 August 2016.|$|E

25|$|Nest {{activity}} is episodic and occurs in bursts rather than continuous activity throughout the day. Polistes instabilis spends {{roughly half of}} the daylight hours inactive and immobile. Periods of inactivity are broken when individuals initiate actions such as arriving, leaving, walking, antennating, gaster wagging, or fanning. These actions cause other workers to also begin working. 80% of {{activity is}} initiated by arriving or walking. Arriving triggers activity because when wasps arrive to the nest they bring materials to transfer to other workers. Walking <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> taken in assessing needs of the colony, which can then be communicated to others. Queens do not differ from other workers in the initiation of active periods.|$|E

2500|$|... "Is there life {{elsewhere}} in the universe?" [...] is one of humankind's most profound unanswered questions. A step {{in the attempt to}} answer this question is the search for planets outside the Solar System. ESO's observatories are equipped with an arsenal of instruments for finding, studying, and monitoring extrasolar planets. In 2004, the Very Large Telescope detected a faint glow from an apparent planet orbiting a star about 200 light-years from earth. A year later, this detection was confirmed as the first picture of an exoplanet ever recorded. Although the planet is large (five times more massive than Jupiter), this observation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> toward identifying the physical structure and chemical composition of exoplanets.|$|E

Not he, but another who will suit France better: [...] "Kur-Sachsen perhaps, the {{so-called}} King of Poland? Or say it were Karl Albert Kur-Baiern, the hereditary friend and dependent of France? We are not tied to a man: only, at any and at all rates, not Grand-Duke Franz." [...] This is the grand, essential and indispensable point, alpha and omega of points; very clear this one to Belleisle,--and towards this the first steps, if as yet only the first, are also clear to him. Namely that [...] "the 27th of February next",--which is the time set by Kur-Mainz and the native Officials for the actual meeting of their Reichstag to begin Election Business, will be too early a time; and must be got postponed. [Adelung, ii. 185 ("27th February-1st March, 1741, at Frankfurt-on-Mayn," [...] appointed by Kur-Mainz [...] "Arch-Chancellor of the REICH," [...] under date November 3d, 1740);--ib. 236 ("Delay {{for a month or}} two," [...] suggests Kur-Pfalz, on January 12th, seconded by others in the French interest);--upon which the appointment, after some arguing, collapsed into the vague, and there ensued delay enough; actual Election not till January 24th, 1742.] Postponed; which will be possible, perhaps for long; one knows not for how long: that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> definitely clear to Belleisle. Towards which, as preliminary to it and to all the others in a dimmer state, there is a second thing clear, and has even been officially settled (all but the day): That, in the mean while, and surely the sooner the better, he, Belleisle, Most Christian Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary to the Reichstag coming,--do, in his most dazzling and persuasive manner, make a Tour among German Courts. Let us visit, in our highest and yet in our softest splendor, the accessible German Courts, especially the likely or well-disposed: Mainz, Koln, Trier, these, the three called Spiritual, lie on our very route; then Pfalz, Baiern, Sachsen:--we will tour diligently up and down; try whether, by optic machinery and art-magic of the mind, one cannot bring them round.|$|E
