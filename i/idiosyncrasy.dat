40|$|International audienceAlthough {{speakers}} of one specific language {{share the same}} phoneme representations, their productions can differ. We propose to investigate {{the development of these}} differences in production, called <b>idiosyncrasies,</b> by using a Bayesian model of communication. Supposing that <b>idiosyncrasies</b> appear during the development of the motor system, we present two versions of the motor learning phase, both based on the guidance of an agent master: " a repetition model " where agents try to imitate the sounds produced by the master and " a communication model " where agents try to replicate the phonemes produced by the master. Our experimental results show that only the " communication model " provides production <b>idiosyncrasies,</b> suggesting that <b>idiosyncrasies</b> are a natural output of a motor learning process based on a communicative goal...|$|R
25|$|The Central Bank {{announced}} its intention {{for the new}} banknotes in December 1971 and Servicon, an Irish design company, was employed to design the notes of the denominations; £1, £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100.

25|$|The first miRNA was {{discovered}} in 1993 by a group led by Ambros and including Lee and Feinbaum; but additional insight into {{its mode of action}} required simultaneously published work by Ruvkun's team, including Wightman and Ha. These groups published back-to-back papers on the lin-4 gene, which was known to control the timing of C. elegans larval development by repressing the lin-14 gene. When Lee et al. isolated the lin-4 gene, they found that instead of producing an mRNA encoding a protein, it produced short non-coding RNAs, one of which was a ~22-nucleotide RNA that contained sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3' UTR of the lin-14 mRNA. This complementarity was proposed to inhibit the translation of the lin-14 mRNA into the LIN-14 protein. At the time, the lin-4 small RNA was thought to be a nematode <b>idiosyncrasy.</b>|$|E
25|$|For the slaves, the cabildo {{had many}} uses. They {{were able to}} collect money or pool {{resources}} to assist members in times of illness or death. Cabildos also had a religious purpose, they were the place where slaves could consult their deities and ancestors. For those slaves who clung to the religious traditions of Africa, a cabildo {{was one of the}} few means of succor at their disposal. The cabildo represented Africa in foreign territory that would help slaves keep alive their faith. Cabildos were institutions that made possible the conservation of the <b>idiosyncrasy,</b> religion and culture of the African nations in Cuba. The songs, dances, and drum rhythms that were played for African deities in a land that was so hostile to the Africans slaves were the mechanism by which slaves were able to keep alive their Africanness and resist Spanish cultural hegemony.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Forest {{reached their}} first FA Cup final under Clough against Tottenham Hotspur. With typical <b>idiosyncrasy,</b> Clough {{selected}} two players – Lee Glover and Ian Woan – {{with only a}} handful of league games behind them and left England international Steve Hodge on the substitutes' bench, preferring the young Roy Keane in the starting line up. After 90 minutes, with the score at 1–1, Clough did not go on to the pitch to encourage or advise his players before extra time, but remained on the bench. Tottenham won 2–1 with an own goal by Des Walker in extra time. Keane later claimed in his autobiography that he was injured and should not have taken part in the game. The FA Cup was to be the only major domestic trophy which Clough did not win. In 1992, Forest reached another League Cup final, but lost 1–0 to Manchester United, but they did win a second Full Members Cup (the last edition of the competition) that season.|$|E

His opinion is echoed by Houston Chronicle's Amy Biancolli who complained that [...] "the script is busy with so many supporting characters and plot detours that the series' charming <b>idiosyncrasy</b> is sometimes lost in the noise." [...] Jack Matthews of Daily News thought the film was too devoted to the [...] "quiet conversations" [...] of Peter and Mary Jane, but that fans would not be disappointed by the action. Finally, Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly felt that the director [...] "substituted scope and scale for the warmth and wit that made those two previous pictures so memorable."

40|$|We {{investigated}} the independent contribution of speech rate and speech rhythm to perceived foreign accent. To {{address this issue}} we used a resynthesis technique that allows neutralizing segmental and tonal <b>idiosyncrasies</b> between identical sentences produced by French learners of English at different proficiency levels and maintaining the <b>idiosyncrasies</b> pertaining to prosodic timing patterns. We created stimuli that (1) preserved the <b>idiosyncrasies</b> in speech rhythm while controlling for the differences in speech rate between the utterances; (2) preserved the <b>idiosyncrasies</b> in speech rate while controlling for the differences in speech rhythm between the utterances; and (3) preserved the <b>idiosyncrasies</b> both in speech rate and speech rhythm. All the stimuli were created in intoned (with imposed intonational contour) and flat (with monotonized, constant F 0) conditions. The original and the resynthesized sentences were rated by native speakers of English for degree of foreign accent. We found that both speech rate and speech rhythm influence the degree of perceived foreign accent, but the effect of speech rhythm is larger than that of speech rate. We also found that intonation enhances the perception of fine differences in rhythmic patterns but reduces the perceptual salience of fine differences in speech rate...|$|R

The soundtrack features fourteen songs, most of which appeared in various scenes in the film. Niamh Kavanagh performed as both a lead and backing vocalist in songs such as [...] "Destination Anywhere" [...] and [...] "Do Right Woman, Do Right Man". The soundtrack album was a commercial success, reaching the number one position of the New Zealand Albums Chart. The Commitments was present {{for a total of}} 76 weeks on the Billboard 200, and peaked at number 8 [...] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album [...] "a bit generic", while Robert Christgau called it [...] "a cross between The Big Chill and The Blues Brothers" [...] with performers who [...] "sacrifice <b>idiosyncrasy</b> for competence".|$|E
500|$|Tipping the Velvet was {{critically}} acclaimed upon its release and Waters' writing style highly praised. Harriet Malinowitz {{wrote that the}} story is an [...] "utterly captivating, high octane narrative" [...] and Mel Steel of The Independent wrote, [...] "Could this be a new genre? The bawdy lesbian picaresque novel? Whatever it is, take it with you. It's gorgeous." [...] Kirkus Reviews also praised it, writing [...] "Waters' debut offers terrific entertainment: swiftly paced, crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters", comparing the depiction of Nancy's parents to the fishing community in David Copperfield, and adding that it [...] "pulsat with highly charged (and explicitly presented) erotic heat". John Perry in The San Francisco Chronicle stated that it [...] "has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair. Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe, it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader marveling at the author's craftsmanship, <b>idiosyncrasy</b> and sheer effort." [...] Perry did acknowledge, however, that modern optimism was probably the impetus driving Waters' vision of a lesbian past.|$|E
500|$|Julie Barak {{emphasizes}} {{the significance of}} [...] "one other stylistic <b>idiosyncrasy</b> {{of the work that}} adds to the sophistication of [...] artistry" [...] as there is a marked transition from third to first person narration for each girl in the last section of the novel. Luis describes this shift as a pivotal moment after which the events assume a chronological order and time accelerates, illuminating life in such a manner that it suddenly makes sense. The manner in which Alvarez alters the narrative voice is a stylistic expression {{of the extent to which}} each one of the girls [...] "wants to be in control of her own version of her history... These first person narratives in the last section become, in effect, a defense offered by each girl in her own words, an explanation of who they have become in the present, of why they 'turned out' the way they have." [...] The transition of narrative voice [...] "changes the dynamic of the reader-character-author triad" [...] and allows for the reader, who has been kept at a distance by the third person narrator, to relive [...] "the memory with the character, closely connected to her, developing a strong empathy with a unified character".|$|E

500|$|The colt {{arrived at}} Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on April 28, 2014. He was {{flown in from}} California, his first time on a plane, and {{traveled}} quietly. Once the plane landed, however, his travel <b>idiosyncrasy</b> was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp; Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground-based transportation. [...] Upon arrival at Churchill Downs, the horses entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given a special saddle cloth to wear while exercising on the track, identifying them as Derby contenders and including their name. [...] The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical error, with California misspelled as [...] "Califorina". He wore it the first day and then the track management obtained one with the correct spelling. Critics commented that bringing the horse in late and not giving him a full workout on the track was a mistake, but Sherman's strategy was backed by Lukas. [...] In {{the days leading up}} to the race, California Chrome galloped on the track, was walked in the saddling paddock, and schooled at the starting gate. Willie Delgado later remarked that the horse did not particularly like that particular track, saying [...] "he never actually felt comfortable on it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. The NME {{listed the}} song as the [...] "Single of the Week" [...] on its release, with reviewer Johnny Cigarettes {{stating that the}} track was [...] "head and shoulders above anything released this or most other weeks". Cigarettes saw [...] "Northern Lites" [...] as indicative of the Super Furry Animals' [...] "genius <b>idiosyncrasy</b> and elegantly eccentric class" [...] and described the song as [...] "somewhere between a Mexican cocktail bar, a '60s surf party, a Vegas lounge show and a really good acid trip". Cigarettes compared the vocal harmonies on the track to those of The Beach Boys and stated that the song has a [...] "classic, Bacharach" [...] quality" [...] although he did criticise the indecipherable lyrics which he felt could prevent the record from [...] "its deserved 23-week residence at Number One". In a later review of Guerrilla, the NME described the song as a [...] "seamless fusion of tumbling xylophones and Caribbean brass". The magazine listed the track at number 3 in their single of the year list for 1999. [...] "Northern Lites" [...] was also awarded [...] "Single of the Week" [...] in the 15 May 1999 issue of the Melody Maker by guest reviewers Gay Dad, who described the song as [...] "twisted and psychedelic". Echoing the views of Johnny Cigarettes, Gay Dad likened the song {{to the work of}} Bacharach and Hal David and complained that they could not fully understand Rhys's lyrics, as his vocals were too low in the mix.|$|E
500|$|Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney {{states that}} estrangement from {{the self and}} others is the primary theme of the fourth season. To {{illustrate}} the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam {{was not the first}} re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. [...] "Some Assembly Required" [...] in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and [...] "Beauty and the Beasts" [...] in the third includes references to Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel Frankenstein (1818) tells his creator that he is the [...] "Adam of your labours". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to [...] "find the stillness" [...] in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's [...] "flawed but impressive performance" [...] includes Adam's interesting <b>idiosyncrasy</b> of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying. Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts [...] "to compensate for human vulnerability". The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.|$|E
