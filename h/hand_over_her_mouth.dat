5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl {{reported}} to police that a boy called John had assaulted her by putting his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and saying: [...] "What {{would you do}} if I killed you? I have done it before." [...] This incident was not connected to Straffen until later. Six weeks later, Straffen was found to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a girl with whom he had quarrelled. When arrested, Straffen was also under suspicion for burglary and in interview cheerfully confessed to it and many other incidents to which he had not been connected. He was remanded in custody, and the Medical Officer of Horfield prison examined him, certifying that he was mentally retarded. On 10 October, Straffen was committed to Hortham Colony in Bristol under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.|$|E
60|$|Patsy whistled, {{and then}} clapped her <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and looked grave.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} stood with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> pressed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{watching}} him.|$|R
60|$|He {{succeeded in}} getting one of his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and still keeping her clasped firmly with the other arm, began drawing her towards the door. But not even yet was she wholly overcome; all the power which had been in her imprisoned arms and hands {{appeared}} suddenly to have gone into the muscles of her jaws, {{and in a moment}} her sharp teeth had cut his hand to the bone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, hush, hush!" [...] said Rose, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> friend's <b>mouth.</b> [...] "Naughty one! you can bless me, if you will, {{only you}} are wayward." ...|$|R
60|$|The saleslady {{clapped her}} <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> {{and led the}} way to another model.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are no gentleman! Let me go!" [...] replied Nellie. Then she {{attempted}} to scream, but he promptly clapped his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E

500|$|In his defence, Tabak {{claimed that}} the killing had not been sexually motivated, and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed {{when he tried to}} kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a [...] "flirty comment" [...] and invited him to drink with her. He said that after she screamed he held his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and around <b>her</b> neck to silence her. He denied {{suggestions}} of a struggle, claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and [...] "... for about 20 seconds". He told the court that after dumping the body he was [...] "... in a state of panic".|$|R
60|$|Then {{she came}} to a wider path. She {{scarcely}} noted it and passed on. Then came a quick rustle--a swift shadow. Between two steps--as her heart leaped--violent arms swept her off the ground. A hard <b>hand</b> was clapped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She was being carried swiftly through the gloom.|$|R
6000|$|But {{fortunately}} at {{this juncture}} Miss Trevor was captured again, and Miss Thorn put her <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Heaven only knows what she would have said! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{good you}} are!" [...] cried Louise, in a {{grateful}} under-tone, {{as she came}} in. She kissed Grace, and choked down a cough with her <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you beast! Let me go!" [...] {{she screamed}} faintly. She {{was about to}} say more, but Yellow Elk clapped a dirty <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and silenced her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Save {{us, and we}} {{will pay}} you well," [...] added Dora, and then Baxter's not <b>over</b> cleanly <b>hand</b> was clapped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and she could say no more. Loring's hand was {{likewise}} placed over Nellie's mouth, and then the launch began to tow the rowboat back into midstream once more.|$|R
60|$|They hid in {{the shadow}} {{at the side of}} the house until the girl had turned the corner and was {{approaching}} the veranda, then they ran quickly forward and as she mounted the steps she was seized from behind and dragged backward. A <b>hand</b> was clapped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and a whispered threat warned her to silence.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, without warning, Swenson and Miller fell, {{pierced with}} savage spears, {{and at the}} same instant sinewy fingers gripped Barbara Harding, and a {{silencing}} <b>hand</b> was clapped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> There had been no sound above the muffled tread of the seamen. It had all been accomplished so quickly and so easily that the girl did not comprehend what had befallen her for several minutes.|$|R
60|$|On {{came the}} {{unconscious}} pair, until they almost trod on the prostrate men. Then, {{before they could}} imagine what had occurred, each found herself {{on the ground with}} a strong <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Kahn, who was nearest, {{clapped his}} <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and Laverick knocked him down. Instantly the pacific {{atmosphere}} {{of the room was}} changed. Lassen and Morrison closed swiftly upon Laverick from different sides. Streuss covered him with the shining barrel of a revolver.|$|E
60|$|Henry {{broke off}} short, and {{thinking}} his companion {{was about to}} speak, clapped his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Through {{the stillness of the}} forest he had caught sounds that could mean but one thing--the approach of several men. In a moment more he caught glimpses of a flickering light approaching.|$|E
60|$|There was an {{interval}} of several seconds--it seemed minutes--it {{might well have}} been hours. Then the stealthy footsteps came towards him. A little stiff rustle of draperies proclaimed the sex of the intruder. Without a second's warning, the electric light flashed out all over the room. The girl would have screamed, but Deane, who was prepared, leaned forward, and his <b>hand</b> suddenly closed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She looked at him with dilated eyes.|$|R
2500|$|McGreavy {{was arrested}} by police at 3:50 am, {{walking on a street}} near the Ralphs' home. Upon his arrest, McGreavy {{reportedly}} said, [...] "What's this all about?" [...] At first, McGreavy denied any responsibility, but, several hours later said, [...] "It was me, but, it wasn’t me," [...] after which he described in graphic detail what he had done. He told police, [...] "I put my <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> (Samantha's) <b>mouth,</b> and it went from there. It's all in the house. On Paul, I used a wire. I was going to bury him, but I couldn't. I went outside, {{and put them on the}} fence. All I could hear is kids, kids, kids." [...] McGreavy's only explanation for the murders was that the baby would not stop crying.|$|R
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on <b>her</b> nose, nostrils, <b>mouth,</b> and underneath <b>her</b> jaw were compatible with a <b>hand</b> being clamped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|R
60|$|Messua {{was half}} wild {{with pain and}} fear (she had been beaten and stoned all the morning), and Mowgli put his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> {{just in time to}} stop a scream. Her husband was only bewildered and angry, and sat picking dust and things out of his torn beard.|$|E
6000|$|... "What lungs he has" [...] thought Mrs. Easterfield, {{as she put}} her <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> so that no {{one should}} hear her laugh. At the open window, at which she still {{steadily}} gazed, she now felt sure she saw something white which moved, but it did not come to the front.|$|E
60|$|He came nearer {{still and}} she shrank, like a terrified dumb thing, against her {{magnificent}} dressing-table, with its load of priceless trinkets. She {{tried to call}} out, but her voice seemed gone, and he only laughed as he laid his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and drew her gently towards him. With a sudden unnatural strength she wrested herself from his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{night as}} I sailed homeward," [...] Antonio said, {{in a low}} tone, [...] "I heard strange cries from the castle. The night was still, and the breeze brought the sound to my ears. They came from up above, and when I {{strained}} my eyes I fancied that I could see a white figure--the figure of a woman--standing on the castle walls. She was crying for help, but suddenly, as though a <b>hand</b> were placed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>her</b> cries ceased, and the figure vanished. It was three nights before the English lord died at the monastery!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{moment that}} the {{possibilities}} suggested by these few words dawned upon her, she sprang {{to her feet and}} followed the woman toward the door of the apartment. Immediately without the two warriors stood upon the verandah awaiting their victim, and as Virginia passed through the doorway she was seized roughly from either side, a heavy <b>hand</b> was clapped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and before she could make even an effort to rebel she had been dragged {{to the end of the}} verandah, down the notched log to the ground and a moment later found herself in a war prahu which was immediately pushed into the stream.|$|R
40|$|The Common Core {{can combine}} with well-equipped and {{prepared}} teachers {{to move ahead}} students who otherwise might struggle to learn and advance in literacy. and 500 L, students have only just grown profi cient enough at word solving to shift their fo-cus to comprehension. Bianca’s new task is to master the art of tracking the meaning of stories — even when these stories are complex, featuring multiple main characters and intricate plotlines. It’s no mean feat. This is the fi rst big decision point for Juliana: How will she address Bianca’s error? Juliana, however, has anticipated this mo-ment. When Bianca confuses Jack and Cal, Juliana encourages the group to contemplate Bianca’s sharing. “Who {{wanted to get out}} of the line? ” she asks. Another student raises his hand. “Jack didn’t want to get out of line, ” he explains when Juliana calls on him. “His friend {{wanted to get out of}} line. ” “His friend who? ” Juliana presses. The students don’t know the answer immediately, and Juliana waits. Each one of them starts go-ing back to the book to fi gure out the answer. All this time, Bianca is studying her text, her brow fur-rowed. “Cal? ” she questions aloud. Juliana points to Bianca, who im-mediately claps <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> doubting <b>her</b> answer. “Go ahead, ” Juliana reassures her. “It says here that Cal wanted to get out of the line, ” Bianca answers more confi dently, refer-ring to the text. Juliana nods and then leads students in developing a chart that shows the main char-acters in The Bully and what each says and thinks. They’ve got it When I think about the Com-mon Core State Standards for lit-eracy, I think of Bianca. I fi rst met Bianca in kindergarten when she could not read. Since then, she has made leaps of progress in reading — reach-ing over the 90 th percentile on national and state assess-ments — that have continued to impress and fascinate me. Bianca demonstrates what the Common Core can do when teachers combine its rigor with the need to meet every student just where he or she is...|$|R
60|$|Gyp sat quite {{still for}} a few seconds, {{and then began to}} laugh. He looked so like a sulky child, {{standing}} there. He turned swiftly on her and put his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She looked up over that hand which smelled of tobacco. Her heart was doing the grand ecart within her, this way in compunction, that way in resentment. His eyes fell before hers; he dropped his hand.|$|E
60|$|But {{what was}} to happen at midnight, Neangir did not hear, for Zelida's father hastily laid his <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> crying: 'Oh, be silent, child! Would you draw down on you by {{imprudence}} the fate of your unhappy sisters?' Hardly had he uttered the words, when a thick black vapour rose about him, proceeding from the precious bottle, which his rapid movement had overturned. The old slave rushed in and shrieked loudly, while Neangir, upset by this strange adventure, left the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "It means {{going from}} hence to-day, dear heart, {{and perhaps not}} meeting again. Hush-sh-sh, my beloved," [...] he said, tenderly placing his thin <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> from which a sharp cry of pain had well-nigh escaped; [...] "your {{exquisite}} soul will be with me always. Try--try not {{to give way to}} despair. Why! your love alone, which I see shining from your dear eyes, is enough to make a man cling to life with all his might. Tell me! will you do as I ask you?" ...|$|E
60|$|They {{all three}} heard {{it at the}} same time. The {{inspector}} broke off {{in the middle of his}} sentence. Ruth, shrinking in her chair, turned her head fearfully towards the door, which still stood half open. Arnold was looking breathlessly in the same direction. Faintly, but very distinctly, they heard the patter of footsteps climbing the stone stairs. It sounded as though a man were walking upon tiptoe, yet dragging his feet wearily. The inspector held up his hand, and his subordinate, who had been searching the inner room, came stealthily out. Ruth, obeying her first impulse, opened her lips to shriek. The inspector leaned forward and his <b>hand</b> suddenly closed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> He looked towards Arnold, who was suffering from a moment's indecision.|$|R
6000|$|... "Finally, by his directions, they flung me {{into the}} big rocking-chair. I was sewed in so tight that I was stiff {{like a piece of}} wood. He was giving orders in a very loud voice, and that man Babalatchi saw that they were executed. They obeyed him implicitly. Meantime I lay there in the chair like a log, and that woman capered before me and made faces; snapped her fingers before my nose. Women are bad!--ain't they? I never saw her before, as far as I know. Never done {{anything}} to her. Yet she was perfectly fiendish. Can you understand it? Now and then she would leave me alone to hang round his neck for awhile, and then she would return before my chair and begin her exercises again. He looked on, indulgent. The perspiration ran down my face, got into my eyes--my arms were sewn in. I was blinded half the time; at times I could see better. She drags him before my chair. 'I am like white women,' she says, her arms round his neck. You should have seen the faces of the fellows in the verandah! They were scandalized and ashamed of themselves to see her behaviour. Suddenly she asks him, alluding to me: 'When are you going to kill him?' Imagine how I felt. I must have swooned; I don't remember exactly. I fancy there was a row; he was angry. When I got my wits again he was sitting close to me, and she was gone. I understood he sent her to my wife, who was hiding in the back room and never came out during this affair. Willems says to me--I fancy I can hear his voice, hoarse and dull--he says to me: 'Not a hair of your head shall be touched.' I made no sound. Then he goes on: 'Please remark that the flag you have hoisted--which, by the by, is not yours--has been respected. Tell Captain Lingard so when you do see him. But,' he says, 'you first fired at the crowd.' 'You are a liar, you blackguard!' I shouted. He winced, I am sure. It hurt him to see I was not frightened. 'Anyways,' he says, 'a shot had been fired out of your compound and a man was hit. Still, all your property shall be respected on account of the Union Jack. Moreover, I have no quarrel with Captain Lingard, who is the senior partner in this business. As to you,' he continued, 'you will not forget this day--not if you live to be a hundred years old--or I don't know your nature. You will keep the bitter taste of this humiliation to the last day of your life, and so your kindness to me shall be repaid. I shall remove all the powder you have. This coast is under the protection of the Netherlands, and you have no right to have any powder. There are the Governor's Orders in Council to that effect, and you know it. Tell me where the key of the small storehouse is?' I said not a word, and he waited a little, then rose, saying: 'It's your own fault if there is any damage done.' He ordered Babalatchi to have the lock of the office-room forced, and went in--rummaged amongst my drawers--could not find the key. Then that woman Aissa asked my wife, and she gave them the key. After awhile they tumbled every barrel into the river. Eighty-three hundredweight! He superintended himself, and saw every barrel roll into the water. There were mutterings. Babalatchi was angry and tried to expostulate, but he gave him a good shaking. I must say he was perfectly fearless with those fellows. Then he came back to the verandah, sat down by me again, and says: 'We found your man Ali with your little daughter hiding in the bushes up the river. We brought them in. They are perfectly safe, of course. Let me congratulate you, Almayer, upon the cleverness of your child. She recognized me at once, and cried [...] "pig" [...] as naturally as you would yourself. Circumstances alter feelings. You should have seen how frightened your man Ali was. Clapped his <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> I think you spoil her, Almayer. But I am not angry. Really, you look so ridiculous in this chair that I can't feel angry.' I made a frantic effort to burst out of my hammock to get at that scoundrel's throat, but I only fell off and upset the chair over myself. He laughed and said only: 'I leave you half of your revolver cartridges and take half myself; they will fit mine. We are both white men, and should back each other up. I may want them.' I shouted at him from under the chair: 'You are a thief,' but he never looked, and went away, one hand round that woman's waist, the other on Babalatchi's shoulder, to whom he was talking--laying down the law about something or other. In less than five minutes there was nobody inside our fences. After awhile Ali came to look for me and cut me free. I haven't seen Willems since--nor anybody else for that matter. I have been left alone. I offered sixty dollars to the man who had been wounded, which were accepted. They released Jim-Eng the next day, when the flag had been hauled down. He sent six cases of opium to me for safe keeping but has not left his house. I think he is safe enough now. Everything is very quiet." ...|$|R
