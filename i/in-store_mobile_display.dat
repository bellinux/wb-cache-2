The cloud based approach places the mobile payment provider {{in the middle}} of the transaction, which involves two separate steps. First, a cloud-linked payment method is selected and payment is authorized via NFC or an alternative method.

Second, in a separate transaction, the payment provider charges the purchaser's selected, cloud-linked account in a card-not-present environment to recoup its losses on the first transaction.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a VR system for {{allowing}} {{various types of}} interaction with virtual objects using an autostereoscopic <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> and an accelerometer. The system obtains the orientation and motion information from the accelerometer attached to the <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> and reflects them to the motion of virtual objects. It can present 3 D images with motion parallax by estimating {{the position of the}} user’s viewpoint and by displaying properly projected images. Furthermore, our method enables to connect the real space and the virtual space seamlessly through the <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> by determining the coordinate system so that one of the horizontal surfaces in the virtual space coincides with the display surface. To show the effectiveness of this concept, we implemented an application to simulate food cooking by regarding the <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> as a frying pan...|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : The see-through mobile AR system {{enables a}} user to {{interact}} with virtual objects overlaid on the see-through images <b>displayed</b> on a <b>mobile</b> <b>display.</b> In this paper, we propose an interaction {{system in which the}} appearance of the image <b>displayed</b> on a <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> is consistent with that of the real space and that enables a user {{to interact with}} virtual objects overlaid on the image using the user’s hand. The three-dimensional scene obtained by a depth camera is projected according to the user’s viewpoint position obtained by face tracking, and the see-through image whose appearance is consistent with that outside the <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> is generated. Interaction with virtual objects is realized by using the depth information obtained by the depth camera. To move virtual objects as if they were in real space, virtual objects are rendered in the world coordinate system that is fixed to a real scene even if the <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> moves, and the direction of gravitational force added to virtual objects is made consistent with that of the world coordinate system. The former is realized by using the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm and the latter is realized by using the information obtained by an accelerometer. Thus, natural interaction with virtual objects using the user’s hand is realized...|$|R

40|$|Owing to the {{diversity}} of projection surfaces, an effective <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> system must be adaptive to the surface to avoid introducing a clipped scene. In this paper, we propose a smart <b>mobile</b> <b>display</b> system which automatically adapts to the location and motion of a surface. Firstly, an imperceptible structured light technique is adopted and continuous adaptation is accomplished. Secondly, a specifically designed code image with high distortion tolerance is proposed. Thirdly, we present a priority-based correction method to revise previous decoding results. Finally, a matching procedure resisting noise interruption is introduced. The system achieves 95 % correct rate under the common indoor illuminance. In addition, the system performance is independent of the projected content and the surface shapes.
