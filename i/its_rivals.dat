5|$|Microsoft Xbox 360 {{gained an}} early lead {{in terms of}} market share, largely due to its {{established}} Xbox Live online gaming system, and its early launch date, which was one year before <b>its</b> <b>rivals.</b> Sales in North America and Europe have continued to be strong, even {{after the release of}} the Wii and PlayStation 3. Like its predecessor, the Xbox 360 received a muted reception in Japan, attributed to the lack of content aimed at Japanese gamers.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out between France and <b>its</b> <b>rivals,</b> Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight {{alongside}} the French {{in the name of}} the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the Act of Mediation which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons. Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.|$|E
5|$|In 1839 Samuel Cunard, a Prince Edward Island shipowner, {{was awarded}} the first British transatlantic {{steamship}} mail contract, {{and the next year}} formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company together with Robert Napier, the famous Scottish steamship engine designer and builder, to operate the line's four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool–Halifax–Boston route. For most of the next 30 years, Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage. However, in the 1870s Cunard fell behind <b>its</b> <b>rivals,</b> the White Star Line and the Inman Line. To meet this competition, in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd, to raise capital.|$|E

5|$|When Cunard died in 1865, {{the equally}} {{conservative}} Charles MacIver assumed Cunard's role. The firm retained its reluctance about change and was overtaken by competitors that more quickly adopted new technology. In 1866 Inman started to build screw propelled express liners that matched Cunard's premier unit, the Scotia. Cunard responded with its first high speed screw propellered steamer, Russia which {{was followed by}} two larger editions. In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the White Star Line commissioned the Oceanic and her five sisters. The new White Star record-breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines. White Star also set new standards for comfort by placing the dining saloon midships and doubling the size of cabins. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard, but Cunard lagged behind both of <b>its</b> <b>rivals.</b> Throughout the 1870s Cunard passage times were longer than either White Star or Inman.|$|E

However, in a large market, or in a medium market size with less efficient R&D technology, the innovating firm does not share information with <b>its</b> <b>rival.</b> They also show that the social welfare may be higher under incomplete information regime.
