25|$|<b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> (Chondrus crispus), often {{confused}} with Mastocarpus stellatus, {{is the source}} of carrageenan, which is used as a stiffening agent in instant puddings, sauces, and dairy products such as ice cream. <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> is also used by beer brewers as a fining agent.|$|E
25|$|Alginate, carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using <b>Irish</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|E

60|$|At Jerusalem village the {{inhabitants}} were collecting in haste, before a thunder-shower now approaching, the <b>Irish</b> <b>moss</b> {{which they had}} spread to dry. The shower passed on one side, {{and gave me a}} few drops only, which did not cool the air. I merely felt a puff upon my cheek, though, within sight, a vessel was capsized in the bay, and several others dragged their anchors, and were near going ashore. The sea-bathing at Cohasset Rocks was perfect. The water was purer and more transparent than any I had ever seen. There was not a particle of mud or slime about it. The bottom being sandy, I could see the sea-perch swimming about. The smooth and fantastically worn rocks, and the perfectly clean and tress-like rock-weeds falling over you, and attached so firmly to the rocks that you could pull yourself up by them, greatly enhanced the luxury of the bath. The stripe of barnacles just above the weeds reminded me of some vegetable growth,--the buds, and petals, and seed-vessels of flowers. They lay along the seams of the rock like buttons on a waistcoat. It was one of the hottest days in the year, yet I found the water so icy cold that I could swim but a stroke or two, and thought that, in case of shipwreck, there would be more danger of being chilled to death than simply drowned. One immersion was enough to make you forget the dog-days utterly. Though you were sweltering before, it will take you half an hour now to remember that it was ever warm. There were the tawny rocks, like lions couchant, defying the ocean, whose waves incessantly dashed against and scoured them with vast quantities of gravel. The water held in their little hollows, on the receding of the tide, was so crystalline that I could not believe it salt, but wished to drink it; and higher up were basins of fresh water left by the rain,--all which, being also of different depths and temperature, were convenient for different kinds of baths. Also, the larger hollows in the smoothed rocks formed the most convenient of seats and dressing-rooms. In these respects it was the most perfect seashore that I had seen.|$|E
40|$|The hectad (10 × 10 km square) {{distributions}} of the 1405 native British and Irish vascular plants were classified by the SPHERIKM cluster analysis program into 20 clusters, {{each of which}} is characterised by the key species used to initiate the cluster. The clusters reflect the influence of climate, altitude, geology and habitat on distribution patterns at this scale. Clusters with restricted distributions have high concentrations of threatened species, particularly the Medicago sativa cluster, centred on Breckland (55 % of the species are threatened in Britain, although only 29 % are regarded as priorities for conservation), and the Carex atrata cluster of montane species (45 % threatened, and 49 % conservation priority species). Some clusters are composed predominantly of species with similar European distributions whereas others are much more phytogeographically heterogeneous. A comparison with a similar analysis of the distribution of British and <b>Irish</b> <b>mosses</b> and liverworts reveals many similarities, especially between the vascular plants and the mosses, although there are many more common vascular plants than bryophytes and many more coastal species...|$|R

40|$|We {{classified}} 747 {{species of}} British and <b>Irish</b> <b>mosses</b> into 10 clusters, {{based on their}} recorded distribution in 10610 km grid squares (hectads). We generated the clusters in a two-stage process using the CLUSTASPEC program, the method that we had earlier used for British and Irish liverworts and hornworts. The clusters are named after the species with distributions which are most {{similar to those of}} the clusters as a whole. Clusters of widespread species (Bryum capillare), southern, lowland species (Rhynchostegium confertum), widespread calcifuges (Pleurozium schreberi), upland species (Blindia acuta), and montane calcifuges (Kiaeria falcata) closely match clusters recognised in the liverworts. The remaining clusters (Tortella flavovirens, Weissia longifolia, Mnium stellare, Encalypta alpina, Mnium lycopodioides) are less similar. The classification of mosses into 15 and 20 clusters generates additional clusters of hyperoceanic and montane mosses which also resemble liverwort clusters. The influence of calcareous bedrock has a more marked effect in determining moss distributions and, unlike the liverworts, the 10 moss clusters include one which is predominantly coastal. Mosses tend to be a less upland group than liverworts; a smaller proportion of their species have northern and western distributions and the lowland clusters are characterised by more extreme environmental conditions. As with the liverworts, geographically restricted clusters of species with predominantly Mediterranean-Atlantic, Arctic-montane and Boreo-arctic Montane world ranges include marked concentrations of threatened species, and species which are not recorded as fruiting in the British Isles...|$|R

40|$|It is now {{accepted}} that macrophages play an integral role in chronic inflammatory processes (1, 2). They are always present at sites of chronic inflammation, albeit in widely varying proportions, {{accompanied by a}} variety of other cell types. The cellular composition of chronic inflammatory lesions is dependent {{on the nature of the}} inciting stimulus. The lesions of many clinically important chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are dominated by lymphocytes (3). Some stimuli, e. g. mycobacteria (4) and the intracellular parasites Listeria monocytogenes (5) and Toxoplasma gondii (5) provoke lesions rich in macrophages but also with prominent lymphoid cell components. Lesions caused by indigestable materials such as asbestos (6) and the cell walls of group A streptococci (7, 8) are dominated by macrophages with minimal contribution by cells of the lymphoid system.

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{soil organic matter}} (OM) in the uptake of cadmium (Cd) by Sorghum will be studied {{in order to get}} a better knowledge in the yield and understanding of detoxification mechanisms of soils. Plants were grown for 60 days in a greenhouse pot experiment using a contaminated soil with 4. 5 and 35 mg Cd kg_ 1, in absence and presence of OM. An <b>Irish</b> peat <b>moss</b> (70 g kg_ 1 of soil) was added as OM. In the presence of OM the biomass production of root and shoot was increased with a positive correlation between biomass increment and contamination level. For experiments with 35 mg Cd kg_ 1 of soil the biomass production was increased of about 7 times in the presence (vs. absence) of OM. Although the presence of OM had decreased Cd root concentration by decreasing Cd bioavailability in soil, the increase of biomass in presence of OM led to an increase of about 3 times on the Cd amount in shoot, result that can be important in soil phytoremediation...|$|R
