40|$|International audienceAs {{the speed}} metric of Massively Parallel Multi-Processors System-on-Chip (MP 2 SoC) systems has {{increased}} over time, another metric {{has become more}} important: power consumption. Finding a tradeoff between power consumption and performance early in the design flow of MP 2 SoC systems {{in order to satisfy}} time-to-market is the design challenge of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. This paper presents a Design Space Exploration (DSE) framework, named Energy-Aware Rapid Design of MP 2 SoC (<b>EWARDS),</b> aiming at exploring the performance and power capabilities of modern homogenous MP 2 SoC systems at design time using Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. The proposed framework extends the Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems (MARTE) profile with power aspects of MP 2 SoC systems providing a high-level design entry. In addition, <b>EWARDS</b> integrates an energy-aware scheduler that strives to balance performance and energy savings by combining clustering scheduling algorithm with off-line Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) power management techniques. © 2016 IEEE...|$|E

They can cure and kill. Matters of Substance {{is a fascinating}} global tour of drugs and our ambivalent relationship with them. From alcohol to amphetamines, cannabis to crack cocaine, heroin to valium, Griffith Edwards reveals the history, culture and language behind each drug - their physical and psychological effects, medical use, trade routes, the involvement of big business and the chequered path of control and legislations. He considers the key issues: which drugs are most dangerous? Why do some people become addicted? What causes a drug epidemic? As <b>Ewards</b> argues, only when we truly understand drugs can we hope to deal with them, and this enlightened book will inform all future debates on the subject...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{multilevel}} fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA), {{an efficient}} method is proposed {{to accelerate the}} solution of the combined field integral equation in electromagnetic scattering and radiation, where the fast far-field approximation (FAFFA) is combined with MLFMA. The translation between groups in MLFMA is expensive because spherical Hankel functions and Legendre polynomials are involved and the translator is defined on an <b>Eward</b> sphere with many k directions. When two groups are in the far-field region, however, the translation can be greatly simplified by FAFFA where only a single k direction is involved in the translator. The condition for using FAFFA and the way to efficiently incorporate FAFFA with MLFMA are discussed. Complexity analysis illustrates that the computational cost in FAFFA-MLFMA can be asymptotically cut by half compared to the conventional MLFMA.

40|$|Abstract Objective This study {{analyses}} {{the association}} between occupational stress factors and nicotine dependence. Our hypothesis is that occupational stress factors increase nicotine dependence. Methods Data {{were taken from the}} Cologne Smoking Study, a case-control study that examines which genetic/psychosocial factors lead to a higher risk for smokers to suffer from cardiac infarction, lung cancer and/or to become addicted to nicotine. Our sample consisted of N = 197 currently smoking and employed participants. Nicotine dependence was measured using the F agerström T est for N icotine D ependence (FTND). The extent of the stress factors experienced at work was assessed using the E ffort- R <b>eward</b> I mbalance scale (ERI). Logistic regression was used for the statistical analysis. Results Contrary to our hypothesis, the results show that occupational stress factors are actually associated with lower levels of nicotine dependence (N = 197; adjusted OR = 0. 439; p =. 059). Conclusions One possible explanation for the study's findings is that the participants have a heavy workload and can only smoke in their spare time. Another reason may be workplace smoking bans. Furthermore, the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is unable to examine nicotine dependence during working hours. </p...|$|R

Rather than wait to inherit the right to till a section of land, he left his home at the age of fourteen as servant to a wool-trader, and thus became acquainted with Shrewsbury early in life. In 1096, he embarked on the First Crusade to the Holy Land in the force commanded by Robert II, Duke of Normandy. After the victorious end to the Crusade, he lived for several years in Syria and the Holy Land, earning a living as a sailor, before returning to England around 1114 to find that Richildis Vaughan, to whom he had been unofficially engaged, had tired of waiting and had married <b>Eward</b> Gurney, a Shrewsbury craftsman.

It was then that its war ships made their first appearance in the Adriatic. Warships of another countries, however, had already made their appearance in the harbours along the Adriatic. It was their usual practice to dock at Zadar, Vis and Dubrovnik. At this time, Zadar was the capital city of Dalmatia. Dubrovnik lost its status of naval port in 1886. The very first foreign warship that visited Split in 1886 was the Italian warship. Since then, many ships would arrive in Split.

A parallel effort has also been expended to evaluate the engineering feasibility of a nuclear rocket reactor using tungsten-matrix fuel elements and water as the moderator. Both of these efforts have resulted in significant contributions to nuclear rocket technology. Many successful static firings of nuclear rockets have been made with graphite-core reactors. Sufficient information has also been accumulated to permit a reasonable Judgment as to the feasibility of the tungsten water-moderated reactor concept. We therefore consider that this technoIogy conference on the nuclear rocket work that has been sponsored by the Lewis Research Center is timely.

2500|$|In 1949 Munschke {{switched}} from local government to national government {{when he took}} a position working for the Party Central Committee, again becoming head of the critical personnel department. By 1952 the government and their allies were looking to create an East German Kasernierte Volkspolizei (People's Police in Barracks), a quasi-military police service which is seen, in retrospect, as a precursor to the establishment in 1956 of an East German army. One thing on which the Soviets and their western allies had agreed back in 1945 was that Germany should not have its own army, but after the establishment in 1949 of the German Democratic Republic and the de facto division of what remained of Germany into two separate states, each in one of two competing military alliances, and both German states accommodating several hundred thousand fraternal troops from (respectively) the United States and the Soviet Union, perceived priorities had changed. [...] Both side were quietly preparing to re-introduce national armies into their versions of post-war Germany. In the late summer of 1952 <b>Eward</b> Munschke was surprised to find himself being interviewed by the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht himself. On 1 October 1952, despite never having held any military rank in any national army, Munschke was promoted to the (police) rank of major general, with the job of [...] "Kaderchef", tasked by Ulbricht to select capable and suitable young men ("befähigte und geeignete junge Männer auszuwählen ...") for the new quasi-military police brigade. Munschke's record in the Spanish Civil War and as a resistance operative in the Netherlands during the war, together with his never-questioned loyalty to his country's Communist status quo, had evidently impressed Ulbricht, and he stayed in the post of [...] "Kaderchef" [...] to which he had been appointed by the leader for five years. [...] The position went with a government job as Chief of Cadre administration ( [...] Chef der Verwaltung Kader) in the [...] which was the government department responsible for the police. [...] The National People's Army (NVA / Nationale Volksarmee) was formally founded on 1 March 1956, and this was also the date on which Ewald Munschke was appointed Deputy Minister for National Defence, and the country's first Head of Personnel Administration with the Ministry for National Defence (Chef der Verwaltung Kader beim Ministerium für Nationale Verteidigung). It was largely on the basis of Munschke's approach that the new East German officer class was drawn almost exclusively from the industrial and agricultural working classes.|$|R
