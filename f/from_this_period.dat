5|$|Between 1350 and 1500, {{many new}} {{buildings}} appeared, especially churches with towers like Fotheringhay in Northamptonshire. Some fine bridges as at Wadebridge in Cornwall are <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5|$|Danish country vicarages <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> {{tended to}} be built in the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} Funen. The house itself is a thatched half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses.|$|E

5|$|Many modern insect genera {{developed}} during the Cenozoic. Insects <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> on are often found preserved in amber, often in perfect condition.

5|$|The {{language}} spoken {{during this period}} {{is thought to be}} Southwestern Brythonic, but only one or two inscribed stones survive in Somerset <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period.</b> However, a couple of curse tablets found in the baths at Bath may be in this language. Some place names in Somerset seem to be Celtic in origin and may be <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> or earlier, e.g. Tarnock. Some river names, such as Parrett, may be Celtic or pre-Celtic. The religion of the people of Somerset in this period is thought to be Christian but it was isolated from Rome until after the Council of Hertford in 673AD when Aldhelm was asked to write a letter to Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Some church sites in Somerset are thought to date <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> e.g., Llantokay Street.|$|E

5|$|An old style {{grammar school}} at Healds Green in Chadderton was built and founded in 1789. As the {{population}} of Chadderton grew during the 19th century, more schools were opened, each linked with a local church. Mills Hill School began as a voluntary aided school belonging to the local Baptist church. Further schoolrooms <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> were found at Cowhill Methodist Church and Washbrook Methodist Church, opened in 1855 and 1893 respectively.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 17th century, {{possibly}} around 1600, a new hall was built in stone to replace the older timber-framed one; it was positioned to the south, replacing the earlier 15th-century extension. The new hall was slightly anachronistic, having only one floor, unlike most new halls <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> which had two storeys. The old hall was then probably adapted for use as a service area.|$|E

50|$|From 3000 to 1900 BC Pomerania {{was settled}} by farmers and herders of the Funnelbeaker culture (also TRB, Trichterbecher culture), that had {{evolved from the}} {{previous}} Mesolithic cultures and Linear Pottery culture influence. During <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> Western Pomerania was more densely settled than before, primarily on smooth hills near the water. Artefacts and settlements <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>periods</b> have been found at various sites in Western Pomerania, e.g. around the Bay of Greifswald. The Funnelbeaker culture people erected numerous Megalith tombs.|$|R

5|$|At {{this stage}} of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian {{architect}} during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, {{which would have been}} unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by {{his success}} in Lvov, he {{returned}} to Bucharest in 1892, {{as director of the}} Jigniţa theater. His new company again included Lazăr Zuckermann; other players were Marcu (Mordechai) Segalescu, and later Iacob Kalich, Carol Schramek, Malvina Treitler-Löbel and her father H. Goldenbers. Among his notable plays <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> were Dos zenteh Gebot, oder Lo tachmod (The Tenth Commandment, or Thou Shalt Not Covet), Judas Maccabaeus, and Judith and Holfernes and a translation of Johann Strauss's Gypsy Baron.|$|E
5|$|By 1827, {{the family}} had {{returned}} to Leipzig. Wagner's first lessons in harmony were taken during 1828–31 with Christian Gottlieb Müller. In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and then, in March, the same composer's 9th Symphony (both at the Gewandhaus). Beethoven became a major inspiration, and Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony. He was also greatly impressed by a performance of Mozart's Requiem. Wagner's early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} age of tournaments had ended, and {{physical}} crests largely disappeared. Their illustrated equivalents consequently began {{to be treated as}} simply two-dimensional pictures. Many crests <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> are physically impossible to bear on a helm, e.g. the crest granted to Sir Francis Drake in 1581, which consisted of a disembodied hand issuing from clouds and leading a ship around the globe (representing God's guidance).|$|E
5|$|By {{the death}} of Dom Pedro in 1786, all the {{interior}} work was completed. This was fortunate, as <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> his widow's mental health deteriorated, until in 1794, she and her court took up official and full-time residence at Queluz. There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the view of her subjects. Her eldest son, later King João VI, was appointed Regent and ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra.|$|E
5|$|Catholic worship was {{deliberately}} low key, {{usually in the}} private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.|$|E

5000|$|The {{political}} concern {{derives from}} the fact that none of the historians <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>periods</b> works exclusively in the historiographical fields, and had steady political works at the same time. Despite keeping a rigorous scientific approach, their works were marked by their political views: when Ramos Mejía rote about the popular participation and how it led to either the May Revolution or the tyranny of Rosas, he was indirectly pointing his opinions about popular participation in his own context. <b>This</b> <b>period</b> ends by 1920, with the creation of the New Historical School.|$|R
