40|$|ABSTRACT Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Today it has {{observed}} a continuing and {{rapid increase in}} its prevalence. Autism increase, in combination with unknown factors that cause it, so far, has drawn the interest of several researchers (from different scientific fields). It could be characterized as a multiple-factors disorder. In recent decades, many researchers have implicated mainly environmental, chemical, genetic, hereditary, and biological factors. The present article focuses on environmental factors that their exposure causes <b>irreversible</b> <b>brain</b> <b>damages</b> (toxicity) - autism. Some of these factors are (mainly) mercury, brominated, thalidomide, misoprostol, valproic acid, chloropiryfos, ethanol etc. However, according to literature review, {{it has not been}} proved a direct correlation with the factors which have been implicated for autism disorder. As a result, the question “what causes autism” is still unanswered. Today, diagnostic criteria, early diagnosis, methods for autistic education and medication (under circumstances) are continuously improving...|$|R

40|$|Vitamin B 12 is a {{cofactor}} of methionine synthase in {{the synthesis}} of methionine, the precursor of the universal methyl donor S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe), which is involved in different epigenomic regulatory mechanisms and especially in brain development. A Vitamin B 12 deficiency expresses itself by {{a wide variety of}} neurological manifestations such as paraesthesias, skin numbness, coordination disorders and reduced nerve conduction velocity. In elderly people, a latent Vitamin B 12 deficiency can be associated with a progressive brain atrophy. Moderately elevated concentrations of homocysteine (> 10 µmol/L) have been associated with an increased risk of dementia, notably Alzheimer’s disease, in many cross-sectional and prospective studies. Raised plasma concentrations of homocysteine is also associated with both regional and whole brain atrophy, not only in Alzheimer’s disease but also in healthy elderly people.

40|$|Objective: Antipsychotics {{are used}} by {{millions}} of patients worldwide. There is an ongoing discussion whether second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) concerning effects on symptoms and side effects are better than first generation antipsychotics (FGAs). Some researchers and authors have also questioned the long-term effect of antipsychotic drugs and discussed whether they really have a positive positive long-term effect. The last decade some researchers have also looked into whether antipsychotics cause <b>irreversible</b> <b>brain</b> <b>damages.</b> In the present study I wanted to examine to what extent this {{is supported by the}} existent research literature. Methods: I conducted searches on various databases such as PubMed, PsychINFO,EMBASE and the Cochrane Library and I used the following words in four combinations: (1) antipsychotics AND first-episode psychosis AND side effects, (2) side effects AND antipsychotics (3) first-episode psychosis AND antipsychotics (4) antipsychotics AND long-term effects. I searched through the referance-lists of several articles and found relevant articles here. I mainly focused on the latest systematic reviews, bacause this is a large topic. Results: The studies regarding the efficacy on positive symptom reduction showed that there is not any significant difference between SGAs and FGAs. SGAs give more weight gain initially than FGAs but with longer follow-up, this difference seems to decrease. The changes in brain structure associated with schizophrenia might be the result of antipsychotic use. There is some evidence that showes that long-term exposure of antipsychotics increases mortality in schizophrenia. Regarding the functional outcome in the long-term, patients that were given dosereduction/discontinuation after remission from the first-episode psychosis(FEP), were doing much better than patients that were given maintainance treatment when evaluated seven years later. Conclusions: There is a need for more research about the side-effects of antipsychotics, with longer follow-up and the use of medium-potent FGAs in moderate doses as comparator. More research is needed regarding the long-term outcomes of antipsychotic treatment including mortality. There is a need for the introduction of patient choice regarding treatment of FEP/psychosis in general with more respect of the patients autonomy and less paternalism from the therapist...|$|R

30|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} these aneurysms poses a significant challenge owing to their deep location and frequent unfavorable morphology, and {{is complicated by}} hemodynamic fragility of the vessels [6]. Surgical revascularization is an option for peripheral aneurysms in the moyamoya vessels since hemodynamic stress reduction that ensues may result in disappearance of the aneurysms [8]. Recently, improving microvascular techniques and technology may enable more frequent endovascular treatment for these aneurysms [9, 10]. Aneurysms located at the circle of Willis are usually saccular aneurysms which are associated with high risk of bleeding, and revascularization is not a viable option in such cases as the procedure cannot make these aneurysms disappear. Clipping of such aneurysms has its own inherent risks. Dural handling and incisions may disturb the transdural collaterals [11], perforators and moyamoya vessels may cause hindrance [12], and placement of temporary clips at the parent vessel may cause <b>irreversible</b> hypoxic <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> owing to an already compromised flow. Endovascular coil embolization could be a viable option in such cases. A study by Arita et al. [13] showed that conventional coil embolization is an efficient and safe treatment option for basilar tip aneurysms (BTA) associated with MMD.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} results of {{parallel}} positron emission tomography (PET) studies of regional cerebral glucose metabolism with the radiotracer F- 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) density by PET using the BZR ligand C- 11 -flumazenil (FMZ), a tracer of neuronal integrity, in nine patients with acute vegetative state (AVS, duration < 1 month). Overall glucose utilization was significantly reduced in AVS in comparison with age-matched controls (global metabolic rate for glucose 26 μmol/ 100 g/min in AVS vs. 31 μmol/ 100 g/min in controls). FMZ-PET demonstrated a considerable reduction of BZR binding sites in all cortical regions that grossly corresponded {{to the extent of}} reduction of cerebral glucose metabolism assessed with FDG-PET, whilst the cerebellum was spared from neuronal loss. In controls, cortical relative flumazenil binding was not lower than five times the average white matter activity, whilst in AVS, nearly all values were below this threshold. There was no relevant overlap of the data of relative umazenil binding between both groups. The comparison of FDG- and FMZ-PET findings in AVS demonstrates that alterations of cerebral glucose consumption do not represent mere functional inactivation, but <b>irreversible</b> structural <b>brain</b> <b>damage...</b>|$|R
40|$|Given {{that most}} fatal hangings are suicidal and occur in {{locations}} {{that have been}} selected to conceal this activity (thus maximizing {{the chances of a}} lethal outcome), there has been very little corroboration of the speed with which unconsciousness and death may occur. A 35 -year-old male is reported who committed suicide by hanging immediately after talking to his spouse. Police investigations confirmed her reliability as a witness indicating that lethal anoxia in this case had occurred within a very short time (most likely in less than 1 min) of suspension. The speed with which death may result from hanging not only gives an insight into fatal pathophysiological mechanisms, but also provides useful information for situations where a lethal outcome is to be avoided, or is not intended. For example, individuals at risk of suicide who are being monitored in institutional facilities need to be constantly under direct visual surveillance as significant hypoxia can be rapidly induced, parents and caregivers with infants and children in potentially unsafe sleeping environments need to realize how swiftly death or <b>irreversible</b> anoxic <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> may occur from neck compression, and those who engage in recreational asphyxia should be informed just how quickly a fatal outcome may ensue.

40|$|The {{validity}} of clinical criteria for diagnosing brain death {{has been investigated}} in three ways. A total of 447 published cases were reviewed. In three neurosurgical units (Cambridge, Glasgow, and Swansea) 609 patients diagnosed clinically as brain dead were studied; 326 had final cardiac asystole while still being ventilated, and ventilation was discontinued in the remainder. No patient recovered. The median time in hospital before the heart finally stopped was 3 1 / 2 - 4 1 / 2 days, with 30 - 40 hours on the ventilator. Analysis of prospective data from three countries on patients with severe head injuries showed that not one of 1003 survivors would ever have been suspected of being brain dead even in their worst state soon after injury. Recovery after supposed brain death has been alleged in patients who {{were thought to be}} brain dead but in fact were not and in cases where reflex movements in the limbs were mistaken for signs of life. The safeguards in diagnosing brain death include establishing <b>irreversible</b> structural <b>brain</b> <b>damage,</b> excluding the effects of drugs, and allowing enough time to elapse to establish the diagnosis beyond doubt. The studies reported here show that the clinical criteria used in the United Kingdom are reliable.

40|$|International audienceFollowing {{exposure}} to the organophosphorus nerve agent soman, the development of long-lasting seizures and build-up of <b>irreversible</b> seizure-related <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> (SRBD) still represent a therapeutic challenge. A neuro-inflammatory reaction {{takes place in the}} brain after poisoning but its characteristics and potential role in SRBD and post-status epilepticus epileptogenesis is not well understood. In the present study we have analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR the time course of changes in mRNA levels of IL- 1 beta, TNFalpha, IL- 6, ICAM- 1 and SOCS 3 in hippocampus, whole cortex and cerebellum in a mouse model of severe seizures and neuropathy up to 7 days after poisoning. Mice received an injection of the oxime HI- 6 (50 mg/kg) 5 min prior to the administration of a convulsive dose of soman (172 microg/kg). An important and highly significant increase of the five mRNA levels was recorded in cortex and hippocampus. In the cortex, the activation was generally detected as early as 1 h post-intoxication with a peak response recorded between 6 and 24 h. In the hippocampus, the gene up-regulation was delayed to 6 h post-soman and the peak response observed between 24 and 48 h. After peaking, the response declined (except for ICAM in the hippocampus) but remained elevated, some of them significantly, at day 7. Interestingly, in the cerebellum, some changes were also observed but were several fold smaller. In conclusion, the present study indicates a quick neuro-inflammatory gene response that does not subside over 7 days suggesting a potential role in the neurological consequences of soman-induced status epilepticus...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: There is, in European {{countries}} that conduct medical chart review of {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) deaths, no consensus on uniform criteria for defining a potential organ donor. Although the term is increasingly being used in recent literature, it is seldom defined in detail. We searched for criteria for determination of imminent brain death, which {{can be seen as}} a precursor for organ donation. Methods: We organized meetings with representatives from the field of clinical neurology, neurotraumatology, intensive care medicine, transplantation medicine, clinical intensive care ethics, and organ procurement management. During these meetings, all possible criteria were discussed to identify a patient with a reasonable probability to become brain dead (imminent brain death). We focused on the practical usefulness of two validated coma scales (Glasgow Coma Scale and the FOUR Score), brain stem reflexes and respiration to define imminent brain death. Further we discussed criteria to determine irreversibility and futility in acute neurological conditions. Results: A patient who fulfills the definition of imminent brain death is a mechanically ventilated deeply comatose patient, admitted to an ICU, with <b>irreversible</b> catastrophic <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> of known origin. A condition of imminent brain death requires either a Glasgow Coma Score of 3 and the progressive absence of at least three out of six brain stem reflexes or a FOUR score of E 0 M 0 B 0 R 0. Conclusion: The definition of imminent brain death can be used as a point of departure for potential heart-beating organ donor recognition on the intensive care unit or retrospective medical chart analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) reflects brain electrical activity. A flat (isoelectric) EEG, {{which is}} usually recorded during very deep coma, {{is considered to be}} a turning point between a living brain and a deceased brain. Therefore the isoelectric EEG constitutes, together with evidence of <b>irreversible</b> structural <b>brain</b> <b>damage,</b> one of the criteria for the assessment of brain death. In this study we use EEG recordings for humans on the one hand, and on the other hand double simultaneous intracellular recordings in the cortex and hippocampus, combined with EEG, in cats. They serve to demonstrate that a novel brain phenomenon is observable in both humans and animals during coma that is deeper than the one reflected by the isoelectric EEG, and that this state is characterized by brain activity generated within the hippocampal formation. This new state was induced either by medication applied to postanoxic coma (in human) or by application of high doses of anesthesia (isoflurane in animals) leading to an EEG activity of quasi-rhythmic sharp waves which henceforth we propose to call n-complexes (Nu-complexes). Using simultaneous intracellular recordings in vivo in the cortex and hippocampus (especially in the CA 3 region) we demonstrate that n-complexes arise in the hippocampus and are subsequently transmitted to the cortex. The genesis of a hippocampal n-complex depends upon another hippocampal activity, known as ripple activity, which is not overtly detectable at the cortical level. Based on our observations, we propose a scenario of how self-oscillations in hippocampal neurons can lead to a whole brain phenomenon during coma...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the long-term results of liver transplantation (LT) for non-acetaminophen fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). METHODS: Over a 20 -year period, 29 FHF patients underwent cadaveric whole LT. Most frequent causes of FHF were hepatitis B virus and drug-related (not acetaminophen) liver failure. All surviving patients were regularly controlled at the out-patient clinic and none {{was lost to}} follow-up. Mean follow-up was 101 mo. RESULTS: One month, one-, five- and ten-year patient survival was 79 %, 72 %, 68 % and 68 %, respectively. One month, one-, five- and ten-year graft survival was 69 %, 65 %, 51 % and 38 %, respectively. Six patients needed early (< 2 mo) retransplantation, four for primary non-function, one for early acute refractory rejection because of ABO blood group incompatibility, and one for a malignant tumor found in the donor. Two patients with hepatitis B FHF developed cerebral lesions peri-transplantion: One developed <b>irreversible</b> and extensive <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> leading to death, and one suffered from deep deficits leading to continuous medical care in a specialized institution. CONCLUSION: Long-term outcome of patients transplanted for non-acetaminophen FHF may be excellent. As {{the quality of life}} of these patients is also particularly good, LT for FHF is clearly justified, despite lower graft survival compared with LT for other liver diseases.

40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widespread nutritional disorders worldwide and has multiple adverse effects on growth and development in humans. Inadequate iodine intake during pregnancy may lead to <b>irreversible</b> foetal <b>brain</b> <b>damage.</b> Objective: The overall objective of this study was to assess iodine status in pregnant women in Oslo and Akershus by evaluating urinary iodine concentration (UIC), urinary iodine excretion (UIE), and iodine intake from food and supplements. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed during 2016 by convenient sampling in 804 pregnant women (18 - 44 years) in eight Mother and Health Centres in Oslo and Akershus. Spot urine samples were collected from 728 women for assessment of UIC and 804 participants provided information about 24 -h iodine intake and supplement use. In addition, 49 participants in a sub-study collected a 24 -hour urine sample for assessment of UIC and UIE, and answered a 24 -hour dietary recall and a food frequency questionnaire comprising 31 food items. Results: The median UIC was 92 μg/L (n= 777), which according to WHO reflects insufficient iodine intake. The median UIE was 120 μg/ 24 h (n= 49). In the large study, median 24 -hour iodine intake from food and total iodine intake was 110 μg/day and 148 μg/day. In 24 -hour recall, the median iodine intake from food and total intake was 114 μg/day and 143 μg/day. The median habitual iodine intake from food and total was 117 μg/day and 149 μg/day. Milk/dairy was the main dietary iodine source (contributing ~ 50 %), followed by seafood (contributing 25 %). The median iodine intake estimated from UIC and UIE was 157 μg/day and 133 μg/day (n= 49). The predictors for UIC were smoking, low metabolism, maternal age, and iodine from supplements. Together they explain 11 % of the variance in UIC. Conclusions: The findings from the present study indicate suboptimal iodine status due to insufficient iodine intake in pregnant women in Norway, shown through UIC and estimated iodine intake...|$|R
