40|$|The {{adsorption}} of sterically stabilized colloids at water/oil (w/o) interfaces is studied experimentally by {{the formation}} of Pickering emulsions. Specifically, {{the effect of the}} steric stabilizer with respect to the rate of particle adsorption is investigated. Uniform, micrometer-sized poly(methyl methacrylate) (pMMA) particles, which are sterically stabilized with poly(isobutylene) (pIB), are used. The pIB concentration on the particle surface (GPIB) is controlled during the synthesis by adjusting the pIB/monomer ratio. Pickering emulsions are formed directly by the addition of water to the nonaqueous pMMA dispersions and subsequent emulsification. A strong dependence of the rate of particle adsorption on GPIB is found. The rate constant <b>k</b> <b>for</b> particle <b>adsorption</b> decays exponentially with GPIB, which suggest the use of a Boltzmann factor to model the experimentally found rate constants. The experimental results can be explained when the activation barrier <b>for</b> particle <b>adsorption</b> EA is of the same order as the average kinetic energy EK of a particle colliding with an emulsion droplet, which is equivalent to 105 kBT. Interestingly, this makes EA several orders of magnitude greater than the steric interaction with another particle. A possible mechanism that can lead to such a significant repulsive force is the inhibited drainage of solvent between the particle and o/w interface. Deformation of the o/w interface then occurs, when the solvent does not have time to drain, which results in a dramatic increase in the interfacial energy.

However, those of the samples heated at 673 K increased with increasing time ofthe treatment, during which micro porosity was mainly developed. Activation of the pyrolyzedcedar bark led to drastic increase in specific surface area and pore volume. The increase was due tothe selective formation of the micro pores which distributed mainly less than 0. 35 nm in radius.

This paper examines {{the relationship between}} <b>Kd</b> values <b>for</b> uranium(VI) <b>adsorption</b> and the specific surface area (SSA) of geologic materials. We then investigate the potential applicability of normalising uranium (U) Kd measurements using the SSA, to produce ‘Ka values’ as a generic expression of the affinity of U for the surface. The data for U provide a reasonably coherent set of Ka values on various solid phases, both with and without ligands. The Ka representation provides a way of harmonising datasets obtained for materials having different specific surface areas, and accounting {{for the effects of}} ligands in different systems. In addition, this representation may assist in developing U sorption models for complex materials. However, a significant limitation of the Ka concept is that sorption of radionuclides at trace levels can be dominated by interactions with specific surface sites, whose abundances are not reflected by the SSA. Therefore, calculated Ka values should be interpreted cautiously. © 2011, Elsevie...|$|R

Two soil minerals were employed to demonstrate sorption properties of the dyes; a. soil sample from the B horizon of a Woodburn silt loam and a 30 / 40 grade clean silica sand. Significant hysteresis was observed between adsorption and desorption processes for the two dyes in the Woodburn soil, suggesting that these dyes do not have fully reversible desorption characteristics when organic matter and the Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) play a role in organic chemical mobility. Our soil/water batch experiments show that FD&C Blue Dye No. 1 is suitable for use as a tracer for hydrophilic agro-chemicals that have potential to leach through the soil.

The electric resistance in dry and wet atmospheres at 350 °C was strongly increased by humid aging. From the results of oxygen partial pressure dependence of the electric resistance, the oxygen adsorption equilibrium constants (<b>K</b> 1; <b>for</b> O− <b>adsorption,</b> <b>K</b> 2; <b>for</b> O 2 − adsorption) were estimated {{on the basis of the}} theoretical model of oxygen adsorption.

The sensor response to hydrogen in dry and wet atmosphere at 350 °C was clearly improved by humid aging.

Identical behavior of the monomer-monomer reaction and the voter model is also found in an ‘‘epidemic’’ analysis, where one considers the evolution of a surface poisoned by one species, except for a small patch.

Activated Carbon (AC) has been proposed as a potential adsorbent due to its natural affinity for CO 2 and {{to the possibility of}} tailoring textural properties and surface chemistry to enhance capacity and selectivity. An AC commercial sample was functionalized with monoethanolamine (MEA) in order to obtain nitrogen-enriched AC with two different loadings (ACN 10 and ACN 20). Samples characterization was carried out by nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K, XPS, FTIR and adsorption microcalorimetry. CO 2 equilibrium adsorption experiments were accomplished in a volumetric system in the pressure range of vacuum up to 10 bar, at 298 and 348 K. Impregnated activated carbon presented different chemical and textural characteristics with a significant reduction in the surface area, depending on the amine loading. A high adsorption capacity at room temperature and high pressure was observed for the pristine AC as compared to the modified samples. The reduction in surface area affected the adsorption capacity of CO 2 at 298 and 348 <b>K,</b> except <b>for</b> <b>adsorption</b> on ACN 10 at 348 K, which suggests the occurrence of chemisorption.

30|$|To the {{question}} of the surface area, in the oXiris membrane, the microstructure and the chemical composition of the AN 69 polymer offer a unique context <b>for</b> bulk <b>adsorption</b> of middle molecular weight proteins, the high water content of the hydrogel making the polymer chains easily accessible [8]. This implies that the surface area accessible <b>for</b> <b>adsorption</b> is considerably increased, far above the surface area that is at the blood membrane interface (i.e., 1.5 [*]m 2 for oXiris). Sakai et al. have notably proposed a model to simulate hydrogel total surface accessible <b>for</b> <b>adsorption</b> [9]. In case of oXiris, the total theoretical surface area accessible <b>for</b> <b>adsorption</b> would basically consist of approx. 17, 000 [*]m 2. Of note, Nishida et al. have shown that the AN 69 hydrogel membrane does not reach saturation at supra pathological quantities of HMGB- 1 (seven successive pathological injection of 100 [*]μg) [10], further illustrating this point.|$|R
