40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{monitoring}} and control of tap changer mechanism of a transformer implementation in an <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Device</b> (IED) is discussed. It has been a custom for decades to provide a separate panel for {{on load tap changer}} control for monitoring the tap position. However, this facility cannot either record or transfer the information to remote control centers. As there is a technology shift towards the smart grid protection and control standards, the need for implementing remote control and monitoring has necessitated the implementation of this feature in numerical relays. This paper deals with the programming, settings and logic implementation which is applicable to both IEC 61850 compatible and non-compatible IEDs thereby eliminating the need for separate tap changer control equipment. The monitoring mechanism has been implemented in a 28 MVA, 110 / 6. 9 kV transformer with 16 tap position with GE make T 60 IED at Ultratech cement limited Gulbarga, Karnataka and is in successful service.

50|$|Early {{electrical}} substations required manual switching or {{adjustment of}} equipment, and manual {{collection of data}} for load, energy consumption, and abnormal events. As the complexity of distribution networks grew, it became economically necessary to automate supervision and control of substations from a centrally attended point, to allow overall coordination in case of emergencies and to reduce operating costs. Early efforts to remote control substations used dedicated communication wires, often run alongside power circuits. Power-line carrier, microwave radio, fiber optic cables as well as dedicated wired remote control circuits have all been applied to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) for substations. The development of the microprocessor made for an exponential {{increase in the number}} of points that could be economically controlled and monitored. Today, standardized communication protocols such as DNP3, IEC 61850 and Modbus, to list a few, are used to allow multiple <b>intelligent</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> to communicate with each other and supervisory control centers. Distributed automatic control at substations is one element of the so-called smart grid.|$|E
50|$|COMTRADE {{files are}} {{typically}} generated by <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>Devices</b> (IEDs), {{such as an}} electronic protective relay, in electrical substations during power systems disturbances. These IEDs are monitoring the electrical characteristics of the power system by digitally sampling measurements of the current, voltage, power, frequency, etc. at a high speed. The IEDs then use digital signal processing algorithms on that data to detect abnormal conditions in the power system so that automated control actions {{can be taken to}} prevent damage to the power system. When faults are detected, the IEDs will record the digitized transient fault data that was used during processing into a file using the COMTRADE file format. Analysis tools can then download the COMTRADE file and calculate useful information related to the disturbance. For instance, a COMTRADE recording of the fault current absorbed by a transformer prior to the circuit breaker opening can be used to calculate the total energy dissipated by the transformer which helps the utility to more accurately estimate the impact of that fault on the lifetime of the transformer. COMTRADE files from multiple substations can be used collectively to perform forensic analysis of large scale power disturbance events (e.g. blackouts) to determine the root cause of the disturbance, help improve system protection and guide future mitigation strategies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — IEC 61850 is {{a recent}} {{standard}} in substation automation system (SAS) aiming mainly at interoperability. Interoperability is achieved by standardizing communications and data between <b>intelligent</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> (IEDs).

40|$|The Industrial Ethernet {{has become}} a way to build {{distributed}} systems in industrial networks which must provide predictable performance and maintainability. Industrial applications require time-critical processing, which can be guaranteed within soft or hard real-time environments, Where applications' responses require deterministic processing time, the hard real-time environment is requested. The Fieldbus protocols are the standard way to connect instruments on the Ethernet-based communication. Fieldbuses require synchronisation and dedicated application-specific integrated circuits, what leaves space for alternate, more common solutions. This thesis presents design, implementation, and evaluation of the novel Real-Time Driver Model asynchronous communication stack called 61850 CS API. 61850 CS stack is implemented in an <b>intelligent</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> to enable real-time IEC 61850 GOOSE Ethernet communications in electrical substations. The presented 61850 CS implementation enables simultaneous flow of real-time and non-real-time Ethernet traffic over the same physical network interface controller. The same technology supports running arbitrary real-time Ethernet traffic and non real-time Ethernet traffic simultaneously and its implementation is general enough to enable an API use on different architectures and to comply with different industrial Ethernet requirements. And more, since 61850 CS doesn't affect CSMA/CD mechanism, it doesn't need any master nodes, which increases the system availability. The presented solution was implemented as an application programming interface for feeder protection and control (FPC 680) <b>intelligent</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>device</b> relay.
