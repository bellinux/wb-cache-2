Consequently, the aim of this research is to develop an integrative conceptual framework that can support gender inclusivity <b>in</b> <b>games.</b> The development of the Gender Inclusivity Framework (GIF) aimed to understand the makeup of gender inclusivity <b>in</b> <b>games,</b> how to define gender inclusivity <b>in</b> <b>games</b> and measure the level of gender inclusiveness <b>in</b> <b>games.</b> Drawing upon established theories and prior research findings, the proposed framework suggests that gender inclusivity <b>in</b> <b>games</b> can be determined by 3 dimensions: (1) gameplay, which describes the game behaviour and include non-violent action (NVA), game support (GS), forgiving gameplay (FG), non-violent challenge (NVC), feedback system (FS), variety of activities (ACT), personalization (PER) and collaboration (COLL); (2) content, that relates to the aesthetics elements of a game and consists of character/avatar portrayal (AVP), game world graphics (GW), sound/music (SM) and storyline (STOR) and; (3) genre, which categorizes games into twelve broad genres: racing, simulation, classic/board, strategy, sports, shooting, role playing game, platform, children, puzzle/quiz, action and adventure. Each dimension in the framework is divided into individual components that can be modified or further investigated in future studies. Each component in combination describes the dimension in terms that can be measured and evaluated in empirical studies. Hence, the combination of dimensions and components used to construct the framework provide the description of gender-inclusivity <b>in</b> <b>games,</b> which <b>in</b> turn is expected to predict the degree of gender-inclusiveness <b>in</b> <b>games.</b> For educators, GIF allows the identification of gender-inclusivity components <b>in</b> <b>games</b> so informed decisions can be made on how to evaluate and choose appropriate games for classroom activities. For researchers, GIF provides a common framework in which to conceptualize their research and make it easier to see how individual variables fit into the larger picture. For game designers, GIF enables deconstruction of the concept of gender inclusivity <b>in</b> <b>games</b> into smaller, conceptually distinct and manageable component to guide the design of gender inclusivity <b>in</b> <b>games...</b>|$|R
