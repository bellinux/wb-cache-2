40|$|The {{examination}} of the fetal heart {{is part of the}} comprehensive fetal scan, but this examination is still considered a challenge even for experienced sonographers. Over the years, the number of ultrasound techniques used in fetal cardiology impressively increased and no other fetal organ is examined with as many modalities as the fetal heart including high resolution two dimensional (2 D) imaging, M-mode examination, spectral, color, power, high-definition digital Doppler, B flow as well as tissue Doppler. It is, however, common knowledge that despite the availability of all these technologies, screening programs, especially when limited {{to the study of the}} “four chamber view”, have shown disappointing low detection rates for congenital heart disease (CHD). Although the identification of CHD can be improved by routinely visualizing the outflow tracts, their diagnosis is greatly affected by the skill of the operator as well as his ability to interpret the findings. Very recently, three- and four- dimensional (3 D and 4 D) technologies have been introduced in fetal cardiology and have revolutionized the way in which it is possible to study the heart. 4 D ultrasonography may reduce the operator dependency of CHD diagnosis and adds the possibility to obtain offline virtual planes in cardiac examinations, views of the fetal heart difficult or impossible to obtain with conventional 2 D ultrasound. This new fetal cardiology ebook, we believe, will be of great value for all practicing clinicians wanting to start the study of the fetal heart with 4 D ultrasonography. We have chosen a panel of contributors that are both leaders in this field and can represent the differences in practice between Europe and United States. This is a comprehensive guide intended for anyone interested in fetal heart scanning performing both routine screening ultrasonographic examinations and targeted heart scans. It aims to assist the reader with the following questions: how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> technology to acquire cardiac volumes?; how do I handle cardiac volume data sets after acquisition?; how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> improve diagnosis and definition of CHD?

For instance, Annie felt that her students failed to see connections between the science content and the engineering design challenge that asked students to create a device to desalinate water. This was most notable during a stations activity, which included such activities as dissolving salt in water and examining saturation using a PhET simulation. She commented, “I think it was too many things and that they [the students] didn’t connect. They didn’t have a flow where they’re like, ‘Oh, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> information from class to do this next station.’” Further, she was not confident in her students’ ability to connect to mathematics content, which might explain its limited appearance in her implementation, “I don’t {{think they would have}} got the math connection. They would have, ‘Ok, we have to measure this,’ but why? What does surface area or volume…or you know, why? Why does that make a difference?” Sandy was also not sure if her students made connections, but noted that students used scientific language during the engineering design challenge, “Um, ‘cause I did hear them using some of the vocabulary and whatnot. ‘Which one’s the best conductor? Which has the lowest specific heat?’” Because of the emphasis on science, Sandy believed that her students were successful in learning that content.|$|E

Making the invisible, visible. The word ‘drawing’ retains a dynamic, energetic & incipient value in which resonates well against {{the nature of the}} site. The idea of friction is imperative to both of these concepts, drawing and site, and is why I began my investigation into the abandoned site at Clifton Terrace with pencil and paper. Kumutoto Lane is an example of unfinished built form and I would like to see if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> awkward abandonment to express the idea of drawing as a catalyst for architectural design. A poetical expansion to how the road draws a line through the infrastructure that we live in.

In terms of form, the project will generate an architectural reaction providing an ‘office space’ for the abandoned Ministry of Works Department. I have been really cautious to not let the specificness of the site camouflage how I am working on it, essentially appointing the Clifton terrace carpark as a case study. Ideologies of this research assimilated into dynamic forms to flow in and around the existing landscape, avoiding a static solution in which I believe will contradict the nature of the site.

Under certain conditions, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> variation to estimate the marginal product of labor and compare it to workers 2 ̆ 7 pay. I find that workers are paid below their marginal product on average, which is at odds with a simple neoclassical model of pay determination but is consistent with a variety of alternative models that introduce frictions such as search or moving costs. The degree to which workers are underpaid also rises with worker tenure. This is consistent with the Becker (1962) hypothesis that firms bear a portion of the cost of investment in human capital. ^ Chapter 2 : Numerous theories posit that the fiscal decisions of one jurisdiction influence the fiscal decisions of its neighbors.

40|$|Participatory design {{approach}} emphasizes user involvement {{to contribute}} to interactive systems throughout the design process. The potential user participates in many activities in different physical meetings and workshops. This approach helps the designers to develop better tools to support users work {{but it is difficult}} to get them to co-design at the same place and time for many reasons. I have also experienced this kind of difficulty in the school projects involving users in the design process. Many new technologies nowadays have been introduced and used for different purposes so I have asked myself how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> to get control over this kind of difficulty. And how to bring people together online to co- design instead of having any physical workshops. Today, many online technologies are used to facilitate PD activities and bring the potential users together regardless of time and space. Some researchers have investigated online media platforms that people are familiar with, for example Facebook to reach their users. Some of them use online tools developed for conducting participatory design online. This study investigates how to design remote/online meeting formats to engage people with different media habits in the early stages of participatory design to get inspiration for redesigning a website. It is very important for a participatory design at a distance to understand and adapt to individual media habits and technological skills because this aspect is crucial for the success of bringing the participants together online and persuade them to contribute including making them willing to involve and perform their online work tasks. The project facilitator should get to know already in the beginning of the project about different communication ways that each participant prefers and usually uses in their daily life. To make sure that the facilitator can reach the potential users and bring them to collaborate online and give their contribution to a design in time. This study shows also that the relation between the participants and the temple or the facilitator is crucial for the success of getting them to contribute. Another aspect that the facilitator needs to take into account is to know about the users’ technological background. This can be used as basic information to choose online tools or media platforms to design online meeting formats to engage people in the design process. The tools that match the participants’ skills make them focus more on their work tasks rather than technical issues. But even if someone has high computer skills, it does not mean that he wants to work with whatever tools in some online activities, the facilitator has to adapt according to what they prefer or give them choices and flexibility. In addition, it is not enough only to observe and provide different channels for the participants to get feedback. It is hard to observe people working online and not everyone says what they think to the facilitator. To know how the users interact with and think about different online meeting formats during the design project by doing feedback interview after each PD stage helps the facilitator to improve online meeting formats for the next steps. The facilitator gets possibilities to repeat and clarify some issues during the project, encourages the participant to continue or contribute more, and prepares them for the next steps. The participants get better understanding of the project and motivation to move on...|$|E
40|$|Conflict {{archaeology}} is {{a fairly}} new discipline {{and is in the}} process of defining its methods and theories. Recently, the American Battlefield Protection Program has started requiring that grant applicants perform a KOCOA analysis. KOCOA is a modern military technique and stands for Key terrain, Obstacle, Cover and Concealment, Observation, and Avenues of Approach. However, this method was developed for modern warfare, and its adoption by the archaeological community has not yet been analyzed. I argue that this method needs a few modifications to make it more applicable to historical research and that it can be broadened to investigate more complex questions regarding decision-making processes. In its current form, KOCOA only looks at how a landscape was used during conflict based on the results of what happened. <b>I</b> contend we <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> method to analyze the landscape and look at the decisions that went into selecting it. Employing KOCOA in this manner will allow us to understand how militaries adapted, or failed to adapt, to a given landscape. The Second Seminole War in Florida (1835 - 1842) can serve as an ideal case study. For one thing, the military had never experienced the Florida environment, and therefore adaptations to landscape utilization will be readily apparent. Also, in the early 19 th-century, the military as a cultural institution indoctrinated its members through extensive training at the United States Military Academy in West Point, NY, and I propose this standardized education had a significant negative effect on the shape, direction, and outcome of the Second Seminole War due to the gap between the knowledge gained through training and the knowledge needed in the field when fighting a war with Indians in the swamps and hammocks of Florida. Using modern military theory, the purpose of this research is to develop tools to measure how traditional European educational methods, which officers received while at the Military Academy, hindered their ability to adapt to the unique and challenging environment they encountered while trying to remove the Seminole Indians from the Florida territory. Conflict archaeology is also well suited to investigate the more human side, such as the decision-making processes and adaptations required, moving beyond the 2 ̆ 2 what 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 how 2 ̆ 2 aspects of conflict to the 2 ̆ 2 why. 2 ̆ 2 One traditional approach to conflict archaeology is KOCOA. As used archaeologically, KOCOA employs modern cartographic information. Those participating in the conflict, however, would not have had access to this level of detail. Therefore, I propose that KOCOA be revised to incorporate the knowledge that would have been available to the decision makers at the time of the conflict. The aim of this research is to expand the methodologies of conflict archaeology to include indirect expressions of warfare and to incorporate them into a meaningful discussion of their role in the outcome of conflict. To accomplish this, I have developed a model against which hypotheses about the decision-making processes and their effectiveness can be compared...|$|R

40|$|Master of Regional and Community PlanningDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningHuston GibsonThis {{document}} is a Master’s Project for a proposal of a sustainable community amenity {{to be implemented}} in Union, Nebraska. The idea that I have considered best fit for Union {{is the concept of}} a multi-functional structure that will have many uses, such as office space for city government, a community center, a visitor center, public restrooms, and indoor and outdoor recreational space. There may also be space that can be utilized for a small commercial function, such as a coffee shop, bakery, or convenience store. Right now, Union only has a handful of businesses, most of which only operate part-time. There is nowhere currently where a person can purchase a drink, a meal, groceries, or even use a restroom. Although Union lacks those amenities, Union is home to two historic finds: an old Union Pacific Railroad caboose car and a single-room jail cell. Without a proper place to showcase Union’s unique character or a place for people to stop in the town, Union may take a turn downhill economically and socially. Many sites in the town are deteriorating and are in definite need of rehabilitation. The implementation of the proposed structure will {{improve the quality of life}} for the community as well as benefit passersby by providing an attraction. The social equity of the community is an important concern and providing a space where the community can thrive within Union is an integral factor for sustainability in the town. By also targeting the people driving through Union, the town can benefit economically by getting these visitors to stop and spend money in the town. Environmentally, Union can be improved by addressing the aging properties along their main street. Many parcels along Main Street are potential brownfield sites and could be revitalized through cleanup funding opportunities. Within this document I will be identifying potential sites and funding opportunities and focusing on composing a feasible course of action for implementing the multi-functional structure. Research has been done through many methods including literature reviews, case studies, site visits, and through a community survey process. Funding for my research is provided by the Technical Assistance to Brownfields (TAB) program through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) because of the potential brownfield interests in Union. Working with Union, Nebraska constitutes a valid planning situation because it is in need of essential planning practices that can boost the social, economic and environmental equity of the town. With only about 230 residents, Union has only one governmental official, the city clerk. The city clerk must wear many hats in order to keep Union running smoothly. Having help with planning recommendations will greatly benefit the town and take some weight off of the city clerk’s work load. By focusing my efforts on creating a concept for a multi-functional building, I could produce the optimum outcome in the most efficient manner. The final goal of my work is to not only graduate with a Master’s Degree in Regional and Community Planning through the College of Architecture, Planning and Design at Kansas State University, but also to impact the town of Union, Nebraska in a positive and lasting way. I am truly pleased to be able to produce something that could improve the quality of life in a realistic way for a real community. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> project to make any positive influence in a community, then I have succeeded...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have found}} that experts often fail as good teachers, mainly {{because there is a}} lack of {{communication}} within their specific area (Feldon, 2007). Experts may routinely underestimate how difficult a task can be for a newcomer (Hinds, 1999) and even when attempting to make a task easier, they omit information a novice would find valuable (Hinds, Patterson, 2 ̆ 6 Pfeffer, 2001) because they unintentionally assume that non-experts are aware of and possess knowledge that only those already familiar in the field might have, and would thus know what they are talking about. Furthermore, there are factors controllable by the professor, and not the students, that can determine a degree of student success (not to imply that student’s don’t need to take their share in responsibility for their learning). The lecture style and format of a classroom can change the outcome of how much students learn. For example, the use of active learning exercises or videos during lecture can improve students’ recollection of material (Lawson, 1995, VanderStoep et al), and the implementation of multiple-choice versus short answer exams can have an effect on how students study and learn subject material (Scouller, 1998). It is important that professors and experts be aware of these factors, and manipulate them as they see fit (i. e. improve efficiency and quality of learning). However, it has been found that the correlation between teacher experience and effectiveness is statistically low (Hattie, 2009 p. 118), implying that most experts fail to pass on their expertise to upcoming generations. This should serve as a red flag to most, especially because the extreme cost of a college education should guarantee quality education. As a student here at URI, I have witnessed the good and the bad professors. As a future college professor, I recognize the need to implement a personal formal training, not only of the field of expertise, but also on how to communicate that expertise. This requires empathy and understanding towards the student experience. My project involves being trained as an academic coach through the Academic Enhancement Center, where I work with students individually to determine the roots of their academic struggles, so that we can later develop plans on how to negate the causes. This allows me to observe a wide variety of students’ experiences from many different backgrounds, because realistically, a student’s struggle is much more complicated than them “not studying enough. ” Furthermore, I am exposed to the science of learning, which explains how students can learn information efficiently, and, equally as important, how they can apply that information to real world problems. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> information to my advantage to design lesson plans that will strategically and efficiently prime students for their exams. Finally, through the conduction of a study skills and a test-taking strategies workshop both catered towards freshman enrolled in the College of Environmental and Life Sciences, I gain real experience leading a classroom, thus exposing myself to the everyday troubles that experts must overcome in the classroom setting (such as getting disinterested students to pay attention to lesson material), while also applying all that I have learned through this project. These workshops are designed to help students within the AEC and CELS community succeed academically, whose success will be measured by a Survey Monkey questioner...|$|E
