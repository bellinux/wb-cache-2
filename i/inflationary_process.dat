50|$|The price/wage spiral {{refers to}} the {{adversarial}} nature of the wage bargain in modern capitalism. (It {{is part of the}} conflict theory of inflation, referring to the objective side of the <b>inflationary</b> <b>process.)</b> Workers and employers usually do not get together to agree on the value of real wages. Instead, workers attempt to protect their real wages (or to attain a target real wage) by pushing for higher money (or nominal) wages. Thus, if they expect price inflation - or have experienced price inflation in the past - they push for higher money wages. If they are successful, this raises the costs faced by their employers. To protect the real value of their profits (or to attain a target profit rate or rate of return on investment), employers then pass the higher costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This encourages workers to push for higher money wages.|$|E

Second, the distinction between exogenous and endogenous money supply is important for a proper taxonomy of inflation theories.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a selective {{review of the}} literature on the determinants of inflation in Nigeria, analyzes the dominant factors influencing inflation, presents the empirical results of a reduced-form elasticities model, and discusses the policy implications of the empirical results. The results of this analysis confirm the basic findings of earlier studies, namely that monetary expansion, driven mainly by expansionary fiscal policies, explains to a large degree the <b>inflationary</b> <b>process</b> in Nigeria. Other important factors are the devaluation of the naira and agroclimatic conditions. With respect to the depreciation of the naira, it was found that concurrent fiscal and monetary policies had a major influence on its impact on inflation. Given the considerable role of food commodities in the CPI, agroclimatic conditions (rainfall) were found to {{play a significant role in}} overall movements in prices and should be fully taken into consideration in any analysis of the <b>inflationary</b> <b>process</b> in Nigeria. ...|$|E
40|$|While {{the concept}} of "imported inflation" and its {{relevance}} for open economies have received considerable attention in the policy-oriented literature, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been constructed as carefully as might be desirable {{in view of the}} controversial nature of the subject. The <b>inflationary</b> <b>process</b> can be transmitted to a country by developments in international capital and money markets or through the interaction of goods markets in one country with those {{of the rest of the}} world. The debate concerning the former transmission mechanism involves the difficulties in dichotomizing the balance of payments and the domestic money supply through the sterilization of foreign exchange gains or losses. In this paper, major emphasis will be given to the transmission of the <b>inflationary</b> <b>process</b> through the goods and services markets. Primarily,we are interested in investigating the determinants of the rate of inflation for a small country which, because of its size, is forced to accept certain conditions imposed by the external environment. ...|$|E
