25|$|Animal {{husbandry}} and Integrated Crop Management (ICM) {{often are}} just two branches of one agricultural enterprise. In modern agriculture, animal husbandry and crop production must be understood as interlinked sectors which cannot be looked at in isolation, as the context of agricultural systems leads to tight interdependencies. Uncoupling animal husbandry from arable production (too high stocking rates) is therefore not considered {{in accordance with the}} principles and objectives of <b>Integrated</b> <b>Farming</b> (Lütke Entrup et al., 1998 1). Accordingly, holistic concepts for <b>Integrated</b> <b>Farming</b> or Integrated Farm Management such as the EISA <b>Integrated</b> <b>Farming</b> Framework, and the concept of sustainable agriculture are increasingly developed, promoted and implemented at the global level.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether an}} <b>integrated</b> <b>farm</b> that owns both {{crops and livestock}} is more resilient under global warming than a specialized farm in crops. Using around 9000 farm surveys across Africa, we explore how farmers choose one of the farm types and how the net revenue of each type varies across the range of climate in Africa. The results indicate that an <b>integrated</b> <b>farm</b> increases in number while a specialized farm decreases across Africa under climate predictions for 2060. The relative profitability of each system against each other also changes. An <b>integrated</b> <b>farm</b> becomes relatively more profitable over specialized farms half a century from now. The impacts of climate change on <b>integrated</b> <b>farms</b> range from 9 % loss to 27 % gain depending on climate scenarios.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{possible}} changes in occurrences of pests and diseases in winter wheat {{as a result of}} differences in farm management, a monitoring study was carried out between 1993 and 1997 in The Netherlands to assess pest and disease incidence in winter wheat produced by conventional, integrated and organic methods. For the characterization of the different management types and for the interpretation of differences in pest and disease levels among management types information was gathered by yearly questionnaires on field characteristics, crop rotation, tillage, seeding, fertilizers, growth regulators, fungicides; insecticides and weed control in 558 fields. This paper reports on these various aspects of crop management at the conventional, <b>integrated</b> and organic <b>farms</b> investigated. Two groups of <b>integrated</b> <b>farms</b> were hereby distinguished; a group of pioneer farmers (Innovation project (IP)) and a later-started group (A 2000 project). Winter wheat cultivation on conventionally managed farms was very similar to cultivation at the <b>integrated</b> <b>farms</b> run under the A 2000 project. By comparison, the IP <b>integrated</b> <b>farms</b> used a greater range of seed mixtures, sowed later and made less, and less frequent, use of growth regulators and pesticides. At both conventional and <b>integrated</b> <b>farms</b> there is an ongoing intensification of fertilizer and pesticide use. Management at 'integrated' farms is consequently increasingly similar to that at conventionally managed holdings. The organic farms differ in virtually every aspect of their management, and their management regime shows little variation over time. In the discussion the representativeness of the farms studied and the differences between, and the changes within, the IP and A 2000 <b>integrated</b> <b>farms</b> are considered. It is concluded that the IP <b>integrated</b> <b>farms</b> meet the government's environmental targets with respect to pesticide use, but not with respect to pesticide dependence...|$|R

25|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, however, {{that there are}} also {{critical}} voices from environmental organisations for example. That is {{in part due to}} the fact that there are European Organic Regulations such as (EC) No 834/2007 or the new draft from 2014 but no comparable regulations for <b>Integrated</b> <b>Farming.</b> Whereas organic farming and the “Bio-Siegel” in Germany for example are legally protected, EU Commission has not yet considered to start working on a comparable framework or blueprint for <b>Integrated</b> <b>Farming.</b> When products are marketed as “Controlled Integrated Produce”, according control mechanisms and quality-labels are not based on national or European directives but are established and handled by private organisations and quality schemes such as LEAF Marque.|$|E

25|$|The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO {{promotes}} Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as {{the preferred}} approach to crop protection and regards it as {{a pillar of}} both sustainable intensification of crop production and pesticide risk reduction”.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} economics of vertical integration in poultry industry in Ogun and Oyo States. The {{study examines}} the production systems and analyses costs {{and returns to}} non-integrated and vertically <b>integrated</b> poultry <b>farms.</b> Primary data were generated using structured questionnaires in a field survey of 100 non-integrated poultry <b>farms,</b> 70 partially <b>integrated</b> poultry <b>farms</b> and 40 fully <b>integrated</b> poultry <b>farms.</b> The analytical techniques employed include descriptive statistics and budgetary analysis. The gross margin analysis reveals that the fully integrated poultry production systems have the highest gross margin while the non-integrated poultry farms have the lowest gross margin per 1000 birds. The gross margin per 1000 bird realized by non-integrated poultry <b>farms,</b> partially <b>integrated</b> poultry <b>farms</b> and fully <b>integrated</b> poultry <b>farms</b> are N 758, 828. 07, N 909, 973. 06 and N 985, 645. 12, respectively. Likewise, the net farm income per 1000 birds for fully <b>integrated</b> poultry <b>farm</b> is {{higher than that of}} partially <b>integrated</b> poultry <b>farm</b> which is in turn higher than that of non-integrated poultry farms.

25|$|Integrated Farming- UNI 11233-2009 new European {{agriculture}} organic standard (IF) or {{integrated production}} {{is a whole}} organic farm management system which aims to deliver more sustainable agriculture. It is a dynamic approach which {{can be applied to}} any farming system around the world. It involves attention to detail and continuous improvement in all areas of a farming business through informed management processes. <b>Integrated</b> <b>Farming</b> combines the best of modern tools and technologies with traditional practices according to a given site and situation. In simple words, it means using many ways of cultivation in a small space or land.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} to follow, various {{national}} and regional initiatives and projects were formed. These include LEAF (Linking Environment And Farming) in the UK, FNL (Fördergemeinschaft Nachhaltige Landwirtschaft e.V.) in Germany, FARRE (Forum des Agriculteurs Responsables Respectueux de l'Environnement) in France, FILL (Fördergemeinschaft Integrierte Landbewirtschaftung Luxemburg) or OiB (Odling i Balans) in Sweden. However, there are few if any figures on the uptake of <b>Integrated</b> <b>Farming</b> in the major crops throughout Europe for example, leading to a recommendation by the European Economic and Social Committee in February 2014, that the EU should carry out an in-depth analysis of integrated production in Europe {{in order to obtain}} insights into the current situation and potential developments. There is evidence, however, that between 60 and 80% of pome, stone and soft fruits were grown, controlled and marketed according to “Integrated Production Guidelines” in 1999 already in Germany for example. In the UK, 22% of fresh fruit and vegetables are grown to Integrated Farm Management standards as recognised by the LEAF Marque.|$|E
