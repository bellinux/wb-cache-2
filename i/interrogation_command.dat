2500|$|Jordan {{asserted}} he was {{a scapegoat}} [...] "because he is a reservist, is considered expendable". [...] It was his belief that interrogation procedures were the responsibility of Colonel Thomas Pappas, the intelligence brigade commander and highest-ranking officer at Abu Ghraib, and Captain Carolyn Wood, leader of a unit within the interrogation center called the <b>Interrogation</b> <b>Command</b> Element. [...] Neither of these two officers has been charged, although Pappas was fined $8,000 for approving the use of dogs during an interrogation without higher approval. [...] During the trial, witnesses for the prosecution appeared to support some of Jordan's claims. Pappas testified that Jordan's responsibilities involved {{improving the quality of}} life for soldiers at the base and [...] "improving the flow of intelligence information". [...] He admitted that he advised Jordan to [...] "let the experienced interrogators run the interrogations." [...] Pappas also testified that Jordan was not in charge of the military police who ran the prison and who were responsible for some of the abuses. He further stipulated that military police were in charge of the November 24, 2003 weapons search which he had personally observed, and found no issues with. [...] Other soldiers testified that Jordan was not present during any of the abuses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new {{wireless}} sensing network {{paradigm is}} presented for structural monitoring applications. In this approach, both power and data <b>interrogation</b> <b>commands</b> are conveyed via a mobile-agent that {{is sent to}} sensor nodes to perform intended interrogations, which can alleviate several limitations of the traditional sensing networks. Furthermore, the mobile-agent provides computation power to make near real-time assessments on the structural conditions. This paper will discuss such prototype systems, which are used to interrogate impedance-based sensors for structural health monitoring applications. Our wireless sensor node is specifically designed to accept various energy sources, including wireless energy transmission, and to be wirelessly triggered on an as-needed basis by the mobile-agent or other sensor nodes. The capabilities of this proposed sensing network paradigm are demonstrated in the laboratory and the field...|$|R

40|$|Sensor {{networking}} is {{an important}} first-line component in any structural health monitoring (SHM) application. We present how an interdisciplinary team of structural, mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers are tackling a large-scale civil infrastructure SHM application by proposing a new variant on sensor networking. Most sensor arrays are typically interrogated via conventional wired networks, which require centralized processing and powering. Conversely, recent technology advances in embedded architectures and power harvesting have allowed wireless networks to be developed, where each individual sensor is individually powered and communicates with neighboring sensors or substations via hopping protocols. This work will present a hybrid approach to sensor array interrogation, where both power and data <b>interrogation</b> <b>commands</b> are conveyed via an autonomous aerial vehicle that is sent (via remote piloting or GPS autopilot programming) to each sensor or node to perform the individual interrogation. Power {{does not have to}} reside at the sensor node, relaxing battery or other such powering requirements. This work will discuss such a prototype system, which will be used to interrogate impedancebased and capacitive-based preload sensors on a full-scale bridge...|$|R

Captured enemy agents were taken to Camp 020, Latchmere House, for <b>interrogation.</b> This was <b>commanded</b> by Colonel Robin Stephens. There was a Reserve Camp, Camp 020R, at Huntercombe which was used mainly for long term detention of prisoners.|$|R
50|$|On 17 May 1945 {{the enemy}} encircled the Indian National Army. So they {{surrendered}} without any surrender ceremony. They {{were put into}} prison at Pegu. Shah Nawaz and Dhillon were taken to No. 3 Field <b>Interrogation</b> Centre under <b>command</b> of Major C. Ore on 18 May 1945. Later on 31 May, they were sent to Rangoon Central Jail. On 1945 Khan was brought to Calcutta by plane and from there, sent to Delhi by train. On 1945 he was put in the Red Fort and interrogated by Mr. Bannerjee of the Central Intelligence Department. The interrogation was over by {{the third week of}} July. On the August 1945, Shah Nawaz, Sahgal, Dhillon and Khan were jointly summoned to the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre for the first time. It {{was the beginning of the}} first INA trial at Red Fort. On 17 September 1945 they were served a copy of charge sheet. The main charge was waging war against the King. The news of trial was made public through the press and All India Radio.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2002, he was {{requested}} by HQ, Department of the Army, {{to travel to}} Guantanamo, Cuba, to evaluate the interrogation operations of the newly established task force (JTF 161) of Global War on Terror detainees. His report to the Task Force's commander strongly recommended the adoption of sophisticated, developmental-based operations {{along the lines of}} earlier successful projects Herrington had undertaken in other contingencies. In December 2003, he again was asked by the Army to serve as a consultant, this time by traveling to Baghdad, Iraq to evaluate both interrogation operations and the command's (Combined Joint Task Force-7) conduct with respect to the growing insurgency. As in Guantanamo, Herrington's report was critical of the command's operations, and became controversial when it was leaked to the [...] "Washington Post." [...] In that report, Herrington criticized the <b>command's</b> <b>interrogation</b> practices, and pointed out that command operations, particularly [...] "kinetic" [...] operations in search of Saddam Hussein and insurgents, were counterproductive [...] In 2006, Herrington mentored a class of interrogators at Fort Bliss, Texas, on the use of non-abusive interrogation techniques.|$|R
40|$|Pilots' use of and {{responses}} to a traffic alert and collision-avoidance system (TCAS 2) in simulated air carrier line operations are discribed in Volume 1. TCAS 2 monitors the positions of nearby aircraft by means of transponder <b>interrogation,</b> and it <b>commands</b> a climb or descent which conflicting aircraft are projected to reach an unsafe closest point-of-approach within 20 to 25 seconds. A different level {{of information about the}} location of other air traffic was presented to each of three groups of flight crews during their execution of eight simulated air carrier flights. A fourth group of pilots flew the same segments without TCAS 2 equipment. Traffic conflicts were generated at intervals during the flights; many of the conflict aircraft were visible to the flight crews. The TCAS equipment successfully ameliorated the seriousness of all conflicts; three of four non-TCAS crews had hazardous encounters. Response times to TCAS maneuver commands did not differ {{as a function of the}} amount of information provided, nor did response accuracy. Differences in flight experience did not appear to contribute to the small performance differences observed. Pilots used the displays of conflicting traffic to maneuver to avoid unseen traffic before maneuver advisories were issued by the TCAS equipment. The results indicate: (1) that pilots utilize TCAS effectively within the response times allocated by the TCAS logic, and (2) that TCAS 2 is an effective collision avoidance device. Volume 2 contains the appendices referenced in Volume 1, providing details of the experiment and the results, and the text of two reports written in support of the program...|$|R
