This research provides information on the technical efficiency of <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> {{as well as the}} business cycle of the economy in Bali. A stochastic frontier method is used to analyze the technical efficiency of <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> while the Bry-Boschan algorithm is used to estimate the business cycle of the <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> which are relatively efficient. The estimation result indicates that the efficient <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> in Bali are trade, hotel & restaurant (thr) sector and agriculture sector. Both sectors contribute most on the Bali’s economic output. At the end of the observation period, the economic business cycle in Bali is in a period of contraction. It is estimated that the next quarter will be the expansion period. </p...|$|R

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

5|$|WINDALCO {{reported}} {{a loss of}} 10,000tons of aluminum due to flooding. Manufacturing companies reported J$18.3million (US$296,000) in losses, primarily from suspended operations. In November, the Jamaica Labour Party sought J$3.2billion (US$51.8million) in additional funding to repair roads damaged by Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, Emily, and Wilma. The following month, the Jamaica Agricultural Society received J$5.5million (US$88,266) from the Japanese embassy to assist 500farmers in Portland Parish. The long-term effects of Dennis were limited, with nearly every <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> returning to normal within a few months. The only exceptions were exports of banana and coffee crops, {{both of which were}} still recovering from Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Overall implications to the nation's gross domestic product were negligible, merely flat-lining growth rather than causing decline. However, in combination with the effects of a drought early in 2005, inflation values required adjustment upwards from 9% to 14.3%.|$|E

Agriculture is the leading <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E
5|$|In March, {{hundreds}} {{of political prisoners}} were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming {{that there were no}} further political prisoners in Libya. In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive. Also in 1989, the government founded the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights, to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the <b>economic</b> <b>sector.</b>|$|E
5|$|The nearly {{decade and}} a half of wars greatly {{weakened}} the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade among the new Spanish American nations was less {{than it had been in}} the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.|$|E
