5000|$|A <b>waste</b> <b>pond</b> or {{chemical}} pond {{is a small}} impounded water body used for the disposal of water pollutants, and sometimes utilized {{as a method of}} recycling or decomposing toxic substances. Such <b>waste</b> <b>ponds</b> may be used for regular disposal of pollutant materials or may be used as upset receivers for special pollution events. [...] Often, chemical ponds themselves are addressed for cleanup action after their useful life is over or when a risk of groundwater contamination arises. [...] Peak usage of <b>waste</b> <b>ponds</b> in the United States occurred in the period 1955 to 1985, after which the environmental risks of pond technology were sufficiently understood, such that alternative technologies for waste disposal gradually began to displace many of the <b>waste</b> <b>ponds.</b> <b>Waste</b> <b>ponds</b> often have pond liners, such as concrete or robust synthetic polymeric materials, to prevent infiltration of chemicals to soil or groundwater.|$|R

40|$|Birds are not {{normally}} attracted to <b>waste</b> <b>ponds</b> {{as a food}} source but, rather, {{as a place to}} loaf or rest. This is why sound patterns designed to affect bird behavior act as an effective deterrent to birds in these less attractive sites. The number and species of local or resident birds that frequent the site depend upon the degree of suitability found during their first visit. They can often be discouraged from using a <b>waste</b> <b>pond</b> by eliminating or reducing nearby roosting, loafing, nesting sites, and preferred food sources. Migratory birds present a different problem in that as they move into or fly over an area, on a seasonal basis, large flocks often will visit a <b>waste</b> <b>pond.</b> They are not in- terested in roosting or nesting, just resting and dabbling for food items. By the time they discover that there is no food in the pond, many of them have either absorbed or in- gested a lethal quantity of waste materials. In <b>waste</b> <b>pond</b> situations an integrated management program incorporating sound and visual devices has been effective in repelling the birds before they land. Generally speaking, each bird species responds differently to a given sound pattern. Sound patterns elicit an aversion response that can be rated simply as poor, fair, good, and excellent. There are three principal sound types to work with which can be easily understood with a few basic definitions...|$|R

A <b>waste</b> {{stabilization}} <b>pond</b> {{was suspected}} of causing fecal contamination to Holt Branch, {{a tributary of}} Juniper Creek, near Byron, Georgia. We used ribotyping, a genotypic (DNA-based) bacterial source tracking (BST) method, to match Enterococcus faecalis isolates from Holt Branch and the <b>waste</b> stabilization <b>pond.</b> Fecal enterococci in the effluent from the <b>waste</b> stabilization <b>pond</b> averaged 13, 863 colony-forming units (CFU) per 100 mL, and numbers of fecal enterococci from Holt Branch averaged 3, 290 CFU per 100 mL.

40|$|The {{present study}} follows an {{ecological}} demarch of reintegration in the scenary through revegetation of an anthropic ground, consisting in a <b>waste</b> <b>pond</b> formed from the flotation activity of non-ferrous ores. Problem statement: To support {{the formation of}} a compact vegetal layer, having an anti-errosion and a restoration role, a preliminary study was required regarding the spontaneous settlement of different vegetal species. We have followed the specific floristic composition and the biodiversity on the <b>waste</b> <b>pond,</b> the manner of association of plant species, and the possible interractions with other species from the biocenosis (microorganisms and fungi). We have also studied the pace at which vegetal species settle, as well as the reciprocal influence, {{from the point of view}} of vegetation, with the neighbouring area, since the desideratum is the settlement of a vegetation similar to the natural one. Approach: The aim of the research is to draw a list of the vegetal taxa installed on the pond, as well as to detect some succession stages or some possible vegetal associations. We have established the share of different species in the vegetal layer on the <b>waste</b> <b>pond</b> through an analysis of the ecological preferences, of the geographical origin of plant species, of the cariological and bioform profile. All this was done to compare the possible vegetal associations which settle on such anthropic grounds with the neighbouring vegetation. The approach used was the classical one in fitosociology, recommended by the Central European Fitosociological School adapted to the pedo-climatic conditions in Romania. Results: Over 50 species of plants and fungi spontaniously settled have been listed, and we have followed their association as well as their distribution, compared to the microclimatical conditions of the <b>waste</b> <b>pond.</b> In this way,we have distinguished species with a large potential of revegetating highly polluted with heavy metals <b>waste</b> <b>ponds</b> and sites. Conclusions/Recommendations: Starting from this study, we may establish a formula of sustaining the vegetation and using the interractions among species in order to stimulate the settlement of a dense vegetation which might ensure anti-errosion protection and landscape integration...|$|R

Poor waste management of mercury can pollute the environment. This research aims to identify a potential distribution pattern of mercury waste or tailing in Cisungsang village, Cibeber sub-district. Methods used are survei and spatial analysis. Samples taken from the research site are the gold miners (as subjects of research), sample of mercury waste, environmental samples (water, soil, fish, vegetables, and rice). The research {{results show that the}} use of mercury (100 gr every tromol, every shift) has strong correlation (r = 0, 791) with mercury concentrations in the <b>waste</b> <b>ponds.</b> Mercury concentrations in the liquid of <b>waste</b> <b>ponds</b> are 0, 083 - 0, 265 ppm and mercury concentration in the tailing (sludge) are 0, 304 - 0, 407 ppm.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} on the algal community structure in <b>waste</b> stabilisation <b>ponds</b> is limited {{and it is}} unclear how physical–chemical changes affect the algal community structure and the treatment performance of <b>waste</b> stabilisation <b>ponds.</b> In the present paper we studied the spatial distribution of the algal community in a <b>waste</b> stabilisation <b>pond</b> in Cuenca (Ecuador) and found that the distribution was associated with the BOD concentration of the system. At the upstream end of the facultative pond where the BOD value is relatively high (74 mg L− 1), the community is dominated by motile algal species such as Euglena and Cryptophytes. More downstream, the algal community is more evenly distributed (G = 0. 26 > 0. 18) and also non-motile species such as Chlorophytes and Chrysophytes are present. Throughout the ponds, the reduction of motile algal species was associated with the decrease in BOD concentration. The dominance of Chlorophyta, Chrysophyta and Euglenophyta was highly associated with BOD concentration. Furthermore, it was concluded that the algal abundance (45541 cells mL− 1), diversity (D = 0. 85), evenness (G = 0. 26) and richness (20. 97) of the community in the maturation pond were higher than those of the facultative pond.
