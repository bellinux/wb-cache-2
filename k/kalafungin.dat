50|$|Streptomyces tanashiensis is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces {{which has been}} isolated from soil in Japan. Streptomyces tanashiensis produces luteomycin, mithramycin, phosphoramidon and <b>kalafungin.</b>|$|E
40|$|Medermycin and <b>kalafungin,</b> two {{antibacterial}} and antitumor antibiotics {{isolated from}} different streptomycetes, share an identical polyketide skeleton core. The present study reported {{the discovery of}} <b>kalafungin</b> in a medermycin-producing streptomycete strain for the first time. A mutant strain obtained through UV mutagenesis showed a 3 -fold increase {{in the production of}} this antibiotic, compared to the wild type strain. Heterologous expression experiments suggested that its production was severely controlled by the gene cluster for medermycin biosynthesis. In all, these findings suggested that <b>kalafungin</b> and medermycin could be accumulated by the same streptomycete and share their biosynthetic pathway to some extent in this strain...|$|E
40|$|<b>Kalafungin</b> {{is a new}} {{antimicrobial}} agent obtained from the culture broth of a soil isolate of Streptomyces tanashiensis, designated Streptomyces tanashiensis strain Kala UC- 5063. <b>Kalafungin</b> is a chemically stable, nonpolyene agent which is ex-extremely inhibitory in vitro against a variety of pathogenic fungi, yeasts, protozoa, gram-positive bacteria, and, to a lesser extent, gram-negative bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermochemical}} cascades for the bioreductive alkylation of DNA by <b>kalafungin</b> {{were calculated}} using density functional theory (DFT). Guanine (G) {{was used as}} a model nucleotide. According to the calculations both one- and two-electron reduction of <b>kalafungin</b> is possible in vivo. Furthermore, a clear pathway was found for both mono- and bis-alkylations of G with the former favoured. Alkylation at C- 8 position of G is considerably more exothermic than on the N 2 -exocyclic amine. In the absence of experimentally identified adduct structures of <b>kalafungin,</b> the results presented here support the idea that this compound readily forms covalent bonds with DNA resulting in pro-mutagenic lesions...|$|E
40|$|Pyranonaphthoquinones are a {{class of}} {{naturally}} occurring antibiotics which have in common a synthetically interesting isochromanquinone skeleton. Members of this family exhibit a variety of biological activities. Examples are frenolicin B, an anticoccidial agent; <b>kalafungin,</b> an antifungal agent; hongconin, having cardioprotective activity against angina pectoris. Efforts toward the direct synthesis of these natural pyranonaphthoquinones forced us to develop new methodologies. During our research, a general methodology was developed to stereoselectively synthesize the common isochromanquinone skeleton. The key step in the syntheses, a regioselective Diels-Alder reaction, proceeds with complete regiocontrol and in excellent yield. This work has led to extremely direct total syntheses of hongconin, <b>kalafungin,</b> frenolicin B, [alpha], [beta]-epoxyfrenolicin B and their analogs...|$|E
40|$|Total syntheses of {{bioactive}} {{natural products}} recently accomplished in our laboratories are described. They are classified by structures of target molecules and {{are focused on}} our original approach to their own structures. The target molecules include nanaomycin, <b>kalafungin,</b> BE- 54238 B, tetracycline, rosmarinecine, thienamycin, luminacines C 1 and C 2, tetrodecamycin, cochleamycin A, and tubelactomicin A, which have been synthesized as optically pure form from carbohydrates...|$|E
40|$|Frenolicin B, an {{anticoccidial}} agent, {{has been}} synthesized in six steps from ketone 3. Racemic <b>kalafungin,</b> an antifungal agent, has been synthesized in five steps. The key step in both syntheses, a regioselective Diels-Alder reaction, proceeds with complete regiocontrol and in excellent yield. One {{rationale for the}} remarkable stereocontrol is that the lactone ring induces ring-puckering in the quinone subunit which, in consort with electrostatic repulsion, contributes to the regioselectivity...|$|E
40|$|The anions of %cyano- or 3 -(pheny 1 thio) {{phthalide}} {{react with}} Michael acceptors to afford functionalized naphthydroquinones in good yield. The cyano and phenylthio groups function both as activating groups and as leaving groups. An alternative {{involves the use}} of protected o-(carboxymethy 1) cyanohydrins. The use of phthalide anions in synthesis is exemplified by total syntheses of <b>kalafungin,</b> pachybasin, and chrysophanol. This methodolgy consititutes a direct and regiospecific approach to polycyclic systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} oxygenated heterocycles have been {{described}} in nature as having a myriad of biological activities. Owing to these biological activities and their complex structure, these compounds are of interest to us and the preparation of selected oxygenated heterocycles is described in this thesis. Three main sections form this thesis, with each representing a class of oxygenated heterocycle. The {{first part of the}} thesis deals with pyranonaphthoquinone analogues where a model study was performed to construct the skeleton of the isochromane <b>kalafungin.</b> The synthesis of isochromane 6, 9 -dimethoxy- 3, 3 a, 5, 9 b-tetrahydro- 2 H-furo[3, 2 -c]isochromen- 2 -one was successfully achieved from commercially available 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid in an overall yield of 9. 5...|$|E
40|$|Thequinone subunit is {{contained}} in {{a broad range of}} biologically important natural products. 2 Ì† 7 This subunit is present in anticancer agents such as the anthracyclines, antibiotics such as the rifamycins, antifungal agents such as <b>kalafungin,</b> and antimidial agents such as frenolicin B. 2 The latter two compounds are members of the pyranonaphthoquinone family. The diverse biological activity of quinones has {{led to the development of}} several new synthetic methods for quinones. A number of methods involving cycloadditions, 3 carbanion-mediated annulations, 4 and nucleophilic and electrophilic reactions 5 have been reported. Among the pathways featuring a cycloaddition reaction, one of the most general methods for the regiospecific synthesis of substituted quinones was pioneered by Rapoport and others. 6 This method involves the Diels-Alder reaction of a substituted quinone and is depicted below. The X group is usually chlorine or bromine, but nitriles and sulfoxides 7 can also be employed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe ActVA-ActVB {{system from}} Streptomyces coelicolor isatwo-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase {{that belongs to}} an {{emerging}} class of enzymes involved in various oxidation reactions in microorganisms. The ActVB component is a NADH:flavin oxidoreductase that provides a reduced FMN to the second component, ActVA the proper monooxygenase. In this work, we demonstrate that the ActVA-ActVB system catalyzes the aromatic monohydroxylation of dihydrokalafungin by molecular oxygen. In the presence of reduced FMN and molecular oxygen, the ActVA active site accommodates and stabilizes an electrophilic flavin FMN-OOH hydroperoxide intermediate species as the oxidant. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that the quinone form of dihydrokalafungin is not oxidized by the ActVA-ActVB system, whereas the corresponding hydroquinone is an excellent substrate. The enantiomer of dihydrokalafungin, nanaomycin A, {{as well as the}} enantiomer of <b>kalafungin,</b> nanaomycin D, are also substrates in their hydroquinone forms. The previously postulated product of the ActVA-ActVB system, the antibiotic actinorhodin, was not found to be formed during the oxidation reaction...|$|E
40|$|Part I {{describes}} the successful total {{synthesis of the}} antifugal antibiotic <b>kalafungin</b> and a close analogue, 9 -deoxykalafungin. The key step, in which all of the carbon atoms present in the target molecules were assembled, is the addition of 2 -tert-butoxyfuran to either 2 -acetyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone or 2 -acetyl- 8 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone. Hydride reduction followed by removal of the tert-butyl protecting group and addition of the C- 1 alcohol to the unmasked butenolide afforded intermediate naphthydroquinone dimethyl ethers, which were oxidized to the target molecules with argentic oxide;Part II {{describes the}} first successful total synthesis of the trichothec- 9 -ene skeleton containing oxygenation at both carbon- 15 and in the C-ring. The four asymmetric centers present were introduced unambiguously with the correct relative configuration. The synthesis began with a Lewis acid catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction between 1 -acetoxy- 3 -methyl butadiene and 3 -hydroxymethyl- 3 -buten- 2 -one. The major product from this reaction had the desired stereochemistry at carbons 6 and 11, resulting from cis-endo addition. The thermal reaction afforded the diastereomeric acetoxyketone as the major product. The adduct from the former reaction was transformed to a bicyclic lactone by an intramolecular Knoevenagel condensation. This lactone could be converted into the desired keto-alcohol by reduction of the lactone and nitrile followed by an oxidation and Curtius degradation. Desilylation furnished an alcohol, which was reprotected as the bromoacetate. The third asymmetric center was introduced via an intramolecular alkylation of the regiodefined silyl enol ether of the ketone with the proximate haloester. The (delta) -lactone produced was transformed to an aldehyde, which underwent intramolecular aldolization to introduce the final asymmetric center. Oxidation of the resulting ketol afforded 15 -tert-butyldimethyl-silyloxy- 13 -nortrichothec- 9 -ene- 3, 12 -dione...|$|E
