40|$|Cultivated land {{transition}} and its driving mechanism are the hotspots among studies on land use change. In this study, we constructed a framework {{to study the}} driving mechanism of cultivated land transition from the quantitative perspective. Based on the vector data of land use in 1990, 2000 and 2009 of Yantai Proper, Shandong Province China, 11 explanatory variables were chosen from two aspects: the elevation, slope, cost <b>distance</b> to major water area and cost <b>distance</b> to minor water area, which presented physical factors; cost <b>distance</b> to district center, cost <b>distance</b> to town center, cost <b>distance</b> to city expansion center, cost <b>distance</b> to major roads, cost <b>distance</b> to city roads, cost <b>distance</b> to county roads and cost <b>distance</b> to rural roads, which presented the socio-economic factors. Combined with spatial analysis tools and Logistic regression analysis model, we construct Logistic regression analyses with four objectives that were urban construction land, rural residential land, orchard and other lands. The results show that, cost <b>distance</b> to district center, cost <b>distance</b> to town center, cost <b>distance</b> to city expansion center and cost <b>distance</b> to city roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into urban construction land. The main explained factors on the transition of cultivated land into rural residential land are slope, cost <b>distance</b> to town center, cost <b>distance</b> to county roads and cost <b>distance</b> to rural roads. Slope, cost <b>distance</b> to minor water area, cost <b>distance</b> to town center, cost <b>distance</b> to county roads and cost <b>distance</b> to rural roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into orchard land.
