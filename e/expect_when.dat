25|$|The {{final phase}} of {{accession}} involves bilateral negotiations between the applicant nation and other Working Party members regarding the concessions and commitments on tariff levels and market access for goods and services. These talks cover tariff rates and specific market access commitments, and other policies in goods and services. The new member's commitments are to apply equally to all WTO members under normal non-discrimination rules, {{even though they are}} negotiated bilaterally. In other words, the talks determine the benefits (in the form of export opportunities and guarantees) other WTO members can <b>expect</b> <b>when</b> the new member joins. The talks can be highly complicated; {{it has been said that}} in some cases the negotiations are almost as large as an entire round of multilateral trade negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Uranus is {{the third}} largest (Neptune has a larger mass, but a smaller volume) planet in the Solar System. It orbits the Sun at a {{distance}} of about 2.8billion kilometers (1.7billion miles), and it completes one orbit every 84 Earth years. The length of a day on Uranus as measured by Voyager 2 is 17 hours, 14 minutes. Uranus is unique among the planets in that its axial tilt is about 90°, meaning that its axis is roughly parallel with, not perpendicular to, the plane of the ecliptic. This extremely large tilt of its axis is thought {{to be the result of}} a collision between the accumulating planet Uranus with another planet-sized body early in the history of the Solar System. Given the unusual orientation of its axis, with the polar regions of Uranus exposed for periods of many years to either continuous sunlight or darkness, planetary scientists were not at all sure what to <b>expect</b> <b>when</b> observing Uranus.|$|E

25|$|Moving {{lights are}} much more {{difficult}} to program than their conventional cousins because they have more attributes per fixture that must be controlled. A simple conventional lighting fixture uses only one channel of control per unit: intensity. Everything else that the light must do is pre-set by human hands (colour, position, focus, etc.) An automated lighting fixture can have as many as 30 of these control channels. A slew of products are available on the market to allow operators and programmers to easily control all of these channels on multiple fixtures. Lighting boards are still the most common control mechanism, but many programmers use computer software to do the job. Software is now available that provides a rendered preview of the output produced by the rig once fixtures are connected to the program or console. This allows programmers to work on their show before ever entering the theater and know what to <b>expect</b> <b>when</b> the lights are connected to their controller. These products usually feature some method of converting a computer's USB output to a DMX output.|$|E
25|$|The {{image on}} the right shows scatter plots of Anscombe's quartet, a set of four {{different}} pairs of variables created by Francis Anscombe. The four y variables have the same mean (7.5), variance (4.12), correlation (0.816) and regression line (y=3+0.5x). However, {{as can be seen}} on the plots, the distribution of the variables is very different. The first one (top left) seems to be distributed normally, and corresponds to what one would <b>expect</b> <b>when</b> considering two variables correlated and following the assumption of normality. The second one (top right) is not distributed normally; while an obvious relationship between the two variables can be observed, it is not linear. In this case the Pearson correlation coefficient does not indicate that there is an exact functional relationship: only the extent to which that relationship can be approximated by a linear relationship. In the third case (bottom left), the linear relationship is perfect, except for one outlier which exerts enough influence to lower the correlation coefficient from 1 to 0.816. Finally, the fourth example (bottom right) shows another example when one outlier is enough to produce a high correlation coefficient, even though {{the relationship between the two}} variables is not linear.|$|E

500|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{was looking}} ever more tenuous {{and the idea}} of [...] "no {{independence}} before majority rule" [...] was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and [...] "go it alone". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of [...] "Southern Rhodesia first", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that [...] "trouble pays dividends". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, he said that if there were black MPs [...] "they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by jowl with them, and what sort of legislation can {{the people of this country}} <b>expect</b> <b>when</b> we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans?" ...|$|E

[...] Although Paul wasn't sure what to <b>expect</b> <b>when</b> the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian Bush that includes a duet on the track, [...] "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan support inspired him to make [...] "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: [...] "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though {{we live in a}} soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture."

500|$|The Wilson {{murder is}} a [...] "red ball", a police case {{involving}} an innocent victim, widely known suspects {{or a combination}} of the two. Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media, the public and high-ranking police brass, and often result in additional detectives being added to the case. Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives. Julie Martin, one of the show's writers and supervising producers, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] marked a deliberate change in the series, focusing on darker story lines that are [...] "a little messier and unresolved" [...] and more interpersonal relationships: [...] "The show's been on for six seasons, and it absolutely has to change. We can't keep doing the same show." [...] Media outlets noted that [...] "Blood Ties" [...] included more action-oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport. Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him: [...] "I don't want us to have a style every week that we feel we have to conform to. ... I want people not to know what to <b>expect</b> <b>when</b> they tune in every week. We're not formulaic." ...|$|E

It was the opening number of her set, and Spears appeared wearing a black top and a white fur cape. While the choreography was deemed as [...] "erotic", Corey Moss of MTV commented {{that some of the}} effect was lost due to Spears's lip synching and a stagehand fixing a prop during the song. On January 24, 2004, Spears opened the 2004 NRJ Music Awards with a performance of [...] "Toxic". During the ceremony, she also presented the NRJ Award of Honor for the Career to Madonna. Spears performed [...] "Toxic" [...] as the opening number of 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. Previous {{to the beginning of the}} tour, she deemed it as the song she was most excited to perform, along with [...] "Everytime". After an introduction in which she briefly appeared on a large video screen, Spears took the stage standing on top of a hotel bus, wearing a tight black catsuit. She was surrounded by dancers dressed as employees and columns of LED lighting, suggesting the façade of a glitzy hotel on the Vegas Strip.
