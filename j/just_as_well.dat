5|$|After their {{trips to}} the Himalaya, the Workmans gave lectures about their travels. They were invited to learned societies; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and the second {{to speak at the}} Royal Geographical Society. She {{received}} many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was {{recognized as one of the}} foremost climbers of her day. She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that every {{algorithmic}} technique or complexity result that applies to H-coloring problems for directed graphs H applies <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E

5|$|These highly {{explosive}} eruptions {{are associated}} with volatile-rich dacitic to rhyolitic lavas, and occur most typically at stratovolcanoes. Eruptions can last anywhere from hours to days, with longer eruptions being associated with more felsic volcanoes.

5|$|From 1988, environmentalists started {{actively}} {{opposing the}} Triangle Link. The most active were the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, who stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who argued to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections, to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be 60 as 15 years. He instead wanted to collect tolls in advance.|$|E
5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able}} to scent-detect and identify the many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E

Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|From 1988, {{environmental}} groups started opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, who stated that the road would have a negative impact for local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. They therefore recommended that the municipalities select a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the risk was too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last. He argued that the tolls could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern Bømlø, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer driving time to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.|$|E

As Wells lunges towards Taylor, Taylor grabs a kerosene lamp and hurls it at Wells. Set on fire, Wells stumbles and crashes out a window and falls down a cliff into the ocean. Reporting his story into the paper, Taylor tells his editor to make space in the marriage section for Joan and himself.|$|R

5000|$|During her {{freshman}} year playing for West Virginia University, Wells averaged 11.9 points per game. In addition to her high scoring, Wells crafted her dunking talent, training to achieve her goal of dunking during a live regulation game. Leveraging her tall stature, Wells and her coaches worked an additional 10 to 15 minutes after each practice, with Wells dunking seven to 20 times to perfect her form [...] Early during the 1984-85 season, Wells came very near to achieving her goal, but her dunk was cancelled when one of her opponents fouled Wells' sister, Marva, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>Wells</b> attempted her dunk.|$|R

25|$|Others {{have said}} that Oz stands for New York, since {{the letters of the}} {{alphabet}} before O and Z are N and Y respectively.
