Indo-Caribbean folk traditions include the chowtal songs from the springtime festival phagwa, and Hindi bhajans which are still sung at temples despite there being <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> understand Hindi. Guyanese and Trinidadian Indo-Caribbeans developed a tradition that fused elements of calypso with the folk music of North India, a style that {{was referred to as}} local music.|$|E

During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and the <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E

5|$|When Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood {{during a}} {{campaign}} event, Meechum trades fire with the assassin, {{and both are}} killed instantly. Meechum's death {{is one of the}} tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent, though Meechum may have been eligible, in his own right, as {{a former member of the}} US Military who served in Afghanistan. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, who says that Meechum was one of the <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> truly understood them.|$|E

Recently, relationships between less urban sprawl and more leisure exercise and between certain urban characteristics usually associated with less sprawl and exercise for transportation have been found.

25|$|The skyrocketing {{inflation}} was a hardship on the <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had fixed incomes—but 90 {{percent of the}} people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages were usually in arrears and declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships of their families.|$|E

He devoted various papers partly or wholly to the family and introduced six new species and subspecies. He was a friend of the recently deceased American Achatinidae specialist Albert Raymond Mead (1915–2009). They regularly exchanged opinions, but did not publish jointly.|$|E

30|$|Although {{the number}} and {{percentage}} of single-person households are growing in China, the percentage is still much lower in comparison with developed Western countries. Taking the USA as an example, the percentage of single-person households within {{the same period of}} time is almost three times that of China. Two reasons may contribute to this difference. First, there are relatively <b>fewer</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> never marry in China; second, the proportion of elderly, especially the widowed, who live alone is lower in China than in developed Western countries.|$|R
25|$|His {{first serious}} work was a {{translation}} or {{adaptation of the}} Eunuchus of Terence (1654). At this time the patron of French writing was the Superintendent Fouquet, to whom La Fontaine was introduced by Jacques Jannart, a connection of his wife's. <b>Few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> paid their court to Fouquet went away empty-handed, and La Fontaine soon received a pension of 1000 livres (1659), on the easy terms of a copy of verses for each quarters receipt. He also began a medley of prose and poetry, entitled Le Songe de Vaux, on Fouquet's famous country house.|$|E
25|$|At most times, Toad {{is portrayed}} as a rather cowardly character, {{but the fact that}} he {{actually}} knows about his cowardice makes him one of the more innocent and humbler characters in the series.

Despite the fact that Toad is usually seen as a cheerful character, he can get extremely distressed when a major event occurs, such as the kidnapping of the princess.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Ó Sé's Kerry {{announced}} their arrival when they captured the National League title {{at the start}} of the year. A second Munster title soon followed after a demolition of Clare in the provincial decider. Kerry subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final, with Mayo providing the opposition. The game saw both sides share periods of dominance. Kerry's Maurice Fitzgerald scored nine of his team's points while Mayo scored 1-2 in a two-minute spell. The Connacht champions failed to score in the last twenty minutes as Kerry held on to win by 0-13 to 1-7. The win was all the more significant for Ó Sé as he became one of the <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> captained and managed his county to an All-Ireland title.|$|E

25|$|A {{change in}} market {{conditions}} {{also contributed to}} Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had {{done an excellent job}} marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.|$|E

Akira confesses his love to Yukina and wants to be more than just cousins, and can't stand the sight of Shigure around her. Frequently, Yukina comes to Akira for advice. Akira, through a trial date, was chosen by Yukina to be her boyfriend but because Yukina was still confused with her feelings he felt that her love is not that love of a lover but a love like of family so he broke up with her. He is now going out with Mami.|$|E

GrandPré devises her images after reading the scripts for the books, and does not collaborate with or receive input from J.K. Rowling, although the two have met. Her artwork for the final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was created using pastels on toned printmaking paper.|$|E
