Its application to the urinalysis of workers exposed to styrene vapour. A rapid {{colorimetric method}} has been developed for {{the determination of the}} styrene metabolites, phenylglyoxylic and mandelic acids, in urine. Ether extracts of acidified urine containing the two acids were evaporated to dryness in a test tube, and a mixture of sulphuric acid and formalin (100 : 1, v/v) was added for colour development. Factors necessary to convert optical extinction to <b>gravimetric</b> <b>units</b> were determined. When urinesamples from workers exposed to up to 30 ppm of styrene were analysed for phenylglyoxylic and mandelic acids together with hippuric acid, {{it was found that the}} phenylglyoxylic acid level provided the most sensitive index of styrene exposure and that the optical extinction at 350 nm was practically proportional to phenylglyoxylic acid concentration. No significant increase in hippuric acid levels was observed...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: Ozone is {{a summer}} {{pollutant}} {{which can cause}} respiratory complications, eye burning sensation and failure of immune defense against infectious diseases. Ahvaz city (southwestern Iran) {{is one of the}} seven polluted Iranian metropolises. In this study we examined the health impacts of ozone pollution in Ahvaz city during years 2010 and 2011. 			Materials & Methods: The health effects of ozone pollution in Ahvaz estimated by determining mortality and morbidity, and incidence of diseases attributed to the ozone, i. e., cardiopulmonary mortalities and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using Air Quality Model. Ozone data were taken from Ahvaz Department of Environment (ADoE). Conversion between volumetric and <b>gravimetric</b> <b>units</b> (correction of temperature and pressure), coding, processing (averaging) and filtering were implemented. 			Results: Sum of accumulative cases of mortalities attributed to ozone was 358 cases in 2010 and 276 cases in 2011. Cardiovascular and respiratory mortality attributed to ozone were 118 and 31 persons, respectively; which revealed a considerable reduction compared to those values in 2010. Number of cases for hospital admissions due to COPD was 35 in 2011, while it was 45 cases in 2010. The concentration of ozone in 2011 was lower than that of 2010 and this is why both mortalities and morbidities of 2011 attributed to ozone pollutant had decreased when compared to those values of 2010. 			 		 	 Conclusions: Mortality and morbidity attributed to ozone concentrations in 2011 were lower than those of 2010. The most important reason was less concentration in ground level ozone of 2011 than that of 2010 in Ahvaz city air...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: As an air pollutant, NO 2 {{reacts with}} ammonia, {{moisture}} and other compounds to form small particles. These small particles may cause or aggravate respiratory diseases and exacerbate existing heart diseases, leading to increased hospital admissions and premature death. In this study, the AirQ 2. 2. 3 model {{was used to}} evaluate adverse health effects caused by NO 2 exposure in Ahvaz city (Iran) during 2009. Materials & Methods: The adverse health effects of NO 2 as an air pollutant in Ahvaz city at 2009 were calculated by AirQ 2. 2. 3 utilizing relative risk and baseline incidence related to health end point defaults. NO 2 data were taken from Ahvaz Department of Environment. These data were in volumetric base. Health effects are being related to the mass of pollutants inhaled and this is why the AirQ model was on gravimetric basis. So, there was a conflict between AirQ model and “Ahvaz Department of Environment (ADoE) ” data. Conversion between volumetric and <b>gravimetric</b> <b>units</b> (correction of temperature and pressure), coding, processing (averaging) and filtering are implemented for solving such problem. Results: Approximately 3 % of total cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction, and hospital admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease happened when the NO 2 concentrations was more than 20 μg/m 3. Low percentage of the observed health endpoints was associated with low concentration of measured NO 2. The lower level of relative risk value may be achieved if some control strategies for reducing NO 2 emission are used. Conclusions: Therefore, the higher relative risk value can depict mismanagement in urban air quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-performance}} microcomputer controlled gravimetric burette {{described in}} Part 1 has been employed to automate some routine analytical procedures. A direct potentiometric determination of fluoride ions {{in drinking water}} was developed to include an automatic calibration step, matrix adjustment and sample determination. Also the complex and cumbersome titrimetric procedure for determination of the kappa number (lignin content) in paper pulp, has been automated by using the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>unit</b> and biamperometry. In this last instance, the automatic standardization of the solutions employed in the determination and the complete automation of the recommended kappa number determination procedure, allows {{a significant reduction in}} the amount of reagent consumed. The gravimetric approach to these procedures reveals that the same performance is achieved in terms of precision and accuracy when compared with classic volumetry while the cost associated with the automation decreases owing {{to the use of the}} same unit to attain automatic management of up to three different solutions...|$|R

40|$|Aims: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess health-effects of exposure particulate matter (PM 10) in Ahvaz city (located in South-Western Iran), during 2009. Materials and Methods: The adverse health effects of PM 10 were calculated by relative risk (RR) and baseline incidence related to health end point PM 10. A specialized model, the air quality health impact assessment tool (AirQ 2. 2. 3), was used to assess the potential impacts of PM 10 exposure on human health in Ahvaz city during 2009. PM 10 data was taken from Ahvaz Department of Environment. These data were in volumetric base. Health effects are being related to the mass of pollutants inhaled and should convert on the gravimetric basis. Conversion between volumetric and <b>gravimetric</b> <b>units</b> (correction of temperature and pressure), coding, processing (averaging), and filtering are implemented for solving such problem. Results: The results revealed that approximately 3 % of total numbers of deaths and respiratory mortality happened when the PM 10 concentration was over 50 μg/m 3. Sum of total number of deaths attributed to PM 10 was 1165 cases in 2009. Based on the results of this study, 13 % of all respiratory mortality were attributed to PM 10 concentration over 20 μg/m 3 in Ahvaz city during 2009. High percentage of the observed health endpoints was associated with a high concentration of measured PM 10. Conclusion: Year comparison of PM 10 concentration with standard was revealed particle matter concentration in summer and winter season were higher than standard. Although total mean of particle matter was higher than the standard concentration. The higher percentage of deaths perhaps could be the result of higher average PM 10 or because of sustained high concentration days in Ahvaz...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the AiF {{research}} project No 11503 N 1 "Test and Improvement of the Measuring Accuracy of Multichannel Piston Pipettes", the time for testing a multichannel pipette was reduced from 11 - 12 hours (using the nominal gravimetric test method) or 6 hours (using a modified gravimetric method) to 1. 5 hours by developing a semiautomatic <b>gravimetric</b> <b>unit</b> with weighing cells operating with strain gauges (testing unit 1). This was achieved by simultaneously pipetting with up to 12 channels and then simultaneously weighing the dispensed fluid volume. For this purpose, a testing unit was constructed in which the distance between the weighing scales is equal to the distance between the channels of a multichannel pipette (= 9 mm). By the use of weighing cells with strain gauges, a weighing accuracy was obtained that corresponds to an analytical balance of 0. 1 mg resolution. Thus, this unit can test multichannel pipettes with a nominal volume from 50 to 300 µ. It was not possible to further increase resolution and accuracy by using strain gauges. Based on previous experience, a second, significantly optimised unit (testing unit 2) was developed. The most important new aspect was the introduction of weighing cells with electromagnetic force compensation, as they are used in semi-microbalances. Using this new testing unit, pipettes with a nominal volume of up to 10 µ can be tested in significantly reduced time. For the very first time, a complete, standardised gravimetric test of a multichannel pipette was performed in less than 15 minutes. The gravimetric test of multichannel pipettes by four different producers showed that no pipettes exceeded the maximum number of errors permitted in DIN 12650 - 8. The dispensed volume of multichannel pipettes is adjustable between approximately 10 % of the nominal volume and the nominal volume. At the lowest adjustable volume, the uncertainty of measurement was reduced on average to approximately 50 % of that obtained at the nominal volume. Slight deviations occurred at different nominal volumes and between different producers. With few exceptions, the dispensed volumes of the individual channels were more or less equal. Compared with manual pipettes, electronic pipettes showed fewer systematic and random errors...|$|R

Hariot {{was similar}} for the frond and stipe, being 28 % ash, 3 % protein, ca 1 % lipid, less than 10 % acid-soluble carbohydrate, and 60 % acid-insoluble carbohydrate. The holdfast differed by being 22 % ash and 66 % acid-insoluble carbohydrate. The energetic level of all 3 components was ca 13 kJ (g dry wt) - 1 and ca 17 kJ (g ash-free dry wt) - 1. The relative {{proportion of the}} 3 plant components varied little for plants having stipe diameters ranging from 10 to 40 mm, being ca 8, 3, and 89 % wet wt and ca 10, 4, and 86 % kJ for the holdfast, stipe, and frond, respectively. Maximal density found in summer was 471 individual plants m- 2, 226 kg wet wt m- 2, and 457, 000 kJ m- 2.

40|$|The bifunctional {{nature of}} Cu [...] -Al 2 O 3 -on-carbon catalysts, {{used in the}} direct {{catalytic}} conversion of ethanol to ethyl acetate, prompted {{an examination of the}} dispersion of Cu on the composite catalyst. For this, the N 2 O-method of Osinga et al. for estimation of bare metallic copper surface on composite copper catalysts has been adapted for use on a <b>gravimetric</b> adsorption <b>unit</b> and then applied to several promoted and supported copper catalysts. For catalysts with Cu/Al atomic ratio 0. 8 to 26, all reduced at 300 °C, the copper surface is only 1 – 8 % of the total surface of 500 – 560 m 2 /g, but 50 – 430 m 2 /g Cu. The maximum Cu dispersion is obtained for the catalyst with Cu/Al = 6, which {{is also one of the}} best catalysts for the esterification reaction. The Cu surface rapidly increases from 1 to 10 % of the total surface as the temperature of reduction of the catalyst is raised from 100 to 400 °C. On a low area (32 m 2 /g) asbestos carrier, a relatively higher Cu coverage of 55 % can be obtained, but the activity of this catalyst is very poor. On use in the esterification reaction, the carbon-supported catalyst gets a more reddish brown copper color, however there is no increase in the exposed copper area. X-ray microscan studies of the catalyst prove that the copper sites on the surface (in an 1 μ-thick layer) are mostly in close association with the Al sites of the alumina promoter. Results from catalyst testing show that these Cu [...] -Al sites or junctions are necessary to catalyze the condensation to ester of the acetaldehyde formed in the primary dehydrogenation of ethanol over copper. The microscan studies on the same spot on one and the same catalyst particle indicate that the distribution of Cu and Al in the 1 μ-thick layer on the catalyst surface does undergo some alterations when the catalyst is reduced at 300 °C and subsequently used in the esterification reaction at 275 °C. The exact nature of these alterations is still not clear...|$|R
40|$|The Yaghi {{laboratory}} {{has developed}} porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs), COF 102, COF 103, and COF 202, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), MOF 177, MOF 180, MOF 200, MOF 205, and MOF 210, with ultrahigh porosity and outstanding H 2 storage properties at 77 K. Using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with our recently developed first principles based force field (FF) from accurate quantum mechanics (QM), we calculated the molecular hydrogen (H 2) uptake at 298 K for these systems, including the uptake for Li-, Na-, and K-metalated systems. We report the total, delivery and excess amount in <b>gravimetric</b> and volumetric <b>units</b> {{for all these}} compounds. For the gravimetric delivery amount from 1 to 100 bar, we find that eleven of these compounds reach the 2010 DOE target of 4. 5 wt % at 298 K. The best of these compounds are MOF 200 -Li (6. 34) and MOF 200 -Na (5. 94), both reaching the 2015 DOE target of 5. 5 wt % at 298 K. Among the undoped systems, we find that MOF 200 gives a delivery amount as high as 3. 24 wt % while MOF 210 gives 2. 90 wt % both from 1 to 100 bar and 298 K. However, none of these compounds reach the volumetric 2010 DOE target of 28 g H_ 2 /L. The best volumetric performance is for COF 102 -Na (24. 9), COF 102 -Li (23. 8), COF 103 -Na (22. 8), and COF 103 -Li (21. 7), all using delivery g H_ 2 /L units for 1 – 100 bar. These are the highest volumetric molecular hydrogen uptakes for a porous material under these thermodynamic conditions. Thus, one can obtain outstanding H_ 2 uptakes with Li, Na, and K doping of simple frameworks constructed from simple, cheap organic linkers.

40|$|Gas Technology Institute is {{developing}} a novel concept of membrane reactor coupled with a gasifier for high efficiency, clean and low cost production of hydrogen from coal. The concept incorporates a hydrogen-selective membrane within a gasification reactor for direct extraction of hydrogen from coal-derived synthesis gases. The objective of this project {{is to determine the}} technical and economic feasibility of this concept by screening, testing and identifying potential candidate membranes under high temperature, high pressure, and harsh environments of the coal gasification conditions. The best performing membranes will be selected for preliminary reactor design and cost estimates. Hydrogen permeation data for several perovskite membranes BCN (BaCe{sub 0. 9 }Nd{sub 0. 1 }O{sub 3 -x}), SCE (SrCe{sub 0. 9 }Eu{sub 0. 1 }O{sub 3 }) and SCTm (SrCe{sub 0. 95 }Tm{sub 0. 05 }O{sub 3 }) have been successfully obtained for temperatures between 800 and 950 C and pressures from 1 to 12 bar in this project. However, it is known that the cerate-based perovskite materials can react with CO{sub 2 }. Therefore, the stability issue of the proton conducting perovskite materials under CO{sub 2 } or H{sub 2 }S environments was examined. Tests were conducted in the Thermo <b>Gravimetric</b> Analyzer (TGA) <b>unit</b> for powder and disk forms of BCN and SCE. Perovskite materials doped with zirconium (Zr) are known to be resistant to CO{sub 2 }. The results from the evaluation of the chemical stability for the Zr doped perovskite membranes are presented. During this reporting period, flowsheet simulation was also performed to calculate material and energy balance based on several hydrogen production processes from coal using high temperature membrane reactor (1000 C), low temperature membrane reactor (250 C), or conventional technologies. The results show that the coal to hydrogen process employing both the high temperature and the low temperature membrane reactors can increase the hydrogen production efficiency (cold gas efficiency) by more than 50 % compared to the conventional process. Using either high temperature or low temperature membrane reactor process also results in an increase of the cold gas efficiencies as well as the thermal efficiencies of the overall process...|$|R
