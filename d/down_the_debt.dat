This process has continued to this day {{in the guise of}} the state owned KfW bank, (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving loan system, the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt,</b> stabilize the currency, or invest in non-industrial projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.|$|E

2500|$|By July 1907 {{the initial}} {{construction}} of the quarry {{and the rest of}} the system was finished but marble was being shipped out before though only in small amounts and advertising pieces. [...] The first major contract came in late October 1907 to supply $500,000 worth of marble for the Cuyahoga County Court House, in Cleveland, Ohio and set off a quarrying boom. [...] In spite of the increased quarrying, by 1913 the company was in financial trouble due to the huge start-up debt and high operating costs not generating enough revenue to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b> [...] A loan of $1,868,000 was obtained in early February 1913 and used to refinance to debt. In spite of the financial difficulty orders kept coming in with the first contract of one million dollars for the Equitable Building, New York City, in August 1913 for [...] of marble.|$|E

2500|$|Act II {{takes place}} {{outdoors}} in mid-summer {{on the family}} estate, near the cherry orchard. The act opens with Yepikhodov and Yasha trying for the affection of Dunyasha, by singing and playing guitar, while Charlotta soliloquizes about her life as she cleans a rifle. In Act I {{it was revealed that}} Yepikhodov proposed to Dunyasha around Easter; however, she has since become infatuated with the more [...] "cultured" [...] Yasha. Charlotta leaves so that Dunyasha and Yasha might have some time alone, but that is interrupted when they hear their employer coming. Yasha shoos Dunyasha away to avoid being caught, and Ranevskaya, Gayev, and Lopakhin appear, once more discussing the uncertain fate of the cherry orchard. Shortly Anya, Varya, and Trofimov arrive as well. Lopakhin teases Trofimov for being a perpetual student, and Trofimov espouses his philosophy of work and useful purpose, to the delight and humour of everyone around. During their conversations, a drunken and disheveled vagrant passes by and begs for money; Ranevskaya thoughtlessly gives him all of her money, despite the protestations of Varya. Shaken by the disturbance, the family departs for dinner, with Lopakhin futilely insisting that the cherry orchard be sold to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b> Anya stays behind to talk with Trofimov, who disapproves of Varya's constant hawk-like eyes, reassuring Anya that they are [...] "above love". To impress Trofimov and win his affection, Anya vows to leave the past behind her and start a new life. The two depart for the river as Varya calls scoldingly in the background.|$|E

50|$|In 1519, the King's {{paternal}} grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, died. Charles {{competed with}} King Francis I of France {{to win the}} imperial election by aggressively bribing prince-electors. Charles won, becoming Emperor Charles V. He left Aragon to return to Castile to raise funds to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> he had incurred in the election. The taxes granted to Charles at a Castilian cortes in Corunna would help spark the Revolt of the Comuneros of Castile. Of more importance for Aragon, {{in the summer of}} 1519 Charles granted his permission to the Germanies to arm themselves against the raiding Muslim fleets. While permission had previously been granted under Ferdinand, Charles was able to force the Valencian nobles to accept this decision.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a tension}} between the {{repayment}} of debt and the Mexican government’s potential control over Mexican natural resources, {{which could be used}} to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b> The State Department wanted the bankers to get their money and for assets not to be seized, but they tried to keep the two issues separate.|$|E
50|$|Ramos {{tried to}} control debt through debt {{restructuring}} and fiscal management. Ramos claims to have brought <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> service ratio from 40% of export earning to around 20%. The debt service ratio was reduced in his regime as well. Reduction in debt servicing, however, partially caused the economy's decline since funds were not used for the country's development/growth.|$|E
50|$|Share repurchases {{avoid the}} {{accumulation}} of excessive amounts of cash in the corporation. Companies with strong cash generation and limited needs for capital spending will accumulate cash on the balance sheet, which makes the company a more attractive target for takeover, since the cash {{can be used to}} pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> incurred to carry out the acquisition. Anti-takeover strategies, therefore, often include maintaining a lean cash position and share repurchases bolster the stock price, making a takeover more expensive.|$|E
5000|$|Besides J. P. Morgan, another notable congregant of {{the church}} was Harry Thacker Burleigh, the spiritual singer and {{classical}} composer. He performed in the church choir for 50 years.

50|$|The {{philosophy}} was, {{and continues}} to be, {{that almost all of}} the profits get reinvested into the company through paying <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> and company development. When most of the debt is paid it is time to look for a new investment. In 1993, the cable TV systems operated by Regional Cable Systems in Ilderton, Ailsa Craig, Thedford, Port Franks, Parkhill, Arkona, Forest and Watford were for sale. An agreement was reached, the system was bought and the name changed to Ausable Cablecom Inc.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} used a {{shaft of}} the Bon Accord mine as its water supply from 1884 to 1905. In 1911, the council initiated a public fund {{for the construction of}} the historic Market Square Rotunda in honour of King Edward VII. In 1945, the committee of the Burra Institute transferred the building to the council, which renamed it the Burra Town Hall and began screening films in the hall to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt.</b> The Burra Hospital was also vested in the council, although separately managed.|$|E
50|$|While Blackstone saw an {{opportunity}} to streamline the company and push Hilton's expansion overseas when Blackstone pursued Hilton in 2006 and 2007, the buyout saddled the company with $20 billion of debt just as the economy was turning <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> <b>debt</b> had very liberal terms, {{so there was no}} danger of default, but when travel slowed, the company suffered. In April 2010, Hilton and Blackstone restructured the debt. Blackstone invested a further $800 million of equity and the debt was reduced to $16 billion.|$|E

5000|$|For example, Paul Krugman {{wrote in}} December 2010 that significant, {{sustained}} government spending was necessary because indebted households were paying down debts {{and unable to}} carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: [...] "The root of our current troubles lies in <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can’t spend {{the way they used}} to, they’re having to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debts</b> they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what’s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more — and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained..." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{recipient}} government is also then {{left with the}} original payment in its domestic currency. These payments are amalgamated into a fund {{that is used to}} further fund development. This can take the form of investments in infrastructure or industry, paying <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> or deficit, or stabilizing the currency. The investment of these funds can take the form of loans rather than grants, creating a permanent pool of investment capital. For instance, Germany's Marshall Plan counterpart funds were used to set up such an investment fund, and it is still in operation today.|$|E
50|$|The {{triumph of}} Christian III would {{eventually}} bring about {{an end to}} Catholic Christianity in Denmark, but Roman Catholics still controlled the Council of State. Christian III ordered the arrest {{of three of the}} bishops on the State Council by his German mercenaries (12 August 1536). Christian's debt for the Count's Feud was enormous and confiscating the Church lands (farmed by peasants who had been free from vassalage duties to the nobles) enabled him to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> to his creditors. The ultimate gainers from the confiscations were the nobles who led the New Faith imported from Germany.|$|E
50|$|In December 2011, it was {{reported}} that Portugal's estimated budget deficit of 4.5 percent in 2011 would be substantially lower than expected, due to a one-off transfer of pension funds. The country would therefore meet its 2012 target a year earlier than expected. Despite the fact that the economy is expected to contract by 3 percent in 2011 the IMF expects the country to be able to return to medium and long-term debt sovereign markets by late 2013. Any deficit means increasing the nation's debt. To bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debt</b> to sustainable levels will require a 10% budget surplus for several years according to some estimates.|$|E
50|$|Thomas {{was evidently}} a skilled {{administrator}} and agriculturalist. Under his stewardship his often financially troubled abbey remained solvent (a difficult task given the small endowment {{and the vast}} cost of providing hospitality to travellers by land and sea and the king’s sailors) {{and he was able}} to build up a farm surplus worth more than £100, a huge sum for the time and not far off the annual net income of the abbey, and to pay <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>debts.</b> He also maintained high standards of religious life at the abbey, and he and his seven monks gained good reports to the king from the local gentry and were much respected in the neighbourhood. Thomas was trusted by the government too, as is shown by his being given custody of two Franciscan friars, who presumably had offended the king by opposing his religious policies.|$|R
50|$|The budget {{contained}} few surprises: {{most major}} initiatives had been announced long beforehand. These included $2 billion for health care, money for municipalities, and $1 billion to help livestock farmers harmed by the Mad Cow crisis.
