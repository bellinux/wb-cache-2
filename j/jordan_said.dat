5|$|There was one driver change {{heading into}} the race. Having been {{in one of the}} Jordan cars since the first race of the season in Australia, Heinz-Harald Frentzen was sacked by his team and was {{replaced}} by Jordan's third driver Zonta. Frentzen announced he would take legal action against Jordan and team principal Eddie <b>Jordan</b> <b>said</b> that Frentzen's management was not happy with Jordan's current performance but denied rumours that a heated row occurred. The Schumacher brothers were sympathic towards Frentzen who felt unhappy about the manner in which he was sacked. Irvine came to Jordan's defence and said that he believed the decision was influenced by problems Jordan had with 1996 World Champion Damon Hill who had similar poor performances like Frentzen. In an interview with The Sunday Independent in 2005, Jordan later claimed that Frentzen was sacked because engine supplier Honda wanted Japanese driver Takuma Sato to race for Jordan in 2002 and to retain Honda's engine supply. During the week of the race, the organisers of the German Grand Prix signed an extension to continue hosting the event at the Hockenheimring until 2008 with an option for a further five years.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the authoritarian political systems in Iraq and Syria, the popularity of the Ba'ath Party has waned, but Ba'athist ideology remains popular.

In the 2000 close season Simon Jordan bought the club and replaced Coppell with Alan Smith, who had taken over from Coppell on his first resignation seven years earlier. <b>Jordan</b> <b>said</b> Coppell had done a [...] "fantastic job", but the club needed to [...] "evolve or die".|$|E

The 1950s were a period of racial segregation in parts of the United States, especially the southeastern portion of the country.

2500|$|In 2006, EastEnders {{scriptwriter}} Tony Jordan revealed {{how it was}} {{his idea}} to bring Den back in 2003.

Commenting on this, <b>Jordan</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If [...] hadn't come out I think it would have worked and he'd still be in the show. When I saw him on screen after those revelations came out, suddenly I couldn't believe in the character any more. I was starting to love the character and buying into all of it, but after that I saw him as Leslie Grantham - not Den Watts. He was older, and flawed in all the wrong ways. I think a lot of viewers felt the same, and the cast as well, probably." ...|$|E

Children are used as human shields on front lines and to provide blood transfusions for Islamic State soldiers, according to Shelly Whitman of the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.
