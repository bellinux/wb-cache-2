5|$|In 2006, {{there were}} 210 schools in Gaza; 151 were {{run by the}} Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority, 46 were run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and 13 were private schools. A total of 154,251 {{students}} were enrolled and 5,877 teachers were employed. The currently downtrodden economy has affected education <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> severely. In September 2007, a UNRWA survey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> revealed {{that there was a}} nearly 80% failure rate in schools grades four to nine, with up to 90% failure rates in mathematics. In January 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that schools in Gaza had been canceling classes that were high on energy consumption, such as information technology, science labs and extra curricular activities.|$|E

He and his wife, Amal, live in the UNRWA-run Bureij refugee camp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> As of 2013 they had four daughters and six sons, including a boy, Muhammad, born two years after the shooting.|$|E
5|$|Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli {{troops in}} April 1948, the family fled {{to their house}} near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, {{and they had to}} flee again. This time they went to the Bureij refugee camp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> then under Egyptian control. Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents, {{dependent}} on UNRWA for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes. The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal.|$|E

25|$|In January 2007, {{fighting}} erupted between Hamas and Fatah. The deadliest clashes occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> where General Muhammed Gharib, {{a senior}} {{commander of the}} Fatah-dominated Preventive Security Force, died when a rocket hit his home.|$|R
50|$|Al-Bayuk (البَيُوك, also spelled al-Buyuk) is a Palestinian village <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rafah Governorate located {{south of}} Rafah <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> According to <b>the</b> Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), {{it had a}} population of 5,648 in 2006.|$|R
5|$|With a {{population}} of 2,560 in 1945, Deir al-Balah was a relatively large village. The influx of Palestinian refugees from nearby areas captured by Israel during the 1948 War drastically increased the population thereafter. In the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) Deir al-Balah's population was recorded as 42,839, a figure which included the adjacent Deir al-Balah Camp (the smallest refugee camp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.)</b> Nearly 75% of the population were below the age of 30.|$|E

5|$|The major {{agricultural}} products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water {{have reduced the}} productive capacity of farms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Israel withdrew {{its troops}} from the Gaza Strip and removed the {{thousands}} of Israelis who had settled in the territory. See Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2004. Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas has been engaged in a sometimes violent power struggle with its rival Palestinian organization Fatah. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in the elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council, the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas, recognized as a terror organization by most western countries, has de facto control {{of the city and}} Strip.|$|E
5|$|Khalil al-Wazir {{was born}} in 1935 to Muslim parents {{in the city of}} Ramla, Palestine, then under British Mandatory rule. His father, Ibrahim al-Wazir, worked as a grocer in the city. Al-Wazir and his family were {{expelled}} in July 1948, along with another 50,000–70,000 Palestinians from Lydda and Ramla, following Israel's capture of the area during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. They settled in the Bureij refugee camp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> where al-Wazir attended a secondary school run by UNRWA. While in high school, he began organizing a small group of fedayeen to harass Israelis at military posts near the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
2500|$|Gush Katif ( [...] , lit. Harvest Bloc) was a bloc of 17 Israeli {{settlements}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Gaza</b> <b>strip.</b> <b>In</b> August 2005, <b>the</b> Israeli army {{carried out}} the Cabinet's decision and forcibly removed the 8,600 residents of Gush Katif from their homes.

5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater {{as the only}} source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears {{a small amount of}} water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip</b> and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most of the Gaza Strip, Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E
25|$|On 15 October <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> an anti-Assad protest expressing {{solidarity}} with Palestinian refugees in Syria {{affected by the}} unrest there took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> and was attended by 150 people. Hamas police forces dispersed the demonstration, claiming that it was held without a permit.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the water}} quality is {{considerably}} worse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>strip</b> {{when compared to the}} West Bank.
