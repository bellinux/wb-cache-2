30|$|Conceptual {{models of}} forest {{dynamics}} are powerful and indispensable cognitive tools for communicating ecological knowledge and ideas.

40|$|<b>Forest</b> {{landscape}} <b>restoration</b> {{includes both}} {{the planning and}} implementation of measures to restore degraded forests within {{the perspective of the}} wider landscape. Governing <b>forest</b> landscape <b>restoration</b> requires fundamental considerations about the conceptualisation of forested landscapes and the types of restoration measures to be taken, and about who should be engaged in the governance process. A variety of governance approaches to <b>forest</b> landscape <b>restoration</b> exist, differing in both the nature of the object to be governed and the mode of governance. This paper analyses the nature and governance of restoration in three cases of <b>forest</b> landscape <b>restoration</b> in Indonesia. In each of these cases, both the original aim for restoration and the initiators of the process differ. The cases also differ in how deeply embedded they are in formal spatial planning mechanisms at the various political scales. Nonetheless, the cases show similar trends. All cases show a dynamic process of mobilising the landscape’s stakeholders, plus a flexible process of crafting institutional space for conflict management, negotiation and decision making at the landscape level. As a result, the landscape focus changed over time from reserved forests to forested mosaic lands. The cases illustrate that the governance of <b>forest</b> landscape <b>restoration</b> should not be based on strict design criteria, but rather on a flexible governance approach that stimulates the creation of novel public-private institutional arrangements at the landscape level...|$|R
