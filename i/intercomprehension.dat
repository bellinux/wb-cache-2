Calling in this opposition, our paper brings forward the problem of <b>intercomprehension</b> and incomprehension in the endolingual space. <b>Intercomprehension</b> is nowadays almost exclusively associated to plurilinguism {{and a series of}} curricula of foreign language simultaneous learning. It is considered that the exolingual situation is by excellence a state of communicational risk and its management is more difficult, for it does not guarantee the success in communication. Polarizing the research in this direction unfortunately casts a shadow on the opportunity of debates on <b>intercomprehension</b> in one’s native tongue. And this is due, as Tyvaert (2008) showed, to the fact that “we should avoid pretending from linguistic <b>intercomprehension</b> what cannot be accomplished by intralinguistic intercomprehension”. It is naturally acceptable that the lack of <b>intercomprehension</b> leads to incomprehension, therefore to the misinterpretation or annulment of communication between people speaking the same language. In the context of linguistic training of future economists, we consider that the lack of <b>intercomprehension</b> in one’s native tongue often originates in the deficiencies of speciality knowledge. Therefore, we can state that an economist who does not understand an economic message in his native tongue cannot generate “endolingual intercomprehension”. According to a recent study on a representative sample of students from the Faculty of Economic Sciences of Oradea, we have tried to prove the above hypothesis and to render the students sensitive regarding the study of foreign languages. The results entitle us to consider that the lack of intralingustic <b>intercomprehension</b> (due to deficiencies in the speciality field) leads to incomprehension, diminishes the person’s willingness to start a plurilingual communication, thus compromising the chance of an interlinguistic <b>intercomprehension,</b> so necessary to the contemporary geostrategic space...|$|E

In the first part, higher education research and applied projects (»Jessner«, »Gooskens«, »Prokopowicz«) regarding these topics {{that contributed to the}} improved comprehension of both phenomena and to the preparation of pluri- and multilinguistic syllabi proposals (for example CARAP / FREPA) are presented.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 44) In the United States, Spanish is {{the most}} studied foreign language in the university setting, and Italian is the fourth most studied spoken language in the university setting. When it comes to travel, in 2010, Mexico was the most visited country by Americans, with Italy ranking fifth and Spain ranking tenth. The second and third most visited countries by Americans were Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively, both English speaking countries. Based on student interest and travel statistics, Spanish and Italian could be considered very worthwhile of study in the United States. What if the efforts put into studying the Spanish language could result in competency in communicating in the Italian language as well? By developing <b>intercomprehension</b> skills in students, this is an outcome that is very possible to achieve. <b>Intercomprehension</b> {{has been defined as}} the process of developing the ability to coconstruct meaning {{in the context of the}} encounter of different languages, and to make pragmatic use of this in a concrete communicative situation. This thesis provides several suggestions on how to teach Spanish and Italian in such a way that facilitates <b>intercomprehension</b> between the two languages. This thesis suggests using mutual intelligibility as a key factor in selecting lexical items and phrases to teach students. This sometimes will entail the teaching of a less commonly used word or phrase that is more mutually intelligible than the common word or phrase, resulting in increased <b>intercomprehension</b> success. The foreign language textbooks Oggi in Italia and ??Claro Que S??!, as well as the Kindle electronic travel phrasebook guides Language for Travelers-Spanish and Language for Travelers- Italian, are utilized to illustrate how the vocabulary and phrases provided by these resources could be modified in order to facilitate <b>intercomprehension.</b> In addition to modifying vocabulary and phrases to be instructed in language courses that seek to promote <b>intercomprehension,</b> charts indicate how pronunciation can be modified depending on whether one is communicating with a Spanish or an Italian speaker, in order to increase <b>intercomprehension.</b> This thesis also provides charts illustrating common morphological differences that exist in areas such as plural formation and infinitives. In addition, this thesis demonstrates how gestures can be a useful tool in making less mutually intelligible words comprehensible. Lastly, this thesis argues for the importance of multilingualism and suggests populations of students that could greatly benefit from the development of <b>intercomprehension</b> skills...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intercomprehension</b> is an {{innovative}} technique {{for teaching and}} learning based {{on the ability of}} speakers quickly to master techniques for transferring competences between related languages, principally with respect to comprehension. This methodology relies on activities contrasting with those communicative practices that have become the rule in the area of teaching language and cultures, such as translation, contrastive grammar, the importance of writing. The methodological common denominator is that of a plurilingual and pluricultural pedagogy. Learning French thus opens a door to a range of romance languages spoken by more than 500 million people throughout the world. For French-speakers, <b>intercomprehension</b> represents a means of rapid access to related languages and cultures, at the same time encouraging reflexive observation of the first language.

40|$|Custom {{sets that}} {{teaching}} foreign languages refers {{to teaching and}} learning a language taken in isolation, within an essentially monolingual framework. Academic orthodoxy Chardenet (2007) refers to training the teacher in one foreign language only, following the unnatural preoccupation for the completion {{of knowledge and skills}} in this language. The dynamics of the societies forces towards the transition from monolingualism to multilingualism, by introducing the pluralistic like teaching devices. Defined as "teaching approaches that put into practice the teaching-learning activities while involving more (= more than one) linguistic and cultural variety," pluralistic approaches are designed as opposed to traditional teaching approaches, the aim of which is a particular language or culture in isolation (Candelier, 2007 : 7). <b>Intercomprehension</b> is, along with the intercultural approach, the integrated teaching of foreign languages and awakening to languages, a pluralistic approach that allows the development of diverse and unthinkable emotional and practical knowledge and skills, inventoried in a Framework of reference for pluralistic approaches to languages and cultures (CARAP). Considered from different perspectives - as a method, strategy, training device or educational purpose - <b>intercomprehension</b> is mainly a general competence of the multilingual individual. A doctoral program attended at the University of Reims, France, as part of a team coordinated by professors J. E. Tyvaert and E. Castagne, has allowed us to experiment <b>intercomprehension</b> with a public trained for skills training for acquiring the perception and understanding of foreign languages not known a priori. According to Jamet (2010), it is a metalinguistic cognitive type activity (the awareness of areas of formal transparency and of significance), meta-pragmatic (the use of knowledge acquired in the native language to decide the needs triggered in a certain situation) and meta-cultural (by means of the encyclopaedic knowledge of the world), activity practiced by inferential type strategies. The regular observation of ICE type training sessions has led us to a reflection applied to non-philological learning environment. We consider that organizing a module of initiation in French for beginner economic students, a course relying on <b>intercomprehension</b> principles, would be an excellent introduction to multilingualism. In this paper we will tackle the knowledge that, according to CARAP, seems attainable by means of this alternative method of teaching - learning a language, in the light, even if only virtual at the moment, of the introduction of French in the curriculum by specific means of <b>intercomprehension.</b> Established as prolegomena to the traditional study, an introductory course of <b>intercomprehension</b> of French would be able to provide students with quicker global linguistic knowledge otherwise acquired in a longer period of time, with more effort and without guaranteed results...|$|E

It became a complex concept which represents its richness and flexibility, but threatens the immediate understanding of its potential as a language education approach. <b>Intercomprehension</b> is aligned with the most recent language and education policies. However, it is still struggling to be recognized and operationalized in the educational context, due to its methodological inconsistency (De Carlo, 2013). Thus, the Référentiel de compétences de communication plurilingue en <b>intercompréhension</b> (REFIC) (De Carlo, 2015) was recently developed 1 This work is financially supported by National Funds through FCT – Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I. P., under the project UID/CED/ 00194 / 2013 and under a PhD grant SFRH/BD/ 103005 / 2014. and one of its aims is to allow a consistent evaluation of the plurilingual and intercultural communicative competences involved and developed in an intercomprehensive experience. In this study, an interactional perspective of <b>intercomprehension</b> is favoured. It is assumed that the interaction between students that live in different languages and cultures allows them to develop plurilingual and intercultural competences, which is intensified by new forms of communication associated to virtual mobility, such as chats, forums or blogs. In order to contribute to the piloting and further validation of REFIC, which is still in a conceptualized version, we will be analyzing the multilingual chats and forums from the session “Poliglotta? No, plurilingue!” from the Galanet platform using its categories. We will be focusing on a cognitive dimension and the research questions guiding this study will be: which knowledge on languages and cultures and how is it mobilized and developed in multilingual chatrooms in a pedagogical session on <b>intercomprehension?</b> The “Poliglotta? No, plurilingue!” session took place in 2014, between February 3 rd and April 10 th, and was attended by 168 Secondary School students from Spain, Italy, France and Portugal, whose participation is directly related and connected with their language learning at school. There were 7 multilingual chat sessions and 64 discussion forums, which will be analyzed bearing in mind the categories from “II. Les langues et les cultures” from REFIC. We expect to find evidence on the development of knowledge on different dimensions of language and culture, such as organization and social usage of a language and role of culture in communication. This approach puts multilingual virtual communication and interaction in the centre of learning, {{which is one of the}} trends in multilingual education that can only be fully recognized once a framework of competences in <b>intercomprehension</b> in validated and adopted...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a critical reflection and a synthesis on {{the links between}} European policies aimed at promoting plurilinguism and the <b>Intercomprehension</b> approach, 25 years after its first appearance in the languages teaching environment. In particular, it focuses on Italy’s role in different <b>Intercomprehension</b> projects that have emerged and on how Italy promotes this new approach. The European Union set a target whereby all European citizens should speak two foreign languages in addition to mother tongues. This poses the challenge of which languages to choose both within European Institutions and within the educational systems. Moreover it leads to reconsider the place traditionally assigned to English. This European target remains far from being achieved, {{as demonstrated by the}} Eurobarometro polls. Against this background, the <b>Intercomprehension</b> solution still offers a credible option that could be extremely powerful if it were to be rigorously applied on a large scale, as we try to demonstrate. In fact, this approach respects the variety of languages and cultures by considering them within their linguistic families. It is a simple, time-effective and flexible approach for multiple audiences. An examination of the case of Italy allows one to observe how a new dynamic can emerge by participating in several European projects and how it is possible to slowly start thinking about a set of different actions that would help achieve the objective of European plurilinguism...|$|E

L’école a longtemps ignoré les langues et cultures maternelles des élèves.

Une étude de l’évolution historique des programmes scolaires français laisse enfin entrevoir la perspective d’ouvrir l’école au plurilinguisme, en adéquation avec les préconisations des Institutions Européennes. L’intercompréhension entre langues apparentées, apparaît comme une modalité d’apprentissage favorisant la compréhension et le fonctionnement de plusieurs langues, d’autant plus si l’apprentissage organise l’intégration des langues entre elles.

It has been at the core of several research projects since the ’ 90 s, and as of 2011 the team of researchers within Intermar (a European Cooperation Project funded by the EU Commission’s Lifelong Learning Programme, under Key Action 2 of the Transversal Programme, coordinated by Prof. F.

40|$|In {{this talk}} {{we will discuss}} the role of L 1 in {{flipping}} the language classroom {{and its impact on}} the learning process, a traditional discussion, not only in SFL, but in foreign language teaching as a whole, in which several extreme positions are still defended without providing the added value of any of them. Nussbaum (1991) differentiates between three groups of foreign language teachers: a first group where teachers never use the mother tongue, a second group who defends the use of the mother tongue only for elucidations, metalinguistic explanations and translation of concepts and difficult words (especially at beginners levels) and a third group who only uses the mother tongue in crisis situations, when they observe that communication blocks. Despite the absence of a detailed reasoning in favor of the exclusion of L 1 in the classroom, this position is commonly used in Spanish for adult education (the most common form of Spanish language education in Flanders). Nevertheless, several studies conclude that the use of only the FL has some important disadvantages in the learning process: Suby and AsenciÃ³n-Delaney (2009) refer to various investigations made by Chaudron and Thompson, which show that the simplified language used by the teacher gives students fewer chances to evaluate their input. Chaudron and Thompson also show that beginner students of Spanish use the FL less creatively and donât improve their listening skills significantly, despite receiving much input of the FL from the teacher. On the other hand, "the use of L 1 limited to metalanguage, instructions and difficulties of crisis moments degrades L 1 to the status of a merely negative instrument, not making the most of its possibilities to reinforce the learning process in a positive way" (Buyse, Fernández and González, 2012; translations is ours). One of those posibilities is found in the field of <b>intercomprehension,</b> which is defined as "la capacité de comprendre une langue étrangère sans l'avoir apprise sur la base d'une autre langue. En général, les variétés d'une même langue sont intercompréhensibles" (Meissner et al., 2004). In <b>intercomprehension</b> and plurilingualism didactics several studies (e. g. Meissner et al. 2004, Vez 2007, Carullo et al. 2010) are based on the idea that common structures are more beneficial than detrimental when learning a second or third language from the same family. That is the reason why the EU is currently financing several projects aiming to design strategies, materials and activities promoting <b>intercomprehension</b> and plurilingualism in language learning (e. g. BabelWeb). In this talk we will look into the possibilities for the reference to L 1 in the language classroom and its arguments pro and contra, both from a historical point of view and from the actual state of art.

One of those posibilities is found in the field of <b>intercomprehension,</b> which is defined as âla capacitÃ© de comprendre une langue Ã©trangÃ¨re sans lâavoir apprise sur la base dâune autre langue. En gÃ©nÃ©ral, les variÃ©tÃ©s dâune mÃªme langue sont intercomprÃ©hensiblesâ (Meissner et al., 2004). In <b>intercomprehension</b> and plurilingualism didactics several studies (e. g. Meissner et al. 2004, Vez 2007, Carullo et al. 2010) are based on the idea that common structures are more beneficial than detrimental when learning a second or third language from the same family. That is the reason why the EU is currently financing several projects aiming to design strategies, materials and activities promoting <b>intercomprehension</b> and plurilingualism in language learning (e. g. BabelWeb). In this talk we will look into the possibilities for the reference to L 1 in the language classroom and its arguments pro and contra, both from a historical point of view and from the actual state of art. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ogni contributo è stato {{double-blind}} {{peer reviewed}} in fase di selezione per la partecipazione al Convegno e successivamente, in vista della presente pubblicazione. The multilingual interaction that characterizes language learning throughout {{the use of}} different languages (Candelier 2007) is a noteworthy factor {{in the study of}} plurilingual competence as well as of intercultural communicative competence (Araújo and Sá, De Carlo, Melo-Pfeifer 2010). After presenting the platforms implemented by Galanet, Galapro and MIRIADI projects, we will analyze the processes of interaction and relational skills established by speakers coming from countries of Romance area. We will draw inspiration from examples which are taken from some online sessions; in particular, a part of our analysis will focus on the project MIRIADI to test a part of the framework on <b>Intercomprehension</b> skills whose preparation is in progress...|$|E
40|$|This {{book is a}} first {{comparative}} study of the Nuni dialects. Nuni is a Gurunsi-Gur language spoken in Burkina Faso. This dialectological study is based on new first hand lexical and sentential data which are presented in the book. The lexical dialectological study shows that the dialect of Yatini (Silly) is closest {{to all the other}} dialects and shows the least differences. Impressionistic <b>intercomprehension</b> judgements from two different age groups of speakers shows that this dialect is best understood by speakers of other dialect. The study provides a motivated recommendation to choose this dialect as a dialect of reference for implementation of Nuni in the educational system. Such a recommendation is imminent {{in the light of the}} start of bilingual (French-Nuni) education the area. Promotores: M. P. G. M. Mous, A. DelplanqueWith summary in Dutc...|$|E
40|$|Simone Lecointre : « Humour, Ironie : signification et usage » This {{essay on}} pragmatic {{linguistics}} takes {{another look at}} Wittgenstein's theory of « Real Linguistic Transactions » by analysing concrete applications. Different uses of the contrastive structure « HUMOUR vs IRONY » are demonstrated by varying co- enonciators and discursive situations. Taken within a specific context, each co-enonciator selects its extra-linguistic signs and sets up its own model of referenciation creating new « language games » each time. These « language games » change word « grammar » by changing references, resulting in « <b>intercomprehension</b> ». Lecointre Simone. Humour, Ironie — signification et usage.

40|$|<b>Intercomprehension</b> between similar {{languages}} {{of the same}} family is to a certain measure a natural phenomenon. However, comprehension of a close language will very often be disturbed by many opaque elements, which are not understandable without a better knowledge of its grammar or vocabulary. A methodology {{similar to the one}} offered by the manual Eurom 5 allows learners to work on their comprehension of a language family and its functioning. In Eurom 5, the learning process is focused on the knowledge of a “romance system”, bringing out the particularities of each of the languages dealt with within the manual. With such a system in place, a better comprehension of these languages is guaranteed. We have been trying to adapt such a concept to western and south-western Slavic languages, focusing at first on Czech, Slovenian and, to a lesser extent, Croatian...|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of the European {{language}} policy, higher education institutions are assigned an enormous role and expectations when it comes to promoting individual multilingualism (i. e. plurilingualism). Drawing upon the language policy developments and research in this area, this paper aims to show the pathways to developing learners ’ plurilingual/multilingual repertoires at the tertiary level. Ac-cordingly, the author will outline the psycholinguistic tenets of individual multilingualism as well as current priorities and recent tendencies in what has been referred to as plurilingual education. Such concepts as partial and transversal competences, <b>intercomprehension,</b> learning L 3 through L 2, CLIL, interdisciplinary communicative competence and international cooperation will be highlighted. The emphasis will be placed on the design and implementation of a coherent language policy by higher education institutions; in addition, a number of good practices institutions may take pride in and the obstacles they ultimately face will be described...|$|E

Here we apply the self confrontation- and methods taken from Linguistics- to the Ergonomist to understand the tine mecanisms of the <b>intercomprehension</b> between the Ergonomist-Interviewer and young Interviewees. They face a ” imp&ant problem of rehabilitation. The Ergonomist helps them to prepare the skills assessment they have to submit to. This study is based on!umwledge,derived from interactionist linguistics and so&-linguistics. It helps in the knowledge ofthe profession of Ergonomist.

40|$|This paper aims {{to situate}} the various areas of {{discourse}} analysis {{with respect to}} general typological or intersecting characteristics, and to èxtend our apprehension of «true meaning» as far as possible. It suggests that unacceptable phrases and paralinguistic elements can be included in semantics, and that non-spontaneous cited or transcribed discourse can be considered alongside spontaneous oral and written discourse. A distinction is made between the «producer» (who is «responsible») and the «emitter»; between the «addressee» (who is deliberately targeted) and the «receiver». The emitter is often citing a third party, while the addressee is often non-specific or accidental. Provision is made for conflictual relationships between speakers (claiming {{the right to speak}} in public) and messages with pseudo addressees, which give the function of expression priority over the function of communication. The phatic function merely maintains a relationship between speakers which is detrimental to meaning, just as violence may ensue when <b>intercomprehension</b> breaks down...|$|E
