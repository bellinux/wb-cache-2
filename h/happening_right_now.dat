[...] However, the pacifism and concern for the environment that formed the basis of Franquin's politics and would be expressed much more bluntly in Idées noires were already surfacing in Gaston (and Spirou et Fantasio). [...] Very occasionally, Franquin stepped over the mark, as in an uncharacteristically angry strip where Gaston uses a toy Messerschmitt plane to strafe the whole office in protest at their (real life) appearance in the magazine's modelling column (while building the model, he says: “… and now, the swastikas. They are very popular amongst retards”). [...] Outside of Spirou however, Franquin had a free rein, and used Gaston in promotional material for diverse organisations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In the former, activists scare whales away from whalers by plucking the dreaded gaffophone. [...] For the latter, Franquin produced a gut-wrenching sequence where Gaston is beaten and tortured and forced to watch M'oiselle Jeanne raped in front of him, before being sent to a prison camp.

40|$|Copyright © 2007 by WIT PressThere is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} cost of our ‘disposable society’ is beginning to take a toll and that the continued use of unsustainable resources will have a severe detrimental affect upon the living standards of our successive generations. The possibility of our fossil-fuel resources running dry becomes more likely as the global demand for power increases. This particular resource is also directly responsible for releasing copious quantities of previously entombed carbon directly into our atmosphere, possibly causing global warming. Quite obviously there is therefore a need to consider other means of energy generation that reduce our rate of consuming this finite resource, while also reducing the potential for damage to our planet. This {{is by no means a}} new concept, but while scientists and engineers have the ability to initiate change through design, there does not seem to be the level of urgency required to implement effective action. Perhaps there is public confusion regarding alternative energy sources, or perhaps there is simply not sufficient widespread concern for something dramatic to <b>happen</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> As this paper will show, engineering education can be the starting point for change. Graduate engineers can lead the way by researching, designing and developing new practical alternative fuel applications if they are sufficiently enthusiastic. These same engineers can also improve the public’s understanding of alternative energy applications. A number of problem based learning projects have therefore been introduced at The University of Adelaide to develop the necessary graduate attributes while also developing a passion for the development of alternative energy solutions. The merits and outcomes of two projects are discussed here: The Biodiesel Motorbike Project and The Hybrid Electric-Solar Car Project...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} high {{resolution}} simulation of an idealized model {{to explain the}} origin of the two young, counter-rotating, sub-parsec scale stellar disks around the supermassive black hole SgrA * at the Center of the Milky Way. In our model, the collision of a single molecular cloud with a circum-nuclear gas disk (similar to the one observed presently) leads to multiple streams of gas flowing towards the black hole and creating accretion disks with angular momentum depending on the ratio of cloud and circum-nuclear disk material. The infalling gas creates two inclined, counter-rotating sub-parsec scale accretion disks around the supermassive black hole with the first disk forming roughly 1 Myr earlier, allowing it to fragment into stars and get dispersed before the second, counter-rotating disk forms. Fragmentation of the second disk would lead to the two inclined, counter-rotating stellar disks which are observed at the Galactic Center. A similar event might be <b>happening</b> again <b>right</b> <b>now</b> at the Milky Way Galactic Center.

We are all made of stardust. In fact all life is sprung out of dust. In my essay I investigate the dust and ask the question if there are any traces in the dust. I {{look at the history of}} the dust and how it has affected us and our world through the decades. What does this small and airy but oh so unappreciated dust tell us? Why do we want to get rid of it? Is it possible to find a sense of belonging in the big context by investigating the dust and its origin and could I transform such a low material as dust into something magic that makes people reflect on our origin and belonging and how everything is connected? In my work I use dust as a material and in the essay I compare my work with other artists who have worked with dust as a material. Dust is everywhere because its source is from everything. I as a crafter also contribute to the dust making when I mechanically process material. We all share the atmosphere and breathe the same air and by that means we all share the dust particles. With every breath we take we inhale 1000 of dust particles and without knowing it the wind could have brought invisible camelhair from the Sahara desert that you just know have inhaled into your system. The most fascinating is that under your bed you can find traces of particles that have come all the way from outer space. In fact, each year it rains down 100 tons of cosmic dust from outer space down to our planet, particles that come from asteroids or comets and could contain hundred thousand of smaller particles of diamonds and sapphires that might come from a time when our planet was formed. I found that through the dust you can read the whole history of the universe. It holds the information of what has <b>happened,</b> what <b>happened</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and what will happen. The dust reveals all our secrets; it holds the past and present at the same time. The dust is on its way to become and at the same time on its way from being.  In the dust you can find traces of me, you and the universe. By investigating the dust I have found a new view of the world. I have found a sense of belonging in the big context, where everything is connected and part of the same origin. Even in the darkest corner you can find magic. We are all diamonds fallen from the sky. The full thesis contains copyrighted material which has been removed in the published version. </p...|$|R
