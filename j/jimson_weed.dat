2500|$|Historically, and {{possibly}} {{related to the}} [...] "Reefer Madness" [...] legend, some people (particularly Americans) had confused cannabis with <b>Jimson</b> <b>weed</b> (Datura stramonium). <b>Jimson</b> <b>weed,</b> which grows wild in the United States and several other countries, is a potent deliriant which can cause true hallucinations and delusions that are believed by the user to be real, {{as opposed to the}} pseudohallucinations and perceptual distortions typically caused by cannabis. Confusion could have resulted from the fact that Daturas common name contains the word [...] "weed," [...] which is also a slang term for cannabis, and the fact that both plants (as well as others) have been given the moniker [...] "locoweed" [...] {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. [...] Aside from these superficial similarities, the two plants are not related and have very little to do with one another, and thus should not be confused. [...] <b>Jimson</b> <b>weed</b> is highly toxic and can cause delirium, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, photophobia, dry mouth, urinary retention, hyperthermia, incoordination, hypertension, and rapid heartbeat among other effects. [...] An overdose (or suspected overdose) on this substance is a medical emergency, as it can cause seizures, coma, or death by cardiac arrest.|$|E

2500|$|Psychoactive {{substances}} often {{bring about}} subjective (although {{these may be}} objectively observed) changes in consciousness and mood that the user may find rewarding and pleasant (e.g., euphoria or a sense of relaxation) or advantageous (e.g. increased alertness) and are thus reinforcing. Substances which are both rewarding and positively reinforcing {{have the potential to}} induce a state of addiction– compulsive drug use despite negative consequences. In addition, sustained use of some substances may produce physical or psychological dependence or both, associated with somatic or psychological-emotional withdrawal states respectively. Drug rehabilitation attempts to reduce addiction, through a combination of psychotherapy, support groups, and other psychoactive substances. Conversely, certain psychoactive drugs may be so unpleasant that the person will never use the substance again. This is especially true of certain deliriants (e.g. <b>Jimson</b> <b>weed),</b> powerful dissociatives (e.g. Salvia divinorum), and classic psychedelics (e.g. LSD, psilocybin), {{in the form of a}} [...] "bad trip".|$|E

5000|$|In Hoodoo herbalism, the [...] "cure-all" [...] {{was very}} popular among followers. The cure-all was a Hoodoo mixture that could solve all problems.

50|$|Datura species (especially Datura stramonium, {{commonly}} known as <b>Jimson</b> <b>weed)</b> are common poisonous weeds in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family.

50|$|Included in {{this group}} are such plants as Atropa {{belladonna}} (deadly nightshade), Brugmansia species (Angel's Trumpet), Datura stramonium (<b>Jimson</b> <b>weed),</b> Hyoscyamus niger (henbane), Mandragora officinarum (mandrake), and Myristica fragrans (nutmeg), {{as well as a}} number of pharmaceutical drugs, when taken in very high doses, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and its close relative dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). Uncured tobacco is also a deliriant due to its intoxicatingly high levels of nicotine.|$|E
50|$|Western {{flower thrips}} are a year-round pest, but are less {{destructive}} during wet weather.
