He designed a <b>fencing</b> <b>blade</b> for the Leon Paul company. [...] He wrote his autobiography in 2004, Fencing Is My Life. The book was translated into French and published in France in 2013 under the title L'escrime dans la peau.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blade</b> Club (<b>Fencing)</b> Singapore is a {{commercial}} fencing club founded 2005 by Henry Koh, an ex-National fencer of Singapore. The club teaches fencing students at all levels, from beginner to advanced fencing in {{group or individual}} lesson formats. According to the Club website, {{the mission of the}} Blade Club is to help develop fencing in Singapore, focusing on helping students to learn fencing well and to achieve success in competitive <b>fencing.</b> <b>Blade</b> Club has classes for all three weapons in fencing: foil, epee, and sabre. The Club is located along Bukit Timah Road, Singapore.|$|R

50|$|In {{the sport}} of <b>fencing,</b> <b>blades</b> used in {{competitions}} run {{under the auspices of}} the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime are usually made with maraging steel. Maraging blades are superior for foil and épée because crack propagation in maraging steel is 10 times slower than in carbon steel, resulting in less blade breakage and fewer injuries. Stainless maraging steel is used in bicycle frames and golf club heads. It is also used in surgical components and hypodermic syringes, but is not suitable for scalpel blades because the lack of carbon prevents it from holding a good cutting edge.|$|R

50|$|Christiane is a {{transfer}} student from Germany who knows little about Japan outside {{of what she}} had seen in jidaigeki dramas. She tends not to read the atmosphere when problems arise but follows Yamato's orders to exactly what he says. She wields a unique <b>fencing</b> <b>blade</b> which she uses with great speed. She acts flustered around Yamato as these two tend to end up in unusual situations. She has a strong sense of justice which served to put her and Yamato at odds as Yamato uses dirty tricks and any means necessary to win. However, she eventually understands that Yamato uses such tactics in order to protect his friends above all else and she approves of it. She has a sister type relationship with her father's lieutenant Margit and they even sleep in the same bed. She is extremely loving towards her father, who in turn is extremely protective of Christiane to the point of threatening any boy who tries to flirt with her. She also has an extreme passion for teddy bear collecting, with her room being full of them. Christiane also has a rivalry with Kazuko and they compete in all sorts of areas such as running and squatting, with Christiane being the victor more often.|$|R

5000|$|Gold Base (also {{variously}} {{known as}} Gold, Golden Era Productions, Int Base, or Int) is the confidential de facto international {{headquarters of the}} Church of Scientology. It is located at 19712 Gilman Springs Rd,San Jacinto in Riverside County, California and about 100 miles km from Los Angeles. The heavily guarded compound comprises about 50 buildings surrounded by high <b>fences</b> topped with <b>blades</b> and watched around the clock by patrols, cameras and motion detectors. The property is bisected by a public road, which is closely monitored by the Church with cameras recording passing traffic.|$|R
2500|$|... : Table saws {{commonly}} have a fence (guide) {{running from}} the front of the table (the side nearest the operator) to the back, parallel to the cutting plane of the blade. The distance of the <b>fence</b> from the <b>blade</b> can be adjusted, which determines where on the workpiece the cut is made. The fence is commonly called a [...] "rip fence" [...] referring to its use in guiding the workpiece during the process of making a rip cut. Most table saws come standard with a rip fence, but some high end saws are available without a fence so a fence of the user's choice can be purchased separately.|$|R
5000|$|Corpsstudenten (corps students) wear couleur (colored {{stripes and}} caps) and {{practice}} Mensuren, academic <b>fencing</b> with razor-sharp <b>blades</b> {{that can result}} in bleeding face wounds, Schmisse. The corps usually bear names that reflect their former origin from certain German regions, such as Saxonia (Saxony) or Guestphalia (Westphalia). Formerly, when a distance {{of a few hundred}} kilometres between a student's home town and his university meant weeks of travel, students from the same part of Germany traveled together and formed some kind of [...] "new family". The distance, plus the fact that they carried the money for a complete semester with them in a bag, might also explain why students began fencing, simply for self-defense, for students, military officers and aristocrats were the only people allowed to carry arms.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} the flow separation {{in the corner}} (i. e., 'corner separation') between a wall and a single wing in a wind tunnel and in a highly loaded compressor cascade was performed. As a passive flow control device a single vortex generator placed in each corner on the wing or the guide vane reduces the corner separation considerably. The experiments with the single wing were carried out for Reynolds numbers of Re= 0. 2 x 10 " 6 to 1. 2 x 10 " 6 in a low speed wind tunnel. With flow visualisation techniques it was shown that a significant reduction of the corner separation and an improvement of the two-dimensionality of the flow can be achieved with vortex generators. Force measurements of the wing profiles with vortex generators showed a lift increase and a drag reduction. In order to extend {{the design of the}} vortex generators for an application in turbomachines, a small cascade test section was developed, which works with realistic Mach and Reynolds numbers. The side wall boundary layer thickness can be adjusted within a wide range by side wall suction or spoilers. Measurements with vortex generators, boundary layer <b>fences</b> and <b>blades</b> with slits (in the side wall region) were carried out. Flow visualisations showed a significant reduction of the corner spearation on the guide vane and the wall. First results already showed improvements. Further loss reductions are to be expected during a continuation of the project. (orig.)

2500|$|The American-style cabinet saws {{generally}} {{follow the}} model of the Delta Unisaw, a design that has evolved since 1939. Saws of this general type are made in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, and China. These saws are characterized by a cast iron top on a full-length steel base, square in section, with radiused corners. Two 3/8" [...] deep by 3/4" [...] wide miter slots are located parallel to the blade, one {{to the left of the}} blade and one to the right. The most common type of rip fence mounted to this type of saw is characterized by the standard model made by Biesemeyer (now a subsidiary of Delta). It has a sturdy, steel T-type fence mounted to a steel rail at the front of the saw. It has replaceable laminate faces. American cabinet saws are normally designed to accept a [...] " [...] wide stacked dado blade in addition to a standard saw blade. The most common size of blade is 10" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of [...] ", but 12" [...] or 14" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of 1" [...] are found in commercial/industrial sites. American saws normally include an anti-kickback device that incorporates a splitter, toothed anti-kickback pawls and a clear plastic blade cover. American style saws have an easily replaceable insert around the blade in the table top. This allows the use of zero-clearance inserts, which greatly reduce tear out on the bottom of the workpiece. It is common for this type of saw to be equipped with a table extension that increases ripping capacity for sheet goods to 50". The saw blade can tilt to either the left side or right side of the saw, depending on {{the model of}} saw. The original Delta Unisaw and early cabinet saws based on it were all right-tilt units while newer Delta Unisaws and many competitive cabinet saws made after 2000 are left-tilt saws. The switch to left-tilt design is due to a lower perceived propensity for the cut piece to become trapped between the rip <b>fence</b> and <b>blade</b> and kick back when the blade tilts away from the rip fence (left tilt saw) versus towards the rip fence (right tilt saw.) While conceptually simple in design, these saws are highly evolved and are capable of efficient, high volume, precision work.|$|R
5000|$|Black Pete {{walks through}} the camp as he {{inspects}} it and tells himself [...] "Hmm, the camp sure is peaceful tonight" [...] and goes through the cabins to see the soldiers sleeping, where he checks one of the cabins that is sleeping peacefully {{to discover that the}} snoring was a record and the things in bed were [...] "dummies" [...] (including Donald Duck.) Speaking of which, Donald Duck sneakingly arrives at the Army Camp, after some unauthorized leave. Knowing Donald Duck's coming, Black Pete goes into Donald's bed to surprise him. Donald Duck goes to his bed, and sleeps in it, knowing that he [...] "put it over on the sarge", not realizing that Black Pete is in. But when he does, Donald runs for it. Pete chases Donald and Donald hides under one of three boxes, Donald switches the boxes repeatably to fool Black Pete. But when Pete finds him, and when Donald is still hiding in the box, Black Pete kicks Donald's box which flies through the <b>bladed</b> <b>fence</b> and the box cracks in half as Donald's lower half falls in a hole. But Donald thinks that his lower half was cut off, and when Pete comes, he realizes that he killed Donald and he is crying over Donald's tragedy. Donald feels so upset, he grabs Black Pete's gun and attempts suicide. But Black Pete tells him to do it [...] "Over there, behind the bushes", to which Donald comes out of the hole realizing that his lower half was not cut off. Donald feels relieved, but Black Pete on the other hand feels angry. So Pete chases Donald to a sign which says National Speed Limit: 35 mi, so Donald and Black Pete chase more slowly (and even the music slows down) as the clip ends.|$|R
