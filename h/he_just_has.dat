500|$|Farrell starred with Kate Beckinsale in Columbia Pictures' Total Recall, a 2012 {{remake of}} the 1990 film with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Filmed from May to September 2011 in Toronto and {{directed}} by Len Wiseman, the film was a new sci-fi take about a sleeper agent. Costar Jessica Biel appreciated Farrell's skills, calling the actor [...] "surprising and exciting. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> {{the ability to be}} trying different things all the time." [...] Roger Ebert and the New York Times said that although they believed Farrell the better actor, Schwarzenegger in the original was [...] "more of a movie presence and better suited for the role".|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Wilcox and story editor Ethan Gross, and was directed by frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson. Around the time the episode aired, executive producer and showrunner J.H. Wyman said of Anderson, [...] "If {{we come up with}} this great concept and say, 'That's going to be tricky to shoot,' we know he's going to transcend it because <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> that way of looking at film as a feature director where anything's possible." [...] Wyman and fellow executive producer and showrunner Jeff Pinkner planned the Fauxlivia pregnancy storyline since they conceived her character; according to them, they departed from the typical television pregnancy trope by [...] "Fringe-if it" [...] and adding a science fiction element.|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{original}} first-person shooter elements were removed by the third revision of the game, which incorporated a more spy-oriented style of gameplay, with the player [...] "trying to quietly take out enemies and not be seen." [...] Chung commented that he reworked the game several more times to fit his vision: [...] "It kept on just changing and changing and changing until it got into a more story-oriented direction." [...] He stated {{that he did not}} feel comfortable developing Gravity Bone as a first-person shooter game, and kept adding [...] "bits and bits of more and more unconventional" [...] elements as a result. He explained that he [...] "got stuck on this idea of the hero never fires a gun, but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> a bunch of tools on his belt, like a power drill or a can of pressurized Freon, a screwdriver. I thought that was kind of funny and interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we really see George as the character we know and love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{testing the}} limits of what he can get away with, such as {{interrupting}} church attendants by having a Bible fight, kicking open the stall doors in a girls' bathroom, and saying [...] "testicles" [...] through a microphone at a fast food restaurant, Peter goes behind the counter and sees a [...] "Fryolator" [...] and wants to take it home. [...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie {{on the grounds that}} Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks {{that the best way to}} do that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland’s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} season, Rypien {{made the}} Canucks' line-up out {{of training camp}} {{for the first time}} in his career. After scoring two goals in the first five games in 2008–09, he suffered a sports hernia on October 19, 2008. Upon recovering, he was granted an indefinite leave of absence for personal reasons. The Canucks organization alluded to Rypien's history of injuries as the main reason for him not returning to the team. Assistant general manager Lorne Henning stated that [...] "It's just wearing on him now - it's frustrating for him. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> to deal with the injuries … and wrap his head around it." [...] It was later made known, following his death, that Rypien was struggling with clinical depression. He returned after a 70-game absence on March 31, 2009, in a contest against the Minnesota Wild. He appeared in 12 games for the Canucks in 2008–09, recording three goals and no assists. The season marked Vancouver's return to the playoffs after failing to qualify the previous season. After eliminating the St. Louis Blues in the first round, they were defeated in six games by the Chicago Blackhawks. Rypien appeared in all ten Canucks playoff games and recorded two points (both assists) while playing on the fourth-line alongside Darcy Hordichuk and Ryan Johnson. He recorded his first playoff point in Game 4 of the second round against Chicago, assisting on a Hordichuk goal with a spin-o-rama pass.|$|E
5000|$|Phillips was {{uneasy about}} using {{earth-moving}} {{equipment in the}} muck around Rozel Point, where Smithson wanted to create the jetty. “It’s tricky working out on that lake,” Phillips said. “There’s lots of backhoes buried out there.” Smithson, in hip-wader boots, was in full command on the site. “When we got out there, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> took over,” Phillips said. “I don’t think he had done any geology work or anything on it. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> in his mind what it should look like.… <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> the eye for it.

2500|$|Before Slumdog Millionaire was released, Patel {{auditioned for}} the role of Zuko by {{submitting}} a tape to the studio. Shyamalan called Patel personally to inform him that he got the part. Training for the film was intense, as he had to learn Wushu and different martial arts. Patel recalls fighting, punching, and throwing and said the experience was [...] "truly amazing." [...] While he was filming Slumdog in India, he would finish a take and turn one of the channels over to the animated series. Even though it is based on a cartoon, he wanted to bring as much of himself as possible to the character he was portraying. Shaun Toub, who was cast as Iroh, describes his character in the first film as [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "free". He compares Zuko's [...] "obsession" [...] to his childhood memories and how kids are always looking for their parents' approval, saying that Zuko just wants his father's. [...] "He isn't necessarily bad, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> a great deal of built up anger and forgets to consider others. I think people will understand that he's not bad, he's just angry and hurting because he really wants his father to love him, but his father is too busy with other things." [...] He says that Patel is an [...] "18 year old with all this energy," [...] and that Patel was able to influence him into appreciating the business of filmmaking more. While comparing the animated series to the film, he says the film is much more serious. He attributed this change to the director trying to relate to every age group, rather than just kids.|$|E

5000|$|The {{object of}} the game was to solve word puzzles that {{consisted}} of a sentence or short paragraph with four blank spaces, usually incorporating a pun or play on words.

A typical puzzle: [...] "The _____ wasn't _____, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a _____ in his _____ [...]" [...] With the words [...] "sick," [...] "code," [...] "spy," [...] and [...] "nose," [...] the solution would be: [...] "The spy wasn't sick, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a code in his nose." ...|$|R
