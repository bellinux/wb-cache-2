Also studied are the possible ways of defining the SIP Servlet API and how it can be implemented together with the existing HTTP Serve out API and servlet engine. In addition, several prototypes are given to show how to use the SIP Servlet API to create the typical <b>IP</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services,</b> such as, call forwarding, call waiting, etc...|$|E

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the problems with}} positioning of emergency telephone calls. Emergency calls to the emergency number “ 112 ” answered by the emergency service in Sweden cannot always be positioned. That is, it cannot be decided where the call is coming from. The problem with positing of emergency calls is mainly caused by emergency calls coming from Internet Protocol (<b>IP)</b> <b>telephones.</b> Since the use of <b>IP</b> <b>telephones</b> are {{increasing the number of}} emergency calls coming from <b>IP</b> <b>telephones</b> will increase. For the emergency service to provide a secure and reliable service to the public it is crucial that all emergency calls can be positioned correctly. The report explains how emergency calls are connected towards the emergency service in Sweden, from the different types of telephones that support emergency calls. For the traditional fixed land line all emergency calls can be positioned, when using a mobile telephone 90 % of the emergency calls can be positioned. The <b>IP</b> <b>telephones</b> can be divided into two categories, fixed and nomadic. When a fixed <b>IP</b> <b>telephone</b> is used the emergency call can always be positioned correctly, the problem occurs when a nomadic <b>IP</b> <b>telephone</b> is used. Interviews have been held with the four largest <b>IP</b> <b>telephone</b> operators to get their views of the problem and whether they have an opinion on how to solve the problem. Practical tests have been performed to show the problem and when it occurs. To solve the problem with positioning of emergency calls coming from <b>IP</b> <b>telephones</b> an international standard must be set. New features needs to be implemented in the networks so that the calls coming from <b>IP</b> <b>telephones</b> can be positioned and utilize positioning features such as GPS. A lot of work still remains before an international standard can be set...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method of}} building an open VoIP telephone using off-the-shelf hardware. VoIP has become an important area of study in computer science and engineering, {{but many of the}} pieces are expensive and proprietary. We discuss the process of building an open <b>IP</b> <b>telephone,</b> the design decisions and difficulties, a performance evaluation of the different pieces of the system, and methods and suggestions for improving the overall system. The <b>IP</b> <b>telephone</b> is built on the Freescale 68 HC 12 microcontroller because of its analog and digital capabilities and the Linksys WRT 54 GL router for its embedded simplicity and network capabilities. The lightweight Embedded Xinu operating system was selected to build up the VoIP capabilities on top of a functional network stack. Our results show that building this VoIP device is viable. The completed <b>IP</b> <b>telephone</b> establishes a call between two routers using UDP network transport and μ-law companding. The roundtrip latency is less than two milliseconds, and the phone has a PESQ MOS (voice quality) of 3. 13...|$|R
