5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other places they form part of the normal diet. Insects have a high protein content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as a major source of protein in <b>human</b> <b>nutrition.</b> In most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.|$|E

5|$|Vegetables can {{be eaten}} either raw or cooked and play an {{important}} role in <b>human</b> <b>nutrition,</b> being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended.|$|E
5|$|The food {{industry}} {{is also a}} major consumer of amino acids, in particular, glutamic acid, which {{is used as a}} flavor enhancer, and aspartame (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie artificial sweetener. Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the <b>human</b> <b>nutrition</b> industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} edge of the central campus area sits Memorial Stadium, the old Ralph Engelstad Arena, and the Hyslop Auditorium. These {{structures}} are all old athletic venues which have been replaced with new structures elsewhere on campus. The eastern part of campus is also the home of the Energy and Environmental Research Center complex which includes the National Center for Hydrogen Technology. The Grand Forks <b>Human</b> <b>Nutrition</b> Research Center, which is operated by the United States Department of Agriculture, is also in this part of campus. A five-story parking garage sits at the corner of University Avenue and Columbia Road. At the extreme eastern portion of campus sits University Park which is operated by the Grand Forks Park District.|$|E

5|$|Vegetables play an {{important}} role in <b>human</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In <b>human</b> <b>nutrition,</b> most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
40|$|Meat {{and milk}} production, {{which is the}} main source of <b>human</b> <b>nutritions,</b> can be {{significantly}} increased provided that animals are accommodated in barns designed based on the project criteria. Factors such as climate, construction system, construction materials and breeding types should be considered in planning animal barns. In this study, present situation of barns of beef and dairy cattle enterprises in the Van region, where most of people gain their income from animal farming, was determined and the possibilities to improve these barns were investigated. Also appropriate barn design criteria suitable to climatical conditions of the region was determined and was found that long side of the barns should be positioned in the north-south direction for natural aeration, {{which is one of the}} most significant environmental factors, of the barns...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in <b>human</b> <b>nutrition,</b> the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and glycolysis, and the synthesis of steroids and porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} {{development}} of these compounds, much more research has been conducted, and {{has been applied to}} <b>human</b> <b>nutrition</b> products in a similar manner to the animal nutrition experiments that pioneered the technology.

25|$|The Surface-based Body Shape Index (SBSI) is {{far more}} {{rigorous}} and is based upon four key measurements: the body surface area, vertical trunk circumference, waist circumference and height. Data on 11,808 subjects from the National Health and <b>Human</b> <b>Nutrition</b> Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999–2004, showed that SBSI outperformed BMI, waist circumference, and A Body Shape Index (ABSI), an alternative to BMI.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This review {{summarizes}} the early effects and responses of low doses of UV-B {{at the molecular}} level. {{in the case of}} four bean cultivars from Romania. The DNA molecules of the plant cells are damaged by UV due to the formation of different photoproducts. such as cyclobutane- pyrimidine dimers. (CPDs). which in turn can be combated by specialized photoreactivating enzyme systems. The investigation were done by using ELISA with specific monoclonal antibodies. CPDs formation increased during UV-B exposure. and photorepair led to descrease. The choice of Phaseolus vulgaris as biological material for investigations. {{can be explained by the}} importance of seeds and legumes in <b>humans</b> <b>nutrition.</b> being considered since centuries the poor peoples “meat” because of the increased level of high quality proteins. and the high energetically level. and due to the importance in soil amelioration. being used as very good previous culture plant for many other species...|$|R

25|$|Archaeological data {{indicates}} that the domestication of various types {{of plants and animals}} happened in separate locations worldwide, starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene around 12,500 years ago. It was the world's first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. The Neolithic Revolution greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available, with a switch to agriculture which led to a downturn in <b>human</b> <b>nutrition.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of rice to <b>human</b> <b>nutrition</b> and food security in Asia, the domestic rice markets tend to be subject to considerable state involvement. While the private sector plays a leading role in most countries, agencies such as BULOG in Indonesia, the NFA in the Philippines, VINAFOOD in Vietnam and the Food Corporation of India are all heavily involved in purchasing of paddy from farmers or rice from mills and in distributing rice to poorer people. BULOG and NFA monopolise rice imports into their countries while VINAFOOD controls all exports from Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Consumed {{worldwide}} by {{billions of}} people, wheat {{is a significant}} food for <b>human</b> <b>nutrition,</b> particularly in the least developed countries where wheat products are primary foods. When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a healthy food source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber recommended for children and adults, in several daily servings containing a variety of foods that meet whole grain-rich criteria. Dietary fiber may also help people feel full and therefore help with a healthy weight. Further, wheat is a major source for natural and biofortified nutrient supplementation, including dietary fiber, protein and dietary minerals.|$|E
