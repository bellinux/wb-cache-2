40|$|Abstract With {{the aim of}} {{extending}} the use of integrated variational principles on fluid and <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> to the large deflection analysis of floating roofs, this paper investigates {{the significance of the}} flexural and membrane components in the formulations of the <b>deck</b> <b>plate.</b> Applying integrated variational principles on <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> and fluid facilitate the treatment of the compatibility of deformation between floating roof and supporting liquid. Analysis results showed that different assumptions about <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> formulation were commonly used in the literature which resulted in considerably different deflection and stress patterns on the floating roof. The results showed that modeling of the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> as a flexural element rather than membrane, by eliminating the need for nonlinear analysis, gave reasonable results for deflections and stresses in the <b>deck</b> <b>plate.</b> Finally, a simple and efficient procedure using linear finite element code analyzes of the floating roofs, considering only the flexural stiffness was developed...|$|R

500|$|In 1970, Ark Royal {{embarked}} 892 NAS {{as part of}} her air {{group for}} the first time, with a total of 12 aircraft. The first operational use of the Royal Navy's Phantoms had come in 1969, when 892 NAS had embarked for training with the US aircraft carrier [...] in the Mediterranean, and had undertaken air defence missions alongside the ship's own F-4Js. This deployment showed the necessity for the modifications fitted to Ark Royal, as the heat from the afterburners of the Spey, combined with the increased angle of attack resulting from the extendable nosewheel, during the initial launches from Saratoga caused the <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> to distort, leading to subsequent catapult launches being undertaken at reduced weight without the use of re-heat. During Ark Royals first three-year commission, 892 NAS, which had initially used RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset as its home base, moved to RAF Leuchars in Fife where, during the periods when it was not embarked, it undertook Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) duties alongside the RAF's 43 Squadron. The Phantom served in the Fleet Air Arm until 1978, when Ark Royal was finally withdrawn from service, leaving no ship in the Royal Navy capable of operating the type. The final catapult launch from Ark Royal was a Phantom of 892 NAS on 27 November 1978 during the disembarkation of the air group following the ship's final deployment; the squadron's aircraft were delivered to RAF St Athan in Wales, where they were handed over to the RAF. During the type's service with the Royal Navy, 10 of the total FAA fleet of 28 were lost in crashes.|$|E

The options to cure this were discussed at length until Marshal Voroshilov, the People's Commissar for Defense approved the addition of anti-torpedo bulges in 1939 which would increase the ship's underwater protection and rectify her stability problem. The second part of the reconstruction was carried out between December 1939 and July 1940. A pair of bulges were fitted that extended from the forward magazine to the rear magazine that increased the ship's beam by [...] They had an unusual form that consisted of an outer void compartment intended to weaken the explosive force of the torpedo backed by a relatively narrow section immediately adjacent to the original hull that extended from above the waterline {{to the bottom of the}} bilge. This was divided into two compartments; the lower of which was kept full of either fuel oil or water to absorb splinters and fragments from the explosion while the upper compartment was filled with small watertight tubes intended to preserve the ship's waterplane area and minimize flooding from gunfire hits around the waterline. The underwater torpedo tubes were incompatible with the bulges and were removed at this time. The bulges increased her standard displacement to , increased her metacentric height to [...] and reduced her speed to [...] The Soviets took advantage of her extra stability to reinforce her deck armor by completely replacing her middle deck armor with [...] cemented armor plates originally intended for s.

500|$|Station {{reconstruction}} {{to accommodate}} the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, with the existing structure {{to be used as}} exits with The lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for {{five and a half years}} (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the [...] "umbrella" [...] covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The <b>deck</b> <b>plates</b> were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical 3ft diameter concrete foundations, sunk from 43 up to 73ft deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. Service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A pre-stressed concrete raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson's third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel. The interchange passageway between the Central line and the Bakerloo line in the area of the former junction with the Bakerloo line lift landing was replaced by the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel. From there, a pilot tunnel Ventilation systems were rearranged with a new ventilation plant installed in the former Bakerloo line lift shaft. A new substation for the Bakerloo line was built at the bottom of the shaft. With the additional escalators in place, the one-way circulation scheme was introduced and the remaining lifts were removed.|$|E

40|$|Due to an {{unexpected}} increase of heavy traffic large fatigue cracks appeared through the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> of orthotropic steel bridge decks in the Netherlands. Visual inspection revealed {{that this particular}} type of crack initiates where a weld joins the <b>deck</b> <b>plate,</b> a rib and a girder. These critical points are commonly inspected from the roadside, which necessitates that the road is closed down for all traffic and that the wear layer is first removed. To overcome these costly drawbacks a new method is proposed that enables ultrasonic inspection of the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> from {{the underside of the}} bridge deck. The method requires a combination of two special measurement techniques, which are optimised for the bridge problem at hand. To detect the maximum crack depth an angled pitch-catch technique is employed. The crack length can be detected along the rib weld by employing the simpler pulse-echo technique. The crack depth and crack length are determined from the respective ultrasonic data sets by a calibration, which relates the number of detected waves to the actual crack size. The calibration is determined by ultrasonically monitoring the various crack stages during a fatigue test that is conducted on a bridge deck specimen. The original, uncracked state and the final state where the cracks can be visibly detected in the <b>deck</b> <b>plate</b> determine the extremes. The tests show that a reasonable accurate detection of crack size is quite possible, while the visual inspections prove to be useless until the crack has already grown completely through the <b>deck</b> <b>plate.</b> The new method provides a crack depth and crack length estimate with an accuracy of ± 15 %.
