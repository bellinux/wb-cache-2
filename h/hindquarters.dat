5|$|The mezair: A {{series of}} {{successive}} levades {{in which the}} horse lowers its forefeet to the ground before rising again on <b>hindquarters,</b> achieving forward motion. This movement is no longer used at the Spanish Riding School.|$|E
5|$|Monument 15 {{is a large}} boulder with an Olmec-style relief {{sculpture}} of the head, shoulders and arms of an anthropomorphic figure emerging from a shallow niche, the arms bent inwards at the elbow. The back of the boulder is carved with the <b>hindquarters</b> of a feline, probably a jaguar.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{tradition of}} the vodiondry, still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, {{is said to have}} originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondrymeat from the <b>hindquarters</b> of a sheepwhich he believed to be the tastiest portion. The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the <b>hindquarters</b> of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for the groom to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary offerings of meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic piastre, sums of money and other gifts.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the <b>hindquarters.</b> He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle mass in the ankles but more at the <b>hindquarters.</b> John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E
5|$|It {{has a long}} broad {{nose and}} muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around {{the tip of the}} muzzle. Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the {{forequarters}} and the <b>hindquarters</b> are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight.|$|E
5|$|Other {{distinctive}} features are a relatively long, level croup, or {{top of the}} <b>hindquarters,</b> and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled <b>hindquarters</b> suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their endurance, and {{the superiority of the}} breed in Endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's {{absence of}} major {{conformation}} flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet {{are less likely}} to become injured. Secretariat's <b>hindquarters</b> were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloring}} of the addax's coat {{varies with}} the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white <b>hindquarters</b> and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders. In the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an 'X' over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs stick out between their curved and spiralling horns, ending in a short mane on the neck.|$|E
5|$|The head is well-proportioned {{and similar}} to that of the Selle Francais, with wide nostrils, small ears and a {{straight}} or convex facial profile. The neck is thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes roached. The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The <b>hindquarters</b> are powerful, although not so much as in heavy draft breeds, and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E
5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, {{with a straight}} or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong <b>hindquarters</b> with a well-rounded croup. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess feathering. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they are quick to learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Andriamasinavalona {{established}} {{new rules}} {{to strengthen the}} authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam-pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the <b>hindquarters</b> of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without children would revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{typically}} {{bite the}} throat {{just behind the}} jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. Blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or <b>hindquarters,</b> causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes usually leave the hide {{and most of the}} skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin, and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the <b>hindquarters</b> (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{themselves}} {{are subject to}} predation. Most species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas continuously ram them with their heads, slap them with their tails and fling them in the air. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. Pups are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well. Large sharks are another major predator of pinnipedsâ€”usually the great white shark but also the tiger shark and mako shark. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. The prey usually escapes, and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted wounds. Otariids typically have injuries in the <b>hindquarters,</b> while phocids usually have injuries on the forequarters.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the <b>hindquarters</b> are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|Several ancient English towns {{displayed}} the Royal Arms of England upon their seals and, when {{it occurred to}} them to adopt insignia of their own, used the Royal Arms, albeit with modification, as their inspiration. For instance, {{in the arms of}} New Romney, the field is changed from red to blue. Hereford changes the lions from gold to silver, and in the 17th century was granted a blue border charged with silver saltires in allusion to its siege by a Scottish army during the English Civil War. The town council of Faversham changes only the <b>hindquarters</b> of the three lions to silver. Berkshire County Council bore arms with two golden lions in reference to its royal patronage and the Norman kings' influence upon the early history of Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas have {{a complex}} set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often {{combined}} with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its <b>hindquarters.</b> Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the <b>hindquarters</b> high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|The Limousin {{is a large}} framed {{breed of}} beef cattle with a bright wheat-coloured coat, not too dark, a little lighter on the belly, {{the rear of the}} thighs, between the legs, on the anus, around the {{testicles}} or udder, and the tail tip. Absence of any spots or pigmentation, with pink mucous membranes. Short head, broad forehead and muzzle, lighter area around the eyes and muzzle, fine horns curved forward and slightly raised at the tip (if present). Short neck. Chest broad and rounded. Side round. Pelvis wide, especially at the pin bones, not too inclined. Bones of lower back and hips slightly protruding. Forequarter well-muscled, wide above and very muscular. <b>Hindquarters</b> thick, deep and rounded. Horns and hooves lighter coloured. Correct limbs. Fine supple hide.|$|E
5|$|The head is {{long and}} strong, with a convex profile and thick, long ears. The neck {{is long and}} the {{shoulders}} are sloping. The chest is broad and deep, the withers prominent, the back long and broad, and the <b>hindquarters</b> strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed {{has been known for}} its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the <b>hindquarters,</b> called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
5|$|When attacked, {{the common}} toad adopts a {{characteristic}} stance, inflating its body and standing with its <b>hindquarters</b> raised and its head lowered. Its chief means of defence {{lies in the}} foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin. This contains a toxin called bufagin and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it. Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs, rats and mink, and even domestic cats. Birds that feed on toads include herons, crows and birds of prey. Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the animal's liver, thus avoiding the toxin. The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not the great crested newt. Aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae, diving beetles and water boatmen. These usually avoid the noxious secretion by puncturing the tadpole's skin and sucking out its juices.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Devonian period (360 {{million years}} ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates, though some, such as Ichthyostega, may have {{sometimes}} hauled themselves out of the water. It is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs, dragging their <b>hindquarters</b> in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal. In the early Carboniferous (360 to 345 million years ago), the climate became wet and warm. Extensive swamps developed with mosses, ferns, horsetails and calamites. Air-breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment. There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were {{at the top of the}} food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile. Though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air, most still had a long tapering body and strong tail. They were the top land predators, sometimes reaching several metres in length, preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water. They still needed to return to water to lay their shell-less eggs, and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors. It was the development of the amniotic egg, which prevents the developing embryo from drying out, that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed.|$|E
5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the <b>hindquarters</b> and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens die {{most often}} by being shot or poisonedâ€”generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by {{vehicles}} than Australian magpies. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished {{in their first}} year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as {{they are more likely to}} come into conflict with farmers. The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird, showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason. However, the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs. Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked. Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs. Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21â€“44% protein, 9â€“37% fat and 10â€“30% carbohydrate. It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb's <b>hindquarters</b> or tail. The raven bites a sleeping lamb's tail, holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up. A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird, but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable. Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills. Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops. In areas of Western Australia, the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976, meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal, although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted.|$|E
25|$|In {{countries}} such as the United States, where there exists a large nonkosher meat market, the <b>hindquarters</b> of the animal (where many of these forbidden meats are located) is often sold to non-Jews, rather than trouble with the process. This tradition goes back for centuries where local Muslims accept meat slaughtered by Jews as consumable; however, the custom was not universal throughout the Muslim world, and some Muslims (particularly on the Indian subcontinent) did not accept these <b>hindquarters</b> as halal. In Israel, on the other hand, specially trained men are hired to prepare the <b>hindquarters</b> for sale as kosher.|$|E
25|$|When {{the horse}} shortens its stride, it rebalances its weight toward the <b>hindquarters.</b> In the actual {{collected}} canter, the horse should carry {{the majority of}} its weight on the hind end, rather than the front end. The <b>hindquarters</b> will sink lower toward the ground, and the forehand will appear higher and lighter. The horse should maintain tempo, rhythm, and impulsion.|$|E
25|$|The Terebellum {{is a small}} {{quadrilateral}} of four faint stars (Omega, 59, 60, 62) in Sagittarius' <b>hindquarters.</b>|$|E
25|$|When a horse collects, {{more weight}} {{moves to the}} <b>hindquarters.</b> Collection is natural for horses and is often seen during pasture play. A {{collected}} horse can move more freely. The joints of the hind limbs have greater flexion, allowing the horse to lower the <b>hindquarters,</b> bringing the hind legs further under the body, and lighten and lift the forehand. In essence, collection is the horse's ability to move its centre of gravity to the rear.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drawings}} {{of particular interest}} include the uterus of a pregnant cow, the <b>hindquarters</b> of a decrepit mule and studies of the musculature of a little dog.|$|E
25|$|Dhole packs {{occasionally}} attack Asiatic {{black bears}} and sloth bears. When attacking bears, dholes {{will attempt to}} prevent them from seeking refuge in caves, and lacerate their <b>hindquarters.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the lion}} cut, the <b>hindquarters,</b> muzzle, and {{the base of}} the tail are shaved {{and the rest of the}} body is left full length. This cut {{originated}} with the fishing dogs of Portugal. This is the traditional cut and perhaps the most functional, given the breed's history as a fisherman's companion. The lion cut diminished the initial shock of cold water when jumping from boats, as well as providing warmth to the vitals. The <b>hindquarters</b> were left shaved to allow easier movement of the back legs and the powerful, rudder-like tail.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the rider}} should use half-halts as {{the horse is}} raising its head and neck upward (during the {{suspension}} phase), because this is when the horse is engaging its <b>hindquarters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Collected gaits (trot and canter) : A {{shortening}} of stride {{in which}} the horse brings its <b>hindquarters</b> more underneath himself and carries more weight on his hind end. The tempo does not change, the horse simply shortens and elevates his stride.|$|E
25|$|Cracking {{the whip}} is {{reserved}} for extreme cases, such as a horse that refuses to move forward. If overused, the horse may begin to ignore it. Cracking upsets some horses. If a crack is needed, it is done behind the <b>hindquarters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Collected trot: A very engaged trot {{where most}} of the horse's weight is carried toward the <b>hindquarters.</b> The frame is {{compressed}} and the stride length is shorter {{than any of the other}} trots with the horse taking higher steps. The horse is lighter and more mobile in the collected trot.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} signs in horses {{are similar to}} cattle. The muscle paralysis is progressive; it usually begins at the <b>hindquarters</b> and gradually moves to the front limbs, neck, and head. Death generally occurs 24 to 72 hours after initial symptoms and results from respiratory paralysis. Some foals are found dead without other {{clinical signs}}.|$|E
