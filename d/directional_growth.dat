2500|$|Newman et al. (2006) {{inserted}} conductive and non-conductive fibers into a collagen-TERP scaffold (collagen cross-linked with a terpolymer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm) [...] ). The fibers were embedded by tightly wrapping {{them on a}} {{small glass}} slide and sandwiching a collagen-TERP solution between it and another glass slide; spacers between the glass slides set the gel thickness to 800µm. The conductive fibers were carbon fiber and Kevlar, and the nonconductive fibers were nylon-6 and tungsten wire. Neurites extend in all directions in thick bundles on the carbon fiber; however with the other three fibers, neurites extended in fine web-like conformations. The neurites showed no <b>directional</b> <b>growth</b> on the carbon and Kevlar fibers, but they grew along the nylon-6 fibers {{and to some extent}} along the tungsten wire. The tungsten wire and nylon-6 fiber scaffolds had neurites grow into the gel near the fiber-gel interface in addition to growing along the surface.

40|$|Abnormal {{grain growth}} in ODS superalloys, {{which leads to}} the desired coarse grain structures, was examined. A heat {{treatment}} in a temperature gradient (i. e. zone annealing) causes <b>directional</b> grain <b>growth</b> producing very elongated grain structures. Two temperature limits were determined which control the abnormal grain growth process: an "initiation temperature" (T(aKw)) which must be reached to initiate the process, and a "minimum temperature" (T(w)) required to maintain abnormal growth. T(w) is always lower than T(aKw) both of which define the temperature range in which abnormal grain growth occurs continuously during zone annealing without the "nucleation" of new coarse grains. The physical explanation of these two temperatures is associated with the mechanisms of the onset and the propagation of abnormal grain growth. These mechanisms can be best understood by the influence of foreign atoms on grain boundary motion (impurity-drag theory) ...|$|R
40|$|One central {{question}} in development biology is how individual cell behaviors contribute to tissue morphogenesis. Growth plate cartilage contains morphologically distinct populations of chondrocytes in different zones {{during much of}} its growth phase, indicating a link between regulated cell behaviors and tissue elongation. To gain insights into this process, we develop a robust avian embryonic metacarpal culture system, and employ time-lapsed live 2 -photon laser scanning microscopy to observe the cartilage growth. Quantitative analysis of the cellular displacements during the tissue growth reveals that cells in the proliferative and prehypertrophic zones, though morphologically distinct, display similar displacement trajectories, contributing in a linearly additive fashion to the unidirectional tissue growth. Our analysis rules out cell division and convergence-extension as the driving mechanisms for tissue elongation; rather, anisotropic matrix deposition and cell volume enlargement are responsible for sculpting the <b>directional</b> tissue <b>growth...</b>|$|R

In this issue of The EMBO Journal, Tortoriello et al (2014) show that the microtubule-binding protein SCG 10 / stathmin- 2 is a specific molecular target for a CB 1 receptor-mediated effect of D 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psycho-active ingredient of smoked marijuana, in the fetal brain. Considering the role of CB 1 in modulating the specification and long-distance migration of neurons in the perinatal brain, this study reveals an inter-esting mechanism potentially accounting for connectivity deficits during cortical development following exposure to CB 1 agonists or THC during pregnancy.

50|$|Electrotaxis (or galvanotaxis) is the {{directional}} {{movement of}} motile cells {{in response to}} an electric field. It has been suggested that by detecting and orienting themselves toward the electric fields, cells are able to direct their movement towards the damages or wounds to repair the defect. It also is suggested that such a movement may contribute to <b>directional</b> <b>growth</b> of cells and tissues during development and regeneration. This notion is based on the existence of measurable electric fields that naturally occur during wound healing, development and regeneration; and cells in cultures respond to applied electric fields by directional cell migration - electrotaxis / galvanotaxis.|$|E
50|$|The solid-liquid {{interface}} must be well-defined crystallographically {{in order}} to produce highly <b>directional</b> <b>growth</b> of nanowires. It is also {{important to point out that}} the solid-liquid interface cannot, however, be completely smooth. Furthermore, if the solid liquid interface was atomically smooth, atoms near the interface trying to attach to the solid would have no place to attach to until a new island nucleates (atoms attach at step ledges), leading to an extremely slow growth process. Therefore, “rough” solid surfaces, or surfaces containing a large number of surface atomic steps (ideally 1 atom wide, for large growth rates) are needed for deposited atoms to attach and nanowire growth to proceed.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{chemotactic}} cues provide essential signaling directing the <b>directional</b> <b>growth</b> of pioneer axons. Chemotactic cues are {{unique in that}} they can be multifunctional and versatile. A single chemotactic cue can both act as an attractant or repellent to pioneer axons, and may work from either a distance or within the immediate vicinity. More specifically, the interactions between chemotactic cues and growth cones can offer a possible explanation for the diversity that is observed in their behavior. Guidance molecules are heavily involved in steering the directions of growth cones. For example, guidance molecules can initiate, extend, stabilize, or retract individual filopodia, as well as attract various adhesion molecules to impact their physical state.|$|E
40|$|<b>Directional</b> cell <b>growth</b> {{requires}} that cells read and interpret shallow chemical gradients, but how the gradient directional information is identified remains elusive. We use single-cell analysis and mathematical modeling {{to define the}} cellular gradient decoding network in yeast. Our results demonstrate that the spatial information of the gradient signal is read locally within the polarity site complex using double-positive feedback between the GTPase Cdc 42 and trafficking of the receptor Ste 2. Spatial decoding critically depends on low Cdc 42 activity, which is maintained by the MAPK Fus 3 through sequestration of the Cdc 42 activator Cdc 24. Deregulated Cdc 42 or Ste 2 trafficking prevents gradient decoding and leads to mis-oriented growth. Our work discovers how a conserved set of components assembles a network integrating signal intensity and directionality to decode the spatial information contained in chemical gradients...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRecA and its homologs help {{maintain}} genomic integrity through recombination. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays and hidden Markov modeling, we show {{the most direct}} evidence that a RecA filament grows and shrinks primarily one monomer {{at a time and}} only at the extremities. Both ends grow and shrink, contrary to expectation, but a higher binding rate at one end is responsible for <b>directional</b> filament <b>growth.</b> Quantitative rate determination also provides insights into how RecA might control DNA accessibility in vivo. We find that about five monomers are sufficient for filament nucleation. Although ordinarily single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) prevents filament nucleation, single RecA monomers can easily be added to an existing filament and displace SSB from DNA at the rate of filament extension. This supports the proposal for a passive role of RecA-loading machineries in SSB removal...|$|R
40|$|The formation, maintenance, and {{plasticity}} {{of neural}} circuits {{rely upon a}} complex interplay between progressive and regressive events.

50|$|Thigmotropism is a <b>directional</b> <b>growth</b> {{movement}} {{which occurs}} as a mechanosensory {{response to a}} touch stimulus. Thigmotropism is typically found in twining plants and tendrils, however plant biologists have also found thigmotropic responses in flowering plants and fungi. This behavior occurs due to unilateral growth inhibition. That is, the growth rate {{on the side of}} the stem which is being touched is slower than on the side opposite the touch. The resultant growth pattern is to attach and sometimes curl around the object which is touching the plant. However, flowering plants have also been observed to move or grow their sex organs toward a pollinator that lands on the flower, as in Portulaca grandiflora.|$|E

40|$|Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) {{are grown}} using {{chemical}} synthesis, and the exact positioning and chirality of CNTs {{are very difficult}} to control.
