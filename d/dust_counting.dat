40|$|Abstract: Performance of a direct-reading handy {{equipment}} for <b>dust</b> <b>counting</b> in workroom air, PDR (MIE, USA), was field-tested {{in comparison with}} the results of low-volume air samplinggravimetry. Application in 64 workplaces of various type dust work with dust concentrations of up to 1. 6 mg/m 3 showed that the agreement was generally good with a correlation coefficient (r) > 0. 64. The calculated regression line had a slope close to one, and the intercept on the axis was next to nil, suggesting that the measurement with PDR is essentially the same with that by low-volume air sampling. Further analysis by types of dust work disclosed that the correlation was best when examined in 12 foundries with r as large as 0. 95. In contrast, r was small (0. 52) in 11 welding workplaces, possibly due to smaller particle size of dust generated during welding.

40|$|Four {{groups of}} rats were treated by {{inhalation}} with the UICC preparations of amosite or chrysotile {{in order to}} explore the effects of intermittent high dust concentrations (peak dosing). For each of the 2 asbestos types one group of rats was treated for 5 days each week, 7 h a day, for 1 year. Two other groups were treated with amosite or chrysotile at 5 times the previous dose for 1 day each week for 1 year. Results showed that the lung dust levels of both chrysotile or amosite in the lungs of rats after the 12 -month inhalation period were similar regardless of whether "peak" or "even" dosing had been used. During the following 6 months, asbestos was cleared from the "peak" chrysotile group more slowly than the "even" chrysotile group but clearance from the "peak" amosite group was faster than that found after "even" dosing with amosite. Levels of early peribronchial fibrosis were generally lower for the "peak" dosing groups than for "even" dosing although levels of interstitial fibrosis were slightly higher following "peak" dosing. The incidence of pulmonary neoplasms did not differ between the "peak"-dosing and "even"-dosing experiments.

Individual dust exposure estimates were derived from <b>dust</b> <b>counts</b> from two similar plants. With as little as one month or less of employment, about 20 % of the films showed parenchymal abnormality and about a third showed pleural abnormality.

It is concluded that with exposure to high concentrations to amosite such as existed in this factory and with follow up for at least 20 years, (1) exposure for as little as a month was sufficient to produce radiological signs of parenchymal and pleural fibrosis, (2) no cumulative exposure threshold for parenchymal and pleural fibrosis was detectable, and (3) parenchymal and pleural progression were still detectable >/= 20 {{years after the end of}} exposure...|$|R

Detections of single dust particles allow us to estimate the anisotropic dust flux from 67 P, infer the dust loss rate and size distribution at the surface of the sunlit nucleus, and see whether the dust size distribution of 67 P evolves in time. The velocity of the Rosetta orbiter, relative to 67 P, is much lower than the dust velocity measured by GIADA, thus <b>dust</b> <b>counts</b> when GIADA is nadir-pointing will directly provide the dust flux.

40|$|Occupational {{exposures}} to hand-arm vibration and dust {{have been shown}} to have deleterious human health effects. Exposure to vibration from pneumatic tools can result in Hand-arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), which is a collection of vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal disorders. Exposure to dust can result in a variety of adverse respiratory symptoms. The use of a low-frequency, high-magnitude sand rammer tool during mold-making processes at a foundry could result in significant exposure to these hazards, thus it is important to mitigate the associated risks in order to ensure worker safety. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether different pneumatic pressure levels and sand rammer types have an effect on reducing hand-arm vibration and dust exposures at a foundry. Vibration and dust measurements were obtained at three different pneumatic pressure levels (90 psi, 80 psi, 70 psi) and for three different sand rammer types (LM, SM, T). The primary concern of the study was reducing hand-arm vibration exposure. Measurements were taken in compliance with ISO 5349 - 1 resulting in frequency-weighted, root-mean-square (rms) acceleration values (m/s 2). Significant differences in mean rms acceleration were observed across all pneumatic pressure levels and sand rammer types. At 90 psi the mean rms acceleration value was 25. 53 m/s 2, decreasing to 19. 58 m/s 2 at 80 psi, and further decreasing to 18. 38 m/s 2 at 70 psi. The mean rms acceleration values were 19. 63 m/s 2 for sand rammer LM, 21. 46 m/s 2 for SM, and 19. 95 m/s 2 for T. The results of this study indicate that reducing pneumatic pressure levels can reduce vibration exposure in the workplace when using low-frequency, high-magnitude tools. The results also indicate that the use of different sand rammer types produces differences in vibration exposure when tested across all pneumatic pressure levels. Dust measurements were taken concurrently with vibration measurements. The number of <b>dust</b> particles was <b>counted</b> for each pneumatic pressure level and sand rammer type. Overall, the mean particle <b>count</b> for the <b>dust</b> measurements was the highest at 90 psi (41, 681) followed by 70 psi (33, 514), and 80 psi (26, 047).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of {{inhalation}} of feed flour dust and dustborne endotoxin on respiratory tracts of pigs. ANIMALS: 29 healthy Belgian Landrace pigs. PROCEDURE: Pigs housed in an environmental chamber were exposed for 6 days to feed flour dust (1 to 15 mg/m 3) and dustborne endotoxins (50 to 2, 500 ng/m 3). Effects were evaluated by measuring albumin concentration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, cell composition of nasal lavage (NL) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and blood, and percentages of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes in blood and lavage fluids. Dustborne endotoxin was obtained by mixing endotoxins from Escherichia coli (serotype O 127 :B 8) with feed flour before spraying the flour in the environmental chamber. RESULTS: Exposure did not affect cell composition of NL fluid or blood. Total cell counts of BAL fluids were increased in all groups exposed to <b>dust.</b> Macrophage <b>counts</b> were increased in pigs exposed to inhalable dust concentrations as low as 4. 4 mg/m 3, and lymphocyte counts were increased in groups exposed to high dust concentrations.

We simultaneously constrain the dust luminosity function, thermal dust spectral energy distribution (SED) and clustering properties of CIB sources, {{and the evolution}} of these quantities over cosmic time. We find that the data strongly require redshift evolution in the thermal dust SED. In our adopted parametrization, this evolution takes the form of an increase in graybody dust temperature at high redshift, but it may also be related to a temperature - dust luminosity correlation or evolution in <b>dust</b> opacity. The <b>counts</b> and spectra together constrain the evolution of the thermal dust luminosity function up to z 2. 5 - 3, complementing approaches relying on rest-frame mid-infrared observations of the rarest bright objects.

The measurements indicate a large drop in particle flux immediately interior to Thebe's orbit and some detected particles seem to be on highly-tilted orbits with inclinations up to 20 deg.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze {{possible}} random and systematic measurement errors and to detect methodological limits of the previously established method. Findings To examine the distribution of random errors (repeatability standard deviation) of the detection procedure, collective samples were taken from two uncontaminated rooms using a sampling vacuum cleaner, and 10 sub-samples each were examined with 3 parallel cultivation plates (DG 18). In this two collective samples of new <b>dust,</b> the total <b>counts</b> of Aspergillus spp. varied moderately by 25 and 29 % (both 9 cfu per plate). At an average of 28 cfu/plate, the total number varied only by 13 %. For the evaluation of the influence of old dust, old and fresh dust samples were examined. In both cases with old dust, the old dust influenced the results indicating false positive results, where hidden moist was indicated but was not present. To quantify the influence of sand and sieving, 13 sites were sampled in parallel using the 63 -μm- and total dust collection approaches. Sieving to 63 -μm resulted in a more then 10 -fold enrichment, due to the different quantity of inert sand in each total dust sample. Conclusion The major errors during the quantitative evaluation from house dust samples for mould fungi as reference values for assessment resulted from missing filtration, contamination with old dust and the massive influence of soil. If the assessment is guided by indicator genera, the percentage standard deviation lies in a moderate range. </p...|$|R
40|$|Women in vaKaranga {{society of}} the 15 th to 17 th centuries have been portrayed as oppressed by an 2 ̆ 2 {{extremely}} patriarchal 2 ̆ 2 system, but the reality, while still fitting the simple classification of a 2 ̆ 7 patriarchal 2 ̆ 7 monarchy, indicates {{quite a bit more}} negotiation of gendered powers than women, as a class, experienced in the Mediterranean or East Asia. The vaKaranga were the architects of Great Zimbabwe, the capital of a growing state, colonizing their cousins of the Zambezi river, which their Kusi-Mashariki Bantu forefathers had traversed southward a millennium before. Civil war had (apparently) split one nation into two states, Mutapa (Monomotapa) and Khami (Torwa, Toroa, Changamire) immediately before Portuguese ships arrived at Sofala in 1502. Statements like 2 ̆ 2 women are dust, one does not <b>count</b> <b>dust</b> 2 ̆ 2 have been used to illustrate the traditional social outlook of the Shona, descendants of the vaKaranga and a major population in present-day Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and central Moçambique. However, close reading of early Portuguese-language sources on women in vaKaranga society suggests that, prior to influence from these original European colonists, vaKaranga women negotiated everyday and political power in a near-even exchange with men, predicated on the imbalance of power women held in the metaphysical dimension, their control of industries from gold production to staple crop production and a strategy for minimizing economic risk for a king transacting a brideprice or 2 ̆ 7 rovora 2 ̆ 7 exchange. In this, vaKaranga women are exceptions to the theory that societies must become more gender imbalanced as they begin to form classes and state-level monarchies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDust {{aerosols}} are {{an important}} component of the climate system and a challenge to incorporate into weather and climate models. Information on the location and magnitude of dust emission remains a key information gap to inform model development. Inadequate surface observations ensure that satellite data remain the primary source of this information over extensive and remote desert regions. Here, we develop estimates of the relative magnitude of active dust emission over the Sahara desert based on data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Utilising the unique vertical profile of aerosol characteristics provided by CALIOP our algorithm identifies emission from aerosol extinction and lidar backscatter in the near surface layers. From the long-term CALIOP archive of day and night-time orbits over 2006 – 13 we construct coarse resolution maps of a new dust emission index (DEI) for the Sahara desert during the peak summer dust season (June to September). The spatial structure of DEI indicates highest emission over a broad zone focused on the border regions of Southern Algeria, Northern Mali and northwest Niger, displaced substantially (∼ 7 °) to the east of the mean maximum in satellite-derived aerosol optical depth. In this region night-time emission exceeds that during the day. The DEI maps substantially corroborate recently derived <b>dust</b> source frequency <b>count</b> maps based on back-tracking plumes in high temporal resolution SEVIRI imagery. As such, a convergence of evidence from multiple satellite data sources using independent methods provides an increasingly robust picture of Saharan dust emission sources. Various caveats are considered. As such, quantitative estimates of dust emission may require a synergistic combined multi-sensor analysis...|$|R
40|$|Workplace aerosol {{sampling}} {{has been}} used to assess exposure to airborne materials that are known to cause adverse health effects in the respiratory system. Respirable cyclones are a common instrument used to monitor occupational exposures to respirable particles and are designed to have a penetration similar to the definition for the respirable fraction. However, deposited particles inside the walls of the cyclone may influence the penetration of cyclones. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if there is a difference in collection efficiencies of a clean SKC 37 -mm aluminum cyclone compared to a SKC 37 -mm aluminum cyclone deposited with polydispersed <b>dust.</b> Glass beads (<b>Count</b> Median Diameter CMD 3. 3 µm, Geometric Standard Deviation GSD 1. 7) were used to test a clean cyclone. The cyclone was then loaded by sampling with one of three dust types individually for three hours at concentrations of at least 3 mg/m 3 : Arizona Road Dust (CMD 1. 04 µm, GSD 1. 57), organic dust (CMD 2. 90 µm, GSD 1. 77), and titanium oxide (CMD 0. 85 µm, GSD 1. 28). After the cyclone was deposited with dust without cleaning, glass beads were used to retest the penetration. Particle penetration was measured using the Aerosol Particle Sizer (APS, TSI 3321). Particles depositing on the walls of the cyclone caused a shift in the penetration compared to clean samplers. When the cyclone was loaded with Arizona Road Dust, the penetration of particles increased as much as 5 % at 3. 5 µm. Depositing with Organic Dust increased particle penetration as much as 4 % at 3. 5 µm. Depositing did not occur with Titanium Oxide and did not significantly particle penetration. Sampling with cyclones deposited with polydispersed particles can cause sampling errors by oversampling, and therefore overestimate the respirable concentration relative to a clean sampler. To counteract sampling errors from deposited particles would require the cyclone to be thoroughly dried and clean before sampling...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to develop and}} evaluate a practical dust removal method for livestock housing using electrostatic precipitation techniques. Laboratory and animal housing studies were conducted;High voltage negative ionizing electrodes and positive collectors were used to charge and remove airborne dust particles from the air. Different negative ionizing electrodes, protective enclosures, and collectors were investigated in the laboratory. Ionizing equipment was compared in a test chamber with a measured dust sample introduced into the chamber before each trial. Particle count data were collected;Needlepoint and wire ionizing electrodes were compared and no {{significant difference was found}} between dust decay rates. Because of the electrical shock hazard with high voltage electrodes, protective enclosures with and without forced air movement were investigated. Enclosure type affected the level of corona discharge and ion distribution. Ion distribution was controlled by the electric field forces rather than movement of the forced air. Therefore, a 58 % open plastic mesh protective enclosure was used. Area tube collectors with and without an insulating coating to reduce the shock hazard were also investigated. The coating reduced the dust removal rate by about 24 %;Prototype tests were conducted in an animal production unit to obtain a quantitative estimate of dust removal under typical operating conditions. Two animal chambers with similar ventilation, temperature control, and management were used. Each chamber housed 48 nursery pigs;Particle count and mass samples were collected. Particle size ranges collected were the same between the animal study and laboratory study [...] 0. 5 - 1. 0 micron, 1. 0 - 2. 0 micron, 2. 0 - 5. 0 micron, 5. 0 - 10. 0 micron, and greater than 10. 0 micron. Mass samples were taken with a 0. 8 micron filter and vacuum pump. All systems evaluated in this study resulted in a significant reduction in airborne dust concentration. Without ionization, typical particle counts were between 76 and 169 million particles per cubic meter (mppcm). With ionization <b>dust</b> control, particle <b>counts</b> were between 38 and 86 mppcm. Percent reductions of 57 % to 66 % of all dust particles were achieved with ionization. Comparing particle count and mass data indicates that particles greater than 2. 0 micron are removed more effectively than particles less than 2. 0 micron...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGalileo was {{the first}} {{artificial}} satellite to orbit Jupiter. During its late orbital mission the spacecraft made two passages through the giant planet's gossamer ring system. The impact-ionization dust detector on board successfully recorded dust impacts during both ring passages and provided the first in-situ measurements from a dusty planetary ring. During the first passage – on 5 November 2002 while Galileo was approaching Jupiter - dust measurements were collected until a spacecraft anomaly at 2. 33 R (Jupiter radii) just 16 min after a close flyby of Amalthea put the spacecraft into a safing mode. The second ring passage on 21 September 2003 provided ring dust measurements down to about 2. 5 R and the Galileo spacecraft was destroyed shortly thereafter in a planned impact with Jupiter. In all, a few thousand <b>dust</b> impacts were <b>counted</b> with the instrument accumulators during both ring passages, but only a total of 110 complete data sets of dust impacts were transmitted to Earth. Detected particle sizes range from about 0. 2 to 5 μm, extending the known size distribution by {{an order of magnitude}} towards smaller particles than previously derived from optical imaging Showalter, M.

The size distribution for the Amalthea ring derived from our in-situ measurements for the small grains agrees very well with the one obtained from images for large grains. Our analysis shows that particles contributing most to the optical cross-section are about 5 μm in radius, in agreement with imaging results. The measurements indicate a large drop in particle flux immediately interior to Thebe's orbit and some detected particles seem to be on highly-tilted orbits with inclinations up to 20 °. Finally, the faint Thebe ring extension was detected out to at least 5 R, indicating that grains attain higher eccentricities than previously thought. The drop interior to Thebe, the excess of submicron grains at Amalthea, and the faint ring extension indicate that grain dynamics is strongly influenced by electromagnetic forces. These findings can all be explained by a shadow resonance as detailed by Hamilton, D. P. and Krüger, H. (2008). Jupiter's shadow sculpts its gossamer rings., 453 : 72 – 75...|$|R
