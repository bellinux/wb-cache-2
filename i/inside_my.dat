25|$|In September 2008, {{he took an}} {{unprecedented}} move for a living artist by selling a complete show, Beautiful <b>Inside</b> <b>My</b> Head Forever, at Sotheby's by auction and bypassing his long-standing galleries. The auction exceeded all predictions, raising £111million ($198million), breaking the record for a one-artist auction as well as Hirst's own record with £10.3million for The Golden Calf, an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves, preserved in formaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|Hirst is a {{supporter}} of the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International. In September 2008, Hirst donated the work, Beautiful Love Survival, at the Sotheby’s London sale, Beautiful <b>Inside</b> <b>My</b> Head Forever, to raise money for this organisation. Later, he also contributed his writing to the book, We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009, in support of Survival. The book explores the existence of, and threats to, indigenous cultures around the world.|$|E
500|$|Ucu {{also became}} active in writing. She {{published}} five Islamic-themed children's books in 2003, insisting on receiving royalties {{rather than the}} standard flat rate. She has also written a short story, entitled [...] "Lelaki yang Menetas di Tubuhku" [...] ("The Man That Hatched <b>Inside</b> <b>My</b> Body"), {{for inclusion in the}} lesbian-themed short story collection [...] (An Evening in Paris). The book also included stories by Clara Ng, Seno Gumira Ajidarma, and Agus Noor.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{a violent}} {{criminal}} named John Mosley (Michael Kelly) is also {{searching for the}} Beacon. After killing one of Olivia's mentors, Mosley kidnaps and tortures Peter {{to find out the}} location. After he recovers the beacon from the grave of Robert Bishop, John Mosley is taken down by Olivia. The beacon escapes into the earth, and The Observer reports that its departure was [...] "on schedule." [...] Peter confronts The Observer about the beacon, only to have a gibberish conversation that implies that the Observer knows what Peter is going to say before he says it, or, as Peter puts it, [...] "he knew me [...] he was <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] The Observer then knocks Peter out with an advanced sort of stun gun.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E
500|$|On {{its release}} most critics {{agreed that the}} book was both scandalous and career-ending. [...] (Even with {{a quarter of the}} 1,000-page {{original}} manuscript excised, it took lawyers at Random House fourteen months to approve it for publication.) Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being [...] " [...] written but spat out, a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity". Newsweek's review called it a [...] "573-page primal scream", while one Hollywood producer said it was [...] "the longest suicide note in history". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to [...] "a little voice <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> head [...] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'." [...] Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of [...] "keeping his friends close and his enemies closer." [...] Rapper Tupac Shakur mispronounces {{the title of the book}} in a Vibe Interview in 1996, stating briefly that it was one of the books he read recently. [...] "You’ll Never Work Again in Hollywood, whatever that is that they’re talking about, all the people that slept together." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} some {{months in the}} United States, Stan began working on the track in October 2013 at the two-weeks inaugural international songwriting FonoCamp in 2013, held in Azuga, Romania, where she met various Romanian and international artists. [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with you <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> head... How could you be so cruel? Turned me into a liar." [...] was directly addressed to Prodan.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "God Is In The Radio" [...] {{contains}} a Backmask message by Josh Homme: [...] "I've been dying to watch you. Look over your left shoulder in the apartment. I'm in Eric's room. You're <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> hands... This is your God." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Seger {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} the power rock ballad [...] "Understanding" [...] {{for the film}} soundtrack Teachers. The song was another Top 20 hit for Seger in late 1984.

2500|$|Carey {{was born}} in Liverpool, England, in 1959 – {{describing}} his young self as [...] "one of those ominously quiet kids... lived so much <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> own head I only had vestigial limbs". As a child, he maintained an interest in comics, writing and drawing primitive stories to entertain his younger brother. He studied English at St Peter's College, Oxford, before becoming a teacher. He continued to teach for 15 years {{before moving on to}} writing comics.|$|E
2500|$|PFC Dennis Konti, {{a witness}} for the prosecution, told about one {{especially}} gruesome episode during the shooting, [...] "A lot of women had thrown themselves {{on top of the}} children to protect them, and the children were alive at first. Then, the children who were old enough to walk got up and Calley began to shoot the children". Other 1st Platoon members testified that many of the deaths of individual Vietnamese men, women and children occurred <b>inside</b> <b>My</b> Lai during the security sweep. Livestock were shot as well.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Falling" [...] (sans vocals) {{became the}} theme to the show, and the songs [...] "Rockin' Back <b>Inside</b> <b>My</b> Heart," [...] "The Nightingale," [...] "The World Spins," [...] and [...] "Into the Night" [...] (found in their full {{versions}} on the album) were all, except the latter, used as Cruise's roadhouse performances during the show's run. The lyrics for all five songs {{were written by}} Lynch. A second volume of the soundtrack was released on October 30, 2007, {{to coincide with the}} Definitive Gold Box DVD set. In March 2011, Lynch began releasing previously unavailable tracks from the series and the film via his website.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 September 2006, Steven Wilson {{announced}} in his blog that Mike Bennion (Co-writer of the Deadwing screenplay) had released the first fifteen {{pages of the}} story. [...] It is available for reading on [...] blog and on the [...] [...] The film script thus far has made several connections to the album in various ways; such as {{a reference to the}} line in Mellotron Scratch 'A tiny flame <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> hand', the man mentioned in Lazarus 'My David don't you worry', and to the artwork in the album's cover insert (more specifically the page with the lyrics to [...] "Halo" [...] scrawled in it).|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Abbott, in her History of Celibacy, contends that, {{although}} Leonardo {{was probably}} homosexual, {{the trauma of}} the sodomy case converted him to celibacy {{for the rest of his}} life. A similar view of a homosexually-inclined but chaste Leonardo appears in a famous 1910 paper by Sigmund Freud, Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood, which analysed a memory Leonardo described of having been attacked as a baby by a bird of prey that opened his mouth and [...] "stuck me with the tail <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> lips again and again". [...] Freud claimed the symbolism was clearly phallic, but argued that Leonardo's homosexuality was latent: that he did not act on his desires.|$|E
2500|$|Soundgarden {{frontman}} Chris Cornell, who {{had been}} Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood's roommate, approached former Mother Love Bone members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament about working on material he had written {{when he was on}} tour with Soundgarden in Europe. The line-up eventually included Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomers Mike McCready (lead guitar) and Eddie Vedder (background vocals). McCready and Vedder were featured on the album due to their involvement with Ament and Gossard's next project, which became Pearl Jam. [...] The name Temple of the Dog is derived from the opening lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song [...] "Man of Golden Words", [...] "I want to show you something, like joy <b>inside</b> <b>my</b> heart, seems I been living in the temple of the dog".|$|E
