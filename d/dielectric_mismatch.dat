40|$|Abstract. A newly {{criterion}} for the validity {{limits of the}} dipole approximation for a dielectric mixture was presented, based on the comparison between the dipole approximation and the numerical solutions by the finite-element method (FEM). In terms of this criterion and the dipole-enhanced model, a simple theoretical formula for the validity limits was derived. This formula includes three variables: the <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch,</b> the volume fraction of particles and the precision. Its calculated results have a good agreement with the limits determined by the empirical method {{in the range of}} our interest, which indicates the theoretical formula is creditable. Using this formula, we can approximate the precision of the dipole approximation for an arbitrary dielectric mixture. And we found that the dipole approximation is acceptable with the precision equal to 30 % when the <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> is less than 2. 3 (εi / εe ≤ 2. 3) for the almost touching spheres...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{analytical}} theory of flexible polymer chain dissolved {{in a good}} solvent, carrying permanent freely oriented dipoles on the monomers. We {{take into account the}} dipole correlations within the random phase approximation (RPA), as well as a dielectric heterogeneity in the internal polymer volume relative to the bulk solution. We demonstrate that the dipole correlations of monomers can be taken into account as pairwise ones only when the polymer chain is in a coil conformation. In this case the dipole correlations manifest themselves through the Keesom interactions of the permanent dipoles. On the other hand, the dielectric heterogeneity effect (<b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> effect) leads to effective interaction between the monomers of the polymeric coil. Both of these effects can be taken into account by the renormalizing the second virial coefficient of the volume interactions monomer-monomer. We establish that in the case when the solvent dielectric permittivity exceeds the dielectric permittivity of the polymeric material, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> effect competes with the dipole attractive interactions, leading to polymer coil expansion. In the opposite case, both the <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> effect and the dipole attractive interaction lead to the polymer coil collapse. We analyse the coil-globule transition caused by the dipole correlations of monomers within the many-body theory.

40|$|International audienceSince the {{demonstration}} of nanowires utilization in optoelectronics [1], nano-objects have attracted a growing interest from the scientific community. In particular, GaN nanowires are strain- and defect-free UV light emitters that can be grown on Si substrates. However, as proposed recently in [2], the low-temperature donor-bound exciton emission from ensemble of narrow GaN nanowires is broad, due to {{the distribution of the}} distance between the donor nuclei and the surface. In this work, we study the influence of the surface and of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> on the binding energy of donor atoms and, therefore, on the emission energy of donor bound excitons in GaN nanostructures. We compute by envelope function calculations, performed in the effective potential formalism, the binding energy of donor atoms in thin air/semiconductor/air slabs. We not only account for the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the donor nucleus, but also for the attraction between the electron and the image charges of the nucleus and for the repulsion between the electron and its images (i. e. the electron self-energy). We first consider the case of a donor nucleus located {{at the center of a}} nanostructure. Comparing our data with tight-binding calculations performed in Ref. [3], we show that the planar symmetry used here reproduces well the results obtained for cylindrical wires. Strikingly, the combination of the confinement and the <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the narrowest nanostructures leads to donor binding energies exceeding four times the bulk Rydberg [4]. When the donor nucleus is located at the air/semiconductor interface, its binding energy is as expected reduced compared to the bulk case [5]. However, we obtain that this reduction is only by a factor of two, while a factor of four is computed when the <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> is neglected [5]. Finally, we discuss the relative influence of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch,</b> surface and confinement on the donor binding energy with respect to the thickness of the nanostructure.

In a charge separation scenario across the interface, we calculate the binding energy of a charge carrier for variations in <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> (i. e., the ratio of the dielectric constant of materials forming the interface), interface shape and size, and dielectric anisotropy. We find that <b>dielectric</b> <b>mismatch</b> results in binding of the charge carrier to the interface with energies on the order of several kT.

Anisotropy is shown to affect critically the electric field along the principal axis, while the binding energy of the charge is altered by more than 5 kT. We are able to give an upper limit on the change in the binding energy for the variations in the above interfacial factors. These limits can serve as guidelines for optimization, interface engineering, and design of high efficiency organic electronic devices...|$|E
