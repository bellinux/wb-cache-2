50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1894, Davenport agreed to become dean of the College of Agriculture at the University of Illinois. Arriving January 1, 1895, Davenport {{found that there were}} only nine {{students}} and that the school offered only a short course in the winter. Furthermore, the new president of the university, Andrew S. Draper, disliked the agricultural studies. Davenport was made professor of animal husbandry that March, Draper initially refused to allow Davenport to hire any fellow instructors. Davenport secured <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>sources</b> to provide for faculty, and Draper finally relented to allow hiring in the summer of 1896 with Perry Greeley Holden and Wilber J. Fraser.Davenport was appointed director of the Agricultural Experiment Station in 1896. He co-founded the Illinois Farmers' Institute, which he used to lobby the Illinois General Assembly for funds for the school. In 1899, the assembly approved a motion to appropriate money for the construction of an agricultural building. He published his first textbook, Principles of Breeding, in 1907. This was followed by Education for Efficiency in 1909, where he argued for teaching home economics and agriculture in public school. During World War I he was part of a committee advising the government on food policy.|$|E

40|$|My {{research}} has {{made great strides}} in 2014 thanks to the generosity of the Faculty Development Program. As I was able to combine archival research trips with travel for invited talks and other service opportunities, I managed to stretch my research funds to their maximum capacity. I gave several invited talks in California in March, presented on my current project {{at the annual meeting}} of the American Society for Environmental History, and then stayed on in San Francisco to conduct research at both UC Berkeley’s Bancroft Library and at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in San Bruno, CA (just south of San Francisco). At Berkeley, I consulted several archived whaling ship logs and gained a better understanding of their overall holdings. At San Bruno, I mined the Admiralty Court records of San Francisco from the mid-nineteenth century. I gained a better understanding of the types of legal charges most commonly brought against whaling ship captains in that port and traced some of the whaling ship crews actively involved in the court case at the heart of my new project (Enos v. Sowle). In the process, I determined that legal charges of a sexual nature were incredibly rare in the time period in question, and I gained a fuller picture of the sequence of events that led to the arrest of Captain Nathaniel Sowle in 1860. Soon after my trip to San Francisco, I traveled to Washington, D. C. Since I was invited to serve on a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) review panel and had to be in D. C. anyway, I had the opportunity to arrive a few days early and conduct research at the National Archives in College Park, MD. I was thus able to take advantage of the NEH reimbursement of my airfare to do research I otherwise would have had to pay for on my own. While there, I explored the letters of the U. S. Consul to Hawai’i in the late 1850 s and early 1860 s. I discovered revelatory correspondence between consular officials and the Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs about Enos v. Sowle, so this was an extremely productive trip. My final research trip utilizing these funds was to Bellingham and Seattle, Washington. As my research progressed on both the whaling project and on a previously written draft article I was revisiting and hoping to complete, it became clear that quick visits to the Center for Pacific Northwest Studies at Western Washington University and to the University of Washington Library would be extremely fruitful. In Bellingham I explored several Northwest Native oral history collections for my draft article. In Seattle, I took advantage of the vast holdings of the University of Washington Library to do additional research for both the article and my whaling project. I also spent several days in the library’s Special Collections division. I made significant strides on both projects as a result. My primary goals for my sabbatical period have been more than met, thanks to the combination of these faculty development monies and <b>funds</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>sources.</b> The research trips listed here, together with others I took to Hawai’i that were funded by the American Philosophical Society have convinced me that the whaling project should become a book-length study. As noted, I am also in the process of revising a journal article I drafted years ago about the impact of the U. S. -Canada border on Pacific Northwest Native peoples in the mid-nineteenth century. I hope to both submit this piece for publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly journal and continue to move forward on the whaling project in the spring of 2015. Given the current status of my whaling research, I am also hopeful that I will be able to create student collaborative research opportunities in the coming summers...|$|E

40|$|Many {{firms and}} {{organizations}} compete for customers {{while at the}} same time receiving substantial <b>funding</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>sources,</b> such as government subsidies. In this paper, we study the effects of two commonly observed, alternative subsidy systems on the behavior of price-competing firms. Specifically, we compare an open-ended per-unit price subsidy with a closed-ended subsidy, allocated according to the firms’ market shares. We find that, holding the total subsidy budget constant, the open-ended subsidy results in fiercer price competition, lower prices, higher output, and lower profits than the closed-ended, market-share based alternative. Second, the open system yields higher overall welfare for relatively modest subsidies and limited substitutability between goods; the closed system performs better at relatively high subsidy levels and when goods are closer substitutes. Third, a market-share based subsidy makes collusive behavior between firms much harder. Our results, therefore, suggest a potential trade-off between short-run and long-run objectives: subsidies designed to widen participation may stimulate collusive behavior. These findings may have important policy implications for the design of subsidy systems in, among many others, education and the arts.

40|$|There is now {{a growing}} {{interest}} in evaluating the impacts of government projects {{mainly because of the}} principle of transparency that the leadership in government advocates. The need to closely monitor government projects, especially those <b>funded</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>sources</b> such as grants or loans, necessitate research and understanding of the conceptual and practical issues relating to a holistic impact evaluation. The spending process and requirement to demonstrate a return on the use of public funds, as well as identifying the long term effect of certain programs/projects that provide development intervention should be studied, evaluated and monitored. For the National Economic and Development Authority, or NEDA, the Philippines’ independent economic development and planning agency, analysis on impact evaluation will serve as basis in making recommendations as to the advisability of continuing budgetary allocation for certain programs and projects. However, there is no clear or ready protocols and standards on how to go about implementing impact evaluation. This paper attempts to propose a capacity building framework in conducting impact evaluation for government-based projects, from conceptualization to sampling of baseline data to tools used in the analysis.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this case study has been to examine how the {{dominant}} mission {{of the community college}} was selectively interpreted or modified. Through interviews of nine faculty members and nine members of the administration of institutional records, and newspaper accounts, an analysis was made, using three perspectives, history and tradition, resource dependency, and social interpretation of reality. From the perspective of history and tradition the organization was examined to see what aspects of the mission were "deposited" from the past in terms of program emphasis and changes over time in the formal mission statement. Politics could not be separated <b>from</b> history. Examining <b>funding</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>sources</b> of revenue demonstrated that shifts in resources were congruent with changes in the composition of the Board and with changes in interpretation of the mission. Resources seemed to influence the interpretation of the mission of the college, but were interwoven with history and politics so it was difficult to separate out which influence predominated. The perspective of selective interpretation demonstrated that the forces determining the selective interpretation of the mission were all conflated. Although the overall force that was the most powerful was the political economic force, the minorities and the human development voices maintained an influence. My research has shown that the mission is socially and politically constructed over time...|$|R

These various educational institutions are located primarily within Florida. However, when the 600 -mile distance from Pensacola to Miami is considered, it is obvious that this Grant provides access to reactor utilization for a broad geographical region and a diverse set of user institutions serving over twelve million inhabitants throughout the State of Florida and still others throughout the nation. All users and uses were carefully screened to assure the usage was for educational institutions eligible for participation in the Reactor Sharing Program; where research activities were involved, care was taken to assure the research activities were not funded by grants for contract <b>funding</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>sources.</b> In some cases external grant funding is limited or is used up, in which case the Reactor Sharing Grant and frequent cost sharing by the UFTR facility and the University of Florida provide the necessary support to complete a project or to provide more results to make a complete project even better.

The role of the Reactor Sharing Program, though relatively small in dollars, has been the single most important occurrence in assuring the rebirth and continued high utilization of the UFTR in a time when many better equipped and better placed facilities have ceased operations.

40|$|Downtowns have {{experienced}} decline since the 1990 s in Japan and several strategies {{have been implemented}} to deal with it. This research focuses on one of such strategies-the Town Management Organization (TMO) model. Although the model was expected to achieve downtown revitalization through managing downtown areas, it has made negligible contributions. This research examines {{the reasons why the}} TMO model has not worked well through a survey and interviews with TMO staff members. This research demonstrates that TMOs tend to face obstacles at two different stages, which has led to the low level of contribution of the TMO model. At the planning stage, most TMO boards are dominated by commercial stakeholders and do not take in broad opinions. As a result, most TMOs do not gain benefits from active participation of various local stakeholders or receive their political and financial support. At the implementation stage, TMOs face different difficulties according to their funding structure. TMOs raising their <b>funds</b> mainly <b>from</b> such <b>outside</b> <b>sources</b> as subsidies tend to face funding shortages and lack of staff, and as a result, do not conduct effective revitalization activities. (cont.) In contrast, TMOs that are not dependent on <b>outside</b> <b>sources</b> but make most earnings from the sales of goods or services are likely to face deficits and focus on profitable activities which might not be related to downtown revitalization. This research recommends that TMOs reform their boards, capitalize on external conditions, diversify their funding sources, and utilize other resources such as volunteers and financial institutions. In addition, this research proposes that governments create effective public policies to help TMOs carry out these recommendations. by Masatomo Miyazawa. Thesis (M. C. P.)
