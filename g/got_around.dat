5|$|This was Manchester United's 18th Charity Shield {{appearance}} to Arsenal's 14th. Manchester United began the game more strongly, but Arsenal {{took the lead}} when Marc Overmars scored 11 minutes before half-time. They extended their lead in the second half, as Overmars and Nicolas Anelka found Christopher Wreh, who put the ball into an empty net at the second attempt. In the 72nd minute, Arsenal scored a third goal, when Anelka <b>got</b> <b>around</b> Jaap Stam in the penalty box and shot the ball past goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.|$|E
5|$|By July 2011, Rohrer had {{submitted}} a beta {{version of the}} game for Nintendo approval. This was followed up with the master version in October. An issue raised during the approval process was Rohrer's desire to credit Bailey on the game's cover, which Nintendo rejected. He <b>got</b> <b>around</b> this by officially naming the game Jason Rohrer with Music by Tom Bailey: Diamond Trust of London. In May 2012, the game was ready for manufacturing. However, due to changing market conditions, Zoo Publishing was {{no longer able to}} afford the manufacturing of cartridges given the large minimum order of 6,000 units that Nintendo required, and so, Rohrer turned to the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began {{dominating}} in {{the second}} half, and increased their lead after 57 minutes. From the left wing, Overmars used his pace to {{get the better of}} Gary Neville and passed the ball to Anelka, who turned and passed to an unmarked Christopher Wreh. Schmeichel blocked the Liberian's initial shot with his feet, but he was unable to stop the second attempt or Wreh's acrobatic celebration. Despite the setback, United continued to press Arsenal; defender Martin Keown almost put the ball into his own goal from Ryan Giggs's corner. Both teams made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably Teddy Sheringham and Luís Boa Morte coming on for Cole – who rarely threatened – and Petit, respectively. Arsenal scored their third in the 72nd minute – Parlour's pass found Anelka, who <b>got</b> <b>around</b> Stam and shot the ball past Schmeichel from a narrow angle, inside the goalkeeper's near post. Near the end, Sheringham wasted a goal-scoring opportunity, shooting wide.|$|E

Two flips {{occurred}} during this race.The first flip was on lap 15 during a 7 car pileup {{coming out of}} the tri-oval. Jeff Green <b>got</b> turned <b>around</b> and flipped once. He was uninjured, though. Later, on lap 104, {{coming out of the}} tri-oval Michael Waltrip <b>got</b> turned <b>around</b> and flipped several times. He, too, was okay.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He <b>got</b> <b>around</b> this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, {{not even in the}} presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers <b>got</b> <b>around</b> this by adding a small white cloth to the top of the wig, representing the coif.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Nico Rosberg <b>got</b> <b>around</b> {{the outside}} of Hamilton in turn one, while Räikkönen lost {{positions}} due to a slow getaway. Sebastian Vettel got past Verstappen, but was immediately repassed on the approach to turn four. At {{the front of the}} race, coming out of turn three, Hamilton tried to retake the position from Rosberg. As the latter defended his position, Hamilton went off the track and spun and they collided at turn 4, ending the race of both Mercedes drivers. The collision resulted in a safety car period, with the order standing: Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Vettel and Räikkönen. The safety car came in at the end of lap four. Vettel got past Sainz on lap eight and Räikkönen tried to follow suit two laps later, but was forced off track into turn two. He completed the move one lap later at the same spot. Sainz and Button were the first to come into the pit lane for new tyres on lap 12, followed by race leader Ricciardo one lap later, making Verstappen the first Dutchman to lead a Grand Prix, before he came in another lap later. When Vettel made a pit stop on lap 16, he emerged third behind the two Red Bull drivers, all on the medium compound tyre.|$|E

25|$|By 2000 Houston Heights {{community}} {{retained its}} prohibition {{of the sale}} of alcoholic beverages. The Houston Heights passed a prohibition on alcoholic beverages in 1912, and the annexation agreement followed by the City of Houston stipulates {{that much of the}} Heights must retain the ban on alcoholic beverages. Many restaurants in the zone <b>got</b> <b>around</b> the ordinance by forming private clubs that patrons may join so that the patrons can order alcoholic beverages.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a number}} of teams, notably Benetton with their Ford V6 turbo and Arrows with their 4 cyl Megatron turbo (formerly the BMW turbo), {{encountered}} problems with the pop-off valve during 1987 when it would often come in lower than the 4.0 bar limit thus giving less horsepower, McLaren <b>got</b> <b>around</b> this by generally setting their TAG's turbo limit at 3.6 bar in 1987. This also allowed McLaren the advantage of better fuel economy.|$|E

25|$|Until 2003, tobacco {{manufacturers}} <b>got</b> <b>around</b> this restriction by sponsoring {{cultural and}} sporting events, {{such as the}} Benson & Hedges Symphony of Fire (a fireworks display in Toronto and Vancouver), which allowed the manufacturers' names and logos to appear in advertisements sponsoring the events, and at the venues. The ban on tobacco sponsorship was a major factor {{that led to the}} near-cancellation of the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal and the du Maurier Ltd Classic, a women's golf tournament on the LPGA tour (now known as the Canadian Women's Open).|$|E
25|$|It is also {{revealed}} that Ray's father and grandfather were in the army, but Ray never joined himself as he went out drinking on the night {{he was supposed to}} sign up and never <b>got</b> <b>around</b> to going because he was scared, his relationship with his father subsequently souring despite his successes in the force. In series 2 in 1982, Carling actually fills out an army application form, but when he asks Alex Drake to write a reference, she takes the form and rips it up into little pieces, convincing him to stay.|$|E
25|$|She {{applied for}} {{admission}} to various convents, but she was rejected because she could not afford a dowry. Eventually, the Poor Clares in Münster agreed to accept her, provided she would learn to play the organ. She went to the organist Söntgen in Coesfeld to study music and learn to play the organ, but she never <b>got</b> <b>around</b> to it because the poverty of the Söntgen family prompted her to work there to help them, and she sacrificed her small savings for that. Later, one of the Söntgen daughters entered the convent with her.|$|E

25|$|In August 1940, Ribbentrop {{oversaw the}} Second Vienna Award, which saw about 40% of the Transylvania region of Romania {{returned}} to Hungary. The decision to award {{so much of}} Romania to the Hungarians was Hitler's, as Ribbentrop himself {{spent most of the}} Vienna conference loudly attacking the Hungarian delegation for their coolness towards attacking Czechoslovakia in 1938 and then demanding more than their fair share of the spoils. When Ribbentrop finally <b>got</b> <b>around</b> to announcing his decision, the Hungarian delegation, which had expected Ribbentrop to rule in favour of Romania, broke out in cheers, while the Romanian foreign minister Mihail Manoilescu fainted.|$|E

Jean Lowman kept detailed accounts of the destruction Bobo wrought on their house and possessions. The Lowmans decided they could no longer take care of Bobo in their home, and sold him to the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Harding has {{posited that}} in Singapore it is Parliament, {{rather than the}} Constitution, which is supreme. This arises {{from the fact that}} the Constitution, which is {{supposed}} to be logically prior to the power of Parliament to legislate, was enacted by Parliament on 22 December 1965 through the Republic of Singapore Independence Act. As Parliament only <b>got</b> <b>around</b> to properly enacting a constitution on 22 December 1965, there was a hiatus between 9 August 1965 and that date, such that the legitimacy of laws passed between those dates can be questioned. Thus, the Grundnorm or basic norm of Singapore's legal system is Parliament rather than the Constitution.|$|E
