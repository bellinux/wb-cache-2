The method of FFT filtering was used to smooth time series of <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>extreme</b> precipitation, linear regression to calculate linear fits, and spline interpolation to interpolate station data and estimate linear changes. The {{results show that the}} annual <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> increased in most of the area during 1960 - 2009, especially in the northeast. The greatest increase was the <b>extreme</b> <b>temperature</b> in winter, compared to that in autumn, summer and spring in order from high to low across most of the study area. The annual extreme precipitation changed little in the first three decades and increased significantly in the last two decades, and varied with region and season. Spatially, the annual trend of extreme precipitation increased across most of the province, except in some areas of the southeast. The seasonal change trend of extreme precipitation varied greatly across different areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing <b>extreme</b> <b>temperatures</b> (hot or cold) to be rare.|$|E
5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such <b>extreme</b> <b>temperatures</b> result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Kathiawari are unknown. There were {{indigenous}} horses on the western coast of India before the arrival in the early sixteenth century of the Turco-Mongol invaders who later established the Mughal Empire. Beginning during the Mughal reign, and continuing during the British Raj, Arab horses were imported to India and crossed with native stock, creating the ancestors of the modern Kathiawari breed. The Kathiawari may have also {{been influenced by the}} Mongolian horse. Traditionally, noble households specialised in their own strain of horses, naming their lines of horses after a foundation mare; 28 of these lines still exist. These noble houses selectively bred horses that could withstand <b>extreme</b> <b>temperatures</b> and minimal rations, carry a man with weapons and armour for long periods in rough terrain, and still be swift and nimble. They bred for wiry, sleek horses that were ideal for war, and Kathiawaris were noted for their loyalty and bravery in battle, often defending their riders even when wounded themselves. This breeding was maintained until the Independence of India.|$|E
